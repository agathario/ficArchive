<div class="userstuff">
<p>The evening was unusually warm for autumn, and the sun had just dipped below the horizon. A palpable tension filled the air, heavy with a sense of apprehension. The crimson sky faded into a deep purple, casting eerie shadows across the urban landscape. The scent of damp pavement mingled with the faint aroma of fallen leaves, accompanied by the muted sounds of traffic.  </p><p>“Thank you, Kate,” Agatha said politely to her driver who held the door open after they arrived at the restaurant. Agatha smoothed the fabric of her black dress after it bunched at her hips as she exited the vehicle. Tucking the clutch under her arm, she turned back to watch her mother clamber out of the sleek new Rolls-Royce limo purchased for events. Agatha still cringed at the price tag of her mother’s most recent dip into extravagance. </p><p>“I know you’re new, but you are always to open my door first,” the older woman scoffed. “Never let that happen again.” Evanora barked as the young beta bowed slightly. </p><p>“Yes, Ms. Harkness, my apologies, ma’am,” The young beta driver said quickly, bowing deeper. Agatha’s eyes flickered towards the young woman, and they shared a knowing look. Agatha gave a small helpless smile, as her mother brushed past her, shrugging her shoulders just slightly. The distinctive bitter aroma of burnt juniper, that accompanied her mother’s evident agitation, lingered in the air.  </p><p>Evanora rolled her eyes and moved deliberately into Agatha’s space, muttering to her daughter, “Make sure she is fired. I do <em> not </em> give second chances.”  </p><p>“Yes, mother.” Agatha mentally kicked herself for being so absorbed in preparing for this dinner that she neglected to have her assistant review the guidelines with Kate regarding interacting with Evanora. This was Kate’s first time meeting the extremely challenging alpha. Agatha made a note to not use her personal driver for future events involving her mother. It was better to have her mother assume she followed through with her demands rather than have to offer yet more severance packages to avoid wrongful termination lawsuits. </p><p><em> Tonight was important. </em> </p><p>Agatha knew that better than anyone – having suffered meeting after meeting in the executive board room for weeks with all of the heads of Harkness Industries brainstorming and strategizing ways to seal the deal with Vidal Corp. Hours and hours of being surrounded by the acrimonious scents of increasingly annoyed alphas (and the acrid metallic distress of Vision, their singular beta who outperformed everyone in his realm of policy and compliance as their recently hired Chief Compliance Officer). </p><p>The sharp click of heels hit the wood flooring of the antechamber before the second set of doors leading to the lobby of the restaurant. Evanora Harkness let out an aggravated puff of air through her flared nostrils, her fingers grasping on Agatha’s arm harshly, tugging her daughter towards her, her sharp nails digging into Agatha’s already abused skin concealed under the fabric of her dress. “Do <em>not </em>embarrass me tonight, we need Vidal eating out of the palm of our hand,” she said quickly, hushed but harsh, the weighted warning in her voice hidden under the careful guise of a practiced warm smile.  </p><p>Agatha responded without thinking, focusing more on keeping herself a picture of calm even under the assault of her mother’s acerbic pheromones. “How do we even know if Ms. Vidal is willing to sell?” </p><p>“Everyone has a <em> price</em>,” Her mother said with a fierce conviction, as she tightened her grip. “I thought I paid enough for them to teach you at that fancy French university of yours.”  </p><p>Agatha winced, focusing on the clawed fingernails digging in and leaving deep crescents on the inside of her arm, rather than the urge to correct her mother. That was most definitely not what she had been taught – some people simply did <em> not </em> have a price. “Yes, mother,” she breathed out. Agatha despised her mother, when she brazenly behaved like this in public. The flagrant audacity that everyone would just turn a blind eye and fall in line. What a comfort it is to be an alpha born into wealth and privilege.  </p><p>Their eyes met for a moment; an unspoken exchange passed between them. Evanora’s steel blue eyes snapped around her, scrutinizing Agatha and their surroundings as she released her hold on her daughter. “Good. Now smile. Speak when spoken to. Stick to the talking points. Do not provide any unnecessary details. And for the love of all that is holy do <em> not </em> overeat.” She paused and looked at her daughter over again with disdain. “Your dress looks tight enough as it is.”  </p><p>Evanora rubbed her nose and sniffed, pumping out another wave of sour agitation and annoyance. “You reek of omega; people are going to think you’ve been fooling around. Fix that. Immediately. I will not have Vidal thinking I’ve raised some idiotic knothead.” Evanora snarled as she turned quickly and pushed the wooden door, moving into the lobby, “Good evening Mr. Bohner,” she said to Ralph, their new hotshot Chief Financial Officer. </p><p>The door closed, giving Agatha a moment to collect herself. She let out a shaky breath, her hands trembling as she went for her clutch, digging for the small bottle of synthetic oil she kept on her. She made sure to be discreet as she coated the oleaginous solution against the glands at her neck with her fingertips. It should suffice until she could politely excuse herself to use the restroom after appetizers. </p><p>The thought of appetizers made her hopeful; her empty stomach ached for something more filling.  Maybe her mother would be too busy trying to win her target over to notice Agatha sneak a bite or two. </p><p>Agatha sighed heavily, rubbing the dissipating sting left in her mother’s wake. She glanced down at herself – it was possible that the stolen nibbles of cheese squares she'd eaten before leaving the office with her mother had caused a bit of a bloat. But it wasn't exactly noticeable – except under her weight of her mother's scrutinizing glare.  </p><p>"Yes, mother." She whispered meekly to herself, opening the door to make her way inside, self-consciously fixing her dress again and running her fingers through her hair. Her list of Evanora approved topics could fit on half a Post-it note but was well learned over the years (though she had taken the initiative to do quite a bit more digging into Vidal Corp than was strictly required for her position within Harkness Industries). </p><p>“Stop fidgeting,” Evanora bit out. </p><p>Agatha flinched, forcing herself to stop. </p><p>She held fast against the urge to sigh – other than bearing the Harkness family name she wasn't even sure why she was here. As a closeted omega, Agatha oversaw people and benefits, not potential business mergers. She was usually contacted after the agreements were finalized, where she assisted in preparing compensation packages for employees who were about to be laid off due to her mother's merciless tactic of deconstructing businesses for their assets.  </p><p>She would much rather be at the networking event Wanda had invited her to—or at least that was what it said in her calendar. In truth it was beer, fish and chips at a seedy bar they visited monthly for trivia night, and tonight Wanda was bringing Vision who she had recently started dating after Agatha introduced them. Wanda had assured Agatha repeatedly that he would not utter a word to her mother. Despite her reservations, Agatha believed her - it had only been two weeks and the beta’s unwavering loyalty lay firmly with Wanda. </p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and centered herself; she recited mentally the research notes on Rio Vidal that she and her assistant, William Kaplan, managed to glean from the woman’s online presence (they’d both sat in her office watching a TED Talk and several speaking events, eating day old donuts he had snuck in in his messenger bag). </p><p>Rio Vidal, age 34, CEO of Vidal Corp, graduated from MIT with a degree in Environmental Engineering and a master’s in business. Involved in numerous philanthropic ventures (though typically geared towards low-income communities, with her most recent project being urban produce gardens to help support lunch programs for public schools).  </p><p>Ms. Vidal was, other than Agatha herself, the primary source of woe for her mother for the last few years – throwing the company and its money behind grassroots groups and green lobbyists. From what William was able to determine, Ms. Vidal has managed to garner quite a social media presence, with millions of followers. Including, to Agatha’s incredulity, a viral video of the charismatic CEO falling during a limbo competition. </p><p>Agatha let her breath out and plastered on the well-practiced smile she’d perfected since she was 6. Trying her best to ignore Mr. Bohner as he picked at something underneath his nails. Her fingers twitched as she forced her eyes to pull away from the noticeable dirt; when was the last time he had thoroughly washed his hands? </p><p>Agatha’s attention pulled away as she noticed the host speaking softly with her mother, who already looked more annoyed than usual. </p><p>“—need your best service. This is a very important business dinner.” </p><p>“Of course, Mrs. Darkness—” </p><p>“<em> Ms. Harkness</em>,” Evanora corrected sharply, glaring at the young beta in front of her. </p><p>He smiled nervously, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed. “O-of course. Ms. Harkness. Our head waitress, Alison, will be attending to you this evening. Your guest has already arrived and has been seated.” </p><p>Years of practice kept Agatha’s flinch at bay when Evanora hissed, “<b> <em> What?! </em> </b>” the skin on the back of her neck flushed red with anger. “How long has she been here?!” </p><hr/><p>Rio sat at the table absentmindedly tapping her fingers on the white tablecloth, smiling into her glass of wine, trying to hold back a soft chuckle while watching some of the members from Harkness Industries scramble when they realized the guest of honor had already arrived well in advance. She smirked – she had aimed for 15 minutes but made it a solid 20 before they had even pulled in. Rio silently thanked the gods for small favors when Evanora Harkness’ assistant had suggested the very Sicilian restaurant her mother owned.  </p><p>Rolling her eyes, Rio sipped from her glass. She was certain Lilia’s staff were making bets on how quickly the representatives from Harkness Industries left. Really, she should have forced them to buy her in to every bet. She knew they had taken lots earlier to see who would be assigned to their section – Evanora Harkness had a reputation. Specifically, one for being a horrible guest and a non-existent tipper. </p><p>Curious, Rio observed the young woman walking quickly beside Evanora Harkness and the forgettable man accompanying her. Her striking blue eyes shifted nervously to the ground, fingers clasped so tightly in front of her that her knuckles were turning white. Silently, Rio took note of the taut muscles in the woman’s jaw, the slight grind of her teeth even with a picture-perfect smile plastered across her face. One that most definitely did not reach her eyes. Despite her efforts to conceal it, Rio detected her deceptive attempt. </p><p>Eddie, Rio’s assistant, had made sure to put together detailed dossiers on all the people in charge at Harkness Industries. Rio smiled to herself – she had originally been his baby-sitter while in college. His mother was a professor at MIT and needed someone to look after him. Who better than her own teaching assistant? Somehow, they had hit it off and now, years later at 22, he was a tried-and-true Executive Assistant with his <em> own </em>assistant as he worked his way through a degree in environmental science (he had his eye on a degree in environmental law eventually and Rio was fully prepared to transition him over to Legal the moment he decided he was ready). Rio, to his horror- had a framed photo of him at 13 years old, dressed in his Sunday best with a hand drawn sign reading “Coolest Assistant” on a wall in her office. </p><p>Even with all their preparation, including at least 3 PowerPoint presentations, 2 dozen donuts and 1 extra-large pizza, nothing could have prepared her for the sheer beauty that was Agatha Harkness. She was in a black dress, long sleeved, with the hem ending just below the knee, and sleek black heels that pushed her just an inch taller than her mother. Her hair fell past her shoulders with a gentle wave. Rio’s fingers twitch, utterly consumed with the urge to touch – she shook her head, banishing the thought.  </p><p>Rio committed to the herculean task of shifting her gaze away from the younger woman to observe the Harkness matriarch, whose skin appeared stretched, likely due to multiple Botox injections. </p><p>Evanora Harkness- in a conservative, deep blue dress and had her graying hair pulled into a tight bun. Rio caught sight of a small, golden pin affixed proudly to the fabric and knew it was her iconic lifetime membership National Rifle Association pin that she was rarely seen without. It was always the pin and a small cross necklace that most definitely cost more than her first car.  </p><p>Rio stood swiftly, ignoring the way the older woman scrutinized her. Forcing herself not to gag at the vile combination of burnt juniper and <em> tar</em>, of all things, that wafted off Evanora in pungent waves, Rio reminded herself to maintain a neutral face.  </p><p>“Mrs. Harkness. Ms. Harkness. Mr. Bohner. A pleasure.” She hated lying, but if she focused on the beautiful woman when she said it. Technically, it wasn’t a lie.  </p><p>“Ms. Harkness, actually,” Evanora corrected. “My husband is no longer with us. May God rest his gentle soul.” Somehow, Evanora managed to make even that insulting. Though, any man foul enough to concede to life wed to Evanora was likely no great loss to the world, Rio mused.  </p><p>Rio knew of Mr. Harkness’ death – even if she had somehow missed it, Eddie had shown her a whole true crime section of YouTube dedicated to the <em> mysterious </em>disappearance of Mr. Agatino Harkness on an obscenely large yacht in the middle of the ocean. “Of course, I’m so sorry for your loss,” she said and Evanora’s hand, taking note of the way Evanora pulled away as soon as was politely allowed. </p><p><em> Bitch. </em> </p><p>Ralph, Rio cringed internally, was next the male alpha smelled as sour as he looked. Maybe she could get one of the members of the wait staff to sneak her some hand sanitizer…or an air freshener. To her horror, he brought her hand up to his mouth and placed a kiss on her knuckles. </p><p><b> <em> Why. Were. His. Lips. Wet!? </em> </b> </p><p>Prying, with some effort, her hand from his grip, Rio focused her attention on the other alpha woman. Ignoring the heated whispers behind her, Ralph helped Evanora into her chair. Rio switched hands and smiled just a bit when she saw the tension in Agatha’s shoulders ease slightly. “I’m Rio,” she uttered softly. The younger alpha’s hand was cool to the touch, a contrast to her own warm grip. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” </p><p>The forced smile turned into one so bright that Rio was certain her own breath was stolen just to stoke the fires behind the beautiful woman’s radiance. “Agatha.” Her newfound goddess greeted. “Truly, it’s my pleasure to meet you too. I’ve read some of your contributions to <em> Environmental International </em> and <em> Nature Sustainability</em>. I love how you—” </p><p>Evanora clicked her tongue. Subtle enough to mean nothing. And yet, a gesture like the gentle recall of a well-trained dog it hit its intended purpose. To Rio’s horror, Agatha’s beautiful smile instantly dissolved into a subtle frown. Her back straightened, excitement tampered, the light in her blue eyes dimmed as she instinctively removed her hand quickly from Rio’s as though she had been burned. “I apologize…” She moved towards the table.  </p><p>Rio's jaw clenched and she took a few moments to calm herself before joining the others.<em> What the </em> fuck <em> was that? </em> </p><p>Ralph pulled back a chair and Agatha took her seat. Rio took note of the subtle tic in Agatha’s jaw as Ralph’s definitely unwashed hands grazed her covered shoulder. Agatha placed her hands in her lap and somehow, though they evaded her gaze, Rio just knew they were clasped tightly again.   </p><p>Ralph smirked, shared a knowing look with Evanora.  </p><p>Rio's face twitched in annoyance as she retook her own seat, brushing off Ralph’s attempt at helping her before taking a sip of her wine. She was certain she managed to play it off by taking a deeper inhale than necessary of wine as she desperately tried to wipe the scent of Evanora and Ralph from her nose.  </p><p>“I’m so glad our assistants were able to find a time for us all to meet.” Evanora’s smile was borderline venomous, and Rio had to bite the tip of her tongue to keep from informing the other alpha that Eddie worked hard to make their meet up as difficult as possible. His corkboard of ideas to keep Harkness Industries running around had been prize-worthy. </p><p>Honestly, Rio had only called him off when Eddie informed her that Evanora herself had picked up the phone to call rather than her insufferable assistant, Vertigo. </p><p>“So glad,” Rio parroted, offering up a genuine smile when one of the servers arrived. </p><p>“Might I offer hot towels to anyone?” asked the young waitress. </p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek – Lilia’s restaurant didn’t do hot towels normally, but someone saw the state of Ralph Bohner’s hands and took pity upon them.  </p><p>In her peripheral, Rio caught Agatha perk up a bit. “That would be—” </p><p>“—not necessary,” Evanora cut in. </p><p>“—perfect, thank you.” Rio overruled, gratefully accepting the towel, she eagerly wiped her hands down. Though she regretted removing the hint of Agatha’s scent that might linger there, it wasn’t worth keeping the Bohner residue that clung to her skin. </p><p>Evanora snapped her fingers at the girl, asking for the most expensive bottle of red they had to offer without looking at the wine menu. At least Lilia would be making bank tonight, Rio thought, barely resisting rolling her eyes as she swirled her own glass of house. Rio knew her most expensive wine was a grand and some change. </p><p>Evanora might even have a stroke when she saw the bill later, which would be a gift for humanity, in Rio's humble opinion. </p><p>“So, Ms. Vidal,” Evanora began. “I hear congratulations are in order. The Greenland project… I’m amazed you managed to gain such a lucrative deal.” Rio couldn’t help but wonder if she practiced that cheap, false smile in a mirror. “Greenland so rarely partners with American companies. That was quite the victory for such a new company.” </p><p>Rio's smile was the picture of politeness as she folded her towel and placed it on the table, watching Agatha do the same, though far more discreetly. “Thank you, I know Harkness Industries tried to win the contract.” She also knew the overall opinion of Harkness Industries outside of the United States was, to no one’s surprise, rather abysmal apart from a few countries like Russia and Belarus.   </p><p>Ralph leaned in with a conspiratorial look on his face, “I heard a rumor you’re going to try and harness volcanoes—” </p><p>Rio’s intervention was quick and well-practiced, “The NDAs all parties have signed are about 7 miles long and while Danish prisons treat their prisoners quite a bit more humanely than ours, personally? I would prefer not to see the inside of a courthouse or cell anytime soon.” </p><p>The intent was to find sustainable ways to harness geothermal energy as a viable alternative to oil, gas and coal. Hypothetically, if successful, the technology could be implemented in states such as California, Hawaii, Washington, and New Mexico. Additionally, it could contribute to improving the infrastructure for the power grid in Caribbean islands, particularly in Puerto Rico. If everything went according to plan, it would be safer than nuclear power and far more efficient than solar and wind energy combined. Rio’s end goal was to get the patented technology out and available for use to everyone at an affordable price. </p><p>To Rio’s amusement, the head waiter appeared directly behind Evanora with a bubbly smile, blonde hair pulled back into a sleek ponytail. The older alpha jumped, clearly taken off guard by the newcomer’s unintentionally stealthy appearance.  “Good evening!” she chirped. “I’m Alison, I’ll be your waiter tonight. We’re letting the wine breathe, so can I get you any appetizers to start off the night? Our le cozze gratinate alla Siciliana is delicious.” </p><p>Before anyone even had a chance to reply Evanora leaned forward – staring down the woman. “Nothing fried. I abhor greasy peasant food.”  </p><p>Rio's brow rose as she turned her attention to the younger alpha, whose face was flushed with embarrassment. Agatha offered Rio an apologetic glance while attempting to conceal her grimace by sipping water. </p><p>Alison’s smile was nothing but polished politeness. “Of course, ma’am. Le cozze gratinate alla Siciliana is a baked dish.” Her blue eyes sparked with amusement.  </p><p>Vaguely, Rio wondered if Evanora even knew what Sicilian food was or if she simply saw the price tag and thought it would be intimidating. (It wasn’t, of course – Lilia might cater to a high-end clientele, but she was never one to turn away the hungry. It simply wasn’t in her nature.) </p><p>Evanora cast a glance once more at the menu. “The olives and the mussels for the table.” She didn’t even bother to ask the others seated with her. </p><p>With a quick nod, Alison turned to leave, but Evanora’s cold voice stopped her. “Oh, and I do <em> not </em> want that <em> other </em> one back here.”  </p><p>Their beta waitress frowned, turning to give the older woman her full attention. “I’m sorry?” </p><p>“The other one.” Evanora waved her hand with a look of utter boredom. “The one with the towels.” </p><p>Rio’s right eyebrow shot up and she caught sight of the look of discomfort that crossed Agatha’s features again.  </p><p>“Kamala?” Alison asked, confused.  </p><p>“Yes. The perky one. Clearly not from <em> here</em>. I don’t want her near our table.” </p><p>“I… right. Of course.” Alison’s blue eyes flicked to Rio’s brown and Rio gave a subtle shake of her head, watching as the woman walked away. Rio could just hear Lilia now wherever she was in the restaurant muttering something about insufferable alphas who thought they were the gods’ gifts to mankind. </p><p>The silence was awkward as Rio lifted her glass to her lips again, taking a small, calming sip.  </p><p>“So… is there anything you <em> can </em>talk about for the Greenland Project, Ms. Vidal?” Ralph asked, elbows coming to rest on the table as he leaned forward with interest.  </p><p>Rio’s smile was rictus as her eyes settled on the unkempt man. How he had managed to gain such a high-level position without basic cleanliness standards was beyond her. “My employees are very excited,” she bit out before a genuine smile took over her features. “I’m pretty sure our R&amp;D team is the most excited, however. This contract got their department a substantial budgetary boost.”  </p><p>The research and development team had been hell-bent on a gods-be-damned pizza party, of all things to celebrate. One which quickly turned into a rather boozy pizza party. Eddie had gotten a video of her after they had coerced her into participating in a limbo competition (which she failed miserably at and ended up with a sore ass to show for it, though according to him it was “going viral” on that little dancing app). </p><p>“Employee morale is incredibly important,” Evanora acknowledged without an ounce of conviction, eyes narrowing when their waitress returned with the girl she had explicitly requested not return in tow. Rio watched as her jaw clenched, and her nostrils flared that her demand was not followed. </p><p>“Thank you.” Rio beamed at the young girl, winking when she placed the glass in its designated area for formal dining. Kamala’s cheeks flushed, and she placed the next glass in front of Agatha before moving onto Ralph then Evanora. </p><p>Alison moved to pour the wine as other servers brought the appetizers; Rio needed to thank whoever was in the kitchens tonight for their forethought on separate plates. She suppressed a shudder at the very idea of eating off the same plate as Bohner. “This is our masseto – it’s known for only using merlot grapes,” Alison said, then offered quite a few more pieces of information on the wine. </p><p>Evanora took a slow, savoring sip – humming with approval. </p><p>Somehow, someway, Rio managed to keep a straight face. She knew cooking sherry when she tasted it and from the look on Agatha’s face – so did she.  </p><p>“Wonderful.” Rio grinned, eyes sparkling with amusement. Agatha’s lips twitched with a small smile, and she took another sip of her <em> very expensive </em>cooking sherry before turning her attention to the appetizers in front of her. </p><p>“Are we ready to order?” Alison asked, looking hopefully at the four guests. “If I might recommend the spagetti al nero di seppia or the involtini di pesce spade.” </p><p>“I’ll have whatever the chef recommends tonight,” Rio replied when Alison, expectedly, turned her head first (she hid a grin at the irritated huff it drew from Evanora). And the chef would be recommending timbaletti - she knew because she’d seen him painstakingly preparing single serving rounds for it earlier.  </p><p>Knowing Lilia, she would have some set aside as well—there was no way Nicky would let her live it down if she came home without something from his Nonna’s. He had once even threatened to run away to his Aunt Alice’s when he’d found out she had visited the restaurant and had not thought of bringing him anything back. Granted, he had been seven at the time and on a sardine kick. </p><p>Evanora was quick to jump in, seemingly terrified that someone else might be asked first. Rio realized why as the vile crone spoke, “Ralph and I will have the two dishes you recommended earlier. My daughter will have the caprese salad.” </p><p>Something within Rio tightened when Agatha’s shoulders subtly slumped as she picked at the remaining olives on her plate. All she wanted to do was wrap the young alpha up and ensure she had access to everything she needed – food, water, shelter, warmth... </p><p>Her thoughts came to a screeching halt as Evanora’s voice continued, “—she’s gained a little weight—" </p><p>In that moment?  All Rio wanted to do was smash her wine glass and plunge a shard through Evanora’s eye. Rio’s grip tightened on her fork. she despised people who pushed Alpha superiority; she knew down to her very bones what it was to live under the oppressive weight of an archaic hierarchy. For the longest time she thought she was broken. Her mother – her <em> real </em> mother, not the one who’d given her up to the system for not being <em> normal </em> – had instilled a firm sense of justice within her. “Treat everyone with dignity” Lilia had told her, voice quiet and firm as she pressed a cannoli into Rio's hands. “No matter their designation.” It was practically branded on her soul. </p><p>Rio’s alpha wanted to snap – wanted to rip the other woman’s tongue out and present the wriggling organ to Agatha as a gift. If Evanora wanted aggression, true aggression, she could show it to her. Gladly. </p><p>The CEO of Harkness Industries continued prattling on as their waiter left to put their orders in, but Rio couldn’t bring herself to focus. She was too busy trying to quell the bloodthirsty urge that had sprung up within her. The urge to protect was strong – stronger than it should be with another alpha, Rio realized absently. She shook herself mentally. Now was not the time to contemplate public murder. (Even if she <em> would </em> be doing the world a favor.) </p><p>It took quite a bit of coaxing, but she managed to settle her alpha enough to zero-in on Evanora as she worked her way through a few olives. “Now, Rio – as new player in the field of energy—" </p><p>“Not so new, I’ve been contributing to the field for quite some time.” Rio interrupted curtly. Struck by sudden inspiration, she turned to the enjoyable Harkness. “I was curious, actually – Agatha, you mentioned you’d read my recent contributions to <em> Environmental International </em> and <em> Nature Sustainability</em>. Have you been reading those long?” </p><p>The younger woman swallowed slowly, taking a quick sip from her water glass and dabbing at her lips politely. “I’ve been reading <em>Environmental International </em> for quite a few years now. One of my friends from school was really into ecology and conservation. I read through a few so that I could be knowledgeable on his presentation.” </p><p>Rio cocked her head to the side, full focus on the woman next to her. “Oh wow, that’s dedication. Was it for a college presentation?” She could see Evanora’s lips pursing out of the corner of her eye, but she was more than a little fascinated by the slight flush sneaking up Agatha’s neck – was it embarrassment? </p><p>“It was for our 8th grade group project defenses, actually." The corners of Agatha’s lips twitched with a smile, a bit of pride coming through. </p><p>That smile unraveled Rio’s mind, the urge to do anything to see it again threatening her demeanor. The alpha blinked, trying to stay focused on the conversation. “<em> 8 </em> <em> th </em> <em> grade? </em> You... had to do a defense of a project in 8th grade that required scientific journals?” </p><p>“In French.” Agatha nodded as though it was the most natural thing in the world. </p><p>“In <em> French</em>?” Rio echoed, staring at the younger alpha. Trying very hard not to think how French or her own mother tongue would sound in Agatha’s soothing voice.  </p><p>“Yes, well. My daughter has the best education money can buy thanks to her father. Now," the Harkness matriarch started again, clearly more than a little aggravated that her intention of having the CEO of Vidal Corp eating out of the palm of her hand kept slipping further and further away. </p><p>Rio shifted her body a bit so that she could give Agatha her full attention – utterly ignoring Evanora. Her interest was piqued. “Where did you go to school?”  </p><p>Eddie had been so focused on the CEO and current data on the C-Suite employees that he had failed to gather information on Agatha’s education. Rio didn’t mind learning about it this way, which was much more entertaining.   </p><p>She watched as Agatha seemingly took a moment to collect herself – was she not used to someone taking an interest in her? Blue eyes flitted across the table to Evanora, nervous energy radiating from her before she flashed the most professional smile in existence. “I attended Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. I’m officially an Old Rosean.” </p><p>“Whoa.” Color Rio officially impressed. She knew the Harkness family came from wealth – they reeked of old money – but that was entirely unexpected. She had briefly considered sending Nicky there once but couldn’t bear the thought of having such a distance between the two of them. She reached out to take her glass, a teasing smile on her lips. “And what do alumni from there do for fun?” </p><p>The blush on Agatha’s cheeks stirred something within the alpha. "Reading. Cooking. I can make a mean lobster thermidor... my mother sent me to France for a while, to learn to cook properly. For when I'm married, of course." </p><p>Evanora rolled her eyes, the sour wave of her irritation wafting unpleasantly over the table, "Yes, well…” she smacked her lips, “Agatha will make an adequate wife someday. Now, Rio about Vidal Corp...” </p><p>Rio ignored the older woman and turned her head back to Agatha, "France? That must have been exciting. Did you do any sightseeing? I've always wanted to visit Versailles. Where did you stay?" She caught a whiff of something from Agatha’s side of the table– Sandalwood? Lavender? Rio’s nostrils unconsciously flared as she sought more of the enticing scent. It was difficult to decipher over the juniper. </p><p>Apparently, that was all it took for Agatha to open up like the rarest flower, though Rio could see she was still very restrained. It was almost as if she naturally spoke in animated fashion but constantly fought to repress it.  </p><p>"Some. For a while I stayed in southern France in Marseille at my father's estate. That's where I learned to cook. When I was accepted into École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Paris, I visited Versailles a few times.” She waved her hand as she spoke, flicking her wrist enthusiastically. “The gardens are so, so beautiful.” She blushed smiling at the memory, “It’s rather close to Paris – my roommate and I visited Provence and the small villages around there. They're stunning. We visited Mausanne les Alpilles, Saint Rémy and of course cities like Avignon.” The beautiful alpha said placing her hands back down in her lap, twisting the cloth napkin between her fingers.  </p><p>Rio couldn’t help but stare, entranced, as Agatha spoke. She seemed to naturally pull attention in without even meaning to. “Jen still won’t let me live down how many times we visited Avignon. You might have heard of her, actually – Doctor Jennifer Kale. She owns some amazing clinics." Agatha’s voice tapered off when Evanora cleared her throat and their waitress returned with their food. </p><p>Rio watched with barely contained glee as Evanora and Ralph’s plates were put down in front of them. “These noodles are <em> black</em>!” Evanora snarled and Rio’s nose was immediately filled with the tar-like stink of the older alpha’s displeasure before it dissipated into the air. Rio, silently lamenting the death of the enticing sandalwood and lavender that had delicately permeated the air, made a mental note to have R&amp;D work on an improvement for the scent filters. Anything to avoid that vile smell again. </p><p>Alison glanced down at her, a look of annoyance passing over her features so quickly that if Rio hadn’t been paying attention in that moment, she would have missed it. “Spagetti al nero di seppia uses squid ink, madam.”  </p><p>“It’s going to stain my teeth!” the older woman hissed with a grimacing scowl.  </p><p>“You ordered it, ma’am. However, I can have another dish prepared if you would like.” </p><p>“Immediately!” Evanora turned to snap something at Ralph who was already digging into his meal. Her eyes narrowed in disgust when she saw the flecks of breadcrumbs around his lips. “Is that fish, Mr. Bohner?” </p><p>He took a bite and somehow managed to get out a garbled “Yeah,” before swallowing hard and taking a swig of wine. “It’s real good too, baked. Don’t think I’ve had cod like this before.” </p><p>“Pesce spada means swordfish, actually.” The correction was soft and muttered almost as an afterthought; Rio’s eyes flew to Agatha and annoyance sparked to life when she saw Agatha picking at her salad with her fork, subtle little jabs into the tomatoes. She wasn’t sure if it was due to Evanora ordering something <em> for </em> Agatha or if it was due to Evanora ordering something for Agatha that she clearly did <em> not </em>enjoy. </p><p>The sinking feeling in her gut left Rio painfully aware of the odds it was the latter. </p><p>“You will take this hideous dish back to the chef and have them make that meal for me.” The Harkness matriarch waved her hand dismissively at the staff and cast a withering look at her daughter before turning her attention back to Rio. “So, Miss Vidal—" </p><p>Rio could feel her blood pressure increasing by the second. Honestly, Rio wasn’t sure if it was due to Evanora’s treatment of the staff or her treatment of her daughter. Whatever the cause, her alpha clawed at the enclosure she kept it firmly locked behind with a ferocity rare for them. Eager to soothe it, Rio returned her attention to the youngest member at the table, blatantly (happily) ignoring Evanora once more.  </p><p>Clearing her throat to draw Agatha’s attention from where she was miserably prodding her food, Rio was half tempted to offer her own plate. She took a bite instead as Agatha looked up, entirely unsure if Agatha would accept her gift. An idea struck her like a bolt of lightning, causing her to sit a bit straighter. "I hear the gardens here are quite nice.” She <em> knew </em>they were nice – she worked hard on them. “Would you like to go see them after we finish eating?" Rio asked, wiping her lips with the napkin. The way Agatha’s beautiful blue eyes shone when she spoke about the gardens in Versailles captivated Rio and made her eager to learn more about the stunning woman—her opinions, what made her smile, anything, as long as she kept speaking.   </p><p>Agatha looked at her barely eaten salad – she absolutely despised caprese salads for the sheer fact that her mother loved them. Being constantly under her mother’s thumb pushed her to do what she <em> knew </em>Evanora would punish her for later. In private, of course. "I would love to. Though I know my mother has an early meeting in the morning. I wouldn't want to cause an issue with that." </p><p>Agatha felt a small victory within when her mother’s jaw clenched in palpable frustration. Evanora’s dinner was going nowhere near how she had hoped, and she didn’t seem certain how to get it back on track. Not that the meeting had ever even been close to being on track in the first place. “Dear, I’m sure someone as accomplished as Miss Vidal would rather spend her time discussing other things,” Evanora interjected coldly. “Let’s not waste her time, she was just being polite. I swear, for all that schooling, you have no sense in that brain of yours.” </p><p>Rio watched in horror as Agatha quickly deflated. “Excuse me, I need to visit the ladies’ room,” the younger alpha muttered, putting her napkin down as she slipped from her seat. The saccharine smile on Evanora’s lips told Rio everything she needed to know as she tightened her grip on her fork. At this rate, she was going to owe Lilia a new one. </p><p>“I cannot <em> wait </em>to marry that girl off and get her out of my hair.” Evanora sighed. “Finding her the right mate from the right family is just so difficult.” She shook her head as their waiter placed the second meal in front of her. “Finally. Decent food. For the amount of talk this restaurant has generated, the service is rather subpar.” </p><p>Rio bit her tongue to stop a scathing comment on the fact that the woman had received only what she had ordered.  </p><p>“You know... Evanora.” Both women turned their attention to Ralph, the last remnants of his meal rolling around in his mouth. “I could take Agatha off your hands. She’d make a good wife, like you said. She can cook, she’s well trained, and she can take care of any brats we have. Honestly, there is only one job for a woman and working on top of being a wife and mother… I mean what’s the point?” Ralph laughed into his glass, completely losing the irony of his words sitting with two female CEOs.  </p><p>Rio’s knee hit the table and blinding pain flashed through her brain, clearing her mind of the death she <em> and </em>her alpha wanted to reign hellfire down upon the crass duo. Rio’s lips pulled back into a snarl as she stood, barely containing her fury, nearly taking the table with her. “Sorry, excuse me. I need to step out for a few moments.” </p><p>Rio just barely refrained from stomping off, forcing herself to take slow and calculated steps as she worked on reining in her pheromones. She bit the inside of her cheek until she tasted iron on her tongue, relying on the sting to center herself.  </p><p>It helped, but not as much as seeing Agatha exit the restroom looking somewhat refreshed (though Rio could see hints of redness in her eyes and she still looked bone tired). “Agatha.” The younger woman looked up and gave a wry smile, the light just barely reaching her cobalt eyes. “R-Miss Vidal. I...” She cut herself off, shaking her head, and took a breath. </p><p>Rio frowned with displeasure at being addressed so formally by the other woman. Her alpha longed for the younger alpha to say her name. Rio took a half-step closer, “Please… you can call me Rio.” she whispered diffidently, “How about that visit to the gardens? I need some fresh air, and you look like you could use some too.”  </p><p>Rio grimaced when she caught the overwhelming smell of juniper coming off the other woman. It was so strong it was almost artificial- had Lilia got new scented candles recently? She usually preferred a subtler teakwood for the restaurant foyer. </p><p>“You don’t need to pretend, Ms. Vidal,” Agatha snapped defensively, crossing her arms protectively in front of herself “…Wasting your time humoring me.” She rolled her eyes, her lips pressed in a slight frown, that suggested that her mother's remarks had affected her perception of the situation.   </p><p>Rio clenched her fists in frustration. Her alpha demanded to be let free, to take this woman far from her mother and that pathetic little man who strutted about like a cock on the walk. “It’s not a waste of time,” Rio refuted abruptly, trying to wrangle the sting of resentment she felt from the other woman’s cynicism. “I wouldn’t lie to you, Agatha…” She released an exasperated sigh, relaxing her hands. “I really would like to visit the gardens…” She found herself grinning just a bit, feeling the warmness spread across her cheeks as she continued, “…with you. You’re the only good thing about this evening.” The CEO felt her heart flutter at the admission. </p><p>Warmth sparked deep in her chest when Agatha lifted her eyes, a small smile finding its home on her face as she looked at Rio with something like wonder. </p><p>“I…I’d like that, too.”  </p><p>Internally, Rio felt a smug satisfaction when she saw the faint blush on Agatha’s cheeks. </p><p>She did that. </p><p>She caused that. </p><p>Her alpha was practically preening in its cage. If she weren’t so smug herself, it would be embarrassing. </p><p>Rio extended her hand and, after a brief moment of hesitation during which she adorably bit her lip, Agatha accepted the gesture. Rio's heart stuttered. Before she could talk herself out of it, she squeezed Agatha’s hand, poking her tongue into her still tender cheek. “Come on. We can go around the side here.” Anything to keep Agatha from Evanora’s ever critical eye. </p><p>As they walked, Rio couldn’t help but notice how Agatha’s hand was cool and soft, fingers slotting perfectly with her own. She was certain letting go could quite possibly constitute a hate crime. </p><hr/><p>As Rio and Agatha made their way outside, a cool breeze passed and lifted the humidity. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught a shiver rolling down Agatha’s spine and immediately slipped off her own jacket. “Here, you’ll catch a chill.” She draped it over the other woman’s shoulders with ease. “I tend to run hot. You seem to run a bit cooler than most alphas.” Rio smiled as Agatha pulled the edges of the jacket tighter around her form.  </p><p>Now that they were free from the brusque odors of Evanora and Ralph (it still baffled Rio how they both somehow managed to overwhelm the industrial strength filters Rio had installed for Lilia) she managed to catch Agatha’s scent hidden under Evanora’s cloying one. She could pick up the faint hints of sandalwood and lavender and something almost sweet like honey over the too-pungent scent of burnt juniper. </p><p>They walked side by side in a comfortable silence. Rio struggled to keep from looking at Agatha, caught up in how the tiny sparkling lights reflected in her eyes resembled a night sky. She grinned when Agatha pulled the lapels of her jacket closer to her nose. It filled her with fervent excitement that the younger alpha seemed to enjoy her scent. </p><p>Agatha stopped in front of the bushes. “These azaleas are beautiful.”    </p><p>“You know about plants too?” Rio asked, slightly impressed, eyes lighting up. Agatha had been nothing but a wonderful surprise all evening. She was passionate, highly intelligent, beautiful and Rio couldn’t keep her eyes off her. There was a polished docile politeness about her that made Rio feel a bit perturbed – for all of her accomplishments, she expected the young alpha to be a little more arrogant, assuming she would be more forthright to assert her dominance, like the Harkness matriarch.     </p><p>“I know my favorites,” The younger woman responded, her voice carrying a sweeter cadence.  </p><p>Rio was half-tempted to ask Agatha <em> why </em>azaleas were some of her favorites. She hummed and said, “They are Nicky’s favorite as well,” before she could stop herself. </p><p>Still staring at the beautiful shade of pink-mauve, Agatha asked, “Who is Nicky?” with an almost absentminded tone, her eyes tracing the delicate patterns on the petals. <br/> <br/>Rio paused for a moment, watching Agatha lift her hand to caress the flowers. Her gentleness made Rio’s chest tighten and her belly stir. How honest should she be? Could she trust the woman standing right beside her? She let out a shaky breath. “Nicky is my son… we planted these together about two years ago. My mother said she wanted something homemade for her birthday; Nicky and I planted them.” She reached over to touch the same flower as Agatha. The moment their fingertips met, a spark jolted between them and a stronger scent of sweet lavender swirled around.  </p><p>She blinked – she hadn’t planted any lavender. </p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath the moment they touched. The sensation ricocheted throughout her body, tilting her off-axis. Her blue eyes snapped up to the warm brown ones in astonishment, feeling a bit betrayed by the one-two sucker punch of Rio’s admission and her body’s visceral response to being in close proximity to the handsome alpha. Her cheeks reddened and a warmth crept up her neck. She tried to control the unexpected response, her mind spinning back to what was just revealed.  </p><p>Who was her mother? And Rio had a son? Billy never mentioned she had a child. If Rio had a child, did that mean she had a mate? That didn’t come up in their research either. Her eyes glanced to either side of Rio's neck, searching out any evidence of a mark. </p><p>Rio smiled, imagining the questions formulating behind Agatha’s adorable, contorted brow—her brain was clearly working on overdrive. “My mother coincidentally owns this restaurant. And Nicky is mine. I gave birth to him. I was young. We both were. His sire and I. He… left before Nico was born. I keep him away from the public… Nicky deserves to be a kid and not used as leverage by people who may want to exploit that detail.” She grimaced; her nose scrunched up at the thought of her internet fans. “Or the public. They go a bit rabid sometimes.” </p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, this new information settling in. However, one question still baffled her. “But you still smell like an alpha…” </p><p>Rio shrugged. “I do because I am… we all thought I was a beta when I was younger. Then I had Nicky and I presented after he was born.”  </p><p>Agatha’s mind was spinning. She had heard of late bloomers but presenting after giving birth to a pup… that was a statistical anomaly. At least that’s what she remembered from Jen’s 3am caffeine-induced medical rambles in their youth.  </p><p>Generally, when an alpha gave birth to pups, their scent profile changed, losing its dominating bite. Most alphas were looked down on after this occurrence, becoming societal pariahs—sometimes even dropping below omegas in ranking. Rio was not like any other presenting alpha she’d ever experienced. There was a stillness to Rio, a grounded confidence in the way she carried herself, a gentleness that reminded Agatha of her father. Rio was different… living her life as a beta only to find out she was something else entirely.  </p><p>Alphas carried power, privilege and possibilities. Rio used this status to her advantage, to be a force of something good. This revelation resonated with Agatha in more ways than she could reveal. Agatha lived her life suppressing her true omega nature, presenting herself as an alpha due to her mother's disdain for anything she perceived as inferior. </p><p>Cold realization slammed into her – her mother could never know about this.  </p><p>Why was Rio even telling her? </p><p>Rio took half a step closer, studying the other woman’s side profile. “You know I’m never going to sell to Harkness Industries. I’m never going to sell, period."  </p><p>“Then why did you agree to this dinner?” Agatha’s face contracted with a slight frown of confusion.  </p><p>Rio shrugged. “Honestly? You.” </p><p>Agatha fought the urge to glance over her shoulder – to make sure that nobody else was behind her. “Me?” She was bewildered. There was nothing special about her. Absolutely nothing. Her mother made sure to remind her of that. Daily, even. </p><p>Rio nodded slowly, leaning in close with a soft smile. Agatha couldn’t help it when her eyes fell to the cute little gap between Rio’s front teeth. She forced her eyes back up to the other woman’s. </p><p>“I wanted to see if there was any way I could <em> poach </em> you,” Rio said. “Poach your talents and skills for Vidal Corp, of course. I know about all the good things you have done for your mother’s company. The charities and philanthropic work you are doing right under her nose. After spending the evening getting to know more about you... well, frankly speaking, your mother's company doesn’t deserve you. None of them do.”   </p><p>Agatha felt extremely <em> hot </em> all of a sudden just as the delicious scent of Rio hit her nose, filling her lungs. Petrichor, dark chocolate and something with a hint of heat. Things that shouldn’t go so well together, but they did. Her heart pounded wildly beneath her ribs. An unrelenting pulsating need filled her veins, overwhelming her senses. </p><p>Intoxicating. </p><p><em> Oh no.  </em> </p><p>A <em> want </em> that suffused her entire body. Warmth flooding her senses, pumping through her veins. The <em> need </em> thrumming under her skin, making her muscles hum and quiver. An <em> ache </em> so deep within, no… between her… </p><p><em> Oh… f </em>uck… her heat.  </p><p>Rio's eyes darkened the instant she smelled it, and a low growl rumbled in her chest. Her nostrils flared, breathing in the most intoxicating fragrance, one which was making her feel slightly disoriented. </p><p>This could <em> not </em>be happening, Agatha was on more heat suppressants than her doctor deemed healthy and her cycle wasn’t due for another week. Unless… being near Rio somehow triggered it. Not entirely impossible, if the woman was close to her own rut. Alphas were not exactly expected to be on suppressants; it was more the societal norm for the responsibility to lay on the shoulders of omegas. A sense of panic filled her veins - this had never happened before. She needed to get out of there before anyone else caught her scent. Before she managed to upset her mother even more than she already had tonight. </p><p>Agatha spun on her heel, desperate to leave - knowing full well she needed to put space between herself and the alpha but was stopped by Rio gently grabbing hold of her wrist. Rio stepped forward slowly, standing behind her and leaning in closely. Agatha’s body shivered as Rio’s other hand moved to rest on her waist, fingers possessively splayed on her hip bone. </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched when the tip of Rio’s nose gently grazed her neck, <em> Oh</em>, how wonderful it felt to have the alpha be so near, inspecting… tasting the air, her glands going into overdrive unable to keep from pumping out another wave of pheromones.  </p><p>Rio breathed her in again and let out a low moan. “Agatha….” she groaned, the soft breath that escaped her lips caressed the shell of Agatha's ear, sending a shiver down her spine. The way the alpha reverently whispered her name, taking ownership of every single fucking syllable. The omega's head lolled on to Rio’s shoulder, her eyes rolled back, unable to push down the feeling of pleasure that bubbled up within her.  </p><p>Rio made her name sound like <em> home</em>. </p><p>Her omega melted to the siren’s song beckoning her for submission, the alpha’s scent intensified making her lightheaded. She had never been with an alpha before, as her mother ensured she stayed isolated during her heat. She’d had sex before, sure, but she always played it safe with only other omegas she trusted, all discreet, because there was too much at stake. Agatha had already disappointed Evanora with being born as an omega, the last thing she needed was to get pregnant. </p><p>Agatha knew she was in a dangerous position; alphas in a rut tended to lose control, becoming more aggressive and possessive. They fell back on their primal instincts with little to no repercussions. She took a deep breath, trying to restrain the current of heat flowing through her veins. If she ran, would the alpha chase her? Would she be pinned down? How terrifying and absolutely alluring the idea was.  </p><p><em> Fuck</em>, what was she even thinking?  </p><p>Alluring? <em>No.</em> <b>Yes.</b> Agatha mentally shook herself – desperate to clear the fog of her heat from her brain. </p><p>The beginning of her heat had never been this intense before. The suppressants should have been working, but her omega, who she had been denying for so long, desperately craved to be taken by this alpha. Agatha could feel Rio’s semi-hard bulge pressed against her. She whimpered softly, giving into the burning desire, releasing the tightness she held in her clenched fists. She rolled her hips back, rewarding herself with another dangerous low growl from the alpha.  </p><p>“Agatha… I thought you were… fuck…” The sound that escaped Rio was desperate and needy.  </p><p>“I guess we’re even… now you know my secret too…” She wanted to crack a joke about mutually assured destruction, but her senses were kicking into overdrive. Her skin flushed as Rio’s hand slid down further to rest on her thigh. She took in a sharp breath of air, feeling herself lose control – she wanted that hand closer to where she burned.  </p><p>There was a self-assuredness to Rio’s movements as she released her grip on the other woman’s wrist, running her calloused thumb soothingly over where she had grabbed the younger woman. “Don’t run from me,” The CEO breathed as she pressed a light kiss on Agatha’s neck where her skin met the fabric of her dress. She could feel a shiver beneath the touch of her lips. </p><p>“O-kay…” the whispered reply came unbidden, as Agatha shifted, turning in Rio’s embrace, kyanite eyes meeting rapidly darkening siderite ones.  </p><p>The hand that had been on her wrist lifted of its own accord, coming to a halt at her clavicle and trailing up slowly. Agatha swallowed – Rio was staring at her with a near reverent look in her eyes. Warm fingertips caressed along Agatha's neck and then Rio's thumb slowly brushed against the other woman's lower lip. The touch was so tender, it made her weak in the knees.  </p><p>Rio couldn't help the possessive feeling that bubbled up when Agatha's lips parted to let a small gasp escape. “You are exquisite, Agatha.”  </p><p>Surprised by the praise, the omega mewled, enjoying the warmth that washed over her. Her eyes fluttered shut for a moment as she let herself lean closer, a pleased sound escaping her when Rio’s hand resting near her hip shifted, coming to rest at the small of her back.   </p><p>“I’m sure you say that to all the omegas,” Agatha teasingly breathed out, looking up to watch the alpha staring, utterly transfixed on her lips.  </p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped back to hers, a possessive look flashing over her features, not appreciating the dismissiveness in her tone. “There are no others. Only you.” She traced Agatha’s lower lip with her thumb, eyes darkening to the blackest pitch when Agatha opened her lips slowly, blue eyes fixed on Rio, and took the tip of her thumb between her teeth to nip lightly.  </p><p>Rio’s chest rumbled and she pulled her thumb away, caressing it against Agatha’s cheekbone. “I’ve never seen someone as beautiful as you, Agatha. Not in all my years on this earth.” She spoke softly, her voice barely more than a whisper, hoping the other woman would catch the sincerity in her words. </p><p>She had tamped down on her alpha’s demand to declare she would burn entire worlds just to see Agatha's smile. To have the privilege of making her laugh—she wagered her laugh was the most wonderful sound as well on earth.   </p><p><em> Gods </em>… she was so fucking beautiful. </p><p>Feeling like a love-sick puppy, Rio couldn’t resist the urge for a millisecond longer and leaned in. Stealing a kiss before she could talk herself out if it. </p><p>The moment their lips met, Rio was a goner.  </p><p>The kiss was sweet and tender, and it pulled Rio in like a moth to a flame. Or maybe it was the eagerness of Agatha deepening the kiss. Her hand came up, fingers resting just behind Rio’s neck – thumb caressing her cheek. She pulled her in closer, and Rio forced her knees to lock, refusing to let them give out as the intensity of the kiss skyrocketed. </p><p>Neither of them was sure whose eyes fluttered shut first or whose tongue found the other’s first (Rio would, of course, say it was her own) but it didn’t matter. Her arms wrapped tight around Agatha, pulling her as close as she possibly could, desperate for everything she was allowed to take. </p><p>Somehow, in the frantic wildness of their touching, they lost their balance and landed hard amongst the azaleas with Rio on top of the younger woman. She tried to push herself up – desperate to check and see if Agatha was alright, but was quickly stopped when she felt their bodies meet. Rio groaned when she realized she ended up ensconced between Agatha’s pale thighs (not that she was complaining) and the black dress had bunched up a bit, giving her a peek of the omega’s purple silk underwear. </p><p>Her mouth went dry. </p><p>Agatha shifted, adjusting herself against the flowerbed and letting out a breathless moan. Rio licked her lower lip – there was no mistaking the growing wet patch of fabric there. A smugness filled her chest with pride, knowing that <em>that wetness</em>? Just for her. She had <em>caused </em>that. </p><p>She forced her eyes up, taking in Agatha’s quivering muscles and heaving chest. </p><p>Her lips – parted and swollen. </p><p>Rio wanted to kiss them again.  </p><p>Her nose.  </p><p>So perfect – the blush of her cheeks had migrated across the bridge of her nose.  </p><p>It was so fucking attractive. </p><p>Her eyes — pupils blown wide with arousal. </p><p>Rio opened her mouth to say something – anything really — but Agatha reached up and fisted the front of her shirt tightly and yanked the older woman down with such a force that the air was expelled from her lungs. The omega pulled her into a fiery kiss, scorching her very soul. </p><p>Oxygen? Trivial. Utterly unimportant, when those lips were giving her life. </p><p>It was impossible to tell where one began and the other ended as the kiss deepened. </p><p>Agatha bucked her hips, and the movement caused Rio to hiss out a low sound of pleasure, her chest rumbling as the bulge between her legs pressed firmly against the omega beneath her. </p><p>She couldn’t contain the moan that escaped her and she rolled her hips forward on instinct.  </p><p>Her alpha took over – not wanting to ever lose contact. The building pressure felt just too damn good. </p><p>There was no resisting the inviting warmth between Agatha’s legs, luring her in like a lighthouse on a foggy night. </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio swore under her breath as she rocked forward. One of Agatha’s legs came up to wrap around her waist, urging her closer. Rio groaned to the sensation of Agatha's pointy heel pressing against her lower back; the sting felt so good. The movement pushed the skirt of the omega’s dress up further and she gasped as they slid closer. Her slacks were too tight.  </p><p>Too confining.  </p><p>“Oh fuck.” She buried her face in the crook of Agatha’s neck, nosing her way to where the omega’s scent was the strongest. Her nostrils flared and expelled a displeased snort, for there was something bitter and slick coating Agatha’s skin. Rio growled, thrusting her hips forward, desperate for more as she licked a long stripe along the other woman’s neck.  </p><p>The low whine that came from Agatha’s lips spurred her on further. She latched on – sucking and nipping at the bitter, oily liquid there until it was gone. With it went the pungent odor and Rio was engulfed with Agatha’s natural scent, not whatever synthetic monstrosity she had been wearing.  </p><p>Sandalwood. Lavender. Just a hint of sweet blossoms. Possibly honey.  </p><p>It was addictive and there was no escape from it. </p><p>Rio pressed her nose there, inhaling deep. </p><p>She was so, so close. </p><p>Her hand came down to Agatha’s waist and squeezed possessively. </p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into the muscles of her back with blunted nails, desperately moving her hips in time with Rio’s. “Need you… want you…” Agatha panted in Rio’s ear. Her eyes rolled back in pleasure. The alpha was convinced everything about this woman beneath her was made for her. Rio shifted, sliding her hand to Agatha’s bare thigh, dull nails dragging up to her hip then around to grasp her ass, “Is this okay?” she asked between pants.  </p><p>The omega responded with a high-pitched keening, rolling her hips to meet Rio’s. “Mhmm,” she nodded eagerly. Her hands slid up to stake their claim on the alpha’s face once more, pulling her towards her lips, opening her mouth to kiss deeper.  </p><p>Rio moaned, sucking on her tongue. Her cock expanded, trapped beneath the layers of clothing, firm enough to press against the omega’s clit. When she pulled Agatha’s other leg to wrap around her waist, the angle changed and Agatha moaned loudly, arching her back. “Yes… Rio… like that...”  </p><p>Hearing her name moaned from Agatha’s lips, <em> like that</em>, threw a match on the gasoline sitting deep in Rio. She growled and bucked her hips with more purpose — a singular goal in mind, in fact. Rio would be damned if she didn’t get to see the woman beneath her in the moment of her release. She could feel the omega’s hot panting breath on her lips, her nails sinking into her neck, the smell of her delicious heat, her body shaking.  </p><p>“Rio… I'm…” The omega’s body tensed and started to shake, her mouth opening widely, breath catching in her throat and back arching as her orgasm rocked her body.  </p><p>Rio let out a choked moan when she felt the wetness of Agatha’s release through the fabric of her slacks.  She groaned, grinding harder down, desperate to get as close as she could. Her cock ached to be inside the omega. “Fuck Agatha…” she growled, sucking the skin below her ear.  </p><p>“Rio, <em> more please </em>…” Agatha gasped, her voice raw and wrecked. “Please. I need you.” </p><p><em> Fuck</em>, the devotion in her voice ruined the alpha, as she desperately begged for more. </p><p>Rio nodded, whimpering as Agatha’s lips moved to her neck, sucking her sensitive gland. The alpha frantically moved her hand to unbuckle her belt.  </p><p>What were they even thinking? They were out in public, but none of that seemed to matter —the desire for one another exceeded any rational thought. It was a gravitational pull that they could not resist. Every cell in her body was affected by the omega's magnetic force. A low laugh escaped her when she felt one of Agatha’s hands moving to help her, working her zipper down as Rio managed to get the tip of her belt through the buckle— </p><p>Reality came crashing back, when the splash of cold water drenched her back. Rio snarled, so very close to letting loose an enraged roar. Her dark eyes burning with rage, searching for a foe as she reared around.  </p><p>How dare someone interrupt them.   </p><p>How dare someone challenge her claim to what was hers! </p><p>A thick cloud of tobacco smoke hit her in the face, and she froze, her brain seizing to blue screen before rebooting. “You’re not going to rut into that girl like a teenage pup with no sense, Rio Vidal. Not at my restaurant, not in my gardens. Che cazzo, what have you done to my bushes, piccola!?” </p><p>Shame flooded her senses briefly, but she tamped it down, shifting to keep Agatha partially hidden, trying to protect some of her modesty. Her alpha would not have a possible threat to her claim. </p><p>Even if it was her kooky, crazy mother.  </p><p>“Don’t make me take you by your ear and put you over my knee,”  Her matriarch warned, tone sharp, snapping her aggression like a twig. </p><p>Embarrassment washed over her as Agatha pushed herself up onto her elbows, cheeks flushed – a hickey of all things blossoming just below her right ear. The omega pushed out a wave of her own pheromones, calming the two alphas almost instantly. </p><p>The older alpha sighed, “I’ve had a driver pull around back here.”  Lilia pointed to the gate then snapped her fingers to get the younger alpha’s attention. “You’re going to help Miss Harkness to the car and get somewhere safe. I’ve had this restaurant 35 years and I’m not going to have it turn into a sordid public mating den.” </p><p>Agatha blushed heavily at the mention of <em> mating. </em> They almost just fucked, in public… in the bushes.   </p><p>“Thanks Ma, you’re a life saver,” Rio said gratefully, lifting herself up from the ground and wiping her hands before reaching down to help Agatha stand up. </p><p>“Don’t <em> thanks ma </em> me!” Lilia smacked the back of the younger alpha’s head. “When your rut is over, I will make you spend at least a day here for what you’ve done to my precious azaleas.” Her nostrils flared a bit in agitation, “I called your sister and she will be taking little Nico for the night, then I will pick him up tomorrow to spend the weekend with his Nonna. We don’t need to traumatize the pup – your cooking is enough.” </p><p>“Ow, Ma!” Rio cried out, rubbing the back of her head to relieve the sharp sting left there in her mother’s wake. “My cooking is <em> not </em>that bad!” She scowled, standing in front of Agatha as she adjusted her dress. </p><p>“You burnt water trying to make pasta, bambina.” </p><p>Rio let out a low whine and her shoulders slumped down in defeat. “I was trying to boil water with the olive oil in it like you always do...” </p><p>She heard Agatha giggle and Rio wasn’t entirely sure who was more humiliated – her or her alpha. She knew she was beet red, but seeing Agatha smile thrilled her. She'd happily be the butt of any joke if that smile was the reward. </p><p>Clearing her throat to cover her own embarrassment, Agatha reached instinctively for Rio’s hand again, threading their fingers once more. “I should actually get back to my mother. Thank you for... for...” Her voice trailed off when both alphas looked at her with stern expressions. “What?” </p><p>Lilia took another puff from her pipe, the smoke swirling as she exhaled from her nostrils. “Your mother has been kindly asked to leave and has been banned from the premises.” </p><p>Rio had to stop herself from puffing her chest. It was made even easier when she picked up on Agatha’s distress. “Oh…” </p><p>“Not that she will want to return anytime soon, Alison got a video of her being absolutely deplorable to Kamala. And she ran out on her bill.” Lilia lifted her pipe to her lips, studying the young omega. She smirked in amusement when Rio shuffled a bit more – protecting Agatha from her scrutiny. </p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open in horror. “The girl with the thousand-dollar cooking sherry? Is she alright? My mother can be a bit… abrasive at times.” </p><p>Rio grumbled, “A bit?” She turned to Agatha whose lips were pressed tightly in a line, then cleared her throat and looked back over to Lilia. “Ma, I’ll cover the bill.” </p><p>With a wave of her hand Lilia shook her head, “No, it was payment alone to watch her go six shades paler than she already is. She was practically translucent.” She was smirking, clearly amused by the memory.  </p><p>“No, it’s fine.” The omega’s hand came up with a dramatic flair. “My assistant made sure my corporate card was on file for the night. It’ll charge to the company, as well the tip.” It was getting more and more difficult for Agatha to pay attention to anything but the smell of Rio. “She’ll expect me to pay it anyways.” </p><p>“Oh, I like her,” Lilia laughed, nodding her head in appreciation. The girl's reputation was far better than her mother’s. “I’ll handle that. You and Rio head on through the garden exit.” Agatha moved a bit closer to Rio, unable to resist brushing her nose against the other woman’s shoulder.  </p><p>They shared a brief glance and timid smile, sensing something special was happening between them. Agatha's heart pounded as she looked away, her eyes revealing both yearning and reticence.  </p><p>“And for the love of the gods, polpettina, zip up your pants. You might want to untuck your shirt – cover that wet spot there on your crotch.” The matriarch gestured protruding her lips, quickly tilting her chin down towards the noticeable spot in question.  </p><p>Alpha and omega ducked their heads – one from sheer embarrassment and the other from simply being told off by her mother. Rio hurriedly moved to do up her fly and tighten her belt. She didn’t bother to hide the evidence of Agatha’s pleasure – it wasn’t like they were going to be passing through the restaurant itself. Rio took <em> pride </em>in the fact that Agatha had been so very affected by her attentions.   </p><p>Lilia shook her head, tut-tutting when she glanced over to the azaleas, with their crushed petals on the ground. The older alpha gave Rio one last look and turned to leave, sighing dramatically. “Oh and Agatha, try not to break Rio’s minchia during the first round.” Lilia couldn’t help but laugh to herself at the gasp she heard from the young omega behind her daughter.  </p><p>The alpha growled, snapping her head towards the matriarch. “Ma!” Her ears reddened and she nervously glanced over to the omega. </p><p>Agatha composed herself, trying to swallow the humiliation, and then it dawned on her, <em>oh god I didn't introduce myself to Rio’s mother.</em> But what she said aloud was, “I can’t believe we were caught by your mother <em>dry-humping</em> in the bushes.” </p><p>“I wouldn’t exactly call it dry,” Rio muttered, looking more than a little smug as she lead the way through the gardens.  </p><p>Agatha snorted and released a bark of laughter, then blushed a deep crimson at the noise that escaped her and slapped the older woman’s arm. “Oh my god, Rio, you’re ridiculous!”  </p><p>The alpha grinned. Hearing the omega’s beautiful laugh made her heart flutter, sparking joy deep within her. Yup – she would do anything to hear that laugh, that snort, again.  </p><p>Wrapping her arm around Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer, she asked, “Are you okay? Do you want me to take you home?” She kissed the omega’s temple. </p><p>Agatha’s smile fell instantly – she shook her head frantically, pulling the two of them to a stop in her panic. The thought of holing up in the basement of the Harkness estate for days? Alone? “No! That’s the last place I want to be right now.” She turned to face Rio, placing her hands on the alpha's chest where she could feel a heartbeat starting to race. </p><p>Rio placed her hands over the younger woman’s, enjoying their continuous need to maintain physical contact but so desperately wanting to calm the omega. “Okay, Agatha…where do you want to go?” She hoped to give the other woman a sense of security and control. “You’re in control here, we won’t go anywhere you don’t want to go. I promise.” </p><p>The omega bit her bottom lip and those blue eyes shimmered with clarity. “Anywhere, so long as I’m with you.” </p><p>Rio nodded slowly, pressing her lips on the other woman’s forehead. “Alright. Let’s go. I’m taking you to my place.” </p><p>It took a few moments for Agatha to calm down but once she did, she offered up a shaky smile, nodding her head. “Okay.” Rio pressed a final kiss to the tip of the heiress’ nose before taking one of her hands in her own once more. “Come on. The exit is through here.” She nodded to the side where an ornate gate blocked off the view to the public – Rio was sure her mother had to commission an iron gate with intricate flowers and other plant motifs worked into the metal. </p><p>Agatha followed without question, taking in the rarely seen flowers, then watching as Rio unlocked the gate with ease before allowing her to take the lead. The alpha took a moment to secure the gate closed before turning her attention back to  the patiently-waiting Agatha. “Sorry, gotta make sure it’s locked up tight. Don’t want any vandals getting in and crushing some random azalea bushes.” She watched with a fond smile as a blush found its home on Agatha’s cheeks once more.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips in a tight line, suppressing a grin. “Pretty sure <em> we </em>are the vandals, Rio...” Their hands linked once again and Agatha guided them to a sleek, black car – it was small for a limousine, definitely meant for personal use while still giving off an ostentatious air. Rio gave a polite nod to the beta driver as she held the door open, watching Agatha greet the young woman. “Thank you, Kate.” She glanced towards Rio, cheeks flushing a deeper red. “After you drop us off, your services won’t be required for the rest of the night. Or this weekend.” </p><p>Rio winked at the beta – the driver was no threat. She was young, and Agatha was covered in Rio’s scent. “Or Monday,” she quipped.  </p><p>“… or Monday,” Agatha mumbled, a cute smile ghosting over her lips. “Also, maybe talk to Billy about hazard pay for having to deal with my mother tonight.” Rio made her feel brave enough to joke about her mother – a rarity in her life. </p><p>The quirky beta snorted at the joke then offered up a cheesy salute. “Sir, yes ma’am!” </p>

<p>“I found it hard to find someone like you. Like you, like you. Send your location…” Kate sung along under her breath. Her hands gripped the steering wheel, and she was desperate to shake off the interaction with Evanora Harkness just a short time ago.  </p><hr/><p>The older woman came storming from the restaurant with Mr. Bohner following closely behind her, nodding in agreement with whatever the other alpha was ranting about. Kate had gotten out and immediately went to go open the door only to have the Harkness matriarch baring her teeth, growling and pumping out enough aggressive and dominating pheromones in one go that Kate had dropped to her knees and exposed her neck instinctively.  </p><p>“You’re fired, you unctuous beta worm. I should have gone with my original instinct and never allowed someone of your inferior standing to be hired." </p><p>In the back of her mind, she longed to point out that Evanora had not been the one to hire her, but right now even breathing was hard from the harsh pheromones the alpha was pushing out. She hadn’t even <b> met </b> the insufferable woman until today; Kate had exclusively been Agatha’s personal driver for nearly two weeks now, typically driving the heiress around in her personal Audi. Agatha hadn’t cared that she was a beta, nor had she cared that Kate’s mother was in jail for <b> fraud </b> and <b> murder</b>. Agatha always made sure to communicate clearly with Kate, a trait which was dearly appreciated. </p><p>The air was so thick and pungent that she could almost taste the overwhelming scent of tar and burnt juniper on her tongue as it burned in her lungs. “Stop.” Kate forced out with a grunt; the effort of forcing out a singular word was more than she thought possible.  </p><p>“Can’t even stand up for yourself, you useless waste of space,” Evanora snarled as she stepped closer, towering over her. </p><p>“Hey! What the hell do you think you’re doing, lady?!” </p><p>Kate sucked in a deep breath the moment the air cleared – Evanora’s attention was pulled away from her in an instant, eyes trained on the newcomer.  </p><p>“Don’t stick your nose where it doesn’t belong, mutt,” the alpha growled, pheromones pulsing dangerously.  </p><p>“It would be my genuine pleasure to call the cops on you.” The other beta pulled his cell phone out and snapped a photo of Evanora before making a show of tapping 9-1-1 onto his dial pad. “Your choice, lady. I don’t think your investors would appreciate the bad publicity of their CEO verbally abusing one of their own employees. Get gone and I won’t call the police or stick around and deal with them.” </p><p>Evanora glared at him before casting her gaze down towards Kate once more, pushing out one last wave of excessively bitter and aggressive pheromones. “Pitiful,” she sneered, watching with satisfaction as Kate toppled over before snapping her fingers. “Come, Ralph. We have too much to discuss to waste our time with these…” She eyed the two betas; her lip curled in disdain as the man helped Kate up. “… Strays that should have been <b> put down </b> at birth. My daughter can use that oversized brain of hers to figure out her own way home.” </p><p>Kate pinched her nose, desperate to stop the trickle of blood that had quickly turned into a stream as she watched the duo take their leave. Alphas forcing submission was the actual fucking worst in her very professional opinion. She knew she was going to be in for a rager of a headache tonight, and it would probably stick around well into the next day. </p><p>“Here.” Her rescuer’s grip was strong as he helped her stand up, eyes trained on Evanora and Ralph as they got into Ralph’s company car. “You alright, kid?” </p><p>“Peachy. I just got fired,” she mumbled, leaning her head forward so as not to swallow the blood. Snot and blood? A horrible thing to pair with her newly-minted unemployed status. “Thanks for the help there. She was kinda a bitch.” </p><p>His laugh was soft, and he nodded in agreement. “Seems like you got off easy getting fired by her then. I’m Clint.” </p><p>“Kate.” </p><p>Clint studied her for a moment, worry etched on his features. “You gonna be alright?” </p><p>She smiled and waved her hand with an air of nonchalance. “Yeah. My roomie is gonna freak when she finds out I lost another job, but I’ll figure it out. I always land on my feet…” Kate’s smile morphed into a smirk. “Well, not always. Sometimes it’s the knees. But that’s only when there’s rich bitchy alphas trying to show off how important they are.” Unpinching her nose, she sighed with relief when no fresh blood leaked out. “Really though. Thanks a ton.” She’d probably do a few quick blow outs to remove any remaining clots. </p><p>He nodded, patting her shoulder. “If you’re sure… and here. Reach out if you need. We can always use decent drivers.” The older beta fished something out of his pocket and handed it over.  </p><p>She glanced down and sucked in a breath – almost gagging when a clot of mucusy blood slithered down her throat. </p><p>Clint Barton <br/>Head of Security, Stark Industries </p><p>“Holy shit.” She looked up and he winked at her before jogging back across the road, coming to an easy stop in front of a pair of women – the redhead had her arms crossed and the brunette was watching with a fond expression on her face.  </p><p>Kate just barely heard one of them asking if he was done playing the hero, her tone teasing, while the other complained that she had been forced to watch two grown adults play rock-paper-scissors for who would get to go play said hero. She eyed the trio as they headed down the street and entered a bar together; the redhead held the door open and ushered the duo through before following. </p><p>“Jeeze louise… none of my other jobs have been this crazy.” She shoved the card into her pocket and her shoulders instantly slumped. </p><p>A job. </p><p>She was out of yet another one. </p><p>With a groan she tugged her phone from her pocket, careful not to let the card slip out before firing off a text to Agatha’s personal assistant. </p><p><b> Kate: </b> Hey, so Evanora Harkness just fired me. Where should I drop the car off? </p><p>He responded almost immediately.  </p><p><b> William Kaplan: </b> Don’t worry, figured this might happen. You were hired as Agatha's personal driver, not under Harkness Industries. Evanora can’t fire you. You’re not her employee. </p><p>Her mind bluescreened for a hot second as she got back into the car, careful not to get blood on the fancy leather seats. </p><p><b> Kate: </b> Dude I can’t be a contractor! I need insurance!! </p><p>She connected her phone to the car and waited – smiling when Streets popped on. Kate watched the three dots bounce anxiously as she sang along softly to the song. </p><p>“Jeeze. Are you writing a book?” the beta muttered under her breath as she leaned over and dug around in her bag. She snatched whatever cloth she was able to touch first – bringing it to her face to wipe the remaining blood off. Her face scrunched up when she smelled her own sweat and took in her gym shirt. “Gross…” </p><p>Her phone dinged. </p><p><b> William Kaplan: </b> You’ve got insurance. Didn’t you read your employee packet? You’re a fully employed, salaried employee with benefits. I strongly suggest you read it over when you have the next chance. We get some totally awesome benefits being employed under Agatha. She and her lawyer are weirdly creative.  </p><p><b> William Kaplan: </b>Like... she has something she called “fur-ternity” leave, she actually added it when I adopted Tissaia. </p><p><b> William Kaplan: </b>Have I shown you pictures of my baby girl!?  </p><p>Kate blinked a few times at the screen, barely registering the incoming spam of photos featuring a bearded dragon in multiple outfits. She giggled at the one with the blue cowboy hat and red bandana, then placed her phone down. Maybe when she got home tonight, she <em> would </em>finally go through those new hire packets on the table...or (more likely) pass out after eating a hefty bowl of box mac and cheese. She was fairly certain that she had a bag of kosher “bacon bits” left that she could mix in. Her aunt had included a few bags in her most recent care package – always worrying that Kate wasn’t eating enough. They tasted like real bacon bits, and she absolutely refused to look at the ingredients for fear of never wanting to eat them again. </p><p>Her thoughts were cut short when a sharp knock on the window startled her. Her hand came to rest over her chest as she looked over to the older woman standing there, staring at her with a rictus smile. Kate weighed her chances on whether or not the crazy lady was a serial killer or not before she pressed her finger on the button. The window rolled down slowly; she briefly wondered if people paid more for the relative silence, no mechanical whirring or squeals as the glass disappeared into the door. “Hi… hello. Howdy. Um... can I help you?” She glanced ahead and to the side to quadruple check that she wasn’t in a non-parking zone. A ticket was <em> just </em>what she needed right now. </p><p>The older woman’s smile went from wry to warm in seconds. “Good evening, are you the driver for Agatha Harkness?” </p><p>“I would say that is still up for debate depending on who is asking,” she muttered, then perked up. “Why? Does Ms. Harkness need a ride?” </p><p>The woman snorted as she nodded. “Yes, could you please pull around in 10 minutes by the back entrance?” </p><p>Kate was 110% <em>so </em>not fired – relief flooded her, and she sank into the leather seat. Sure, William had <em>said </em>not to sweat it, but Evanora Harkness was one of those rich <em>“I get what I want”</em> alphas and had sounded like she wanted her g-o-n-e. The young beta nodded after a moment. “Is everything okay? I’m Kate by the way.” </p><p>The older woman huffed and shook her head. “How rude of me, I’m Lilia Calderu. I own this establishment.” She gestured to the building behind her with her free hand. “I do believe we will need the utmost discretion. We have a rather <em> delicate </em> situation.”  </p><p>Kate straightened in her seat, looking up at Lilia – the dictionary picture of seriousness. “Of course. I signed a huge NDA when I got this job.” It had been a singular NDA packet the size of her forearm. She had actually run out of ink at some point during the onboarding process because of it (but then had gotten a donut from Agatha’s assistant when he had returned with a handful of pens “just in case”).  </p><p>“Good. Ah, and here. In case you get hungry tonight.” The older alpha handed over a travel cooler. “I can only assume you’ll be around here often now.” Kate frowned in confusion and opened the cooler, and her eyes widened at the sight of so much food packed in. “My eldest can’t cook to save her life, so she comes by regularly to get proper food for herself and my grandson.”  </p><p>“I can’t pay for this, lady!”  </p><p>Lilia’s brow arched as she pulled out a wooden pipe from her jacket and packed a bit of tobacco into the bowl, tamping it down with her knuckle. “Did I ask you for payment?” She raised an eyebrow, a silent warning that she most certainly did <em> not </em>want to repeat herself.  </p><p>Kate dumbly shook her head at the older alpha. She wondered if the woman felt the stars shining from Kate’s eyes hitting her. Lilia radiated the commanding authority of a matriarch, one who was ready to offer protection, quick to provide unsolicited criticism when needed, and always wondering, <em>“did you eat?” </em>She was the sort of alpha Kate used to read about in fairytales as a child.  </p><p>Lilia rapped the hood of the car with her nails once before she said, “Have a good evening, Kate, it was nice meeting you.” Lilia turned on her heel and walked back to the entrance of the restaurant.  </p><p>“Thank you, Ms. Calderu, bye,” Kate belted back. She shot up to poke a good portion of her upper body out of the window and waved after the retreating figure. Then she slid back into the front seat and looked down at the cooler with a small smile, overwhelmed by the emotional whiplash of meeting two alphas on the opposite ends of the spectrum in just a few minutes. One demanded respect by subduing anyone they could overpower, while the other did it with simple acts of kindness.   </p><p>She shook her head and pressed the button for the ignition. Before putting the car in drive, she tripled checked whether there was any traffic coming up behind her, then drove to where she was instructed.    </p><p>Kate parked the car by the back gate and turned off the engine – honestly driving this car was a panic attack waiting to happen. It was so damn expensive, taking premium gas, hand wash and hand dry only. She pulled her phone out from her pocket, entertaining herself with a few more photos of William’s bearded dragon in a pink tutu. The beta scrolled for a bit till she noticed her boss appear out of nowhere from a sidewall.   </p><p>She tossed her phone on the passenger seat and got out, quickly walking over to open the back passenger door. Her brows pinched tight together when she noticed another person walking with the young alpha. Then it hit her – Agatha was wrapped up in the sweet scent of heat; her cheeks flushed bright red when she realized her boss, who she had assumed was an alpha, was the one emitting omega pheromones, heavily covered in her companion’s scent.   </p><p><em>Ohhh</em>... so this was what Ms. Calderu was referring to when she said there was a “<em>delicate situation.</em><em>”</em>  </p><p>Kate observed the two women smiling at each other and holding hands. It was disarming to see her boss appear so happy and relaxed. It made stark contrast from earlier this evening when Agatha had been a beacon of discomfort. The younger Harkness woman had clearly been on the verge of tears more than a handful of times while sitting next to her mother, who had been berating and nitpicking the entire drive from the office to the restaurant. Kate had only just started driving for the woman, but she was able to witness enough during their commutes to gather a picture of Agatha’s character. Her boss consistently exhibited kindness and sincerity towards Kate, although perpetually walking on eggshells.   </p><p>Kate smiled warmly as she noticed the spark in Agatha’s eyes, and it all seemed to be caused by the alpha standing there, staring at the omega like she hung the stars. She opened the door and stood a bit straighter, trying not to make any direct eye contact or sudden movements when she saw the other woman grip her boss’ hand just a little tighter. She didn’t want the alpha to get territorial, what with the amount of pheromones radiating off the duo.   </p><p>Agatha gave her a nod. “Thank you, Kate.” She glanced towards the woman behind her, cheeks flushing a deeper shade of red than the beta had ever seen, “After you drop us off, your services won’t be required for the rest of the night… or this weekend.”  </p><p>Kate nodded, trying very hard not to emote or say something stupid. She was already fired once today; she wasn’t up for a repeat performance. The young driver happened to make eye contact with the alpha who smiled and winked at her.   </p><p>“Or Monday,” the alpha added.   </p><p>Her boss paused for a second at the door. “…Or Monday,” she mumbled, trying to suppress a grin. “Also maybe talk to Billy about hazard pay for having to deal with my mother tonight.”  </p><p>Kate snorted – while this wasn’t the first time she had heard her boss crack a joke, it was <em> definitely </em>the first time hearing her make one at her mother’s expense. Then she coughed, trying to suppress her laugh, when the alpha turned and gave her a knowing look. The beta offered up a cheesy salute and “Sir, yes ma’am,” then quickly slapped her face in embarrassment.   </p><p>The alpha paused from her hovering (assisting Agatha into the car) and turned to Kate, gently patting her arm. “Thank you. This is the address we will be heading to. I appreciate your assistance <em> and </em>discretion with all of this. I’m Rio Vidal.” The woman then extended her hand for a handshake. </p><hr/><p>Agatha slid across the plush leather seat and into the car, taking a moment to lean her head back gently on the cushioned headrest. She closed her eyes and settled in while Rio thanked Kate for opening the door for them, unable to hold back a smile. Indeed, a very different alpha, unlike her mother. </p><p>Rio sat down and nervously smiled at Agatha as the driver closed the door. The spacious interior was decorated in a shade of dark amethyst with black trim, with dual screens on the partition and several compartments. She said with a teasing smile, “This is fancy… Do you also have champagne hidden in the mini fridge? I’ve always wanted to try limo champagne.” </p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Rio, haven’t you heard? My mother only drinks the blood of virgins and eats babies. Though, in her defense – babies <em> are </em>delicious.” She allowed the ghost of a smirk to curve her lips.  </p><p>Rio snorted, a retort ready on her lips, but the car's music suddenly blared through the speakers. </p><p><em> ‘There’s some whores in this house.’ </em> </p><p>“Oh shit, oh my god!” Kate practically yelled, releasing a slight musky scent of distress. She tried to hit the next button on the screen, but just fumbled with the volume dial.  </p><p><em> ‘I said certified freak-’ </em>  </p><p>“Sorry! Oh sweet baby Jesus on a pogo stick, fuck! Please kill me now!” She quickly turned off the music altogether. The car was filled with an awkward silence as Kate looked over her shoulder to peer at her employer, looking like a kicked puppy. She cleared her throat. “I am so, so, so, so very sorry about that ma’am... ma’ams. Ms. Harkness... I uh... hit the wrong... the playlist it just... it started. I totally have fancy... classical music. Soothing... music. Not... oh god... this is the worst-best day ever.” The cabin filled with a gentle scent of sourdough as the beta looked at them mournfully.  </p><p>Rio pressed her lips together, attempting to remain composed while Kate apologized a few more times, and raised the privacy window from the partition with her finger pressed firmly on the button. When it finally closed after what felt like an eternity later, they heard a muffled, “Please don’t fire me again” from the driver.  </p><p>Rio exchanged glances with Agatha and laughed. “I like her.”  </p><p>Agatha snorted, covering her mouth with her hand. “Me too… My mother tried to fire her earlier today. I didn’t think she’d overheard that.”  </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, taken aback. “I could offer her a job with Vidal Corp?”  </p><p>Agatha shook her head and responded with a sly smile, “That won’t be necessary. She is not an employee of Harkness Industries. I hired her as my personal driver. I needed someone I could trust outside of my mother’s sphere of influence. My mother can be..." she started, then sighed in frustration, running her hands through her hair. There was truly no way to accurately summarize her complex relationship with her mother.   </p><p>Evanora Harkness was her mother – her sire. She loved her mother in some way, she supposed, but it didn’t outweigh the pain and suffering she regularly endured with the alpha.   </p><p>Shortly after their departure, she closed her eyes in an attempt to relax. Then she turned her head to the side and looked out the window. The vibrant city lights blurred into streaks of colors, illuminating the night with flashes of neon signs, streetlights, and headlights. She could hear the faint hum of the engine, the sound of Rio’s breathing, the soft friction of fabric rubbing together as the alpha bounced her leg, the slight vibration beneath her feet as they moved steadily through the night. Maybe it was worth the extravagance of an overly expensive car to have the outside world be silent (if only just for a little while). </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, appreciating the peace and near serenity that seemed to envelop them. The external calm was a stark contrast to the internal turmoil she was experiencing. Sitting in this car felt tortuous; although there were only a few inches separating them, Rio's position at the opposite end by the window made the distance seem transcontinental. </p><p>She was acutely aware of her surroundings, as her heat made her senses exceptionally sharp. The leather seat stuck to her sweaty legs – a sensation she absolutely abhorred. Rio’s jacket remained draped over her shoulders – while it provided considerable comfort when outdoors during a cool evening, it was now overwhelming. The combination of being enveloped in the alpha’s scent and being so near to her but not having Rio touching her was dizzying. Her skin burned and her throat was dry.   </p><p>After the initial adrenaline wore off from being caught literally rolling around in the bushes, the embarrassment had been enough to quell the demand between her legs. But now it was back. Aching. Throbbing – so fucking painfully. Agatha was certain she’d never had a heat this intense before. It had always been more of an annoyance, just a pressing need to get off – easily sated with other omegas (usually Wanda).  </p><p>Now she had urgency clawing at the very fiber of her being, pushing her to be with this woman beside her. She pressed her lips together as tight as she could, trying to silence her whimper. She squeezed her legs together to find some relief and could feel herself leaking through her underwear. There most definitely was a wet spot on her dress – if not from her current state, then from their romp in the bushes.  </p><p>Thank the gods for leather cleaner and car detailers.  </p><p>She bit back a groan. Even as a <em> teenager </em>she hadn’t acted this irrationally. (Not that she had been allowed to; Agatha could only imagine the retribution her mother would have extracted from her flesh if she had acted like this as a minor.)  </p><p>Agatha stole a glance towards Rio, who was gazing out of the window with such an intense stare she was sure the other woman would melt the glass separating them from the outside world. Her breathing appeared slow and controlled, but her jaw was tense, and a vein on her temple bulged from strain. Her rut must be setting in; she looked uncomfortable with a faint sheen of sweat glistening and sliding down her temple. Agatha wanted to lick it and taste the salt on the alpha’s skin. Rio’s fists were clenched tight in her lap, trembling with the effort of keeping them there. The omega licked her bottom lip as she caught sight of the bulge straining against Rio’s trousers – she forced her eyes to move away before she ended up pouncing on the other woman. Agatha slowly traced a visual path back up Rio’s body, watching the other woman’s throat move as she swallowed, wondering what the alpha was thinking about. Was she having a <em>difficult</em> time as well? </p><p>Yes. Rio was fucking dying.  </p><p>Being so utterly ensconced in the scent of Agatha’s heat while confined in such a small space – it was taking everything in Rio’s power not to reach over and touch her. She was suffocating – Agatha’s pheromones were rich and sweet, fucking irresistible, making her alpha thrash wildly. The air was potent enough to make her salivate. The omega’s heat was calling to her in ways she had no frame of reference for, making her feel lightheaded, euphoric, and extremely possessive. Her heart thundered in her chest and her palms were sweaty as the fever truly started setting in. Her dick was hard, painfully throbbing against the fabric of her slacks – she wanted nothing more than to rut into the omega next to her. </p><p>Repeatedly. </p><p>Possessively. </p><p>She wanted to stake her claim.  </p><p>With every second that passed, Rio was losing her mind. Her normally ironclad control over the alpha raging inside was slipping. The alpha voice demanded that she take what belonged to them—and she couldn’t exactly disagree. She hadn’t rutted with a partner in years, and the way she craved Agatha was nothing like she’d ever felt with another partner. It was a pull, a drive, a need.  </p><p>To taste the sounds of her moans on her tongue. To rip the screams from her throat. To sink her teeth into her flesh. To feel her body writhing beneath her. She wanted to absolutely devour the other woman. She wanted to take and take and take until there was nothing left. Rio wanted every single inch of her – she wanted to rut into her so deeply that neither knew where one began and the other ended. </p><p>Rio desperately tried to think of something to distract herself, anything to keep her calm until they got to a safe place with no interruptions, because the ravenous hunger she was feeling would not be satisfied until it dominated the woman sitting near her.  </p><p>As long as they kept their distance, she would be fine. </p><p>The car hit a pothole and she heard a muffled <em> sorry </em>from the driver on the other side of the privacy barrier.  </p><p>Rio instinctively steadied herself on the middle seat while Agatha took the opportunity to immediately grab her left hand, needing to feel Rio’s skin against her own.  </p><p>The alpha’s head whipped around at the touch, and she swallowed hard as she watched Agatha slowly trace the veins on the back of her hand with the tips of her fingers before interlocking their hands together. Agatha pulled the joined hands towards her face, nuzzling Rio's warm skin, then kissed her wrist gently. She smiled when the alpha hummed her approval, chest rumbling.   </p><p>The younger woman glanced over to the CEO. Her eyes burned with desire and just a touch of mischief, hand-in-hand with the possessive longing that thrummed to life inside of her chest. Her skin prickled and her cheeks burned.   </p><p>Rio wanted her – the intensity of her stare took Agatha's breath away and, simultaneously, filled her with purpose.  </p><p>If Rio would not take, then Agatha would just have to make an offering the alpha couldn’t refuse.  </p><p>Agatha adjusted their hands on her lap, separating their fingers. She was aware of Rio's intense gaze as she placed the alpha's hand on her thigh, covering it with her own.   </p><p>Rio emitted a low growl that sent a shudder of pleasure rolling down Agatha's spine. "What are you doing?"  </p><p>“Isn’t it obvious?” Agatha applied just a little more pressure to the top of Rio’s hand, smiling when the other woman gripped the meat of her thigh reflexively.  </p><p>Rio hesitated before breathing out a soft, “Can I come closer?” </p><p>Agatha just barely managed a shaky, “<em> Yes, please.” </em>  </p><p>Rio moved her left hand from her thigh to rest on the back of Agatha's neck, feeling the warmth of her skin, and gently pressed against it to soothe the tension. She shifted around enough that she could move her right-hand to rest on the omega's thigh, her index and middle fingers playing with the hem of her dress. The fabric was soft against her fingertips as she pushed it up just slightly, rewarding herself with more of Agatha’s perfectly smooth, creamy skin. </p><p>She briefly wondered what the other woman’s skincare routine was to make it this gods-be-damned soft. </p><p>The hand at the base of Agatha’s neck slid up to her nape, nails gently scratching her scalp, making the omega purr from the touch. Rio made a mental note of the way Agatha seemed to come undone at the simple touch.  </p><p>Rio watched her for a moment. The flashes of light danced across her gorgeous face, giving Rio brief glimpses of her features. How her eyes rolled back before slipping shut. Her lips parted slightly as she exhaled with a smile. Her throat vibrating as she purred, sending out waves of sweet calming delicious pheromones.  </p><p>She wanted to bask in the younger woman's presence and scent for eternity.  </p><p>She knew that in another universe she would bring entire nations to their knees, just for a chance to be in Agatha Harkness’ vicinity. </p><p>Rio knew without a shadow of a doubt that the heiress didn't even realize just how perfect she was. This perfect omega hiding in plain sight – Rio knew deep in her bones that this woman was made just for her. The alpha was flooded with the urge to break every single rule for Agatha, and by the smell of <em> her </em>… </p><p>Agatha let out a low guttural moan when Rio unexpectedly tightened her grip on her hair. As she pulled Agatha closer towards her, the omega's ragged breathing touched her skin. Agatha’s breath hitched as she looked at Rio — really and truly looked at Rio, who was staring at her as though she hadn’t eaten in weeks. Breathless anticipation filled her with a thrilling mixture of fear and elation.  </p><p><em> Fuck, </em> she didn’t know how much she wanted this – how much she craved the alpha. She was desperate for the other woman to take her, to exert her dominance. Agatha knew she was playing a dangerous game with Rio, but she couldn’t deny the hold the alpha had on her.  </p><p>Rio leaned in close and whispered in her ear, “Are you that desperate for me?” She licked the shell of her ear before biting down gently on the lobe.   </p><p>“Fuck <em> yes, </em>” the omega choked out. “More than you can imagine.” She made a conscious effort to push out a wave of desire, knowing full-well that Rio’s alpha nature would find it irresistible.   </p><p>She was proven right when the other woman let loose a low, rumbling growl. </p><p>Rio moved closer, teeth bared, maintaining only a hair's breadth of distance. Agatha's gaze shifted from Rio's lips to her eyes and back again, expressing a sense of urgency when she attempted to bridge the gap between them, but Rio's firm hold of her hair prevented any movement. She truly didn’t even know she liked her hair being pulled in such a way. When she had been younger and her mother kinder, she had whispered things like, “if a woman has long hair, it is praise unto her...” while brushing out and braiding Agatha’s hair. But now? Now all Agatha wanted was for Rio to pull harder; she wanted the alpha to show her more.  </p><p>She wanted her to <em> take</em>, damn it. And she was willing to give everything in return. The omega emitted a low growl, followed by a whine, her pupils dilated with a burning desire. </p><p>Those baby blues rolled back when Rio flicked her tongue from her chin to her bottom lip, nipping a little rougher than she normally would, urged on by the sounds Agatha was making.  </p><p>“You <em> fucking </em>tease,” the younger woman snarled. Her omega was clawing inside, thrashing for more. </p><p>The alpha smirked at Agatha's attempted aggression, pleased that she was able to bring out such desperation from within the woman. Rio’s hand finally moved – the tips of her fingers slid beneath the dress, blunt nails dragging slowly up and down Agatha’s bare thigh, squeezing her flesh. The omega squirmed under her touch. Soft needy whimpers escaped as those fingers went higher – her eyes closed.   </p><p>So close. </p><p>Rio was so close. </p><p>Agatha spread her legs a little wider, earning her a delighted hum from the alpha. Her eyes fluttered open when Rio stopped moving – blue locking with the alpha's dark brown eyes.  </p><p>The gaze was soft, asking silently for permission. Agatha's chest was rising and falling, her heart pounded wildly against her ribs, her veins burned for any pressure, any contact at all, where she ached the most. </p><p>“Please,” she begged, just barely keeping herself from thrusting up her hips.  </p><p>The air between them was charged and thick with their mixing scent. Rio’s chest rumbled, the vibrations reverberating down her spine and setting Agatha's skin on fire. The omega whimpered out a soft<em>, “Oh”</em> the moment the older woman’s fingertips brushed over her clit.  </p><p>Rio moved her middle and ring finger in small circles. “You’re so fucking wet…” she groaned, as she continued her slow pace, coordinating between tight circles and a slow back and forth movement over the fabric of her omega's soaked panties. She growled low and deep in her throat at the sounds her simple motions were making, it was so lewd.  </p><p>“Are you going to be a good omega for me? Are you going to give me what I want? Are you going to come for me, Agatha?” the alpha coaxed, voice rough with need as she moved the panties to the side, slipping between Agatha's lips and trapping the aroused bud between her fingers, pressing them together.  </p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, <em>G</em><em>ods</em>, to be called a <em> good omega </em> never sounded so <b> <em> fucking </em> </b> sexy. Rio was driving her wild and she wasn’t even inside of her. She wanted to scream, she wanted to jump out of her skin, she wanted to kiss Rio so badly, but the alpha tugged her hair more firmly, pulling her head back and exposing her neck. A filthy moan escaped her when Rio licked up the center of her throat. </p><p>Rio continued stroking her tender flesh at a painfully slow pace, causing sparks of charged particles to arc to her every nerve ending. Her skin, too, was thrumming with electrical current, her muscles twitching.  </p><p>Then suddenly Rio stopped.  </p><p>Agatha let loose a snarl, lips pulling back, eyes snapping open with thunderous fury. </p><p>The frustration left her the instant the alpha’s fingers started moving again, though – applying more pressure, moving her fingers in tighter circles. “Don’t look away from me,” Rio commanded softly. “Don’t close your eyes. I want to see you come undone.”  </p><p>The hand in Agatha's hair flexed, drawing another gasp of pleasure from her even when the grip became painful. Her eyes rolled backwards on reflex, but she quickly refocused them on the woman gazing at her like she hung the very stars.  </p><p>“That’s a <em> good girl</em>.” Rio hummed, pleased with Agatha's obedience. </p><p>Agatha’s orgasm struck her like a bolt of lightning – an overwhelming surge of pleasure washed over her body.  Her hips bucked forward, driving Rio’s drenched fingers further into her folds, so very close to her throbbing core. Rio’s fingertips teased at her opening and the omega let out a roaring cry only to have it cut off by the alpha as Rio brought their lips together, swallowing her moans and cries with a passionate kiss. It was raw, all tongues and teeth. </p><p>If this was the sin of the flesh her mother had warned her against – no, Agatha slapped that thought away, letting herself be present in the moment.  </p><p>She was drowning in the intensity of Rio’s kiss – the CEO kissed her like she held the key to the well holding the waters of life. Rio kissed her like she needed her very soul to live.  </p><p>It amplified the lingering shivers of her climax and all she wanted was more – everything. She wanted every drop of pleasure that the other woman was willing to give.  </p><p>Feeling the need for more oxygen, Rio finally pulled their lips apart. Agatha’s eyes were dazed and unfocused; Rio’s eyes traveled down, watching the omega’s chest heave with the effort required to breathe. </p><p>She looked wrecked in the most beautiful of ways; a piece of art living art that Rio needed to possess. </p><p>Rio reluctantly moved her hand from between Agatha’s thighs, making sure to brush through her folds once more, earning a small, shuddering gasp from the beauty next to her. She smirked when she saw that her fingers were dripping with the younger woman’s release. The omega’s glazed eyes were fixed on Rio’s glistening hand, wetting her lower lip with her tongue when the alpha moved her fingers to her lips. She frowned when Rio paused, immediately consumed with anxiety. Did she not like the way she… </p><p>Rio's fingers hovered over Agatha’s parted lips.  </p><p>“Suck.” The alpha commanded, low and soft but leaving no room for disobedience. </p><p>The omega opened her mouth and eagerly took in those wet fingers. She sucked ravenously, moaning around the taste of herself.   </p><p>Rio watched through hooded eyelids; her alpha had well and truly perished, and she would surely follow with the way Agatha worked to clean her fingers.   </p><p>Agatha pulled back eventually, releasing the fingers with an obscenely wet <em> pop. </em> “Don’t you want to taste me?” the omega asked, the picture of innocence as she batted her lashes and suppressed a salacious smirk. </p><p>Rio growled, yanking her head forward and reveling in the low, tortured moan she drew from Agatha. “I prefer to taste it from your lips.” </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, prepared for another searing kiss from Rio, but yelped when the alpha released her hold on her hair to quickly grab her by her thighs, swiftly twisting and yanking her whole body towards her.  </p><p>When Agatha opened her eyes, the burning dark pupils staring back at her took her breath away. Rio was looking at her with an all-consuming hunger. </p><p>The alpha slid her hands up Agatha's trembling thighs possessively, forcing her dress up, bunching it at her waist. Rio moved with confident precision as she slid off the leather seat, kneeling before the omega in front of her. She leaned down, peppering Agatha’s thigh with soft kisses as her hands moved to capture Agatha’s calves in a tight hold before she lifted them over her shoulders, causing Agatha to scoot even further forward on the seat.  </p><p>The sight before her was nothing short of heavenly and Rio was unable to hold back her groan of delight when she took a deep breath in. “You smell so fucking good.” Rio bit her lower lip hard; Agatha's purple, lacy underwear was utterly soaked through. She traced the intricate vines and flowers woven into the fabric with her eyes before leaning in, dragging the tip of her tongue against the textured fabric. Agatha shuddered above her and that was all she needed before she shot forward, burying her face against the wet cloth. Agatha choked back a moan when Rio sucked the moisture from her drenched underwear, then pulled the sodden garment to the side again with warm fingertips.  </p><p>Agatha wailed when Rio plunged her tongue into her sopping, wet core without hesitation, her thighs clamping hard around Rio’s head. The alpha moaned at the sweet taste and dragged her tongue from the omega’s clenching hole up to her twitching clit then back down, repeating the motion. Another long lick, dipping her tongue as far as she could into her heat, slurping the wetness on her puffy lips. <em>“Fuck”</em> Rio growled into her cunt, “you taste even better.”  </p><p>Rio feasted like it was her last meal on earth, her face drenched, juices smeared on her nose, cheeks and chin. It was pure heaven between Agatha’s legs.  </p><p>The omega braced one hand above her head against the door and the other against the back of Rio's head, pulling her as close as she possibly could. Agatha rolled her hips against the alpha’s skilled tongue, neck tense and back arched. She was completely lost to the feelings the woman was stirring within her. Rio flicked her clit mercilessly with her tongue, alternating between periods of sucking and biting. The alpha’s mouth was utterly overwhelming her previous concept of ecstasy and was rebuilding it with Rio at the center.  </p><p>Rio pulled a low guttural howl from the omega when she pressed two fingers knuckle deep into her slick heat. She hummed in approval as Agatha’s heels dug into her back, and smirked when that caused another gush of arousal to leak from the goddess she was kneeling before. The warm, velvety walls clenched around her digits; she curled her fingers upwards to hit that sweet spot that made Agatha see stars. The alpha wrapped her lips around Agatha’s swollen clit and wiggled her fingers on her inner ridge, sending waves of pleasure roaring through her with every stroke, making her walls ripple and pulsate. </p><p>“Oh God, Rio,” Agatha cried out, tears gathering in the corners of her eyes. Her hips rocked, desperate to keep pace with Rio as she pumped in and out of her. The hand on Rio’s head clutched reflexively, fingers burying themselves in the alpha’s hair, tugging her closer with a needy whine. She filled the car with her moans as her impending climax built higher and higher thanks to the alpha’s laser-focus. She was so wound up she didn’t care about the crude noises Rio was pulling out of her. The moment Rio scraped her teeth on her clit, Agatha went careening over the edge — her muscles contracting, her body snapped forward, cumming hard and fast, her heel tip digging hard into Rio’s back. The CEO knew without a shadow of a doubt that she would in fact have well-earned bruises (ones she might even try to show off later).  </p><p>Blue eyes shut tight, and Agatha’s mouth hung open in another silent scream as Rio continued licking. She pulled her fingers out from her, using her hands to brace against thighs bracketing her ears. Rio moaned as she eagerly lapped at the omega before her – unwilling to lose a single drop.  </p><p>“Rio,<em> please, </em>” Agatha whimpered, body still taut like a bowstring as she tried to tug Rio’s head back. The attempt was moot, given her legs wrapped around Rio’s head. The alpha slowed down, taking a few longer, languorous swipes before gently helping Agatha get her legs back on the car seat. She was thankful that this didn’t mean pulling away from the treat before her.  </p><p>Rio couldn’t help a few more kitten licks before she pulled back from Agatha’s delicious cunt and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. She pressed a few tender kisses to one of the omega’s trembling thighs before she closed her eyes, tilting her head back to savor the taste on her tongue, and panting like she had drunk from the finest spring. Her lips parted in a tipsy smile when she dropped her head forward again and opened her eyes, taking in her disheveled lover’s appearance. The alpha beamed with pride as she watched the omega slump back down on the seat; her right arm covered her eyes, her legs splayed open, body trembling with aftershocks.  </p><p>The CEO shifted back a bit, keeping her movements gentle as she pulled the other woman’s dress back down before pulling herself back up onto the soft, leather seat. She reached over and maneuvered the omega, pulling her body so she could be held against her chest, wrapping her arm around her.  </p><p>“That was…” The omega panted breathlessly, nuzzling into Rio’s neck, purring at such a wonderful frequency that made Rio’s alpha practically <em> preen</em>. </p><p>Rio chuckled and pulled Agatha tighter against her, pressing her lips to her sweaty temple. “I’m just getting started.” It was a promise – a vow, even. </p><p>Her dark eyes caught sight of Agatha’s heaving chest, and her mouth went dry – she wanted nothing more in that moment than to strip the younger woman bare and to devour her all over again. </p><p>Agatha growled, shocking Rio when she moved her head and pulled Rio into another kiss. She surged up and shifted her body to straddle Rio’s lap with a low, desperate whimper. “Fuck, what is wrong with me?” she groaned before plunging her tongue into Rio’s mouth, exploring the space while a primal need raged inside her, wanting to taste every bit of the other woman. “I can’t keep my hands off of you.” She brought her hands up to slide into Rio’s hair, rocking her hips with a moan at the slightest brush against the bulge straining to be freed from Rio’s pants. </p><p>Overwhelmed by the onslaught of pheromones that made her brain hazy and the intensity of the omega’s mouth that made her lips tingle, Rio broke the desperate kiss. “I’ve never wanted someone like this, Agatha. Never needed someone like I need you.” The alpha groaned, feeling Agatha grind harder down on her bulge with more urgency.  </p><p>Rio brought her hands up to rest against Agatha’s backside. She was so fucking hard that it <em> hurt. </em> “I... fuck... need you,” Rio moaned, feeling completely lost in the heat of the omega’s desire. She fought a battle with herself – convincing one of her hands to move from where it was gripping Agatha’s ass tightly and moved to undo her belt.  </p><p>So close and they would finally find relief together; she had a primal and desperate need to sheath herself inside Agatha’s slick heat. Rio had just managed to undo her belt when the tires screeched as the car stopped abruptly – sending the woman in her lap tumbling backwards onto the floor with a soft grunt. </p><p>The car horn blared. “Fuck you, asshole!” Kate yelled from up front. “I’m so sorry, Ms. Harkness! Please don’t fire me!” </p><p>Agatha looked at Rio with wide eyes before she burst into a fit of hysterical laughter. "That's better than getting splashed with water." </p><p>Rio joined in on the laughter once she realized the other woman wasn’t hurt. “Are you okay?” she asked through a fit of giggles. Reaching out to help Agatha get up from the car floor to sit beside her, she placed her hand on the omega’s thigh. </p><p>“I’m okay. Hurt my pride more than anything… from the bushes and now this…maybe my ass…” She grinned, hugging the alpha’s arm and pressing her nose to Rio’s shoulder.  </p><p>The older woman turned her head and breathed in the soothing scent of lavender from Agatha’s hair. “I could kiss it better?” she teased, unable to resist wiggling her eyebrows. </p><p>“As tempting as that is… there’s no way I can handle any more interruptions. I also don’t know how much more embarrassment I can take…” She laughed softly, closing her eyes and trying to calm her racing heart.  </p><p>It wasn’t long before the car came to a far smoother stop and Agatha pressed her nose once more against Rio’s neck, inhaling deeply. She closed her eyes for a few moments before releasing her hold from the alpha’s arm and set to the task of making herself appear a bit more appropriate. Rio couldn’t help but watch in awe as Agatha went from looking disheveled to composed in less than a minute, like donning on a well-practiced mask.  </p><p>The alpha shook herself and ran her fingers through her hair before adjusting her shirt and refastening her belt once more. Rio had never been more thankful for being convinced to buy a hole-free belt – all she had to do was tug, and voila, gone was the possibility of her pants dropping around her ankles. </p><p>At least it was dark out. The security guard to her building was discreet in any case. Harold knew she valued her privacy, and he wouldn’t comment on it (or spread anything on social media). </p><p>Agatha’s hand slipped into hers once more when they heard Kate exit the vehicle and shuffle around to the side Rio was on. They both watched in amusement as the young beta paced a few times in front of the passenger window, obviously trying to give them a bit more time to pull themselves together. </p><p>“She’s a good kid.” Rio tapped her knuckles on the glass and laughed when Kate visibly jumped, not prepared for the sound. </p><p>They watched in continued amusement as Kate ran her hands nervously down the front of her suit jacket. “Last time she opened the door, it was for my mother. Be nice,” Agatha warned, though she guessed it was unnecessary.   </p><p>Kate opened the door, nodding her head politely to them with a strained smile. Her ears were bright red and the anxiety rolled off her in waves. “Sorry...” she mumbled. (Nobody was sure about what, exactly, she was apologizing for. If anyone needed to apologize it was them. After this trial by fire, the young driver deserved a hefty bonus.) </p><p>Rio slipped from the car, turning to offer her hand to Agatha who took it and let Rio assist her from the vehicle.  </p><p>“Thanks,” she whispered, unable to keep the smile at bay when Rio refused to let go of her hand and used her free one to adjust the skirt of Agatha's dress.  </p><p>Rio opened her mouth to tell Agatha it was no problem, only to be cut off by a <em> very </em>familiar voice coming from the building entrance. “Oh! Hey! That’s my boss! Hey, Rio! Your sister came and picked Nicky up. Alice said you knew…” </p><p>A gasp ripped through the air and Agatha instantly went rigid, blue eyes snapping from Kate to the newcomers.  </p><p>“Agatha?!” </p><p>“Oh no,” Agatha muttered, bringing her hand up to her face. The sour scent of embarrassment cut through the night air.  </p><p>Rio moved in front of Agatha unconsciously, glowering at the omega practically skipping towards them with an amused Eddie in tow. The gangly male looked like he was vibrating, ready to combust into rainbow confetti as he came to a stop in front of the trio.  </p><p>“Please forward all my calls,” Agatha mumbled from behind Rio, dropping her forehead to rest on the alpha’s shoulder.   </p><p>“You got it, boss lady! How long do you want me to put your out of office—wait...” He sniffed the air, eyes widening as a knowing grin took over his face. “Ohhhhhhhhhh.”  </p><p>“Until Tuesday.” Rio smirked, feeling more at ease now that she realized this twink of an omega wasn’t a threat. How serendipitous that their assistants were dating one another; maybe they were always meant to cross paths? Rio smiled, thinking to herself.  </p><p>William let out a dramatic gasp, pressing his hand on his chest. “Get it, Agatha!” He snapped his fingers in a z-motion. “It’s about time you got some di-"  </p><p>“TEEN!” Agatha boomed, pressing her face further into Rio’s back.  </p><p>Eddie rolled his eyes, earning a laugh from his own boss. “I’ll enter yours too?” Rio nodded in confirmation.  </p><p>“Right. So. Heat Leave until Tuesday. I’ll make sure it all gets entered and squared away.” He leaned forward conspiratorially, wiggling his eyebrows in an overly enthusiastic way. “Do you need me to get you knot condoms? Maybe a few boxes of Pup Prevention? I know you’re clean of any ST-”  </p><p>A wave of bitter annoyance flared up as Agatha moved around the alpha, her chest puffing up, appearing near feral as her lips pulled back a bit, baring her teeth. “Dégage!” she snarled, low and deep in her throat, growling at the other omega who had clearly touched a <em> very </em>raw nerve.   </p><p>“Okay - <em> Cheetah girl</em>, maybe some concealer? I left mine in my other bag.” He offered quips unfazed by the other omega’s fury, tapping the hickey on his boss’ neck.    </p><p>Agatha growled again stepping forward and sending out another wave of irritation. Rio pressed her tongue to her cheek, suppressing her knee-jerk need to growl at the twink upsetting the other woman, but she also couldn’t help but feel more than a little turned on all over again by the omega’s ferocity.   </p><p>“Have a good night, you three,” Rio muttered dismissively, pumping out a wave of her own pheromones to calm her omega. She smiled to see Agatha’s shoulders relax and reached for her hand. Agatha huffed a bit of air grumpily, eyeing the lock of hair that flew up a bit from her exhalation before taking Rio’s hand in her own. Rio took a step forward, barely resisting the urge to tug the other woman along, far from the others.   </p><p>Rio needed to get Agatha out of there. There was too much unwanted attention on the omega for too long while her heat was settling in, which could be dangerous for everyone. Rio yanked open the door and the others watched in amusement as they disappeared into the building.  </p><hr/><p>“Billy...” Eddie groaned, rubbing his face with one hand, the other wrapped around his boyfriend’s slim waist.</p><p>Billy lit up like a kid in a candy shop, bouncing on his heels. “Why does this feel like the parent trap we didn’t even know we needed?” </p><p>Eddie kept his hand on his face, sighing heavily as he pressed his fingertips into his eyes. “I never wanted to see Rio with a boner. Ever. I could have lived my whole life without that.” He groaned. </p><p>“I think it’s cute.” Billy beamed, bumping his shoulder against the beta holding his hand. “I ship them already.” He turned serious at the flip of a switch. “Oh! Text your boss and tell her that Agatha likes chocolate covered almonds during her heat. For snacks.” </p><p>It was Kate who cut in, letting the passenger door swing shut. “I don’t think there’s gonna be much eating...” she muttered. </p><p>Billy used the distraction to steal his boyfriend’s phone, fingers flying across the screen as he typed out a message. “Oh god! No! Give that back!” Eddie snatched the phone away, fumbling with it only to have it fall from his grasp. “No!” How the hell was he going to explain to Rio that he had managed to destroy his work-phone minutes after seeing her with her partner? She wouldn’t even be able to sign off on a replacement for at least— </p><p>Eddie’s phone appeared in front of him, and he looked up, smiling thankfully at Kate as she held the device up. “Thank you... so much! You’re a life saver.” He looked down, inspecting the device for damage only to see the message Billy had sent Rio.  </p><p><b> Eddie: </b> Hi! This is Billy. William Kaplan, Agatha’s most amazing and wonderful assistant. Agatha likes chocolate covered almonds during her heats, as snacks. I’ve ordered them for delivery tomorrow. Here’s a list of the cuisines she likes to have when she’s allowed the option or when I’m able to sneak them in through in my work bag. My birthday is— </p><p>Eddie blinked a few times, staring at the screen. “Seriously? How the hell did you type all that so fast?!” </p><p>Billy ignored him, turning his full attention to Kate – hope radiating off of him. “Any chance we can catch a ride home? I’ve never gotten to ride in the <em> Harkness-mobile</em>.”  </p><p>“Harkness-mobile?” Eddie mouthed, his eyebrows flying up in confusion as he watched Billy reach for the door handle only to have his hand smacked away by Kate. “Hey! Watch it.” He stepped forward protectively, glowering at the other beta. </p><p>William cradled his hand dramatically. “Ow! Jeeze!” He pouted, looking over to the driver. </p><p>Kate shrugged her shoulders, grimacing a bit. “You do <em> not </em>wanna get back there. Trust me. I need to like... detail it and fumigate and possibly hire an exorcist and even then, I still don’t think it’ll be the same. Good thing it’s not Ms. Harkness’ normal vehicle. I think this one is actually Mrs. Harkness’ actually, which given how she acted today… them desecrating the backseat felt kinda like poetic justice.” </p><p>The omega took an immediate step back from the vehicle, nearly tripping over the sidewalk; Eddie caught him with ease, helping to get him standing up-straight again. “We’ll call an Uber, I think. Or Lyft. Or whatever is cheapest right now...” he prattled off quickly.  </p><p>“Oh, I see how it is. I had to see Rio’s McStiffy but you won’t even let your nose get a whiff of your boss’ need to breed or evidence of her lady juices?” Eddie asked, laughing when Billy looked even more traumatized at the idea that his boss had been having <em> sex </em>in that car. </p><p>Kate shifted from one foot to the other, glancing at the duo. “I’m gonna... head out. Get the car detailed and get home. If I’m off until Tuesday… I’ve got some down-time to enjoy and no-job hunting to worry about for once. Netflix binge-watch for me,” she declared, and turned to walk away.</p><p>Billy perked up immediately. Before Eddie could stop him, he was moving forward, taking Kate’s hands in his own. “That’s so boring. Come out for drinks with us tomorrow! If our boss and Eddie’s boss are busy getting <em> knotty</em>, we’re gonna be hanging out a whole lot more together!” </p><p>Kate cast a desperate glance towards Eddie, trying to free herself from Billy’s grip. “Hanging out is a strong turn of phrase for working together.” </p><p>Billy nodded eagerly. “Definitely more like hanging out!”  </p><p>“Oh! Look! Billy! Our Uber is here.” Eddie pointed, pulling Billy towards the approaching vehicle. “Have a great weekend, Kate! It was nice to meet you.” </p><p>“I’ll text you the details tomorrow!” Billy said, wiggling his fingers at the driver. She waved and watched as the omega was pulled by the beta to get into the backseat of their ride.  </p><p>“Ugh... I’m so gonna have to roll the windows down to air this out on the way there.” Kate glanced at the high-rise building where her boss had entered before heading to the driver's side and bumping her head as she got in.   </p><p>“Ow, fuck.” Rubbing her head she punched in the address to the 24/7 detailing place she preferred to go to – it was only <em> mildly </em>shady, and the big guy who ran it made sure nobody bothered her. She made a mental note to stop by tomorrow with snacks from the new gas station that opened near her apartment across town. Alexei always enjoyed getting new, tasty American treats that he had never had the pleasure of eating before. Somehow, she always managed to know which ones he liked (though she was fairly certain that he just enjoyed it when she brought him treats because she was thinking of the burly old alpha). </p><p>It had been quite the night.</p>

<p>The front door closed, echoing softly through the penthouse. The last obstacle to this unexpected series of events was now over; they were now truly and finally alone. It took a lot for Agatha not do a dorky little dance — no more interruptions (she hoped). </p><p>Rio placed her keys and wallet on the side table in the entryway, then helped remove the jacket from Agatha's shoulders, hanging it on the coat rack. </p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha smiled as she walked further into the CEO’s home, her heels making a clicking sound on the hardwood floor.  </p><p>Doubt crept in. </p><p>What was she even doing here? Her heat wasn’t allowing her (or Rio, for that matter) to think clearly. All she wanted to do from the moment she met the woman was to be alone with her – to kiss her, to <em> mount </em> her — and now here she was. Her cheeks burned at the memory of that kiss; how gentle it had been and then how quickly everything escalated.  </p><p>She had never, not even in her youth, lost control so horribly that she ended up rolling around in the bushes. </p><p>Her body felt like it was shifting into overdrive when she thought back to the earth-shattering orgasm she received in the car.  </p><p>Clearly, something undeniable was happening between them, like stars colliding under gravity’s pull. She felt powerless to stop it and in truth, she didn’t want to. Rio stirred something in her, a piece of her she thought was forgotten.  </p><p>That feeling of being seen – of being cared for, of being wanted – treasured even? </p><p>She hadn’t felt that in so long. Not since – </p><p>Agatha shook away the thoughts and tried to ground herself in the present. She clenched her fist a few times, focusing on the feeling, like Jen had taught her. Right now, she was standing in the beautiful alpha’s home, hoping to ride out her heat and Rio’s rut – together.  </p><p>The thought alone made her insides clench.  </p><p>The spacious foyer was adorned with intricate details on muted green walls, delicate vines hand painted in a slightly darker shade; the ceilings were high with a crystal chandelier hanging from the vaulted ceiling, casting sparkling fractals of warm light on the walls. Her heart raced, wondering what Rio had in mind. Each step felt heavy with anticipation, and the scent of polished wood and fresh flowers combined with the scent of Rio was almost dizzyingly overwhelming.  </p><p>“Please make yourself at home,” Rio said. “Would you like something to eat? Are you thirsty?” she asked as she walked into the kitchen, unbuttoning the top few buttons of her shirt and relaxing in the privacy.  </p><p>Agatha’s stomach growled at the mention of food – she barely had a bite to eat all evening and when her heat started, the idea of actual sustenance was the last thing she craved. “I am a bit thirsty,” Agatha responded, ignoring the hunger pains as she walked over to one of the bookshelves, her fingers tracing along the spines of the books.  </p><p>“Would you like some wine?” Rio came up behind Agatha, hands coming to rest against Agatha’s upper arms. </p><p>“Yes, please, whatever red you have.” She smiled softly when Rio’s thumbs caressed spots where her mother had so callously grabbed her earlier that evening, soothing without even knowing. </p><p>Rio pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s shoulder, nuzzling the spot with a sound of affirmation. “I’ll be right back.” </p><p>Agatha took in the space with more attention once the alpha left her. Rio’s home was the picture of what she had imagined a home to be when she was younger. The CEO was wealthy, but nothing about her home seemed to flaunt that fact (other than Agatha knowing the going rate for penthouses). There were plants everywhere, and framed photos and artwork that were clearly made by a child’s dedicated hand. Everything in the home had character and heart and love. It was <em> lived </em> in, nowhere near like the estate she grew up in with her mother.  </p><p>She caught sight of a well-used skateboard lying on a table with the wheels off – it looked like someone was in the process of upgrading it. A videogame controller sat next to the tools along with a leftover juice box and an open comic of X-Men. A pair of worn sneakers were kicked off and discarded in the corner. Agatha couldn’t keep a smile at bay; she found it all absolutely charming.  </p><p>This wasn’t a place where the alpha brought random omegas on a Friday night. This was Rio’s home, the space that she built with and shared with her son. The thought of its significance made her heart flutter.  </p><p>The younger woman walked over to a photo on the wall of Rio and a young boy, with matching sugar-skull face paint. The alpha had her arms wrapped tight around the boy and was very clearly attempting to plaster his neatly painted face with kisses, a mother’s love held back by the child’s hands. They were both laughing in the photo and Agatha couldn’t resist brushing her index finger against the smooth frame. “Is this your son Nicky?” Agatha asked over her shoulder, smiling adoringly at their identical gap-toothed smiles.  </p><p>“It is, he was 7 then,” Rio responded. “We went to a Día de los Muertos celebration because he really, really wanted to go. Even though I told him we don’t really do that... but he was adamant. Wanted the sugar skulls and everything. I think he ate his weight <em> and </em>mine in churros that day.” She walked over balancing two glasses of wine in one hand and carrying a plate of pizza bagel bites in the other.  </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened comically, and she gave Rio a lopsided smile at the sight of food.  </p><p>Rio shared the smile. “I noticed you barely ate anything substantial during dinner, and I don’t want you to get a headache drinking wine on an empty stomach.”  </p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha blushed at the alpha’s thoughtfulness; this was definitely something she was not used to. She reached for a pizza bite and unceremoniously shoved it in her mouth. With her cheeks full, she gave Rio what might have been the dorkiest, most awkward smile in existence. </p><p><em> Gods, she’s adorable – </em> Rio's alpha hummed happily, knowing that bringing the young woman food was the right call. Though she made a note to get more, as they were Nicky’s favorite afterschool snack, and she couldn’t have him wallowing on the couch going on about a lack of food in the home. The kid was a bottomless pit; he’d once gone through an entire family-sized bag of pizza rolls when she was away for the day after he had begged to be allowed to stay home alone (Alice had been home that day and only a few floors down, so she had allowed it). </p><p>Knowing that when an omega goes into heat, they become hungrier than usual, Rio made a mental note to ask Agatha what her favorite snacks were for next time (It punched her in the gut with just how much she wanted a <em> next time </em> with the omega). She turned and moved over to the couch. Agatha was hot on her heels, trying to grab another bite – the molten cheese and meat had sparked a hunger in her and Rio <em> was </em>offering.  </p><p>They sat down and Agatha hummed happily to herself, her eyes scrunched just a bit as she worked her way through 3 more, including the last one that Rio motioned for her to take, watching the omega with a fond smile as she worked through the offered food.  </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, glancing at Rio curiously. “Your son, how old is he now?” she asked, going back to their previous conversation before she was further distracted by food.  </p><p>“12 and thinks he is a grown man already.” </p><p>Agatha cringed. “Oof, tween-pups…”  </p><p>Rio snorted, shaking her head. “No kidding. Just the other day he came barreling into my home office with his chest all puffed up. I think I injured his ego on accident when I didn’t immediately spot the singular hair on his upper lip.” </p><p>She watched in amusement as Agatha laughed, leaning over to grab her glass of wine. “Poor kid. I’m sure he’ll recover eventually when his first chest hair comes in.” </p><p>“Gods spare me,” Rio groaned, shaking her head at the thought. </p><hr/><p>Agatha finished her wine and set the glass down on the coffee table rather abruptly, clasping her hands tight in her lap. The air shifted. Rio’s eyebrows flew up, keenly observing Agatha — those blue eyes flickered to her hands in her lap, chewing nervously on her bottom lip, squirming uncomfortably in her seat.  </p><p>Rio slowly adjusted her position, shifting to face the omega. The atmosphere changed with noticeable energy, and Rio remained focused on the moment – watching with a cocked head as Agatha fidgeted next to her. Agatha seemed to finally reach a decision or find her resolve and moved closer, reaching for Rio’s almost empty glass from her hands.  </p><p>“What if I wasn’t finished?” the alpha teased, utterly amused by the omega’s antics.   </p><p>Agatha let out an annoyed huff and closed her eyes for a moment, trying to force down the wave of heat that racked her body. She felt like she was boiling alive in her own skin – she hated this part of her heat. Always too hot, never an easy way to cool off. Her omega was rattling at its cage, screeching and declaring that she had waited long enough. Breathing in the powerful scent of the alpha that was sitting right beside her, she could practically <em> taste </em>Rio. Her mouth watered at the thought and she squeezed her legs together, trying to find relief to her aching cunt. When she opened her eyes again, she was met with the almost obsidian pupils fixed directly on her face, but the gaze then descended followed by a low, throaty hum.  </p><p>Agatha moved before Rio could say another word, taking the last sip of the alpha’s wine. She leaned in, bringing their lips close together and paused to look at her. A moment suspended in time; Agatha could hear her heart pounding in her ears. She watched the alpha lick her lips at a measured pace, while swallowing a lump in her throat. A barely audible sound emanated from her, as she attempted to maintain composure. </p><p>Agatha could no longer wait.  </p><p>Their lips pressed together gently, unhurried at first, tentatively, but then Rio made a slow swipe with her tongue on Agatha’s bottom lip. A torrent of pheromones poured from the omega; she grabbed the back of the alpha’s neck, fingers digging desperately into the alpha’s skin and muscle as she pulled her into a searing kiss.  </p><p>Rio moaned into the kiss, opening her lips, eyes widening as the other woman let the rest of the wine flow into her mouth. Rio was quick to swallow, mildly convinced that there was now no other way to drink wine but from the woman in front of her. The omega greedily plunged her tongue inside her mouth, the grip on her neck tightening as if afraid Rio would pull away (as if she would ever want to). Her soft lips were warm, but her kisses were rough and messy. Agatha kissed with a new kind of hunger.  </p><p>Rio’s alpha reacted, surging forward, like it finally accepted the inevitable – desperate to get Agatha under her. To feel their bodies pressed together. </p><p>Agatha’s heat was utterly overwhelming, saturating the air. Rio could <em> taste </em> it on her tongue and wanted nothing more than to taste the other woman once more. </p><p>This kiss was explosive, making sparklers burn behind her eyes. The air was electric as Agatha’s tongue slid against hers, filling her veins with raw need.  </p><p>They pulled apart, foreheads pressed together, both panting breathlessly. Rio couldn’t help but push her hips forward, wanting more friction and more pressure – somehow during their make out session they had ended up with Agatha pressed into the cushions of the couch.  </p><p>“Take me to bed,” The younger woman beseeched in a whisper, her lips swollen, eyes burning with passion that could ignite the room. </p><p>Rio sat up and held her hand out to help Agatha to her feet. Fingers clasped together, Rio led them down the hall. With each step they took closer to her room, her <em> den</em>, her stomach fluttered with a nervous tension at the thought of bringing anyone to her private space, let alone a potential mate. Only her son was permitted in her room and even then, he usually stood at the door, respecting her space just as she made sure to respect his. </p><p>“Are you sure about this?” the alpha asked, rubbing the pad of her thumb in smooth circles on Agatha’s hand. “You can change your mind… ride out your heat safely in the guest room. Or I can take you somewhere else… anywhere.” </p><p>Agatha responded with a brief kiss. As their lips remained together, Rio opened the door, pushing it wider. Then, she stepped back, letting Agatha cross the threshold first – watching the small smile blossom into a full one when she took in the room. </p><p>Rio's den was an oasis reminiscent of a rain-forest, serene and tranquil. Agatha was enveloped by rich aromas of earth, wood, and chocolate — every scent she now associated with the alpha. Heavy curtains covered the large windows, and the purplish-pink light illuminating the room was emitted by the numerous grow lights for the many plants scattered around. She could identify some, like the monstera (but this one had white spots that looked like stars), various varieties of ferns and a sprawling, leafed thing Agatha didn't recognize but assumed was exotic.  </p><p>The walls were painted an emerald shade and were adorned with photos of Rio’s family – Lilia, her son, and an Asian woman that Agatha could only assume was the “Alice” Lilia had mentioned at the restaurant. The large bed, positioned in the center of the room, had a dark wooden frame with green sheer curtains hanging from the canopy. It was adorned with numerous pillows and covered by a deep green blanket. Her den was peaceful and vibrant, radiating the very essence of Rio, one grounded in nature.  </p><p>Agatha moved to stand in front of Rio's bed, her back facing the alpha. She pulled her long wavy hair over her right shoulder, exposing the left side of her neck and sending another wave of sweet intoxicating pheromones. The omega turned her head timidly, tilting her head, offering the jugular.  </p><p>She closed her eyes, anxiety settling into the pit of her stomach. She didn’t know why, it was just there – even though they had been all over each other over the course of the last few hours, Agatha was terrified that she might be denied. Her omega gnashed its teeth, railing against the thoughts. This alpha was kind and caring. This alpha <em> fed </em>them. </p><p>This alpha would <em> not </em> turn them away.   </p><p>Rio’s words caught in her throat, her smoldering eyes burning a path down the other woman’s body, taking in every curve encased in that damned black dress. She watched and waited… she dug her nails into the palms of her hands, fists shaking with the need to touch.  </p><p>Then she heard it – low and soft and needy. </p><p>Agatha <em> whimpered</em>, a desperate little noise so full of distress… almost pained.  </p><p>The alpha could not hold back any longer, and her body moved of its own accord – it only took three brisk strides, and she was finally pressed behind the younger woman. The omega purred when Rio placed her hands on her waist, pulling her rump to rub against the bulge straining against the front of Rio's slacks.  </p><p>The feeling made her weak in the knees. </p><p>Rio’s hands drifted up along the sides of Agatha’s body, fingertips dancing around her tense shoulders and giving a gentle squeeze. Leaning closer to the exposed neck that was offered, movements mirrored from earlier, Rio’s nose gently grazed her neck. She inhaled deeply, taking in Agatha’s scent – burning it into her memory, practically salivating at the thought of sinking her teeth into the soft skin there, of making Agatha hers. Agatha’s breath hitched when the alpha ran the flat of her tongue over her sensitive gland, shifting just a bit to trace the tip of her tongue up along her neck, tasting the sweet salt of her sweat before placing a tender kiss just behind her ear.  </p><p>Rio slowly trailed her fingers across Agatha’s back, only stopping briefly when she came to the middle of the other woman’s dress, then her right thumb and index finger slowly pulled the zipper tab down. Every painful second that passed exposed more of Agatha’s pale skin. Finally, the slider stopped, and Rio couldn’t resist the opportunity to touch. She pressed her palms against the woman’s bare back (her dick twitched at the simple fact that Agatha had not been wearing a bra the entire damn time). Sliding her hands upwards to push the black fabric off the omega’s shoulders, she watched in fascination as gravity did the rest, the dress pooled to the ground and Agatha’s body was left nearly bare.  </p><p>Agatha, still in her heels, stepped over the garment circling her feet. Rio licked her lower lip, taking in the smooth skin – she wanted to map the few smatterings of freckles with her lips, to learn the story behind the small scar on her right side, to touch the small tattoo of a moon on her left shoulder blade. </p><p>Rio lowered herself down to one knee and then the other and moaned at the sight of the purple lace covering Agatha’s perfect ass. She wanted to trace the intricate vines of the fabric with the tip of her tongue until she found her prize. The intoxicating taste of the omega was now seared on her tongue. She was desperate to bury her face between Agatha’s legs again.  </p><p>She gave into the desire and leaned forward, biting lightly at the meat of Agatha’s ass. She grinned to herself when the omega let out a squeal and tried to move away only to have Rio stop her, hands firm on her waist. </p><p>The alpha pushed and bade Agatha to turn her body to face her. She could see the wet patch of her ruined panties, darkened with slick. The intoxicating scent of her sex – her rut made her mouth water, and if she had any less control, she knew some drool would have escaped her mouth. Rolling her eyes back, she growled when she placed her face closer to the fabric covering the omega’s ripe cunt, desperate for another taste.  </p><p>She needed it to keep from going mad.  </p><p>Her dark eyes gleamed with hunger as she looked up to see <em>her</em> omega: her smooth stomach, muscles taut, the perfect roundness of her breasts, nipples pert and rosy. Her long wavy hair suspended in the air as Agatha's chin rested on her sternum, her chest moving rapidly, with lips slightly open. The blue of her eyes was barely visible thanks to her blown pupils. She looked at Rio with a longing that was both beautiful and fervent, a yearning that filled the silence between them.  </p><p>Rio kissed the younger woman’s navel, her teeth scraping on her skin, and her alpha rejoiced in the gasp that released from the omega’s lips. Her fingers moved reverently from her hips, tracing down the plump curve of her thighs, the muscular shape of her calves, encircling her ankles. Rio dragged her lips down, tracing every path her hands took – if she had any doubt that the omega wanted her it would have been tamped down by the pulse of pheromones that seemed to seep out every time her lips connected with Agatha’s skin.  </p><p>The alpha placed her hands flat on the floor and bowed her head in an uncharacteristic act of submission. She could hear the omega let out a rough unrestrained rasp – she wanted a symphony of the omega’s gasps to fill her ears. Rio placed an open mouth kiss on the bare skin of Agatha’s right foot then she dragged the tip of her tongue to the toebox of the omega’s black heels, sealing it with another kiss. This went against her alpha nature; it snarled inside her, demanding she reclaim her rightful dominance, but Rio didn’t care. She knew her purpose here was to worship the beautiful creature before her.   </p><p>Agatha was a goddess in her own right. </p><p>If Agatha told her she was an immortal cosmic entity, Rio would believe her and worship at her altar until the end of days as her most devoted and unwavering acolyte.  </p><p>Rio was slow to take off the omega’s heels, careful to take each foot in hand and placed reverent kisses on her way back up. Agatha whimpered every time Rio’s lips touched her skin. Still, Rio knelt, looking up to the woman who stared down at her completely wrecked. Agatha smiled softly and placed her hand on Rio’s cheek. The alpha leaned into the touch. Turning her face into Agatha’s hand, she licked and kissed the inside of the omega’s wrist, pulling another deliciously soft sound from the other woman’s lips.  </p><p>Rio finally moved to stand back up and noted that without her heels Agatha was a bit shorter than her, the perfect height. She kissed the woman’s nose, then pulled back to drink the beautiful features of her omega in — every blemish, every freckle, every bruise… wait, <em> bruises</em>?  </p><p>It took a moment longer than she would have liked for her lust-filled haze to subside. Her eyes sharpened, and she marked finger-shaped imprints in various shades of purples, greens and yellowish browns on the inside of Agatha’s arms. </p><p>Rio growled, releasing a bitter taste of ire, baring her teeth. “Agatha, who hurt you?”  </p><p>The omega grimaced in discomfort at the shift in scent, at the displeasure radiating from the older woman, and trembled slightly at the alpha’s tone. “Don’t…” she pleaded shamefully, “<em> please </em>… don’t.” Her voice broke a little. “Not now.” </p><p>Later. They could talk about this later. </p><p>Rio’s sharp edges softened, seeing how the omega reacted to her anger. She paused immediately, fighting with her alpha who was demanding blood at the sight, the physical proof, of someone hurting their omega…<em>   </em> </p><p><em> Their? </em>  </p><p>Having met Evanora, Rio had a strong suspicion that the absolute <em> witch </em> of an alpha was the cause of harm. Seeing the bruises on Agatha’s arms, the powerful instinct to protect, to shelter, washed over her again.  </p><p>Her alpha had already decided this omega was hers.  </p><p>“Okay…” Rio wrapped her arms around the smaller woman, sending out a wave of soothing reassurance. She buried her face into the omega’s neck and breathed in her scent. Rio let her hands slowly tangle in Agatha’s mass of hair. She needed to remind her alpha, <em> we do not claim what has not been freely given</em>. But her alpha refused, puffing its chest in defiance, roaring a laugh, viciously mocking her as if Rio’s choice was ever an option. </p><p><em> This omega is ours. </em> </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to rest their foreheads together – ignoring the feral creature she shared space with. “You’re safe with me,” she whispered softly, tucking a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear, feeling the smaller woman tremble in her arms. “Tell me. What do you want?” She kept her tone soft and tender, pressing a kiss to her temple. </p><p>Agatha snorted bitterly. “No alpha has ever asked me that before.”  </p><p>“I am <em> not </em> like most alphas.” </p><p>Agatha thought about it for a moment. From the second she met Rio, she had felt something settle in her bones.  </p><p>In her very soul. </p><p>Rio acted like the antithesis of the power-hungry alphas in her life, even just over the course of a few hours. She was thoughtful and considerate of Agatha's needs – overwhelmingly generous with her wants. The woman had given her multiple orgasms tonight and hadn’t asked for anything in return. She had treated her like something to be cherished and worshiped.  </p><p>Agatha was used to being treated as an inconvenience, an afterthought. The main alpha in her life, the one that dictated every single choice and thought and feeling, made her feel ashamed of everything she was. Made every accomplishment seem like it was insignificant. Evanora had been borderline homicidal when Agatha had presented as an omega. </p><p>“There has never been an omega born into the Harkness line. You should have died with your <em> bitch </em>of a father.”   </p><p>Agatha pretended to be a designation she was not just to stay alive. She took countless suppressants that made her feel sick (so much so that Jen was increasingly worried for her general health – mental, physical, reproductive). Agatha made sure to lock herself away in the basement built for her, to ride out her <em> disgusting </em> heat cycles alone.  </p><p>The home she lived in with her mother was not safe; she had no nest. It was forbidden by her sire. </p><p>Evanora reminded her of her inferiority near daily and taught her to be ashamed of what she was. </p><p>To the outside world she was an alpha – a true Harkness. </p><p>And it was utterly exhausting.  </p><p>Now finally there was someone, a kind, gentle alpha who was tender and loving and literally bowed down and kissed her feet. Rio made her feel safe, and she trusted that she could be herself without being judged. She believed in her heart of hearts that Rio felt the same way. Her omega acknowledged that this was the right alpha for her.  </p><p>She could let go with her. </p><p>She <em> wanted </em> to let go with her.  </p><p>So, what did Agatha truly want at this moment?  </p><p>Agatha wanted a taste of Rio – the alpha had gotten her own taste earlier and Agatha felt like she was left in the desert to die of thirst now. </p><p>Agatha looked deep into Rio’s eyes, searching for a moment, and when she found it, a delighted purr rumbled up from deep within her chest. Keeping her eyes on the alpha, she drew in a breath, as if to will those traces of shame away that fought with her desire for complete surrender.  </p><p>A Harkness never knelt to anyone, but her omega was practically frothing at the mouth when she willingly sank to her knees.  </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened and she choked back a groan. Agatha was kneeling in front of her, looking up at her adoringly. Those brilliant sapphire eyes burned with a fire that sucked the oxygen out of the room, and the way she was looking up at her...begging to please.  </p><p>Rio gave her a short nod of permission, and the omega moved her hands to unbuckle the leather belt. She even used her fucking teeth to unzip Rio's slacks. The alpha bit back another strangled grunt as the sensation of Agatha’s fingers touching her skin to pull the fabric of her pants and briefs down, exposing her lower half. Her body shivered when the air kissed her overheated skin. </p><p>Insecurity washed over her, and she instinctively moved her hands to cover herself, the deep seeded fear of being scrutinized over the sum of her parts. The<em> naked truth </em>was – there was nowhere to hide, this was it.  </p><p>This was her body. Every barrier, every facade, every protective layer she carried, was cast aside.  </p><p>Being here, standing before Agatha, required a level of vulnerability that struck a cord of fear within her. She was an alpha who had birthed a pup, a disgrace to her designation, and she knew the omega before her could do far better – her ears rang when she felt the soft touch of the omega's fingers moving her hands away to get a better look. She closed her eyes tightly, causing tears to leak.  </p><p>Rio sucked in a shuttering breath, when the younger woman slowly traced the faint scar on her lower abdomen.  </p><p>“You’re so beautiful, Rio…” Agatha said with a soft reverence that almost felt like a prayer, one not intended to be uttered aloud.  </p><p>When Rio decided to open her eyes and look down, what she was met with knocked the wind out of her lungs. Agatha was looking up at her with the most beautiful shade of kyanite, her eyes shimmering with devotion.  </p><p>Rio forgot what she was even afraid of.  </p><p>“You make me feel beautiful,” Rio whispered. The alpha placed a hand on the top of the omega’s head, petting her gently.  </p><p>The younger woman closed her eyes, leaned into the touch, and purred. Agatha smiled so brightly that Rio was convinced it could power an entire city grid. She slid her hands to Rio’s waist, her thumbs gently caressing the stretch marks on her hips.  </p><p>Rio watched as the omega leaned forward and placed a kiss on her belly. It was soft and tender, conveying a vast range of emotion without a single word.  </p><p>Then, like the strike of a match, Agatha’s tongue traced that same scar that caused her so much anxiety. One of the many marks left behind to bring Nicky into the world. Her body ignited.  </p><p>Her engorged clit had already extended, forming a much thicker shaft – Agatha stared at her with a hunger that she wasn’t entirely sure she could sate. Rio felt slightly embarrassed for a moment; it had been years since she had taken a lover and even then, she had never been this eager to be touched. </p><p>Rio forgot how to breathe when Agatha’s warm fingers wrapped around her shaft. Her cock twitched, leaking clear fluid from her slit as the omega squeezed and twisted, moving her fist in an upward stroke. Her flesh burned with desire. The pad of Agatha's thumb began to trace her very sensitive dripping tip.  </p><p>“Oh <em> fuck</em>,” the alpha nearly shouted, gritting her teeth. Agatha was driving her wild. She looked down at her with desperation. </p><p>She needed something. </p><p>Anything. </p><p>Any form of relief that the omega before her was willing to give.  </p><p>Agatha looked up, delighted at the tantalizing sound that her alpha was making, and she continued to stroke Rio’s length in slow, languid movements. </p><p>Rio was harder and thicker than Agatha had imagined, her fingers barely managing to close around the shaft. She pushed Rio’s cock up towards her belly, wanting to lick its underside, when she noticed the sticky wetness on Rio’s thighs and her glistening folds. Agatha groaned upon realizing just how unique her alpha was.  </p><p>The omega got Rio to shift her legs wider apart and aimed a little lower.  </p><p>The moment Agatha’s tongue traced the length of her folds, dipping her tongue into her core to get a taste of her arousal, Rio was a goner. She let out a strangled cry deep from her chest.  </p><p>Agatha looked up and beamed with pride to see just how wrecked she had the older woman after a single act. Rio’s head hung back, lips parted – panting. </p><p>The taste of Rio’s cunt was addictive, and every dip of Agatha’s tongue granted her with more wetness in her mouth. The alpha’s slick spilled from her lips, dripping down her chin, at the same time Agatha’s hand started to pump Rio’s cock again with slow strokes. Her grip tightened with each jerk of the alpha’s hips, thumb swiping over the tip, smearing the precum.  </p><p>“Oh god. Oh fuck. Agatha.” The alpha was a mess – quivering and whimpering and halfway to howling. </p><p>Agatha pulled her mouth away from Rio’s cunt, face covered with the older woman’s arousal and continued twisting her fist up and down the shaft a few more times before finally wrapping her lips around Rio’s thick cock.  </p><p>The way Agatha was touching her, <em> tasting her </em> – gods, Rio hadn’t let anyone touch her cunt since she presented, too ashamed of her abnormalities. Previous lovers only wanted her dick – what she was meant to give as an alpha — and ignored the existence of her other parts and other needs. </p><p>They wanted her in pieces, instead of taking her whole.  </p><p>Rio knew Agatha was going to be the death of her but accepted her fate. Whatever this woman wanted from her, Rio would happily give. She would let her take whatever she wanted.  </p><p>The moment Rio felt the wet warmness of Agatha’s mouth on her cock, she felt like she was on the edge of a precipice. She locked her knees when they threatened to buckle as the younger woman flicked her tongue over her slit, lips parting wider to take in more of her length.  </p><p>Rio stared, pupils blown, watching her dick disappear into Agatha’s mouth. “Fuck. Fuck,” she choked out, overwhelmed with the surplus of sensation. She brushed some strands of Agatha’s hair out of her face, hands sliding around the back of Agatha’s head, watching her cock slowly moving in and out of those swollen lips, spit covering her length and dripping off Agatha’s chin. </p><p>It was utterly obscene, the picture they painted, and even more so when Agatha looked up at Rio, her bright eyes full of bliss, humming in approval as the alpha rocked her hips slowly.  </p><p>“Fuck. Fuck. Your mouth… so good...” Rio panted, letting her head hang back again, lost in the feeling. The only sounds were of Rio’s heavy breathing and the gurgling sounds of her cock rocking in and out of the omega’s warm, wet mouth.  </p><p>Agatha grabbed the base of Rio’s cock and braced herself as the alpha greedily bucked her hips forward, pushing deeper into her mouth. The head nudged the back of her throat, barely touching her uvula – she squeezed her eyes shut, tears springing instantly in her eyes as she reflexively gagged on her alpha’s cock.  </p><p>The alpha groaned, tears running down her face from the intensity. Her hands – she didn’t know how or when they’d found purchase in Agatha’s hair – held the omega’s head in place. Her hips sprung forward, sliding deeper into her soft warm mouth – feeling Agatha’s perfect nose brush her stomach. The younger woman’s throat muscles contracted around her sensitive head as she made another gargled sound.  </p><p>Rio gasped, head snapping forward, eyes wide as she quickly tugged her hips back from the retching sound, “I’m so sorry Agatha. I… shit, I didn’t mean to.”  </p><p>Agatha coughed a few times, a string of saliva still connecting her mouth to Rio’s cock. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and placed her other hand on Rio’s hip. Keeping her from moving further away from her mouth, she shook her head. “No, please...” Her voice was raw and raspy, "I want you to come down my throat." </p><p>Rio’s chest rumbled, a possessive urge surging through her body, and she found herself glad she had locked her knees, staring into those teary baby blues looking up at her so devotedly. Rio swallowed slowly and nodded. “Fuck, okay.” She placed her hand on the omega’s cheek, the pad of her thumb gently wiping the wetness under her eye. “If it gets too much, tap my leg… I don’t want to hurt you.” </p><p>The omega closed her eyes for a moment and moaned – to think she could get so fucking turned on by the care the alpha was capable of showing, while all she wanted at this moment was to make Rio feel good. She grabbed Rio’s dick again, gliding her almost closed fist up and down a few times before she took the length in her mouth again.  </p><p>Rio sucked in a harsh breath as Agatha continued to suckle her head, lips wrapped tightly around the tip. Her knees buckled, thighs trembling with how wonderfully overwhelming it all felt. Watching her cock sliding in and out of her omega’s red lips.   </p><p>Swirling her tongue on Rio’s leaking slit, before hollowing out her cheeks to take more, Agatha let her lips fall slack, puffing droplets of saliva around the girth. Watching Rio lose herself again, fucking her mouth – it filled the omega with delight. She could feel Rio’s hip movements become ragged; she could feel the alpha’s control slipping. </p><p>Rio’s hands found their home again in Agatha’s hair. Her fingers curling, gripping tighter and tighter with each thrust of her hips.  </p><p>Something sparked within Agatha – Rio was getting close. She could tell from the way her alpha was moaning, desperate and filthy. Her hips were starting to move erratically, losing their rhythm. Agatha tasted each spurt of precum on her tongue. </p><p>She was lost in the sound of the older woman’s pleasure when the idea hit her. Agatha moaned around Rio’s cock as she pressed three fingers deep inside the alpha’s dripping core. She met no resistance —Rio was aroused beyond measure from the head she was receiving. The ridged walls clenched around her digits so she curled her fingers, hoping it would have its intended effect on the woman writhing above her.  </p><p>The way Rio screamed her name then, she knew, would be seared into her memory.  </p><p>The alpha’s hips stuttered and her whole body stiffened before she rocked forward – hand spasming to grip Agatha’s locks so tight she saw stars. A hot jet of cum hit the back of her throat and Agatha swallowed ravenously. Further ejaculations made her swallow reflexively each time, earning a satisfied sound from Rio with each movement of her throat. What delighted her most was the way Rio’s inner walls gripped her fingers, and the slick evidence of the other woman’s pleasure leaking down her thighs.  </p><p>Agatha gulped greedily as Rio wailed through her release, then pulled her fingers out of the alpha’s cunt. The last drops of Rios sweet cum dribbled out, and Agatha slowly released the bulbous tip from her mouth with a slurpy <em> pop.</em>  </p><p>Rio was still breathing hard, shaking from the aftershocks of her orgasm. Agatha sat back on her heels, pleased with herself and desperately needy. She could feel her own slick dripping from between her legs; she pressed her thighs together, hoping the pressure would provide temporary relief, knowing it would only heighten the need.  </p><p>She moved to wipe the cum on her chin but the scent and wetness on her hand caught her attention. Rio’s cunt smelled sweet – like chocolate (it wasn’t actually chocolate, but to her it was just as intoxicating). Letting out a pleased sound at the discovery, Agatha moved her wet fingers to her mouth and savored the taste before sucking her fingers clean.  </p><p>Rio looked down, eyes narrowed to watch Agatha suck and lick the fingers that were just inside her. <em> Fuck</em>. The alpha moaned at the sight and her pheromones flared with a burning desire for dominance; the power in it made the omega gasp.  </p><p>The hand in Agatha's hair moved, sliding down, tenderly caressing her cheek. “Such a good omega,” Rio praised softly and then firmly grabbed her mandible, squishing her cheeks till her lips made an adorable pout.  </p><p>Rio dipped down and kissed her hard and sloppy. Teeth tugged on her bottom lip before Rio plunged her tongue into Agatha’s mouth. She groaned, tasting herself on the omega’s tongue. When she pulled back, her eyes dark with lust, the alpha growled, “Get on the bed. Now.” </p><p>The words sparked something deep and primal within Agatha; she couldn’t help but scramble towards the bed. When she made it, she let herself fall backwards onto it, engulfed by the soft comforter and pillowtop mattress. </p><p>Agatha scooted backwards to the center of the bed while watching as Rio unbuttoned the rest of her shirt rather quickly, then threw it over her shoulder. Those dark eyes were fixed on her body; she looked like she was famished as she slowly licked her dry lips. Rio unhooked her bra to let it fall to the floor. Agatha couldn’t help a small, pleased sound at the sight of Rio completely naked at last.  </p><p>The alpha was fucking beautiful. Her breasts were small but perky with dark nipples. Her body was lithe, with smooth tanned skin, much of it kissed by the sun, and her arms were toned. The sexiest lines on her abs led down to the thick cock that had been in Agatha's mouth just moments ago, where it still jutted out from between her thighs.  </p><p>Agatha wanted to touch, she wanted to another taste, she wanted Rio inside her. </p><p>Now. </p><p>The omega’s breath hitched, her pulse racing, when the alpha grabbed her dick and deliberately rubbed the length, droplets leaking from her slit. She knew alphas had a difficult time getting their erections to go down during their ruts, and standing before her (pun intended) was proof. </p><p>Rio smirked, knowing Agatha was watching her stroke herself. She slowly moved closer, lifting one knee on the mattress, then the other.      </p><p>“Wait. A... Rio… condom,” Agatha panted desperately, spreading her legs wider – despite how her omega <em> raged </em>at the mere mention of a barrier between them and this alpha. Her hungry blue eyes drift down to Rio’s dick, bobbing as the alpha crawled closer, warm skin brushing against her own overheated body. The omega within warred with her and won as they released a pained sob of desperation, arching her back as the tip of the head barely rubbed against her clothed, swollen clit. It hurt so much, so good. Her heart pounded wildly, and her veins burned with the heat of her own blood. Her skin crackled with electricity as though her body was a conduit.  </p><p>She was in agony. She needed to be filled.  </p><p>Rio groaned as her hips rocked forward for more contact. “I’m... ah, I’m sterile…”  she admitted breathlessly. Traces of shame, of not being an adequate alpha, a <em> loose tie, </em> lingered in the air.  </p><p>It had been complications from her c-section, when she had her son. Doctors opened her up in their haste to get the unborn pup out, accidentally damaging her undescended testes.  </p><p>She had felt like a freak her whole life, with her unusual anatomy. Rio lived with the shame of being something <em> in-between </em> and indeed had lived most of her life as a beta until she presented as an alpha after Nicky was born.  </p><p>Maybe this was a conversation they should have had before they found themselves in this position. But the sweet, rich intoxicating scent of Agatha’s heat filled the air, smothering any rational thought, and her rut brain only wanted one thing.  </p><p>Yes, they were practically strangers, but there was something about Agatha that her alpha could not deny - something that demanded to be claimed by <em> her</em>. Rio had tasted the god’s ambrosia of old, she had taken a bite of the forbidden fruit, and her brain chemicals were altered by Agatha’s deliciousness. She was high on this new drug named Agatha, and it made her alpha act like a lovesick puppy; she was forever addicted to this omega. </p><p><em>MINE</em>, her inner voice snarled, thrashing around wildly. </p><p><em>MINE</em>, her alpha declared in sync. </p><p>Rio’s dick was rock hard and throbbed to be inside those slick folds between her omega’s legs. The last thing she wanted was a fucking condom — she wanted the glory at the end. She never wanted to be inside someone as badly as this, to feel her raw. She wanted to fill her belly up with her seed. The alpha growled in pleasure at the thought.  </p><p>“Fuck, okay, yes…” Agatha moaned incoherently. “Please… Rio… I …”  She pulled Rio’s mouth down to her own with a sense of urgency. Moving her free hand down, her nails dug into the meaty flesh of Rio’s ass, squeezing and pulling her closer to her heat. The omega growled with impatience. “Need… you… in me.” </p><p>She realized she was crying, but the humiliation of her neediness burned away as Rio deepened the kiss.  </p><p>Agatha whined when Rio pulled away from her lips. The alpha looked down and groaned, wondering just how ruined those drenched panties were. It didn’t matter; Rio hooked her fingers on the waistband and pulled them off in one swift motion.  </p><p>And... fuck.  </p><p>Agatha’s cunt looked sublime. </p><p>She had short, neatly trimmed dark curls covering puffy lips glistening from her arousal, with her swollen clit peaking from her folds. And when Rio spread her apart... what greeted her was the prettiest shade of deep rose she had ever seen. </p><p><em> Fuck. </em> Rio swallowed hard, watching Agatha clench at nothing, slick dripping down her folds. </p><p>Rio moved her hand closer to the wetness there, her prize, and let her thumb tracing Agatha's labia. Collecting the slickness leaking, she pressed firmly on her clit and began rubbing in tight circles. </p><p>Agatha cried out when Rio slid two fingers inside her cunt. She could feel her walls fluttering, squeezing so tight that Rio briefly feared her fingers might snap.  </p><p>“Fuck. <em> More</em>.” The omega growled, desperation thick in her voice.  </p><p>“Soon. Let me just…” Rio added a third finger and curled, hitting that spot that made Agatha slam her head back into the pillows, eyes shut tight, lips parting as she let out a most delicious cry of pain-pleasure. The alpha’s fingers traced her inner ridges, while slick squished out her needy hole and pooling in the palm of Rio's hand.</p><p>“I don’t want to hurt you.” The alpha soothed, then pulled her fingers out.  </p><p>Agatha whimpered and bucked her hips into empty air. Opening her eyes quickly at the loss, she called out in a broken voice, “Rio…” Did the alpha not want her anymore? She instinctively sent out another wave of sweet seduction with her scent. Squirming beneath Rio, her soft pleas cut short as her eyes drifted down, watching her slick drip off Rio’s hand.  </p><p>The alpha moved to grab her dick… covering it with her wetness.  </p><p><em> Oh… </em> </p><p>Agatha swallowed heavily, licking her lips as she watched Rio. Rio closed her eyes as she rubbed Agatha’s slick up and down her shaft, coating it completely. </p><p>Her alpha roared, desperate to break free. It wanted to plunge deep inside of her omega on this primal night.  </p><p>“Please…” </p><p>Rio slowly glided the tip into Agatha’s sopping folds, groaning in pleasure, eyes fluttering shut as she felt herself succumbing to just how unbelievably divine this felt. </p><p>Her eyes snapped open as a trickle of horror rolled down her spine. </p><p><em> Oh... </em> </p><p><em> Oh no… </em> </p><p><em> Oh fuck…  </em> </p><p>Her body tensed and she felt the familiar blinding white-hot tug in her belly. She could not stop it (and part of her didn’t want to). Her orgasm erupted before her throbbing dick could even feel the completeness of her omega’s heat. Rio’s cock twitched, spurting ropes of cum on Agatha’s thighs and stomach.   </p><p>Agatha blinked, her heat-hazy brain taking a moment to catch up, before she asked, “Did you just…?” </p><p>An ice-cold splash of mortification crashed over Rio’s body, and her alpha’s bruised ego whimpered like a kicked pup. Pathetic. <em> Pathetic</em>. It rang over and over in her ears. </p><p>Agatha kept eye contact with Rio as she slid her right hand down between them, collecting some of white fluid sprayed across her stomach. Moving her fingers to her lips next, she smirked and stuck her tongue out, deliberately licking Rio’s cum off her finger. “Mmm. Next time aim for my mouth.”  </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio groaned. “You are going to be the death of me.” She moved forward, resting her sweaty forehead on Agatha’s messy stomach, trying to catch her breath. “Sorry… look…I’m.… It’s been a long time. And you just... you felt so... so good…”  </p><p>Agatha chuckled, just as breathy as the alpha, moving her hands to thread them in Rio’s hair and scratch her nails on Rio's scalp. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”  </p><p>Rio nipped at the soft stomach beneath her lips, her face still flushed with embarrassment, and gripped Agatha’s hips a little tighter. </p><p>They settled for a moment. Agatha silently ran her fingers through Rio’s hair. The alpha purred in contentment at the feeling, the intimacy of being so close to someone. It truly had been a very long time since she had shared this comfortable silence, broken only by soft breathing sounds. Their scents mingled in the air, molecules blending, feeling… right. Almost inevitable.  </p><p>After a beat, Agatha cooed enticingly, "Oh my big… strong… alpha, I know you can do better than that.”  </p><p>Rio slowly lifted her head to look at Agatha, who now had the most devious grin plastered on her face. Even in the low light of her room, the other woman’s blue eyes sparkled with mischief. </p><p>She wanted to wipe that smirk off her pretty little face.   </p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened and snapped at the challenge, growling and surging forward. Agatha gasped at the sudden movement as their lips crashed together, again kissing with all tongues and teeth. The kiss grew more intense, their lips moving with, somehow, increased urgency.  </p><p>Rio’s chest rumbled when Agatha reached between them to wrap her fingers around the hard girth she had inspired. Rio bucked her hips forward with a feral noise.  </p><p>“There you go, big boy…” Agatha moaned, squeezing the dick in her hand <em> just so. </em> “Fuck me,” She commanded. The combination of Agatha's heat and Rio's rut had returned with force; a couple orgasms couldn’t shake the way it was clouding their minds. “Rio… take me. Ruin me…” Agatha ordered, pulling out every ounce of her practiced alpha tone, or all she could muster under the given circumstances. The words rumbled out of her throat and fizzled at the end, though, losing most of their bite.  </p><p>The end result was simply a needy (whiny) omega begging to be fucked. </p><p>Rio chuckled softly at her omega’s attempt to use <em> the voice </em> on her. It would be cruel for her to deny such a lovely demand. But honestly, all Agatha needed to do was ask.   </p><p>Agatha’s heat filled her world, pulling her under into a current of need.  </p><p>In response, her alpha roared, chomping at the bit for a second chance of redemption.  </p><p>Her cock ached to be inside. The scent of her omega’s sex pounded in her veins, setting her body on fire.  </p><p>The need to possess took over.  </p><p>Agatha, <em> her omega</em>, with her cheeks flushed, her nearly bruised lips parted, panting desperately. Her legs fallen open at the knees, her wet pink cunt glistening, visibly clenching with each rock of her hips.    </p><p>Rio let herself give into instinct; she allowed the surge of primal dominance to flood her. Strong hands gripped the flesh of Agatha’s thighs to pull them further apart while tugging the rest of her body closer.  </p><p>The omega’s hips slapped the front of Rio’s thighs. Agatha could not contain her delight, but neither did did she want to.  </p><p>Rio spat into her hand, rubbing her saliva up and down the length of her cock. Her alpha growled with anticipation; she could almost hear the rough chanting of <em> yes, yes, yes, ours </em> as she lined herself up with Agatha’s dripping cunt. The scent of her sex, so rich and musky, made her mouth water.   </p><p>Finally, she slowly descended into the warmth and felt her eyes roll back, groaning once she felt Agatha’s cunt squeezing her. The older woman gritted her teeth, trying to control her movements, the savage and desperate part of herself wanted to <em> plow </em>the omega writhing beneath her — wanted to stake her claim so roughly, so thoroughly, that Agatha thought of no one else until the end of time. She wanted to sink her teeth into the warm flesh of her neck and mark the woman as hers.  </p><p>“Oh! Rio!” Agatha cried, achingly, as Rio sheathed herself completely.  </p><p>The cock now inside her was thick and hot, and her walls clenched greedily at its firmness. The blunt tip rubbed in a most deliciously painful way against her cervix, making her howl. The sensation was all she had dreamed it might be, and she was even, momentarily, satiated by simply the comforting stretch.  </p><p>Her alpha, her chosen mate, was deep within her; that feeling alone made her want to cry out again. </p><p>Rio leaned forward, kissing the middle of the omega’s sternum and then dragging her lips to Agatha’s left breast, taking the nipple between her teeth. Agatha hissed as Rio’s teeth scraped her pebbled nipple and then tugged gently. She pressed her head back into the pillows as hard as she could, arching into Rio’s mouth, cunt fluttering around the cock filling her up. When the woman’s other hand moved to palm the other breast, kneading it, Agatha let out a sound that was more whine than moan. Rio's tongue swirled around the nipple between her teeth, and she suckled the flesh gently.  </p><p>After she (somewhat reluctantly) released the nipple with a wet sound<em>, </em>Rio kissed her way up and pressed her face into the crook of Agatha’s neck. A rich scent of lavender and honey wafted from the glands there, as her lips gently kissed Agatha’s sensitive pulse point. She flicked the tip of her tongue over the gland and then moved swiftly, sucking hungrily at the tender spot beneath her lips, hellbent on leaving another hickey on this goddess of a woman in her bed. </p><p>Her alpha rumbled with pride, finally feeling the complete bliss of Agatha’s cunt. She forced herself to remain still to allow the omega a chance to adjust. She knew she wasn’t going to win any length-measuring contests, but she was definitely a girthy alpha. Agatha’s panting breath tickled her ear, moans vibrating her eardrum, and a shiver of pleasure shot down Rio's spine.  </p><p>“Mine,” she whispered, dragging the flat of her tongue up Agatha's neck to taste the sweet salt of her omega’s sweaty skin. Her sharp canines nipped the lobe of Agatha's ear, making the woman shudder through her whole body. </p><p>Agatha shifted beneath her, lifting her legs up to wrap them around the alpha’s waist, tilting her pelvis, allowing Rio’s cock to sink in deeper. They were both making hungry sounds as Rio allowed herself to bite down just under Agatha’s ear. Not the divot above the collarbone where a mating mark would go, but a little higher. To satiate her need to mark the younger woman, as she slowly rocked her hips. She kept herself and her alpha just barely in check, scarcely moving, simply nestled deep within Agatha until the omega was ready for more.  </p><p>“Fuck... you’re mine,” Rio said, barely managing words, feeling Agatha’s nails rake up her back.  </p><p>“Yours…” the omega mewled, “I’m yours. I’m yours. Alpha, please... please.” </p><p>A low growl escaped Rio’s lips; she rolled her hips back and then slid home.  </p><p>They both cried out.  </p><p>The alpha let loose, then, hips snapping back and forth. “Yes… fuck… I’m yours. All yours. Only yours.”  </p><p>Agatha screamed, followed by a gutteral sound that was heavenly to Rio’s ears.  </p><p>The moment their bodies slammed together, all control and tenderness vanished. Rio was thrusting hard and fast inside of her. All Agatha could do was sink her nails into the shifting muscles of Rio’s back — neither cared about the marks she was making there. She didn’t feel an ounce of embarrassment and desperately tried to steal a kiss.  </p><p>Rio rutted into her over and over, hitting spots she didn’t know were there, the base of the thick cock grinding against her swollen clit, and then she felt <em> it</em>. She gasped into Rio’s mouth, pulling her head back from the kiss to gulp in more air.  </p><p>It was like Rio had poured gasoline over every inch of her body and now, as the base of Rio’s knot began to swell, the match was lit, and Agatha was set ablaze.  </p><p>Bliss consumed her as she was finally fucked the way her body craved, the way her heat demanded. It was new, this sense of fulfillment… to be knotted and bred. Her omega exulted in the way Rio moved inside of her, as though the body she claimed was the most precious treasure in existence. Her hips trembled to maintain control, her knot nudging at Agatha’s stretched entrance.  </p><p>Agatha wanted—no, she fucking needed that knot inside her.  </p><p>“<em>Please</em>…” she panted. “Rio, I need… I need your knot.” Her whine was breathless. “Please,” she begged, once more so stimulated that tears were welling in her eyes. </p><p>The alpha groaned, barely hearing, lost in the feeling of her omega. The filthy wet, squishing sounds her cock made as she plowed into Agatha’s sopping cunt were possibly the greatest, she had ever heard. Rio cried out in delight when she felt her knot expanding, slapping against Agatha’s swollen lips. Her alpha roared proudly; she had <em> never </em>expanded her knot. She knew it only happened for some alphas with their true mates, and sure, there were ways to induce a knot but to have it happen naturally?  </p><p>It was perfection. </p><p><em> Oh fuck</em>. Rio squeezed her eyes shut. Agatha, this beautiful omega, was her true mate — and Rio had found her by accident. She wanted to cry and thank the universe for giving her such a gift. This was new, this deep, driving urge to spill her seed, to trap every last drop inside Agatha’s dripping cunt.  </p><p>“Agatha…” A low growl rumbled through the alpha’s chest. She was covered in sweat. They both were. “You… want… me…” She slowed her movements, ignoring a displeasured whine from her omega. Rio's heart pounded wildly in her chest, her alpha snarling inside, demanding she go faster again.  </p><p>She closed her eyes as a fresh flood of anxiety washed over her. </p><p>She couldn’t give Agatha what her omega most certainly wanted now. </p><p>Rio’s mahogany eyes flew open to meet the shimmering benitoite of Agatha’s, and for a moment they fell into each other's gaze. The blissful cloud of pleasure in her mind cleared for a moment. Her hand moved to cradle Agatha’s jaw tenderly, thumb tracing her bottom lip, pulling a whimper from her mate’s throat.  </p><p>“I’ve never knotted with anyone before…. I can’t give you pups….” Her voice wavered, shame sinking in the pit of her stomach. The few omegas she attempted to have a relationship with had left her over this simple fact. Rio had accepted long ago that she would never be a worthy mate for anyone. <em> I can’t give you a pup, but I can give you my heart</em>, she pleaded in her mind.  </p><p>Agatha slid her hand to the back of Rio’s head, scraping her nails on the nape of her neck forcefully — intent on drawing the woman’s attention and keeping it. “Look at me… Rio you are <b> mine</b>.” She declared it with certainty and then shifted her hand up, slipping her fingers into Rio’s hair to pull her back down for another searing kiss.  </p><p><em> Yours</em>, Rio's alpha roared, agreeing fully to her omega’s declaration.  </p><p>Rio’s hips began to rock again with renewed vigor, making Agatha cry out in bliss as her alpha found her stride. The cock was so hard – and thrusted with a newfound resolve.  </p><p>When Rio unearthed a new angle, one that hit Agatha’s swollen clit, curving up to rub the front ridge perfectly with every thrust? Agatha saw stars.  </p><p>The omega could feel Rio’s knot begin to grind harder against the folds of her entrance. Every powerful thrust stretched her cunt a little bit more. She closed her eyes tightly, and the burning ache of being split apart only intensified her need to take more.  </p><p>Rio was already so fucking thick – adding the thickness of her knot? Well, Agatha was certain she would come undone at an atomic level. She knew her alpha could feel it too. Her body started to shake as she moved her hips to match each thrust.  </p><p>A sudden sharp spike of burning pain came when the widest part of Rio’s knot slipped into her folds, and despite it, Agatha lifted her head up, instinctively sinking her teeth deep into her alpha’s neck, drowning out her scream of pleasure with Rio’s flesh. Her cunt sealed around the knot, swallowing it whole, giving her an instant rush of relief. It felt so good, so right, to have Rio inside her, with her walls molded around the thickness, and euphoria rippled throughout her entire body for successfully taking her mate’s knot. Her teeth clamped down harder on to Rio’s scent gland, not deep enough to draw blood but enough to get a wave of the alpha’s pheromones filling her lungs, giving her another surge of ecstasy. Rio’s flesh muffling her continued cries, her eyes rolling back in bliss. </p><p>The moment her knot found its way home inside of Agatha, those velvety muscles closing around and then squeezing tightly, Rio was lost. She had never been wrapped in anything so tight, so wet, so welcoming, so fucking warm, all she could think was that it felt like returning home. Her hips bucked a few more times, making sure every fraction of an inch was inside her omega, before her body surrendered to the pleasure.  </p><p>Agatha’s teeth sank into her skin, claiming her completely, and Rio and her alpha internally said <em> yours </em> in unison. Her climax crashed over her body like a tsunami wave, along with a churning torrent of emotions. She wailed a moan that erupted from deep in her chest.  </p><p>Agatha’s teeth in her neck. </p><p>Agatha’s nails clawing at her back. </p><p>Agatha’s legs trembling around her waist. </p><p>Agatha’s walls fluttering around her cock, milking her for every drop of cum.  </p><p>It was <em>earth-shattering</em>.  </p><p>It was unlike any previous experience.  </p><p>With every short erratic thrust, Rio wailed a choked desperate <em> Oh, oh god </em> as cum continued to spill into the omega. Rio could feel the seed filling up omega’s cunt, begging to escape, but her knot sealed Agatha’s entrance completely. Not a single drop found freedom while she continued to ride out her orgasm, and maybe it was her imagination, but she could see her omega’s stomach swell just a bit.  </p><p>Just enough. </p><p>With one more grind of her hips, her trembling arms gave out and she collapsed on top of <em> her </em> omega. She laid her head on Agatha’s shoulder, panting heavily into the curve of her neck, sucking softly on her gland that now had another dark red spot forming. She moved her hands to grip Agatha’s hips tightly, fingers flexing against whatever skin she could grab hold of. </p><p>Rio growled and her neck vibrated with one last moan from her mate. She hissed when Agatha’s teeth released their hold and groaned when she licked the bite. The overwhelming sensation of her mate’s tongue affectionately lapping her bite made Rio's cock twitch, and she involuntarily thrusted her hips forward – alpha and omega having aftershocks together.  </p><p>“Fuck Ri—” Agatha slammed her head back, teeth bared, as a wordless strangled cry ripped from her throat. Tears slid down the side of her face, as another, stronger and unexpected orgasm crashed over her. The omega’s entire body contracted, her walls squeezing tightly around the knot. Her nails left angry red lines in Rio’s back, and she locked her ankles behind the alpha’s thighs, keeping her cock deeply inside while she arched up into it, hips rising off the bed. </p><p>“That’s it, Agatha… I got you… let go…” Rio whispered in her ear, kissing the sweat from her skin, slowly grinding her pubic bone over her omega’s clit to drag out the orgasm for as long as she could. Being locked as tight as they were, she could just barely move her hips back to push forward again. </p><p>Agatha went limp; her limbs landed on the mattress with a light thud as she moaned deliriously, rocking her head side to side. There were bright yellow sparkles behind her eyes, her ears were ringing, and she could only hear Rio’s voice in a muffled way. She couldn’t register what the alpha was saying but from experience now, and the soft way the words vibrated against her skin, she assumed it was something tender. </p><p>She could feel Rio all the way to her core; the spurts were slowing but she was so, so full. </p><p>She understood the phrase knot-drunk now. </p><p>“You’re so fucking perfect, Agatha, my mate… my beautiful mate...” Rio chanted, nuzzling into her neck and breathing her in. The only response she received from the woman beneath her was a grunt. Rio chuckled softly, kissing any available skin. Her alpha’s chest was puffed out with pride. </p><p>Her omega, her mate… boneless and catatonic…  </p><p><em> Oh yeah… </em>she did that. </p><p><em> Mine... all mine. </em> </p><p>The euphoric haze that surrounded her mind began to dissipate as their bodies cooled down. She felt the younger woman shiver beneath her. Still resting her face in the crook of Agatha’s neck, she tried not to move much, since they were still tied and she knew Agatha was probably sensitive and carefully pulled the blanket over them. Rio nuzzled close, a calming wave of pheromones filling her nostrils and making her head fuzzy. The omega purr and sighed in contentment, her fingers gently tracing lines along Rio's spine. </p><p>Peace. Everything was at peace. </p><p>This was wonderful.  </p><p>They laid in comfortable silence, basking in the afterglow… </p><p>The fog of Agatha’s heat had temporarily been lifted after being so thoroughly fucked by <em> her </em> alpha. Being satiated gave her a sense that she thought was called <em> post-nut clarity, </em>as her mind now began to race. Thinking back over the whole evening and what it all meant.  </p><p>Her work brain started to take over, to the absolute horror of herself <em> and </em>her omega. </p><p>Of all the things to think of, and yet— This represented a significant conflict of interest. One might even say it was the definition of a conflicted interest.  </p><p>It was the last thing she expected would happen, when her mother had disclosed her plans to acquire Vidal Corp. She’d been a pawn in her mother's effort to divest other companies before. She would sometimes participate in meetings with the heads of potential acquisition targets identified by the CEO as competition, propose generous payout packages, and witness her mother strategically manage the dissolution of their assets. </p><p>Layoffs would follow eventually, and it always fell on her shoulders. </p><p>She knew the rules of this game, having played it a few times before. She was just a cog in the machine of<em> it’s not personal, it’s just business</em>. Rio may have had no intention of selling, but Evanora Harkness was persistent and <em> always </em>got what she wanted.  </p><p>Vidal Corp was supposed to be no different from the others. She had spent hours with Billy, learning everything she could about this incredible, talented, magnanimous woman who was resting on top of her, nestled so deep inside of her that Agatha wasn’t entirely sure where one body began and the other ended, kissing her neck gently like she was something to be cherished. </p><p>Yeah… she was totally fucked.  </p><p>Her mother was going to flay her alive. She had ruined everything yet again because she was an omega. </p><p>“I can practically hear you thinking, cariño,” Rio mumbled into her neck. </p><p>The inflection made her heart flutter from the tenderness, swiftly pulling her from her doom spiral. She had never experienced this kind of connection with someone. When she wasn’t locked away in the basement, wallowing in shame, she had ridden out her heats with other omegas, but nothing could compare to this feeling. </p><p>How was it even possible to feel so fucking close to someone you met just hours prior?  </p><p>It felt like finding the piece of the puzzle that she wasn’t even aware had been missing—once snapped into place, everything made sense. Like she was finally complete. She could finally see a future with such vivid clarity, and it belonged with Rio, her alpha, her true mate.  </p><p>Mates were made for each other, if the tales of old spoke true. </p><p><em> Gods</em>. How incredibly wonderful and yet absolutely fucking terrifying all at the same time.   </p><p>“Do you… do you regret this?” Rio’s soft voice broke through her mental spiral, voice quivering, sounding so uncharacteristically small.  </p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed. “What?!” She regretted the snap of her voice, instantly lowering her tone. “No…” She lifted her head off the pillow and kissed the closest available skin, which was the other woman’s pouty lips. “I’m just thinking about the many firsts that happened tonight.”  </p><p>“Mm...” Rio smirked, the insecurity draining from her in seconds as she lifted her head to rest on her elbow. “Many memorable firsts but the night isn’t over yet…” she teased, giving a small wiggle to her hips. </p><p>Normally Agatha would have been utterly mortified by the snort that escaped her, but it was quickly swept away by a moan  as she shifted against her partner. She sucked in a sharp breath, feeling her walls clamp down harder around Rio’s cock. “We’re fucking knotted Rio!” she gasped, filled to the brim with a feeling of bliss. “I’ve... this is...”  </p><p>Rio leaned in and gently nipping at her earlobe. “I hope you know this was never just a rut for me, this is my first time knotting with anyone.” She shifted herself to a better angle to look at Agatha, moving her hand to trace the other woman’s collarbone with her fingertips. “You claimed me. We’re bonded now.”  </p><p>She kissed a trail down Agatha’s neck and then sucked slowly, completely and utterly surrounded by this woman who seemed to have been made for her. She couldn’t help but shift her hips forward yet again, groaning at the movement. She couldn’t thrust properly without hurting the other woman, but even the slow circles of her hips sent shivers down both their spines. </p><p>Agatha arched her back, caught in the overwhelming sensation that flooded her senses, she gasped. “Ah… I... I... ah... did say you were mine.” The moan Rio pulled from her was long and low as she desperately guided Rio’s lips to her own, kissing her deeply. “Fuck… why does this feels so good?” She panted heavily against the soft mouth, trying to catch her breath, shifting her hips as much as she was able with their tie so firmly in place. </p><p>Her mother had always told her knotting was <em> meant </em>to hurt, but nothing about this came close to the horror stories her mother had told her about. Honestly – all Agatha wanted in the world was to come again. </p><p>Closing her eyes, guilt settled in the pit of her stomach; Agatha had claimed Rio. Claiming someone was <em> sacred</em>. One-sided claims were... controversial to say the least, with only one partner able to feel the other’s emotions.  </p><p>They were mated and the claim was one-sided, and Agatha was now flooded with the older woman’s emotions. </p><p>Primarily her ecstasy. </p><p>Agatha bit down on her bottom lip as her own emotions warred with the onslaught of Rio’s. Sobered under the sudden weight of her impulsive actions, she whispered, “I’m sorry. I don't know what I was even thinking. I didn’t ask…” Her voice broke; shame flooded her senses, seeping as it always did into the very marrow of her bones. She could feel tears building up and not from pleasure. </p><p>“Hey, hey. No, Agatha… mi querida, mirame.” Rio placed her palm on Agatha’s cheek tenderly. “Look at me.” She pushed out a wave of calming pheromones on instinct, hoping to soothe the omega beneath her. Agatha’s watery eyes met her own. “You didn’t take anything I wasn’t willing to give you… I told you, there is no one else. I am yours to claim.” A small smile flickered across her lips. “I’ve probably always been yours to claim.” She paused, biting her lip. “Was I at least tasty?”  </p><p>Relief flooded Agatha at her <em> mate’s </em>reassuring words – settling something deep within her. </p><p>Mate, that was what Rio was. Her mate. </p><p>“You were delicious,” She paused, lips quirking upward. “Every single part of you is practically Michelin star worthy.” Her eyes danced, and there was a playful curve to her lips. </p><p>Rio groaned and pressed her hips down, needing as much contact as possible (though more contact was hardly even possible). “Fuck. Agatha. I barely know you and feel like I’ve known you all my life. You drive me crazy. I don’t let anyone touch me <em> like that, </em> not since Nicky. I’ve always been afraid, self-conscious… and you just... you touched me like it was nothing. Like... I’m not some freak.” </p><p>Agatha looped her arm around Rio’s waist, resting a hand against the small of her back. The pad of her thumb caressed the soft, warm skin there; she couldn’t contain her smile when the alpha closed her eyes and relaxed against her touch. “Not nothing, Rio. You’re not nothing, you’re not a freak. You’re... everything. Thank you for trusting me.”   </p><p>Rio let out a sigh and pressed their lips together again.  </p><p>Nothing had ever felt so right before. She pulled away from the kiss and looked down to the omega’s neck. “So…does this mean… I get to claim you back?” she asked softly, voice shaking just a bit with hope. </p><p>The silence that stretched between them was deafening and uncomfortable. Agatha's breathing quickened and anxiety spiked hard and fast within her; Rio's expression turned to one of absolute dejection when her request evoked such a sour taste of fear in the air. </p><p>“Rio… I…” Agatha started to say but then her voice broke – her chest was tight.  </p><p>Too tight.  </p><p>It was too hard to bring the words forth to her lips. </p><p><em> Mother is going to kill me.  </em> </p><p>The thought drummed deep within her core, repeating over and over and <em> over </em>again. There was no silencing it.  </p><p>What was she thinking?! </p><p>She hadn’t been and that was the problem. </p><p>Her mother was right – she was an impulsive, loose-moraled Jezebel. </p><p>“Hey. Está bien, mi amor. It’s okay…” The soft words cut through her stress-filled haze; Rio tried to soothe the trembling omega, with her own feelings on the possibility of rejection flying out the window at the signs of distress consuming Agatha. “Is this about the bruises from your mother?” </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, barely able to breathe. “How did you…” </p><p>Rio shook her head. “Agatha, sweetheart.” She placed her hand on Agatha’s cheek, using her thumb to wipe the stray tear sliding down. “That woman… the way she spoke to you.” Rio looked away, jaw clenching – focusing on the soft lights of the room, trying to suppress the anger welling up within her at memory of Evanora and her treatment of her own daughter. “We’re all lucky I didn’t rip her throat out at dinner.” </p><p>Agatha erupted into tears.  </p><p>She could feel Rio’s ire radiating under her skin – like an itch she knew she wouldn’t be able to relieve, the fresh claiming of her mate washing over her. Agatha could <em> feel </em> Rio in a way she didn’t think was possible.  </p><p>Rarely did she discuss the complex and turbulent relationship with her mother. Jen and Wanda had stopped attempting to address the subject; every time they pointed out the bruises and awful things Evanora had a tendency to say, Agatha would quickly dismiss it.  </p><p>She fully understood that her mother harbored animosity towards her since birth and merely tolerated her presence. Her father, Agatino, had always acted as a buffer between them and shielded her from Evanora's wrath. While her mother was cruel, critical, and demanded absolute perfection, her father had offered encouragement, patience, and love.  </p><p>Agatha tried to please her mother, but nothing was ever enough; doubly so after her father's death. Then, her mother's behavior became more controlling and abusive. Agatha had lost track of the countless times her sire would overpower her with her dominating pheromones until she was a trembling mess on the ground – bleeding, gasping for air, and begging for forgiveness.  </p><p>She understood the real danger her mother posed; she knew without a shadow of a doubt that if Evanora found out about this, she would make it go away like everything else good in her life.  </p><p>“If you claim me, she <em> will </em> know. She can’t know. She’s so, so… dangerous. I can’t lose you, too. Your son can’t lose you.” Her breath quickened; she felt like she might hyperventilate as panic wound even tighter around her chest. “I don’t think I’d survive losing you,” she choked out, with the devastating realization that after only a few hours she was in too deep now. </p><p>Rio could feel her knot beginning to deflate, their mix of fluids slowly starting to escape and trail down between her mate’s legs onto the bedding below. “Shhhh… it’s okay… we don’t have to. I’m yours. Okay? I’m yours.” She shifted a bit, pulling one of Agatha’s hands to the mark on her neck, still raw and red and throbbing in such a delightful way. “This? This means you won’t lose me… this means I belong to you.”  </p><p>Agatha choked back a sob, overwhelmed with the onslaught of emotions – heightened by the fresh claim and her heat. Rio’s words mixed with her anxiety and a flare of protectiveness pooling in the pit of her own stomach.  </p><p>“We only just met,” Rio continued. “We have time to figure this out. Plenty of it, in fact. I am not going anywhere, okay?” She pulled back more, slipping her cock from Agatha – even with her knot going down, she was still uncomfortably hard thanks to her heat-induced rut, and now was <em> not </em> the time for another round (thank you post nut clarity). “You claimed me, I’m your mate,” Rio continued to ramble, trying to quell her omega’s distress. “Nothing, and I mean <em> nothing</em>, is going to change that. Not even some old, washed-up hag like your mother.” </p><p>Agatha pushed herself up, feeling empty without Rio inside her. She wrapped her arms tight around the alpha’s waist, shoving her face into her chest, so very desperate to keep her close. “You don’t understand, I <em> want </em> it, Rio. I want your mark more than anything.” </p><p>Rio hugged her back. “I can wait for as long as you need, Agatha. You’re mine, right?” She pressed a firm kiss to the top of the other woman’s head before rolling over and letting gravity them down, smiling as Agatha adjusted herself against her.  </p><p>The omega now lay on top of the alpha, her legs straddling Rio’s waist, her hands sandwiched between the mattress and her mate’s shoulder blades. She pressed her cheek to Rio’s chest, sighing softly. Agatha closed her eyes to the feeling of being wrapped in the alpha’s arms, surrounded in her soothing scent, and could honestly say that she had never felt so safe. Rio pressed another kiss on the top of her head and lingered, breathing her in; it made her purr in contentment.  </p><p>Agatha shifted to turn her head, pressing her lips on Rio’s right clavicle. “I am yours, but I want to carry your mark on me too.” She choked back a sob, her chest swirling with emotion. “But my sire… my mother…” </p><p>Rio placed her hands to cradle her mate’s jaw, pulling her closer as she sealed their lips together again, desperately trying to pour every emotion into the kiss. “Agatha…” Rio whispered on her lips, pulling back just enough for their eyes to meet. “I. Am. Yours.”  </p><p><em> Mine </em> – her omega roared.  </p><p>Agatha growled into the kiss, her veins suddenly burning again with heat, but this time overcome with a desperate desire to possess.  </p><p>To dominate. </p><p>Rio was <b> hers. </b> </p><p>Agatha pulled their lips apart and rested her forehead on the older woman – feeling the warmth of her breath on her lips. When she opened her eyes, she and her omega knew this alpha, whose fiery pupils were gazing adoringly up at her, was meant for her. Agatha crashed their lips together; her mate tried to sit up but was pushed down until she was flat on her back.  </p><p>The older woman moaned, the scent of her omega’s delicious heat hitting her senses, <em> Fuck </em> it was rich – it made her eyes roll back and her mouth water. Rio slid her hands up to find purchase on her mate’s hips.  </p><p>The omega moved forward, peppering open mouth kisses across Rio’s chest till she reached her claiming bite. The alpha groaned and rocked her hips when she licked it. </p><p>Rio wasn’t entirely sure she could get any harder, her cock now tapping insistently at Agatha’s ass cheeks.  </p><p><em> Gods. </em> This felt incredible. </p><p>Agatha felt <em> powerful</em>. </p><p>In control. </p><p>The omega’s eyes were still darkened with desire, deep and turbulent blue like the ocean, threatening to pull her under her swell. Rio’s breath hitched, knowing she would gladly drown under her omega’s flux. “I’m your alpha now, Agatha,” Rio repeated without a hint of hesitation, fully aware of her submission. She was Agatha’s to take, to consume, over and over again. “You can be in control if you want to be.” </p><p>The omega inhaled sharply, feeling the overwhelming truth of her alpha’s words. It blossomed from her chest and radiated down and into her core – into her fucking soul.  </p><p>This is hers.  </p><p>This feeling.  </p><p>This connection.  </p><p>This woman was hers.  </p><p>Entirely.  </p><p>Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s navel, the muscles twitching at her touch. She slowly moved them up across the light brown skin until they reached Rio’s breasts. Rio groaned when Agatha flexed her fingers, kneading the other woman’s flesh. She leaned forward and took a nipple between her lips, mimicking what Rio had done for her only a short while before. Agatha released one nipple when her alpha hissed and focused on the other. Rio’s nails dug into meat of her thighs, hips rocking, dick rubbing against Agatha’s skin.  </p><p>The omega leaned back to look down at Rio, who was now staring desperately up at her. “I need you,” she murmured. </p><p>“Then take me,” Rio groaned out, eyes blown-out and as dark as pitch.  </p><p>Agatha ground her hips down. She was so wet and needy, she rubbed the slick dripping from her folds against Rio’s pelvis. She gently removed Rio’s firm hands from her waist and clasped them together. Then she leaned forward to place their joined hands above Rio’s head.  </p><p>The alpha let out a low growl as the omega trapped them, pinning her arms down. She bucked her hips upward, desperately rubbing her throbbing cock on the curve of her mate’s delectable ass.  </p><p>Agatha snarled, baring her teeth, and placed her mouth on the older woman’s neck, her canines scraping her claim mark. The alpha howled, thrusting her hips wildly.  </p><p><em> Fuck </em>— she needed Rio’s dick inside her again.  </p><p>The omega released one of Rio’s hands. “Be a good boy for me and keep these here,” she ordered, sliding her free hand down between them.  </p><p>Rio couldn’t argue even if she wanted to – never in her life had a partner called her a <em> good boy</em>.  </p><p>Daddy? Sure. Papi? Expected.  </p><p>Good boy? She was 99% certain in that moment that she didn’t have even two brain cells left to rub together.  </p><p>Lifting her hips, Agatha wrapped her fingers around Rio’s thick cock, earning her a strangled cry from the alpha.  </p><p>Agatha glanced up beneath her lashes at Rio, whose dark eyes were staring down between them, teeth sinking into her plump bottom lip as she watched the omega line her dick up with her dripping cunt. Her brows were furrowed, concentration etched across her features, radiating with desire.  </p><p>The omega moved her other hand and placed it at the center of Rio’s chest to steady herself. </p><p>Following the omega’s command, Rio braced her hands against the wooden headboard as if bound there. She was absolutely certain that the eighth wonder of the world was Agatha in control. She emanated a powerful confidence that took Rio's breath away. She was so fucking hot. The alpha would gladly let her take anything she wanted. The smell of her heat was driving Rio wild and when she felt the other woman’s slick dripping on the tip of her dick and sliding down her length?  </p><p>Well, needless to say she was not the gods’ strongest warrior – not that she could be expected to be, with this succubus of a woman atop her. She whimpered, unable to hold it back, eyes rolling back. </p><p>“Rio, look at me,” Agatha coaxed, air thick with the dizzying scent of their combined arousal.  </p><p>The alpha’s eyes slowly fluttered open, filled with an intense mix of vulnerability and fervent desire. A powerful wave of unspoken yearning and desperate need flooded from her, begging for either relief or to be put out of her misery. </p><p>Experiencing Rio's emotions through this newly established connection from her claim bite was siphoning an overwhelming spectrum of sensations throughout Agatha's body. She could feel the alpha’s deep longing for her, the pure joy of being able to knot with her mate, the unwavering devotion, the steadfast loyalty for her, the fierce possessiveness to keep her from harm, and an overflowing <em> happiness </em>that made Agatha want to cry again. </p><p>Every emotion was intense and vivid and fucking beautiful. They blended together in a way that made her feel deeply cherished, as if she was loved. It was like she had gained a window into Rio’s soul, revealing layers of affection and commitment she had never fathomed before with another person. </p><p>They were tied now, brought together by the accidental triggering of each other’s cycles. The undeniable attraction of their pheromones, just too irresistible for them to ignore — but reducing it down to the mere surrendering of their most basic instincts or yielding to their primal nature felt almost cheap.  </p><p>None of it made sense, but at the same time it did. There was something about Rio that was grounded in a gentle truth. The way she looked at Agatha was like she was staring at a long lost loved one that had finally returned.  </p><p>A simple – <em> ‘oh hey, there you are, welcome home.’ </em>   </p><p>They seemed practically fated from the moment they met – like atoms being pulled into a collision by electromagnetic forces. Destined to be whole, not separate. </p><p>Perhaps they <em> were </em>tied with fate’s string. </p><p>Rio’s strong emotions mixed with Agatha's own were so powerful it almost knocked the air out of her lungs. The alpha needed her, and not in the sense of needing to overpower or dominate someone… but needing someone to take her, to want her, completely. Rio, the woman laying beneath her, desperately wanted to be also consumed.  </p><p>To be seen.  </p><p>To be loved.  </p><p>It was an offering, a submission, an act of blinding faith.  </p><p>Rio was presenting Agatha with the gift of herself. She had let the omega claim her and trusted her enough to wait until Agatha was ready for more.  </p><p>The very definition of patience and understanding, rather than judgment and expectation. That alone was overwhelming and foreign to her. To have Rio’s devotion was so potent, Agatha didn’t know if she would ever be able to let it go.  </p><p>The euphoria that coursed through her.  </p><p>The power she felt.  </p><p>The love she echoed back – it was a feedback loop of emotion.  </p><p>Agatha slid the hand that was on Rio’s chest up to grip her throat, giving it a squeeze. The alpha let out a low, delighted growl that Agatha could feel oscillating beneath her fingertips.  </p><p>She stared at Rio with an all-consuming reverence. </p><p><em> Gods, </em> she was so beautiful.  </p><p>Rio whined, “Agatha, <em> please</em>.”  </p><p>The omega then flashed a dangerous grin as she finally mercilessly slammed her hips down on Rio’s cock. Ripping a thunderous cry from her mate.  </p><p>In truth – rocking her hips, being filled so completely, feeling her mate’s knot expand and rub against her folds – Agatha understood what true power really meant. </p><p>And she was never letting go.  </p>
