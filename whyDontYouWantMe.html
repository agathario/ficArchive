<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness was completely <em>okay.</em></p><p>She did not break two separate wine glasses, crash into a waiter and almost stab Jen’s hand with a steak knife because she was not fine. She was totally fine.</p><p>She was being <em>very</em> well behaved, thank you very much.</p><p>It completely did not matter to her that she was sitting in a restaurant on what should have been a very happy day, you know, celebrating her promotion with her friends, yada yada, and that it turned into objectively the worst day when <em>she</em> walked in.</p><p><em>She</em> being the she-devil that was hanging off Rio’s arm like she didn’t have a spine of her own and would fucking fall apart if she let Rio go.</p><p>When Rio walked in an hour ago hand in hand with the woman, Agatha admitted internally that she was pretty. She had deep red hair, long legs and a sweet smile. Agatha was ready to fist pump Rio and flirt relentlessly with her date while winking at her friends at the panic she incited. And then Rio opened her fucking mouth.</p><p>“This is my girlfriend, Natasha.” Rio smiled, looking over at the redhead shyly.</p><p>Agatha’s blood boiled.</p><p>Because Natasha’s dress was far too fucking short for the restaurant they were in and her legs were <em>unnaturally</em> long, like freakishly long, and she was embarrassing them all by smiling <em>so</em> much. She looked like an idiot. She was making them all look like idiots.</p><p>Agatha hated feeling like an idiot.</p><p>“You can call me Nat!” She said, sitting by Rio. She giggled when Rio kissed her bare shoulder.</p><p>That’s when the first glass broke.</p><p>It was because Agatha was inspecting how much force a glass could take for scientific purposes. Not because her best friend was saddling up to a girl and calling her ‘girlfriend,’ since when did Rio have <em>girlfriends</em>?</p><p>Rio never did <em>committed</em> relationships. Sure, she was sexually active and once in a while she would bring girls over to meet her friends, but they never lasted longer than a week. And no labels, certain or uncertain, were ever used.<br/>
Ever since she and Agatha met in college, she always had one foot out the door. Her parents were always at each other’s throats, the Puerto-Rican fire never fully meshing well with the Irish stubbornness. Somehow, Rio got both the responsibility of holding her parents together and their ire. But the one thing her parents stood firm on, never wavering no matter how much it was threatened, was never getting divorced even though they couldn’t look each other in the eye. So, obviously, Rio looked at relationships with the same enthusiasm that most people looked at a puppy getting kicked.</p><p>It took Agatha three months to convince her that yes, they were friends. It took a year to get her to admit they were best friends. It took filming an entire movie together, literally working side by side for six months, burning the midnight oil, fielding challenges together, seeing each other cry and fail and succeed, for Rio to admit that they knew each other inside out. And Agatha didn’t blame her. With an absent father and an overbearing mother, she had her own fair share of family-related avoidance issues to battle through.</p><p>Honestly, together, they had them all. Rio was fearful avoidant, Agatha was dismissive avoidant and together they were just avoidant and avoidant. It’s why they never dated.</p><p>That and the fact that they immediately friend-zoned each other.</p><p>“So, how did you two meet?” Jen asked Rio and Nat while a waiter cleaned up the glass from Agatha’s hand. She was lucky there was no blood. She was also lucky no one really paid her any specific attention either because then they would have seen the daggers she was shooting the ginger tramp.</p><p>“We met at a coffee shop,” Nat replied, resting her head on her hand and looking at Rio with big loving eyes. Barf.</p><p>“That’s so <em>boring</em>,” Agatha snorted.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “I thought you would swoon over the meet-cute.”</p><p>“Meeting in a coffee shop is not a meet-cute.” Agatha said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>Rio stuck her tongue in her check. <em>Uh-oh</em>. “Sorry, we couldn’t pull up to The Getty, Agatha. Not everyone gets a true meet-cute.”</p><p>This <em>bitch</em>. “You wouldn’t.” Agatha threatened, waving her knife around menacingly.</p><p>“Okay, I will take this away,” Lilia said, grabbing the knife out of Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Oh, it’s a butter knife, stop exaggerating,” Agatha rolled her eyes again.</p><p>“Is this from the iconic first meeting?” Alice prodded, and Agatha wondered how many times she could roll her eyes before they fell out.</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio smirked.</p><p>“Wait, what is happening?” Nat perked up.</p><p>“They had a crazy first meeting,” Jen filled Nat in, leaning over conspiratorially.</p><p>“But they won’t tell anyone about it,” Alice whined.</p><p>“All we know is that it was hilarious and that it happened at The Getty,” Lilia provided helpfully.</p><p>“We just found out it happened at The Getty,” Jen deadpanned.</p><p>“Come on, babe. Tell us!” Nat nudged Rio with her shoulder.</p><p>“Well, I always try but someone here might actually shoot me.” Rio said, rubbing her hand sweetly on Nat’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha ran her finger across her throat with a lot of menace.</p><p>“And that’s that.” Rio said, moving the subject swiftly to something else. Agatha didn’t know whether to be relieved or annoyed.</p><p>“I’m going to go to the little girl’s room.” Agatha said abruptly and not because she dropped her fork, looked under the table and watched Rio and the whore play footsie.</p><p>She stood quickly, chair jutting out, ready to make her exit when Nat perked up, “I have to go too!”</p><p>Agatha spun around, wide-eyed. “What?”</p><p>But Nat was already getting up and fixing her dress. Agatha felt like a cornered dog. She tried to get away faster, like they weren’t going to the same place, but suddenly she was tripping headfirst into a waiter and being doused with an obscene amount of water. Who fucking carries that amount of water in a single tray anyway? Was the waiter running for a fucking world record?</p><p>“Shit, Agatha, are you okay?” Rio jumped up and ran over to Agatha who was soaking wet on the floor next to a million glasses.</p><p>“What do you think, <em>buddy</em>?” Agatha sneered, still taking Rio’s hand and letting her haul her up anyway.</p><p>“I think I have a shirt in my trunk!” Alice bolted out the door. No waiters hit her on her way out. Fucking assholes, this was fixed!</p><p>Agatha stomped to the bathroom, Nat and Rio trailing behind apprehensively.</p><p>“Are you okay, Agatha?” Nat asked hesitantly.</p><p>“I fucking got an entire swimming pool’s worth of water poured on me, of course, I’m not okay,” Agatha barked. Nat seemed to shrink under her gaze. But it only made Rio comfort her more.</p><p>Agatha slammed the door of the bathroom far too violently.</p><p>“Agatha, you need to chill.” Rio tried, but Agatha locked herself in a stall and leaned her forehead on the metal door.</p><p>“I need a minute,” she whispered, hoping Rio would understand and leave her alone.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio said from the other side. She heard someone wash their hands and then the door closing.</p><p>At that moment, for no specific reason, Agatha felt like crying. It definitely wasn’t because of the water that had been spilled all over her and the fact that she was sure the makeup had melted off her face and how her dinner was most definitely ruined. It <em>might</em> have been because of the way Rio was fucking looking at Nat all night. The way it was clearly so much more than sex. The way it was un-<em>fucking</em>-fair.</p><p>What did the ginger bitch have that Agatha didn’t? Agatha was hotter. Objectively. She was more successful. They were literally at her promotion dinner. Oh, and most importantly, she knew Rio so much fucking better than Nat ever better, better than even Rio knew herself. She was there when Rio couldn’t crack her thesis film, sitting out in the cold, half a pack of cigarettes smoked, questioning the state of the world. She was there when Rio didn’t want to go home for the summer, sleeping on Agatha’s couch, working at the local burger joint. She had seen her at her worst. She had been there at her best. She knew how Rio thought, what fueled her, why she ran, why she cried.</p><p>It should fucking count for something right? Like a call or a warning, like hey, I’m bringing a redhead nightmare to dinner, you good with it? <em>Something</em>.</p><p>That’s what was eating Agatha inside. The <em>inconsideration</em>.</p><p>She deserved a text from her best friend letting her know that she asked someone else to be her girlfriend. That she had swapped around her entire worldview. That she had miraculously cured all her attachment issues. Because it was <em>courteous</em>. Because Agatha would have had time to process all the emotions she had trapped shut at the bottom of the tartarus sized pit in her heart. The feelings she barely whispered to herself.</p><p>You know, the ones that burned through her when she and Rio lay side-by-side, not touching, but breathing the same air and she felt safe and whole. Or when she called Rio at seven in the morning and Rio, half-asleep, dodged morning rush traffic to come sit with her while she cried. It was the comfort they had built for years. It was the scraps Agatha accepted so hungrily because she knew that Rio and her would never be <em>right</em>. There would always be ultimatums and walk-outs and toxic make-ups. That they would drive each other off a cliff. That Rio would never <em>date</em>.</p><p>And now she was having to swallow a very painful pill. That Rio never wanted to date <em>her</em>.</p><p>Because the truth was right there, staring at her with such painful force. They never touched. <em>Ever</em>. No casual brushes, no hugging, no hanging off each other. Rio was basically human jelly, she leaned against everything and everyone without worry, but never Agatha. Not like Agatha sought her out anyway. They were always close, side by side, never touching. No casual friendship touches. No touches at all.</p><p>Agatha had always thought it made them special. Now, it felt like yet another way Rio was telling her where she stood in her life.</p><p>They never did the emotional stuff either. The affirmations and words of encouragement. There was a whole six months Agatha thought Rio hated her because she wouldn’t talk to her about something that was not work or her thesis. But she talked to Alice. And Lilia. And even fucking Jen. Talked to them and touched them and leaned on them. But Agatha brushed it off as a quirk of how close they were, that they didn’t need to hold each other's hands. That they knew who they were to each other and were secure in just knowing each other completely.</p><p>But the nail in the coffin, the most damning thing that came back to her in that moment and nestled in her heart, was Rio forgetting Agatha’s screening and not realizing until a whole four days later. Four days that Agatha cried and almost murdered everyone during. It didn’t matter that Rio was home during that time, dealing with her parents. It didn’t matter Rio didn’t really give an apology. She fucking <em>forgot</em>. Agatha had swallowed many excuses of her own making then.</p><p>But Agatha knew her place now. All the lies she told herself melted away and she felt the full brunt of her delusion, clear and simple. She knew where she belonged in Rio’s life, and it was not near the top.</p><p>“Agatha, you okay?” Alice asked from the other side of the door.</p><p>“Yeah, fine,” came Agatha’s watery reply.</p><p>“I have a shirt for you!” Alice threw a large white shirt above the bathroom stall. Agatha caught it and threw it over her damp dress.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said when she walked out, hoping Alice would ignore her red-rimmed eyes and the splotches all over her face.</p><p>But Alice wasn’t the only one out there, was she?</p><p>“Agatha, are you okay?” Rio looked at her, worry creasing her face.</p><p>“Never better,” Agatha tried to say cheerfully but it came out a lot more robotic than she hoped.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio stopped her and tried to reach out, but pulled away before she made contact. “Did I mess up? Should I have not brought Nat?”</p><p><em>Yes. Get her the fuck out of here.</em> “No, no, it’s all okay. Just been a long day,” Agatha lied through her teeth.</p><p>
<em>She was dying inside. </em>
</p><p>“Okay, good. I really like her. I want her to hang out with us more.”</p><p>
<em>She was never going to recover from this. </em>
</p><p>Agatha flashed her best attempt at smiled and turned away, washing her face in the bathroom sink and hoping a snake would crawl out of the tap and kill her. No such luck. Pity.</p><p>Alice had already returned to the table and when Agatha and Rio came back into the restaurant, everyone turned to her with sympathy.</p><p>“If one of you says you’re sorry or even utters a word about how you feel bad, I’ll leave here screaming, change my name and move to Mexico.”</p><p>Rio burst out laughing beside her. “I would pay good money to see you in Mexico.”</p><p>“<em>¡Espero que mueras en el infierno!</em>” Agatha said in broken Spanish, but it only made Rio laugh harder.</p><p>Agatha huffed as she sat down, rattling the silverware.</p><p>“This reminds me of the day we met,” Rio said as she dried her eyes.</p><p>“Oh, please, come on, it’s been years, just tell us!” Alice groaned.</p><p>Rio looked over at Agatha and raised her brow. Agatha felt a rush of happiness that she violently suppressed. <em>Fuck it.</em> Rio wasn’t hers. So why should she keep this story wrapped away then?</p><p>“Tell them,” Agatha mumbled. Rio’s eyebrows shot up her forehead. Everyone cheered.</p><p>“Seriously?” Rio leaned forward, trying to make sure she heard Agatha right.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “You can tell them.”</p><p>Rio looked very shaken, but quickly recovered, a brilliant smile taking over her face. “Uh, um, okay, so let me set the scene.” She cleared her throat dramatically, and Agatha was already regretting this. “First thing I do as a freshman is I join this ‘Women in Film’ group chat, right. I thought it would be super fun but it’s these girls just going at it, like immediately, <em>what is your Letterboxed? Who's your favorite filmmaker?</em> And I am freaking out because everyone has this crazy niche taste and I am from fucking Delaware so I get super intimidated and don’t really say anything. And I watch this one girl, boy, she’s going <em>crazy</em>, like blowing up the chat talking about a BBC television show from the nineties about Pride and Prejudice.”</p><p>“It wasn’t <em>about</em> Pride and Prejudice. It <em>was</em> Pride and Prejudice. Uncultured swine.” Agatha snarked.</p><p>“Let me guess, you were the girl?” Lilia smirked.</p><p>“She was,” Rio replied, smiling bigger. “And she really sold me on this show, even though it was like seven hours of very period-accurate television. And the next day she went off in this ninety people group chat about a different weird TV show and I was like, <em>who is this girl</em>? Keep in mind, we were <em>freshmen</em>.”</p><p>“We were literally film majors, Rio. Having an opinion on film is our entire education. It <em>literally</em> comes with the territory.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but there was no frustration, only fondness. “<em>Anyway</em>, a few days later, I saw this exhibit was going up at The Getty about life in the eighteen hundreds and for some reason I kept thinking about the girl from the group chat and I didn’t want to go alone, so I asked her to come with me.”</p><p>
<em>Rio couldn’t stop thinking about her?</em>
</p><p>“And she said yes, and I bought the tickets. And the whole morning I was shaking, like fully shaking. My freshmen-year roommates were like where are you going and when I told them, they convinced me it was a <em>date</em>, like I had asked her out on a date, and I was like no, it can’t be, and I started to hyperventilate.”</p><p>
<em>Wait, what? Agatha didn’t know this part.</em>
</p><p>“And we lived in the same dorms so we said we would meet right outside but I had no idea what she would look like and suddenly this beautiful girl is talking to me and I am flattered but like I need to find the girl I am going to the museum with, so I am not really engaging. Of course, it turns out to be Agatha. And she gives me so much shit for it the entire way to The Getty.”</p><p>
<em>Rio thought Agatha was beautiful? What?</em>
</p><p>“And we go to the museum, and we are talking, normal topics, but the entire time I can’t figure out if it was a date or not.”</p><p>
<em>This part tracks. Agatha couldn’t figure out if it was a date either. But she thought that was more what happens when two clearly queer women go out.</em>
</p><p>“But it’s going great, we talk for like three hours straight and then we go to a farmer’s market and go get food. And suddenly, she was like, <em>I have to go home</em>. And I am like, <em>what</em>? But she flags down a cab and we get in, food in one hand, water in the other and we are still talking and suddenly, she throws up all over the back of the taxi.”</p><p>Everyone bursts into laughter. Agatha wanted to crawl in a hole and die.</p><p>“I had a very bad stomach bug!” She whined.</p><p>“The taxi driver immediately throws us out and suddenly we are stranded on the side of the street, food in hand and Agatha is trying very hard to pretend like she didn’t just throw up.”</p><p>“I wanted to die,” Agatha moaned, putting her wine glass back down with too much force and cracking the stem.</p><p>“That’s it, we are cutting you off,” Lilia said, flagging down a waiter who shot her a very dirty look as he took away the broken glass.</p><p>“Did you not hear Rio recount the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me?” Agatha whined.</p><p>“That was the second glass you personally broke, Agatha,” Jen said from her other side. “Not to mention the thirty you accidentally broke earlier.”</p><p>Agatha muttered something along the lines of a death threat but didn’t order another drink, instead folding her hands tightly.</p><p>“How did it end?” Nat asked, leaning into Rio. Rio’s smile got bigger.</p><p>“She walked me to the dorm, I puked my guts out for a week, and we have been friends since.” Agatha finished, ready for this to be done.</p><p>“Well, I think it was a very fun story, Agatha,” Nat chimed in kindly. Agatha wanted to carve her eyes out with a spoon.</p><p>“Yes, much more interesting than a <em>coffee shop</em>.” Agatha said, malice intended.</p><p>“Agatha, I can’t believe you threw--” Before Jen could finish her thought, Agatha picked up her steak knife and stabbed it really close to her hand.</p><p>“Never mention it again,” Agatha said simply.</p><p>“You non-stop sociopath!” Jen yelled.</p><p>The night ended very quickly after that. Agatha, the only one without a car, stood outside waiting for her Uber as the rest of them filtered out into their cars. She would have asked Rio to drive her home, but after everything that happened today, she assumed she was going home with Nat.</p><p>“Need a ride?” Rio said, leaning on the wall next to her.</p><p>Agatha jumped a little. “I thought you would have taken Nat home.”</p><p>“Nah, she drove here and wanted to drive back.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha looked up at Rio. Her hair looked like it had been pushed back again and again. Agatha wondered what it would feel like to run her hands through that hair.</p><p>“Sure,” she choked out, when all she wanted to say was <em>sure, take me home to my sad studio apartment where I will spend the night dreaming of you</em>.</p><p>Rio smiled and took her keys off the carabiner that hung from one of her front belt loops. Her car was not far at all, but Agatha felt like it was an eternity. She wanted to memorize every movement, how Rio’s hair swayed at the ends when she walked, how she had folded her formal blazer up to her elbows, which would seem annoying and stupid on most people but it revealed her toned forearms and Agatha was surprised how that could make her weak in the knees.</p><p>She hated how Rio would smile at her and she would melt. She hated how she wanted to be here, in this moment, forever. She hated how Rio didn’t love her. She hated that she cared.</p><p>Rio opened the door for her, without asking. Agatha wanted to cry.</p><p>Rio played her favorite music, popping open her favorite playlist without even hesitating. Agatha needed her to fucking stop.</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t say it,” Rio said as Agatha put on her seatbelt. “Congratulations on your promotion to editor! You finally did it!”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Can’t believe you let me tell them the story,” Rio smirked.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “It was time.”</p><p>“Didn’t think you would ever say that,” Rio said, tapping her fingers on the wheel as they waited for the light to turn red. Agatha lived close by, thankfully.</p><p>“People change.” Agatha offered. Because that is all she could give. Only three more streets.</p><p>“Yeah, people do. Thank god, we never dated,” Rio said casually.</p><p>Agatha almost died.</p><p>“What do you mean?” She whispered.</p><p>“I mean, I was so close to asking you out that day. But I am glad we are friends. We would have killed each other if we got together. Here we are,” Rio said as they pulled up to Agatha’s apartment building.</p><p>Agatha felt her heart breaking. It felt like it was suddenly a sieve and everything, all the pain and longing and sadness of the years that Agatha had hoped and wished and prayed for Rio, just burst through. She tried laughing but it came out closer to a mangled sob. She tore the seatbelt off, and climbed out. Just before she closed the door, she leaned in, possibly making the worst mistake of her life.</p><p>But she didn’t care. She had to say <em>something</em>.</p><p>“Rio,” she said softly. Rio looked up, smiling fading once she noticed Agatha’s expression.</p><p>“I would have loved to be yours.”</p>

<p>Rio Vidal was <em>losing</em> her mind.</p><p>She was sitting in her car in the driveway of Agatha’s apartment building and she couldn’t move.</p><p>
<em>I would have loved to be yours.</em>
</p><p>What the fuck? What the fuck did she mean? Because if she meant that she would love to be Rio’s then Rio would have to invest in an early grave.</p><p><em>I would have</em> loved <em>to be </em><em>yours.</em></p><p>The image of Agatha being hers was too overwhelming. Too, too much. Even though Rio secretly dreamed of it every goddamn night. Even though Rio whispered it like a prayer when she thought no one was watching. Because it couldn’t be true. Agatha never looked at her like that.</p><p>She doesn’t even know how she ended up at Lilia’s. She was trying to go home.</p><p>“Rio?” Lilia had opened her door, already in her night clothes, looking like she was ready to go to bed. “What the hell are you doing here?” She stood in the doorway, arms crossed.</p><p>“What--What does it mean?” Rio said, walking by her and into the house.</p><p>“And you’re coming in,” Lilia shook her head. Rio was already taking her shoes off.</p><p>“She said she would have loved to be mine.” Rio was now pacing.</p><p>“Who did?” Lilia fell back on her couch. “Nat?”</p><p>“No, Agatha. Agatha told me she would have <em>loved</em> to be <em>mine.</em>”</p><p>“Oh shit.”</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“Rio, I think we both know what it means.”</p><p>“No, does-- does it mean she loves me like a friend? What does ‘be mine’ mean anyway? She isn’t a thing to own. Or does she-- or--”</p><p>“Rio.” Lilia grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her. “Why do you care?”</p><p>Rio wasn’t listening. Rio was pulling her hair out. Rio was pacing.</p><p>“Why did she say that? What did it mean?”</p><p>“Oh boy, I am going to need backup for this one won’t I?” Lilia stalked out, muttering under her breath as she roused the neighbors. Alice and Jen very conveniently lived across the hall.</p><p>Rio couldn’t hear her. Rio couldn’t breathe. Rio was hyperventilating.</p><p>Did Agatha love her? No. She said loved. Which means past tense. Which meant Rio missed her chance. Rio somehow missed her chance with Agatha. That should have been impossible. There was never a chance in the first place, right? They spent so much goddamn time together, surely Rio would have caught that Agatha wanted there to be a chance. <em>What the fuck.</em></p><p>Why did she say it like that? I would have loved to be yours. Like she couldn’t just be? I <em>would have loved to be yours.</em> She could be. Rio was going to throw up.</p><p>“What did she say? Exactly.” Jen asked when she came in, Alice and Lilia a step behind.</p><p>“I would have loved to be yours.” Rio all but yelled.</p><p>“Damn, I didn’t think baby girl would ever come close to admitting the big crush she had on you.”</p><p><em>“What?”</em> Rio came to a screeching stop and stared at her three friends. “What did you say?”</p><p>“You heard me,” Jen said, throwing her legs on the coffee tables in front of the couch.</p><p>“Agatha had a crush on me?” Rio choked out.</p><p>“Rio, come on, you have to have seen it.” Lilia said, gesturing wildly to the space around her. “We all saw it for <em>years</em>.”</p><p>Rio did not see it. In fact, Rio did not know how it could be obvious considering how much time Rio spent staring at Agatha. Wait, <em>years</em>?</p><p>“I--I didn’t know.” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Rio, tomorrow we are going to the doctors and getting that autism diagnosis, I swear to god.” Alice muttered behind Rio.</p><p>“So, she had feelings for me?”</p><p>Everyone nodded slowly. Rio was going to have to spend so much money on her expedited funeral because her heart was going to fail in the next five minutes. She could feel it dying.</p><p>“Has or had? Does she still? How long have you guys known?”</p><p>“I think you are missing the point here, Rio.” Jen said, crossing her arms. “Don’t you have a girlfriend?”</p><p>Rio stared blankly. Agatha hadn’t said yes yet.</p><p>“Nat?”</p><p>
<em>Oh shit.</em>
</p><p>“Did… did you forget about Nat?” Jen said eyebrows raised.</p><p>“<em>No.</em> Yes. It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“Rio, why do you care if Agatha has a crush on you or not?” Alice asked, slightly suspiciously.</p><p>Because it-- because--</p><p>
<em>They were sitting in the film lab, screens blinking in the darkness, people clicking away, losing their minds. Rio and Agatha sat side by side at adjoining monitors, secret snacks between their stations. They weren’t allowed to have them, but that’s what made Agatha bring them in the first place. They were working on their separate theses, and it was not going well. AVID was on a super personal mission to make them cry.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha’s hard drive had almost corrupted twice, but she was able to recover it from the backup on the computer. Rio had seen the doom spiral spin thrice, but lived. Two separate IT support people had to console them when they realized one of the dailies didn’t fully load.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was one of the most excruciating days of her life.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And then Agatha leaned over and handed her a red box. Rio turned it over to find speciality Kit-Kats, the Sakura Green Tea ones, the ones she had grown up eating, no savoring because she only got them when her best friend brought them home from Japan. The ones she could not find anywhere in this godforsaken country. But they were here, in her hands. Somehow Agatha had found them.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She looked up at Agatha, brow raised, questioning. Agatha just shrugged.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“There’s a store that sells them nearby.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“No, there isn’t.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“There is in San Diego.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You drove all the way to San Diego to get me these?” Rio choked out.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It was no biggie.” Agatha turned back to her screen.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“We live in Los Angeles.” Rio stuttered out.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It was on the way.” Agatha was already pulling her headphones up.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio wanted to kiss her. Rio wanted to cry.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Why did it matter?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because it changes everything. </em>
</p><p>“Because it changes everything,” Rio said out loud.</p><p>“Why?” Lilia pushed.</p><p>
<em>Rio remembered when Agatha decided she was going to be a theatrical director and was going to put on a very ambitious student play. She remembered how she offered to stage manage even though she had no fucking idea what she was doing. Anything for Agatha, that was what she lived by then.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Let’s be honest, it is what she still lived by now.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She spent the next three weeks googling what a show bible was and how to notate blocking and what a daily call was and watching youtube videos on how to call a show. She was so in over her head. But then she would go to rehearsal and Agatha would start talking and Rio would lose all sense and reason. Because she was a visionary. Because she brought out feelings in Rio she didn’t know she had. Rio had spent her entire life running and for the first time in existence, all Rio wanted to do was stay and listen.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She remembered wanting Agatha to stay back and talk through the next day’s schedule when they would finish, Agatha would make a joke about them being partners.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And it made Rio come alive.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because that is what they were. Partners. Doing this together.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio knew when Agatha didn’t understand a scene by the fact that she let the actors talk more. Rio knew when Agatha was tired because she always showed up with blue Gatorade. Rio always had sour worms on her table because she knew that Agatha inhaled them when she was stressed.</em>
</p><p>
<em>For those three weeks, they were each other’s lifelines. And it meant everything. </em>
</p><p>“Because--” Rio started but the words died on her tongue.</p><p>
<em>Because Agatha meant everything.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because if Rio thought there was ever a chance she would have torn the world apart. </em>
</p><p>“Rio, sweetie, you have such a wonderful girlfriend. I think you should move on from whatever this is.”</p><p>
<em>She never knew she had something to move on from. Nat was smart and sweet and kind but she didn’t know how to talk Rio off a ledge when she was scared and she didn’t have unruly hair that made Rio want to run her hands through it all day long. She didn’t put Rio in her place with one scathing comment. But mostly because she wasn’t Agatha.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because Rio’s entire existence wasn’t wrapped up in her. </em>
</p><p>Rio stopped listening then. “I have to go, I have to talk to--”</p><p>Lilia interrupted then, shaking her head. “Rio, do you think she’s just jealous?”</p><p>Rio froze. “Jealous?”</p><p>“I mean, we all know how jealous she can get. Remember when she dated Wanda?”</p><p>
<em>How could Rio forget?</em>
</p><p>
<em>The Wanda era haunted Rio. Agatha had met Wanda after the brief but enthusiastic attempt as a director. Wanda was a Theatre major, capital T. She lived, breathed, ate her craft as an actor. Rio had thought Wanda was weird when she first met her, but Agatha had found Wanda endearing.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The next thing Rio heard Agatha had invited Wanda for a movie at her place.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Within a week, they were dating.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You move fast,” Jen had said when she broke the news to their friends.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Well, when I want something I get it.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>That pierced Rio deeper than she would like to admit. She thought about it longer than she should have, night after night for months, silently crying when she thought Alice had slept.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Why didn’t Agatha want her? It was a hard pill to swallow.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Wanda and Agatha were like a wildfire. Suddenly, Wanda was everywhere. They basically UHauled within the first three months of their relationship. Wanda all but moved into Agatha’s single in the sophomore dorms. Their wardrobes merged. Their personalities merged. They spent all day together. All night. All their friend game nights and movie nights and all of Rio’s late night facetimes with Agatha. Wanda was always there, lurking in the background.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha and Wanda dated for little more than a year. Rio was mostly okay during that time, especially once she successfully suppressed her stupid feelings and befriended Wanda.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio, begrudgingly, only with a very big gun pointed to her head, would admit she actually did like Wanda. They were very similar people. They made similar jokes. They liked the same music. They had the same nonchalance when Agatha’s theatrics flared up.</em>
</p><p>
<em>There were times Agatha was cooking and Rio would talk to Wanda. They would joke about how Rio was Agatha’s work wife and Wanda felt like a mistress. They would whisper conspiratory over Agatha’s big moments and Wanda would always ask Rio if Agatha was okay. Because the saving grace through it all was that Agatha still kept Rio closer to her than anyone else.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It always seemed like Wanda tried too hard with Rio, like she was trying to impress her somehow. Rio never understood why Wanda seemed to need her validation so much, but she let Wanda fester for a while before she gave her the friendship she so desperately sought.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And then Agatha broke it off. No reason, really. Just ended it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Wanda had tried talking to Rio but Rio was as confused as she was.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I have no idea why, Wanda,” Rio was trying to calm down the sobbing woman who was throwing Agatha’s things into a box.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh, I am sure you know why,” Wanda wailed, throwing a shirt in the box.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It was out of the blue for all of us, she just went home and we don’t know what happened there, who said what, and now we are here,” Rio tried again.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio, don’t be fucking stupid. You know why, hell, even if I don’t want to admit it, I know why.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio didn’t get any chance to figure out the reason because Agatha called then and Rio went running.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When she got to Agatha’s apartment, Agatha was drunk.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“What are you doing?” Rio had wondered, half surprised, half concerned.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Pre-gaming.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Pre-gaming?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Yup, we are going to the theatre club party.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“We are going to the theatre club party?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Is your brain broken? Why do you keep repeating what I am saying?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Why are we going to the theatre club party?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Because I need to win the breakup, Rio.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“There is no winning, Agatha. You dumped her. You won. She’s going fucking crazy.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Well, I need to bury her then.” Agatha took another swing of the vodka bottle.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Why did you do it?” Rio was suddenly very brave.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It’s just vodka.” Agatha tried shrugging it off.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“No, no. Why did you break up with her?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha was silent for a while. “She wasn’t who I thought she was.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Before Rio could prod any further, Agatha’s phone started buzzing.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Taxi is here!” She said cheerfully and Rio knew Agatha was not making it back home herself.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Fuck, give me a second.” Rio grabbed her keys and wallet and ran behind the mad woman.</em>
</p><p>
<em>They arrived at an abandoned warehouse that had been converted into an off-site theatre venue that student groups used sometimes, and which was far more bustling than Rio thought it could be. Theatre nerds, they knew how to party.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Before Rio was even fully out of the car, Agatha already had two drinks in her hand.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh, thank you,” Rio said, reaching her hand out for the second drink.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Get your own,” Agatha yanked the drink back and chugged it sloppily, wiping her mouth with her arm and throwing the red solo cup in the bushes.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Okay, Agatha was acting more unhinged than usual. Something was up.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Agatha, what are we doing here?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I told you,” Agatha said, eyes roaming the crowd. “I’m winning.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Why does it matter?” Rio tried a different tactic.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Will you make out with me?” Agatha suddenly turned to her, desperation lacing her voice.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“What?” Rio would have done a spit take if she was drinking anything. Thankfully, she was not. So, she stood there gaping instead.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh, for fucks sake,” Agatha said, turning around and shoving her tongue into the first girl she found.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio realized why. Across the room she saw Wanda, crying, staring at the scene in shock. </em>
</p><p>“She’s jealous, Rio.” Alice emphasized.</p><p><em>Jealous of what?</em> Rio wanted to ask. <em>Jealous of whom? </em></p><p>“Let’s go find her,” Rio said instead. “Ask her these questions, you know, instead of speculating.”</p><p>“Right now?” Lilia asked, baffled.</p><p>“This actually might be the most sensible way to go about it.” Jen chimed in, looking around for Lilia’s car keys.</p><p>Alice was throwing on her jacket. Lilia groaned and walked out behind them. They all piled into her car and she sighed as she walked up to the driver's seat.</p><p>“Where to?” Lilia asked but Rio was already putting Agatha’s home address into the GPS.</p><p>They got there in record time. Partially because Lilia was an insane driver who should not have a car (and even more so should not have a driver’s license), and partially because Rio was vibrating so hard Lilia was scared she would explode.</p><p>And then Rio was knocking on Agatha’s door. Okay, it was more like pounding.</p><p>Agatha opened the door. She was wearing barely there pajama shorts and a thin camisole, a black floral robe that hung loosely around her, exposing her shoulder.</p><p>“Rio?” She said slowly. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“What did you--” Rio started and then she saw the angry mark on Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Who is it?” came a familiar voice from inside the studio.</p><p>
<em>Wanda.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Wanda was there. In Agatha’s apartment. In the middle of the night.</em>
</p><p>“Who is there?” Rio heard Lilia ask. But Rio had stopped processing.</p><p>Fuck, Rio felt <em>so</em> stupid.</p><p>
<em>Why did she think this could be different? Why did she think this could be anything? She was going to give up a sweet, nice future with Nat for this? </em>
</p><p>She probably said it because she was jealous. It meant nothing.</p><p>“I didn’t-- You-- Why are you here?” Agatha trembled.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” Rio cut in. “We are leaving.”</p><p>“Wait--” Agatha reached out, grabbing Rio’s hand. “Please tell me, why are you here?”</p><p>Tears filled Rio’s eyes looking at Agatha’s hand holding her wrist.</p><p>They never touched. Never.</p><p>“I thought I had a chance.” Rio looked up to find Agatha staring back at her with shock. “Turns out, I was wrong.”</p><p>Rio shook her hand out of Agatha’s hold and fled down the stairs.</p>

<p>Agatha Harkness was a fucking idiot.</p><p>No, way worse than a fucking idiot.</p><p>“You’re genuinely the biggest moron I have ever met,” Jen told her in no uncertain terms after Rio ran away.</p><p>“She-- she-- why?” Agatha’s brain felt like it was on fire. Words were melting in her skull.</p><p><em>Why was Rio at her door so late at night? What did Rio mean when said she thought she had a chance?</em> She <em>was the one dating someone. </em></p><p>“What the fuck, Agatha?” Alice said, crossing her arms.</p><p>“No, what the fuck, Rio!” Agatha said pointing after Rio.</p><p>“Why did you say what you did and then go call your ex?” Lilia sniped, raising her brow.</p><p>“Are you all forgetting the dinner we were at like what three hours ago where Rio brought <em>her girlfriend?</em>” Agatha said, her brain finally returning from the prolonged trip it was on. “I didn’t do anything wrong! She doesn’t get to do this. She doesn’t get to be the victim. Rio is <em>dating</em> someone else.”</p><p>Everyone had the decency to look embarrassed.</p><p>“You’re right. We’re all drunk and not thinking correctly. We’ll see you tomorrow,” Lilia said, shuffling the lot away. “Good night, Agatha!”</p><p>“And Wanda!” Alice called as they left.</p><p>“Was that Alice?” Wanda said once Agatha closed the door and leaned her forehead against it.</p><p>“I think you should go,” Agatha said firmly, not looking at Wanda.</p><p>Wanda sighed and moved to grab her bag from the couch.</p><p>“I saw this coming,” Wanda said as she threw stuff in her bag. “You were always too in love with her.”</p><p>“I am not-- <em>was</em> not in--” But Agatha couldn’t finish her sentence. Because all that flashed through her mind was Rio’s face when she realized that Wanda was there.</p><p>“She has a girlfriend.” Agatha finally whispered out.</p><p>Wanda looked at her with sympathy. “You loved her the entire time we were dating, Agatha. <em>Girlfriend</em> means nothing with the two of you.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the tears escaping her eyes. “I’ve ruined it now, haven’t I?”</p><p>“Agatha, you could stab her repeatedly and she would still look at you like you are everything.”</p><p>Agatha froze. “She looks at me like I am everything?”</p><p>“God, you two really are idiots.” Wanda sighed again, looking at Agatha’s tear stained cheeks. “I can’t believe I am offering this, but I can talk to her. Tell her that we didn’t really do anything.”</p><p>They didn’t, they truly didn’t. They kissed for like forty-five seconds and then Agatha sobbed in Wanda’s arms for two hours. It wasn’t her fault that she bruised easily.</p><p>“I don’t know, Wanda. I don’t know if we will recover from this. I don’t know why I said what I did.” Agatha was trembling now. Wanda stood up and put her arms around her in a platonic show of affection.</p><p>“Agatha, do you remember what you did when we had that screenwriting competition and you didn’t think you had a chance because Pepper Potts was entering?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I said fuck it and I wrote the best thing I have ever written in my life.”</p><p>“When you think you have nothing to lose, you always follow your heart. You thought you lost Rio, so you finally, <em>finally</em> did the one thing you have been dying to do since you met her.”</p><p>Agatha looked into Wanda’s eyes. “And that is?”</p><p>Wanda looked visibly stricken. “Oh my fucking god, I take it all back, there is no hope. You are fucking stupid. <em>You just did the thing</em>, Agatha, <em>you</em> did it! You told Rio how you felt. What do you mean ‘and that is?’ I can’t with you two, I fucking can’t!”</p><p>And with that Wanda barged out of Agatha’s apartment, but not before giving Agatha a kiss on her cheek and smack on the back of her head.</p><p>Agatha was, as some would say, in a state of denial. She didn’t really cry or yell or process anything that night. She pushed it all down, drank a copious amount of vodka and passed out on her bed.</p><p>It was easier that way.</p><p>The next morning Agatha woke up with the worst hangover known to mankind. The birds were chirping too loud, the sun was too bright and Agatha did not set any alarms the night before. When she looked at her phone she almost fell out of her bed.</p><p>She was so fucking late for Jen’s pre-birthday brunch.</p><p>
<em>Fuck, fuck, fuck. </em>
</p><p>Agatha threw a white sundress on, grabbing her strappy wedge heels and cherry red purse and ran out the door, paying no attention to her unkempt hair or puffy face. Her phone died right as the Uber arrived and she almost spilled the entire contents of her bag when they went over a particularly large speed bump, but she made it.</p><p>Only forty minutes late.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Agatha apologized as she found them in the restaurant. Jen crossed her arms when she saw her.</p><p>“And what is your excuse?” She demanded. Agatha squirmed under her gaze.</p><p>“My phone died?”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Sit down. Can someone get her a mimosa?” Jen looked around for a server.</p><p>Agatha sighed in relief and searched for an empty chair. The only one left was opposite Rio.</p><p>
<em>Fuck. </em>
</p><p>Agatha took a seat with as much grace and false confidence she could muster. She flashed a smile in Rio’s direction but Rio immediately looked away.</p><p>
<em>Double fuck. </em>
</p><p>Monica, who was sitting to her left, turned around and smiled at her. “Long time no see,” she laughed and squeezed Agatha into a warm hug.</p><p>“How have you been?” Agatha accepted her warmth. Better than dealing with the frigid cold stare coming from the other side of the table.</p><p>“I’m doing great!” Monica beamed. “Just moved into a new house, got promoted at my job and oh, look at the baby we are fostering.”</p><p>“You and Darcy are fostering a baby?” Agatha squealed. She fucking loved kids.</p><p>“Yes, look,” Monica pulled out her phone and scrolled through an entire folder of baby pictures.</p><p>“She’s so small,” Agatha cooed. “Hi, baby.”</p><p>“She’s a delight!” Monica smiled, then nudged Agatha. “I thought you would have definitely popped one out by now.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her chest in mock outrage. “I didn’t expect this from you. I am <em>barely</em> thirty.”</p><p>Monica rolled her eyes in jest. “Yeah, but you were always so crazy about kids. I always thought being a mom was a part of the plan.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Just haven’t thought about it for a while, you know. Haven’t found the right person to think about these things with yet.”</p><p>She heard a scoff from the other side of the table. Agatha looked up to find Rio’s stare piercing into her.</p><p>Monica was laughing though, clearly not picking up on the tension.</p><p>“I always thought you two would pop out a few children,” Monica said pointing between her and Rio.</p><p><em>I did too.</em> Agatha thought, but instead she choked out a feeble, “What?”</p><p>“Nothing, just that you two would have the most chaotic kids. Like they would get your stubbornness and Rio’s hyper-fixations and they would drive you up the wall.”</p><p>Agatha tried so hard to just look at Monica and not at Rio. She couldn’t let Rio see her heart break at those words.</p><p>Because Agatha had thought about it. A lot. But how do you tell people that in every vision you have of children, all of them have your best friend’s face? How do you say that you can’t imagine kids without Rio also sitting there digging or climbing trees so you chose not to think about that part of your future at all? You know, the more apt question is, how do you say that without someone making a call to the local psychiatric facility?</p><p>There were tears in Agatha’s eyes, she could feel them almost fall, but she coughed and used it as an excuse to wipe them away.</p><p>“That’s such a funny thought,” Agatha tried brushing it aside. “So, how’s Darcy? You two seem happy.”</p><p>Monica smiled and launched into a long update about the status of her relationship. Agatha snuck a quick look at Rio, thinking she would find her pissed or stressed but instead Rio just looked <em>hollow</em>? Far off, like she was imagining something wonderful.</p><p>She couldn’t be imagining the same thing as Agatha, could she? <em>She couldn’t.</em></p><p>Agatha forced her attention back to Monica and soon enough, the brunch was ending and everyone was saying goodbye.</p><p>Agatha had confidently walked out with Monica, only to realize that she forgot her purse. When she double-backed, she saw that Rio had already grabbed it and was walking towards her with new determination.</p><p>Fuck, this is what reckoning looked like.</p><p>Agatha expected Rio to explode. Force her to say something she didn’t want to say. She was ready for Rio’s anger. Hell, she was angry at herself for calling Wanda last night.</p><p>But she wasn’t ready for Rio’s apathy.</p><p>“Here’s your bag,” Rio said, tossing it at her. “You forgot it.”</p><p>Agatha stood there frozen. Rio didn’t even stop, she just walked on past her.</p><p>Agatha knew she should say something, ask Rio for a ride, her phone was dead, everyone had left, ask about last night, fuck, ask about <em>Nat</em>, but all she could think about was how easily Rio had thrown her away.</p><p>It shouldn’t have mattered that Wanda was over last night. Rio had a <em>girlfriend. </em></p><p>It shouldn’t have mattered if she fucked Wanda for god’s sake. She had a girlfriend. Something Rio promised she would never have. Something Agatha had secretly hoped would only happen with her.</p><p>“Rio!” She called out, before she could stop herself. She didn’t need to turn around to see that Rio had stopped. “Can you give me a ride home? We could talk.”</p><p>Agatha heard a low laugh. “After the last one, don't blame me if I don’t trust you.”</p><p>“Trust me?” Agatha swung around to find Rio, stomping to the entrance where she stood. “Why do you not <em>trust</em> me, Rio?”</p><p>“You do stupid shit when you are jealous,” Rio barked back.</p><p>“Jealous? Why would I be jealous?” Agatha said with far too much bite.</p><p>“I don’t know, maybe because I finally found a stable, wonderful girl to date me and you couldn’t?”</p><p>Agatha took a step back. <em>Is that why Rio thought Agatha would be jealous? Maybe they were idiots all along.</em></p><p>“That’s not why-- I didn’t--” Agatha stammered. Then, in one singular moment of clarity. “If you think that’s why I said what I said, then I guess you never knew me at all.”</p><p>Something painful flashed across Rio’s face and quickly disappeared. “I guess I never did.”</p><p>And Rio walked away. Agatha’s eyes followed her as she hopped into a car.</p><p>A car that Natasha was driving.</p><p><em>So, this is what it feels like to have your heart shatter irrevocably,</em> Agatha thought as an unbearable pain gripped her and tore her insides out. <em>This is what it means to lose the only one in your life you thought you didn’t have to live without.</em></p><p>Agatha watched them drive off, no longer keeping it in. No longer even trying to pretend she didn’t love Rio with everything she had.</p>

<p>Rio Vidal was happy.</p><p>She was so happy. She had a lovely, stunning, gorgeous girlfriend she should be swooning over. She had a great job and a wonderful group of friends.</p><p>So why did it feel like someone had ripped her heart clean out of her chest?</p><p>By the time Nat picked her up from Jen’s brunch, Rio had stopped speaking. Nat looked at her with concern, wondering if she needed anything, but Rio’s mind was running at such a pace she didn’t have space to talk. She barely had space to breathe.</p><p>
<em>If you think that’s why I said what I said, then I guess you never knew me at all.</em>
</p><p>She was just saying things to fuck with Rio. She was just trying to cover her own ass by trying to make Rio feel like shit. She was trying to make Rio fold.</p><p>
<em>I guess you never knew me at all.</em>
</p><p>Why was Agatha so good at getting into Rio’s head?</p><p>She hated it. She hated it all.</p><p>She hated how she noticed how good Agatha looked in her white sundress, calves exposed, shoulders bare. She hated how she noticed her face was swollen and her arms still had angry red marks from the way she slept. She hated how she liked how Agatha was taller than her in those stupid strappy heels. She hated how excited Agatha got when looking at Monica’s baby pictures. She hated the thought that Agatha would have children with someone else.</p><p>It shouldn’t have been as revolutionary as it was. <em>‘I always thought you two would pop out a few children.’</em> It should have been just a throwaway comment. People joked about it all the time. About how Agatha and Rio were work wives and basically married. About how they sometimes used to parent juniors in college or their friends when they were drunk. Agatha was Mom, Rio was Dad, and they were always going to give you a piece of their minds. It was a running <em>joke</em>.</p><p>It shouldn’t have been as chaos-inducing as it was, but all Rio could imagine was a girl with Agatha’s hair refusing to brush it before school and a boy with Rio’s eyes running around the backyard and Rio coming into the house full of dirt after gardening for hours and Agatha frowning at the mud she tracked into the house but kissing her anyway and she felt like her heart was exploding.</p><p>Because she wanted it. She wanted it so desperately. She thought she was strong enough to walk away, but she never realized how much of her existence was wrapped up in Agatha.</p><p>Nat didn’t push further, even though she should have. They drove to Rio’s house in silence. No music, no conversation. Just Rio’s manic heartbeat filling the space.</p><p>She had walked away from Agatha. She had not even given her a chance to say anything.</p><p><em>Not that it would have mattered,</em> a voice echoed in Rio’s head. <em>She chose Wanda.</em></p><p>She always chose <em>anyone</em> but Rio.</p><p>“Rio, are you going to tell me what is going on?” Nat asked.</p><p>Rio blinked. They were in her room. She was laying on the bed and Nat was sitting cross-legged next to her. How did they get here?</p><p>“I--I can’t-- I don’t” Rio muttered, unable to get the words on her tongue out.</p><p><em>I can’t stop thinking about Agatha. I can’t stop wishing I got the chance to love her. This isn’t fair to you. I can’t stop.</em> How could she say that to Nat? How could she say any of this to Nat?</p><p>“Do you want me to call Agatha?” Nat asked, already pulling out her phone.</p><p>“No!” Rio yelled.</p><p>Nat looked taken aback. “O-kay. I won’t. I just thought it might be nice talking to her. On our first date you said she was your safe place.”</p><p>Rio started to cry. Not like a few tears, no, big sobs. If Nat thought she was crazy before, hell, she must think she was insane now.</p><p>“Rio, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I don’t know what I said that was wrong but you don’t have to worry, I won’t call Agatha.”</p><p>That just made Rio cry further. She felt like sorrow had gripped her heart and seeped into her bloodstream. She felt it overtake her, engulf her. How was she supposed to move on? She felt like she lost her best friend and the love of her life in one fell swoop. She feels like she lost it all.</p><p>Because of whom? Wanda?</p><p>
<em>Why was it always Wanda?</em>
</p><p>Why did Agatha never say anything earlier? Why didn’t Rio see it earlier? All those times where she thought those feelings in her were just friendship? Why did she drag Nat into this mess? Why couldn’t she drag her out? Rio felt like her world was closing in. She couldn’t figure out what was reality and what was a memory.</p><p>“Rio,” Nat was speaking, but it felt very far off. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p>Rio felt herself nod.</p><p>“Why did you and Agatha never date?”</p><p>Suddenly, Rio’s mind stopped. All the chaos and anxiety and pain just froze and she was consumed by the question.</p><p>Why <em>didn’t</em> they ever date?</p><p>
<em>Rio remembers wanting to ask Agatha out the week after the museum. She remembers checking in on Agatha and her stomach bug and telling her she had a lot of fun at their not-date date. She remembered Agatha not replying with coherent words, just a string of unconnected emojis. She remembers swooning over them and pacing the room as her freshmen roommates offered advice to her on how to ask Agatha out but they were all straight and she was only half-listening, because she felt literal butterflies in her stomach.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And she remembers Agatha calling her that night.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Agatha, I was just thinking about you.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh.” Agatha sounded like she had been crying.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Are you okay?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I just-- I need a friend.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I can be there in ten minutes.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio remembers running over to Agatha’s room and finding her outside her door, eyes red, ghosts of tears still running down her face.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Are you okay?” Rio asked again.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Can we just walk around?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>They walked around campus in silence. But it wasn’t a bad silence. It was a silence that said thank you, for just being here. It was a silence that felt like coming home after a long day and having a hot plate of your favorite food waiting on the counter and the love of your life singing in the shower.</em>
</p><p>
<em>They finally ended up on some hills by the tennis courts. Laying in the grass. Staring at the stars. Just existing.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My mother called,” Agatha finally said. “She’s such a raging bitch.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“So is mine,” Rio responded, leaning back further into the grass.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Do you ever feel like sometimes you are completely alone in the world?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio looked over. Agatha was staring out at the stars, looking so broken.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes, but I wish I had no parents at all.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My mom cut me off today. Said I wasn’t good enough to be her child.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh fuck, Agatha, I’m so sorry.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha waved her off. “I’m more worried about who will be my emergency contact now.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha looked over at Rio then, and realized that in the grand scheme of things they could date and end up hating each other, just like her parents did or they could support each other forever. Maybe they needed to be friends a lot more than they needed to be anything else.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I can be.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha looked at her in surprise. “You would do that for me?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio nodded. “You never have to worry about that, Agatha. You never have to worry about being alone in the world. As long as I am here, you will always have a friend in the world.” </em>
</p><p>“We don’t think of each other like that,” Rio said instead. Nat narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“Bullshit. I have no idea what Agatha said to you last night, but you are not okay and I have a very strong feeling it has to do with the fact that you’re in love with her.”</p><p>“What?” Rio choked out. “I am not in--”</p><p>But Nat just gave Rio a look that said <em>I am not a fucking idiot</em> and Rio folded.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. She’s with someone else.”</p><p>“So, were you, and it didn’t change how you felt.”</p><p>“I-- It-- wait, <em>were</em>?”</p><p>Nat smiled kindly. “Rio, you’re great, you are smart and kind and totally in love with someone else. We will never work out.”</p><p>Rio wanted to laugh and she would have if she also didn’t want to cry.</p><p>“This is so pathetic. I am so pathetic.”</p><p>“No, you are not.” Nat moved closer and cupped Rio’s face in her hands. “You are not pathetic. You both are just scared. But I promise you, love isn’t scary. And you two, the way you know each other, the way you <em>love</em> each other. It will be worth it.”</p><p>Rio let out a watery laugh. “This has to be the most lesbian-coded break up in the world. My ex is telling me to go get with my best friend.”</p><p>“Well, if the shoe fits,” Nat laughed.</p><p>Rio picked up her phone, ready to call Agatha, ready to listen, to say <em>everything</em>, when an incoming call from an unknown number popped up. Rio declined it, pulling up Agatha’s contact when it came through again.</p><p>Rio answered, ready to tell the telemarketer off as she heard, “Is this Rio Vidal?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio responded. “I’m not interested in--”</p><p>“Ma’am, I am sorry to inform you that Agatha Harkness has been in a serious accident and was taken to Westview Presbyterian today. We have been trying to contact you for the last thirty minutes because you are listed as her emergency contact. We recommend you come here as soon as you can.”</p><p>Rio’s heart stopped beating.</p>

<p>Agatha Harkness swore she was not blind.</p><p>She was just hysterical and her brain was foggy from crying so hard. That’s why she didn’t see the car coming at her.</p><p>All she remembers is a shout and looking up just in time to see the car coming at her but not enough to move away and then she remembers Rio’s face.</p><p>Her warm brown eyes. Her smile. The way she scrunches up her nose when she is scared.</p><p>She remembers every time she wanted to lean over and kiss Rio. She remembers Rio holding her hand during her grandmother’s funeral. She remembers a lifetime of going to sleep on FaceTime and watching stupid nature documentaries about bees and ants and sharks. She remembers reading about poisonous plants and doing witch rituals together on full moons. She remembers hugging her and promising that they would last forever.</p><p>And then, she remembers nothing. A black, endless void.</p><p>
<em>Beep. Beep. Beep.</em>
</p><p>Agatha felt like someone had stuffed cotton in her head and asked it to be a substitute for her brain. She felt woozy, like everything around her had been doused in syrup and had the integrity of jelly. Everything was moving. Everything was not solid.</p><p>“Agatha?” A voice came. It felt very far.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha heard herself say, but she had no idea how she opened her mouth.</p><p>“Agatha?” This time it was louder.</p><p>It was not Rio. It was Jen.</p><p>“She’s waking up, she’s waking up,” Jen said to someone else in the room.</p><p>“Hey, sweetie, how are you feeling?” Lilia was beside her. When did she get there?</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to respond but there was an oxygen mask on her face.</p><p>“No, don’t say anything, rest, please, rest.” Alice looked like she had been crying. In fact, the three of them looked like they had been crying.</p><p>Agatha moved the mask away so she could speak. “Who died?” Agatha said weakly.</p><p>Lilia looked stricken. Alice burst into tears again. Jen looked like she was choosing between screaming at and strangling Agatha.</p><p>“You almost did, you idiot.” Jen said, but there was no bite, only concern. “How do you feel, truly?”</p><p>Agatha felt like she was on a cloud. She really did not feel that bad at all.</p><p>“Like I am about to walk out of here tomorrow.” Agatha said confidently, removing the mask and laying it on her chest.</p><p>All three of them looked at her with such pity.</p><p>“Seriously, I am fine. I promise!” Agatha whined, trying to get up. Lilia held her down.</p><p>“Don’t fucking move. You fractured three ribs, broke your leg, almost tore your elbow open and oh, yeah, you have a gigantic hole in your lung.” Lilia threatened. “You’re not leaving any time soon.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her body in the hospital bed. True enough, there was a cast on her leg, bandages everywhere and wires and ginormous cannula in her arm.</p><p>Before anyone could utter a word a doctor walked in. He looked like a kind man with geeky rimmed glasses.</p><p>“I am Doctor Banner,” he said with a smile. “How are you feeling, Miss Harkness?”</p><p>“Surprisingly, fine. Nothing hurts.”</p><p>“Is this normal?” Lilia piped up from near her.</p><p>“It’s the drugs we gave her,” Dr. Banner said, pulling out a torch and running it by her eyes. Agatha blinked back in surprise. “You had quite the accident, Miss Harkness.”</p><p>“Agatha, please.”</p><p>“Agatha, you have a long road of recovery ahead of you. We would like to keep you here for a little longer, monitoring your lungs and heart. Just in case.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, eyes shifting from the doctor to her friends. “So, I got the good stuff?”</p><p>The doctor grimaced. “Yes, you could say you got the good stuff. I have paused the oxygen, but we will ask you to put the mask back on if your oxygen drops again.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. He smiled as he left, promising to come check in on her. She could see the worry on her friends faces but she felt surprisingly lucid. She felt no pain at all, actually. So, she decided to do what any rational human does and inflict the pain on herself.</p><p>“Where’s Rio?”</p><p>All three of them suddenly looked anywhere but at her.</p><p>“She’s-- she,” Alice stuttered and then stopped, tears leaking out of her eyes.</p><p>“She’s not here, is she?” Agatha said, trying not to cry.</p><p>“No, no, she is.” Lilia said and it sounded suspiciously like she was trying to cover something up. Lilia looked through the window in Agatha’s hospital room that overlooked the nurse's station, and waved furiously.</p><p>Agatha followed her gaze and saw her. Rio, hair up in a claw clip, eyes screwed in focus, leaning over a clipboard and writing in it.</p><p>
<em>She was here.</em>
</p><p>And then she saw Nat leaning over Rio, rubbing her arm. Comforting her.</p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p>And Agatha felt all the pain she wasn’t feeling a moment ago.</p><p>Because she was stupid in thinking that this changed anything at all. Rio still loved someone else. Rio didn’t love her. Even while Agatha lay in this hospital bed, hurt and almost escaping death, Rio wasn’t sitting there next to her. No, she was with her girlfriend. Laughing. Agatha felt her heart shatter again and again.</p><p>But then she felt rage. So much pure, unadulterated rage. Because how fucking dare Rio bring Nat here? How dare she rub it in Agatha’s face? How dare she do this again and again?</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop remembering a certain memory. A certain feeling.</p><p>
<em>Evanora sitting on the edge of Agatha’s bed, staring down at her in disgust as she tried on prom dresses, whispering about all the ways it made Agatha look ugly.</em>
</p><p><em>Evanora showing up to parent teacher conferences and asking, “are you sure you are talking about</em> my <em>daughter?” whenever teachers praised her.</em></p><p>
<em>Evanora and her long, burgundy nails that dug into the skin of Agatha’s arm whenever she was too much. Too loud, too animated, too friendly. The angry red marks that stayed beneath long sleeved shirts, pierced skin that let Agatha know that she had overstepped, she had to shrink, make herself smaller, make herself less.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Of all the time spent in her room with her father’s old camera, fidgeting, exploring, trying to capture the world through her perspective, hoping that maybe if her mother saw it her way she would breathe, relax, open up a little.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Everything in her house was white and expensive and Agatha still remembered how hard her mother slapped her when she accidentally spilled something on the couch. Because her hearing was less important than inanimate furniture.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She remembers the feeling, alone in her room, too scared to say anything, too scared to breathe, feeling like there was no place for her, needing to run away, needing to claw her way out.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She remembers her mother finding out she was gay. She saw the last bit of care for Agatha die in her eyes. She remembers packing her things that night, knowing she would never come back.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She remembers a lifetime of being too much and not enough. Of wanting someone to love her and them turning their back.</em>
</p><p>Agatha had felt like a used tossed tissue then, uncared for, unloved, worthless. To be used and forgotten, irrevocably damaged for anyone else.</p><p>And here she was again. Feeling the same inability to change her fate. Feeling the same rejection.</p><p>Though the way Rio hurt her was nothing like the way her mother did. It wasn’t as bad, but in some ways, it was far worse.</p><p>Because Rio was probably going to spend her life kissing Nat and telling her how much she loved her and proposing and having her babies and Agatha was going to die heartbroken and alone.</p><p>Rage now seeped into her bones. Because Rio should know better. Because Agatha was stupid enough to think people were <em>good</em>. Or maybe her mother was right. Maybe <em>she was evil</em>. Maybe she deserved <em>nothing</em>.</p><p>She remembered the first time she thought she could have though. She remembers it because it is seared into her brain.</p><p>
<em>The first time they went to a college party. Agatha had gone out of her way to find this little black dress she was sure would torment Rio within an inch of her life. She had taken time to dress up, hell she wore heels. She was ready to make Rio regret never making a move.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Hey, you got any perfume?” Rio had said when she walked in. Agatha turned around so Rio could see what she was missing and then promptly lost her mind.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She wore a brown strapless dress, so simple, so Rio, and she looked fucking delectable. The dress hugged her just right, tight enough that Agatha could see the curve of her breasts and her nipples poking through, but loose enough that Agatha wanted to rip the dress off with her teeth to see what was below. Her hair was curled at the edges and she had attempted a smoky black eye and a sharp red lipstick that made Agatha’s insides melt into a monster that chanted Rio’s name like it was her religion.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And maybe it was. Because she was so fucking stunning Agatha’s brain went blank.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha stood there gaping, mouth opening and closing, for at least five minutes. Rio had grabbed the perfume from Agatha’s desk that she had converted to a vanity, sprayed it and touched up her mascara.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You good?” she asked Agatha who had not moved from when Rio had walked in.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Your dress…” Agatha muttered. And your collarbones. And your neck. I want to bite your neck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Is it not pretty?” Rio asked, smoothing it down nervously.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“No! I mean yes, it is very pretty.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio beamed. “Thanks, I was worried it was too simple. I thought I needed a necklace or something, but I didn’t have one.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You can take one of mine!” Agatha said too quickly.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh, yeah, didn’t think of that, let me just grab one.” Rio disappeared. Agatha had to remind herself to breathe.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She forgot how beautiful Rio could be. Rio always opted for comfort, dressed in casual jeans or sweatpants. Agatha had never seen her like this, so perfectly crafted. So perfectly crafted for her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Ready?” Rio said, coming out of the room with Agatha’s “A” necklace hanging off her neck. Agatha almost had an aneurysm. She was too afraid to say anything, though, worried if she pointed it out Rio would take it off.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe it meant something, Agatha foolishly hoped. Maybe it meant what she wanted it to mean.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It swayed on Rio's neck all night. When she drank out of a red solo cup at the party. When she danced. When she made out with a random girl and went home with her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>That’s when Agatha found out that no matter how much you love someone, they always hurt you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You know what, fuck this shit. </em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t need her. She didn’t need her as a friend, she didn’t need her as anything. Her feelings for Rio were like a fucking parasite, gnawing away at her reason, making her weak and sappy. If Rio didn’t want Agatha then Agatha did not need Rio.</p><p>Agatha would never move on, not in the sense that mattered, she knew that. But Rio didn’t need to know. She just needed to know that Agatha was done. Rio could have Nat. Hell, she could have whoever she wanted <em>except Agatha</em>, and that didn’t seem like a problem Rio would care about much at the rate she was going.</p><p>And as with most parasites, the only way to get them out is to cut open yourself and rip them from wherever they have burrowed. Harshly. <em>Violently</em>.</p><p>“You should rest.” Jen said from beside her.</p><p>“Visiting hours are almost over.” Lilia chimed in. “We love you.”</p><p>“We will be back first thing tomorrow,” Alice said as they tried to leave.</p><p>“Guys,” Agatha said, ripping her eyes away from Rio and Nat. “Could you pass a message from me to Rio?”</p><p>They nodded with differing levels of enthusiasm. The door opened slightly, but not significantly, as if someone was coming in. Agatha didn’t care what nurse or doctor overheard her. She steadied herself, taking a deep breath.</p><p>“Tell Rio we are done. I don’t want to see her face ever again.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Agatha, you don’t mean it!”</p><p>“You need rest!”</p><p>Her friends' protests fell on deaf ears. Agatha was done listening. She was done pining for someone who didn’t love her. This was like Rio forgetting her about the things that were important to her all over again. When Rio just forgot that Agatha existed while all Agatha could think about was Rio. <em>She had promised Agatha she would always be there.</em> And then she broke it, because here she was with her stupid girlfriend not even visiting Agatha who was <em>dying</em>. It consumed her, that everything came back to her, to this one person who didn’t even think to visit her, who didn’t <em>love</em> her.</p><p>Agatha was <em>done</em>.</p>

<p>Rio Vidal was not okay.</p><p>She was nowhere close to being okay.</p><p>She made it to the hospital in ten minutes, blatantly ignoring the red lights at traffic stops, almost swerving into oncoming traffic and barely missing running over a girl who was texting and crossing the sidewalk. The last one was not her fault, really.</p><p>She sat in the waiting room, heart beating wildly, her whole body on fire. She felt like the world was ending.</p><p>Because it was.</p><p>Because Agatha was in the hospital. She had been hit by a car. Everything seemed so fucking stupid then, all this back and forth. Like there ever was a <em>chance</em> Rio could love someone else. Like there was ever any doubt that Agatha wasn’t the one.</p><p>And now, Agatha was lying in a hospital bed fighting for her life. For both their lives. Because Rio knew she wouldn’t survive losing her.</p><p>“Miss Vidal?” A nurse called out from the station.</p><p>Rio shot up and ran over. “That’s me, do you have any updates about Agatha?”</p><p>“Miss Harkness sustained a fracture on three of her ribs and her left leg, she had a large laceration on her elbow, but we are more worried about the pneumothorax.”</p><p>“What is a pneumothorax?”</p><p>“Collapsed lung.”</p><p>
<em>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</em>
</p><p>“Do you know how she got hit?” Rio was going to fucking murder whoever’s fault this was.</p><p>The nurse flipped through the paperwork. “The EMTs said that witnesses said she was crossing the street to her Uber when a speeding car hit her.”</p><p>
<em>No. Fuck. </em>
</p><p>“She has been unconscious since she came in, so we will need you to fill out these forms for insurance purposes,” the nurse handed her a stack of paperwork.</p><p>“Can it wait? Can I--”</p><p>“We can wait to have her fill it out when she wakes up, if you would prefer.” Rio eyed the ginormous stack of papers and sighed.</p><p>“No, no. I can do it. She doesn’t need to worry about this. Uh, when can I see her?” Rio asked, voice wavering.</p><p>“We are moving her from the emergency room to a semi-private room since we have to formally admit her into the hospital. Once you finish the forms and she has been moved up, you can see her,” the nurse answered kindly and left Rio with the never-ending paperwork.</p><p>Rio sat back down in the waiting room, heart beating wildly. She tried focusing on the paperwork, filling in the insurance numbers and providers and everything she could remember, but her vision got blurrier with every minute.</p><p>
<em>Agatha’s lung had collapsed. She broke three ribs. She was not okay. She’s lying there, all alone, thinking Rio didn’t love her more than life itself.</em>
</p><p>People around her were talking but suddenly it felt like the world had slowed down.</p><p>
<em>Agatha got hurt because of her. She didn’t give Agatha a ride. She said she didn’t know Agatha at all. She was so fucking stupid. It was all her fault. </em>
</p><p>Rio didn’t realize she was crying until the woman next to her offered her a tissue.</p><p>“You should answer that,” the woman said when Rio accepted another tissue, pointing to the phone ringing on her lap. She didn’t even hear it ring.</p><p>“Where the hell are you?” Jen questioned when she picked up the phone.</p><p>“The hospital,” Rio answered, trying and failing not to cry.</p><p>“Rio, I don’t have time for your jokes. We have been waiting at the--”</p><p>“No, Jen, I am at Westview Presbyterian. Agatha got into an accident.”</p><p>“Fuck, is she okay?”</p><p>Rio started crying louder.</p><p>“We are all on our way,” she heard Jen say, but Rio was hysterically sobbing now.</p><p>She couldn’t lose Agatha. She couldn’t. She loved that stupid idiot more than life. Fuck, <em>she was Rio’s life</em>. For ten years Rio had loved her from afar and she couldn’t live with a reality where she wouldn’t get to do it for real.</p><p>
<em>Fuck, fuck. She fucked it up. She was the reason Agatha was lying there.</em>
</p><p>Rio made a promise to herself at that moment. If Agatha made it out of this, she was going to do whatever Agatha asked of her.</p><p>If she asked Rio to drive her home, Rio would.</p><p>If she asked Rio to kiss her, Rio would do so every waking moment.</p><p>If she asked Rio to be friends, just friends, Rio would stand by her side forever, watch her fall in love, be her maid of honor, do it all.</p><p>She would do anything. As long as Agatha kept breathing, she would do anything.</p><p>“Rio! Rio, is Agatha okay?” Lilia was there in front of her.</p><p>“Where is she?” Alice was not far behind.</p><p>Rio couldn’t really stop crying long enough to tell them anything. Alice wrapped her arms around Rio, trying to soothe her.</p><p>“Miss Vidal,” she heard through all the noise her friends were making. Rio bolted to where the nurse was standing.</p><p>“Is she here?”</p><p>“She is here,” the nurse said, gesturing to Rio and her friends to follow. She led them down a hallway to a semi-private room, a suite with two beds and a plastic curtain dividing them. On one of those beds lay Agatha.</p><p>Rio immediately found her side. Tears streaming down her face she grabbed her hand and held it close to her heart. She kissed her hand repeatedly, refusing to let it go.</p><p>“Miss Vidal?”</p><p>Rio looked up to see the nurse who handed her the forms earlier looking at her with sorry eyes. “There is a problem with the paperwork.”</p><p>“What?” Rio choked out.</p><p>“There seems to be a problem with the insurance. They rejected Agatha’s hospital stay.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, what the fuck?”</p><p>“Can you come with me?”</p><p>Rio looked over at her friends, finger pointing, threatening. “Don’t move, okay. If she wakes up, don’t tell her about this. I don’t want her to worry. I will figure it out.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward and kissed Agatha’s forehead. “I love you,” she whispered softly. <em>So simply. Because it was that easy.</em> “Don’t go anywhere.”</p><p>And she ran behind the nurse, following her outside where a woman stood, glasses perched on her nose, clicking on the keyboard of a computer perched on a travelling portable work station.</p><p>“Hello, Miss Vidal. My name is Miss Temple and I am a Billing and Insurance Specialist. I am here to help you figure out what is going on.”</p><p>Rio nodded as the woman launched into a very long and complicated monologue about Agatha’s insurance deductibles and out-of-service providers and out-of-pocket costs.</p><p>“Wait, stop, can you just tell me why they rejected her claim?” Rio said ten minutes in, understanding nothing so far.</p><p>“The insurance company said that she doesn’t need to stay in the hospital. It wasn’t an emergency.”</p><p>“She has a collapsed lung.”</p><p>“The company claims she could have gone home since we are just keeping her here to monitor her and it was non-emergent.”</p><p>“Once again, she has a <em>collapsed</em> lung. And broken bones. And is unconscious.”</p><p>The woman launched into another spiel about insurance and Rio soon realized that she was not there to help Rio at all, no, she was there to help the <em>hospital</em>.</p><p>“I just need to make a call, one second.” Rio said, stepping away and pulling out her phone. She dialed the number, hands shaking.</p><p>“Rio?” Nat said when she answered. “What happened, you ran out of here so fast, I couldn’t make out what you were saying.”</p><p>“Agatha got into a really serious accident. It’s bad.”</p><p>“Oh god, Rio, I’m so sorry. Can I do anything to help?”</p><p>“You can, actually. You work for an insurance company, right?”</p><p>“In security, but yes.”</p><p>“Do you know your way around an insurance policy?”</p><p>“Oh my fucking god, the insurance company rejected her hospital visit didn’t they?”</p><p>“They did. Almost immediately. Can you help?”</p><p>“I am on my way.”</p><p>Nat was there barely fifteen minutes later but by the time she did, Rio was drowning in paperwork. They had taken over a section of the nurse’s station because Rio refused to not have a visual of Agatha for this long, so a nurse had raised her blinds and positioned Rio so she could see her from the corner of her eye at all times.</p><p>“Okay, what is happening?” Nat asked, reaching over and grabbing a copy of the insurance company’s response.</p><p>“I really don’t know, Nat. They rejected her claim and the hospital bill was already going to be a few thousand dollars with the insurance, and I am too scared to look at the number if we have to pay this entire thing out of pocket.” Rio was almost in tears. She circled another thing in the policy that seemed important. “I think you need an advanced degree to figure this out.”</p><p>Nat rubbed her arm in an attempt to comfort her. “We will figure this out. If not, we will just let Jen lose in the hospital.”</p><p>Rio laughed, relieved to finally get some help.</p><p>Suddenly, Rio saw movement in Agatha’s room. Lilia was looking over at her, a pleading look in her eyes, frantically waving for Rio to come in.</p><p>“I think something is happening, I am going to go check on her.” Rio said, extracting herself from the papers.</p><p>“Go, I got this,” Nat said, taking over the spot Rio was in and turning to the administrator with a burning look in her eyes.</p><p>Rio flashed her a grateful smile and rounded the corner, opening the door.</p><p>And then she heard <em>it</em>.</p><p>“Tell Rio we are done. I don’t want to see her face ever again.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness was wrong.</p><p>She did feel the pain. It just wasn’t immediately after she woke up. No, it was two hours later, after everyone had left and she was all alone.</p><p>She was raging still, thinking of all the ways she would tell Rio to fuck herself when she inevitably came running back with her tail between her legs. Or all the ways Agatha would push her away from their friends if she didn’t. And specifically the way Agatha would make her regret it all, move on and win.</p><p>She was so going to fucking <em>win</em>.</p><p>But then pain shot through her body. It started at her leg, the broken one, and suddenly searing, electric pain was rippling through every nerve, every vein in her body. It felt like she was on fire, raw and vengeful, and simultaneously like someone was holding her hands and legs and trying to pull every limb of hers apart. It was piercing. It was overwhelming.</p><p>She <em>screamed</em>.</p><p>A nurse came running in, but Agatha was not coherent.</p><p>“Hurt…pain…it hurts!” she yelled.</p><p>The nurse quickly injected something into the bag that was connected to the intravenous drip attached to her arm, trying to soothe her further. The pain crescendoed and then dulled, but only slightly. Not enough. Not nearly enough. Her muscles were cramping, her heart was beating. She was shivering. She was sweating.</p><p>“What is happening?” Agatha screamed.</p><p>“What is your pain level out of ten, sweetheart?”</p><p>“A fucking eleven.” Agatha moaned as another wave of pain hit her.</p><p>The nurse tapped away on the machines, and then suddenly it felt like someone turned the volume down slightly because Agatha could still feel the pain but it didn’t consume her.</p><p>“Do you feel better now, sweetie?” The nurse asked kindly.</p><p>“Better,” Agatha choked out. “Better.”</p><p>“I’ve given you something that should help you sleep too,” the nurse said, but Agatha was already slipping away.</p><p>“Good morning!” was the next thing Agatha heard. She blinked. She <em>just</em> fell asleep. She genuinely did not know how time moved that fast.</p><p>“I’m Nurse Danvers. How are you feeling right now?” The nurse asked, but she was a different nurse, not the one who helped her last night. She had short blonde hair and a very sweet smile.</p><p>“Uh, sore,” Agatha said as she woke up.</p><p>“I’m sorry, honey, you’re going to feel sore for a little while.” Agatha grimaced. Nurse Danvers busied herself with checking Agatha’s vitals.</p><p>“Everything looks great,” she said once she was done marking the chart at the foot of Agatha’s bed.</p><p>“Press this button if you need anything,” she finished, placing the call button by Agatha’s hand and patting it kindly.</p><p>Agatha nodded and then promptly fell asleep again.</p><p>When she woke up, it felt like no time had passed at all. The only window in her room overlooked the hallway, so she couldn’t really figure out what time it was anyway. She tried getting up, but the pain reminded her why that was a bad idea. She used the little buttons on the calling remote to push the bed into a more seated position. The little movement still hurt her. She tried to look for her phone but immediately gave up when she saw how far it was. She could do nothing else. She just had to sit there and face the music.</p><p>The music being how Rio still had not visited her.</p><p>The music being how she might have truly had lost her.</p><p>No. Fuck. She was <em>moving on</em>.</p><p>She reached out to the table next to her to try to find the phone when she touched something fluffy. She grabbed it and pulled it close and almost cried.</p><p>It was Señor Scratchy.</p><p>Señor Scratchy was <em>here</em>. Who brought him?</p><p><em>Probably Alice or Jen or Lilia</em>, she thought. <em>Must be feeling guilty</em>.</p><p>But either way, Agatha cried into the soft fur of her comfort stuffed animal, thinking of the time Rio won it for her on one of those carnival games on Santa Monica pier. She buried her face in its neck, breathing in his comforting smell of damp fur, vanilla and hints of Rio’s perfume. Rio always hugged the rabbit when she came over, leaving traces all over him. It’s what secretly made him Agatha’s favourite.</p><p>Agatha laughed into his fur. How fucking stupid was she? How did she hug him close to her chest every night, inhaling his fur that carried Rio’s scent and wonder why she always dreamed of Rio?</p><p>No, no, she was moving on. She was never going to see Rio again.</p><p>
<em>Why did it gut her just thinking about that?</em>
</p><p>When Alice and Jen visited later, barely an hour later, Agatha immediately mumbled out, “Did you tell Rio what I said last night?”</p><p>“We--I--Um, Jen?” Alice looked over at Jen imploringly.</p><p>“She, uh, she knows.” Jen said, staring at the floor. “That’s what you wanted, right?”</p><p>
<em>No. Yes. What did she want? Not this.</em>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, instead because she only knew how to eat her words in the safety of her own mind.</p><p>They sat there for a while, trying to distract Agatha, trying to reminisce and failing because all the fun memories they shared included Rio and they didn’t know how to talk about her so they just didn’t. Agatha didn’t ask where Lilia was, she kind of knew the answer. After forty minutes of Alice and Jen awkwardly stumbling through conversation, Agatha feigned sleep.</p><p>“Good night,” they said as they left. Agatha immediately started crying.</p><p>She successfully cried herself to sleep. She had no idea why. (<em>She knew exactly why.</em>)</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said to her in her dream. She leaned in and kissed her temple. It felt so real she could almost feel it on her skin.</p><p>Agatha woke up in tears.</p><p><em>Fuck, she was so stupid.</em> Why did she say it? Why did she say she never wants to see Rio’s face again. Why did she let her jealousy and rage cloud her senses?</p><p>She curled her fists and punched the bed. Something heavy bounced. She felt around and found it to be a book, the very sappy romance kind that she secretly loved. Agatha scoffed. This was useless without her glasses.</p><p>Her glasses were right next to the water on the side table.</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?</em>
</p><p>Who was bringing her things?</p><p>Her head said that it was probably Lilia or Jen or Alice. Her heart really wanted it to be Rio.</p><p>Nope. Stupid heart. <em>Fuck Rio.</em> She still had not visited.</p><p>She spent the day reading the book, grateful for the distraction. She yelled when the main characters were separated because of a <em>miscommunication</em>. Nurse Danvers kept checking in on the progress of the book as she came in to check Agatha’s vitals. Agatha enjoyed telling her what was happening along with her very apt commentary about how stupid the miscommunication trope was.</p><p>She hated the miscommunication trope, it was just <em>so</em> fucking stupid. Like if a few words could separate true love, the maybe your love wasn’t fucking <em>true</em>. She still cried when the love interests got back together, still swooned at the big dramatic love confession. Still tried and failed to not think about Rio through it all.</p><p>Lilia visited that day, nodding along when Agatha told her about the book, eyes crinkling when Agatha smiled for the first time since she had been there.</p><p>She fell asleep more content that night, but she dreamed of Rio again.</p><p>“You are the love of my life,” Rio told her in her dream. “Don’t ever doubt that.” Rio was crying and Agatha could feel her tears fall on her neck. The next morning when she woke up, her neck was surprisingly sticky.</p><p>“A little birdie told me you love this movie,” Nurse Danvers said when she came in to check in on Agatha in the morning. She waved a DVD of <em>The Parent Trap</em>. Agatha nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>She looked at some scans and vitals. “Lucky for you, your head looks better. I’ll put on the movie.”</p><p>Agatha squealed. She smiled as she watched the movie, hugging Señor Scratchy close and, for a moment, it felt like everything was going to be okay.</p><p>And then the pain returned. Suddenly, quickly, the pain was back. It overtook her. Agatha screamed and pressed the call button twice, four times maybe. Nothing happened. She screamed again, pain engulfing her.</p><p>A nurse she had never seen before came running in.</p><p>“It hurts,” Agatha cried.</p><p>“What hurts?” The nurse asked.</p><p>“Everything.”</p><p>It felt like her body was on fire, electric impulses shooting through her, stinging, burning her insides. She felt like she was burning alive from the sheer amount of pain.</p><p>“Help,” she choked out. “Help, please.” The nurse was tapping away on the machine next to her.</p><p>Her insides felt like they would burst through her, ripping her skin and boiling her blood. “More, please.” Agatha begged.</p><p>“I have given you all the pain medication I can, Agatha. I am so sorry.” The nurse replied, apologetically.</p><p>“Please, I need more. This is not enough.”</p><p>Her ribs burned as she talked. Her elbow throbbed. She could feel her heartbeat in her throat. Suddenly, a darkness took over her brain, seeping in through the edges, engulfing her vision, drowning her mind.</p><p>It felt like she was drowning in fire. She couldn’t speak, she couldn’t move.</p><p>She could hear yelling though.</p><p>“What is happening to her?” It was a familiar voice, so familiar.</p><p>“I’m sorry, she is maxed out on pain medication,” someone else said. The nurse! The nurse said.</p><p>“Why did she pass out from pain then?” the first voice got angrier.</p><p>The nurse said something Agatha could not understand.</p><p>“You had her on <em>fentanyl</em> this entire time?” the first voice screeched. Why was it <em>so</em> familiar?</p><p>“She came into the Emergency Room! It is commonly used for trauma patients! ”</p><p>“So, you’re telling me not only is she now going to feel more pain, she will also be in withdrawal for fucking <em>fentanyl</em>?” The first voice was so pissed off. It reminded her of the time Rio almost punched a man for looking at Agatha wrong. Wait, <em>Rio</em>?</p><p>Another wave of pain rippled through Agatha’s body. She could feel every bone, every cell in her body and it was all vibrating.</p><p>But all Agatha could focus on was that Rio was here. <em>Rio was here.</em></p><p>Agatha felt herself lose consciousness with Rio’s name on the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>Rio Vidal was a flaming, hot wreck.</p><p>Because what would you be if the love of your life told you she never wanted to see your face again?</p><p>Rio froze at the door when she heard it.</p><p>
<em>Tell Rio we are done. I don’t want to see her face ever again.</em>
</p><p>Rio was sure that was the sound a death’s knell made.</p><p>She hoped she heard it wrong. She could hear Alice, Lilia and Jen defend her. She could hear their pleas, but Agatha said nothing. Rio knew what that meant. It was final.</p><p>So, Rio did what she does best. She ran. Suddenly, Rio was outside the hospital, fresh air whipping against her face. She needed to breathe. She <em>couldn't</em> breathe.</p><p>She never got a moment of respite, though, because suddenly all three were there, by her side.</p><p>“Rio!” She heard Alice yell.</p><p>Rio felt suffocated. Rio felt loved. She turned around to find her friends staring at her. Agatha’s rejection had witnesses. It made it all worse.</p><p>“She just woke up,” Jen came to her, slinging her arm around her side.</p><p>“Rio, she is half unconscious. She doesn’t know what she is saying.” Alice tried to console her.</p><p>“You should go see her.” Lilia said out of breath, catching up to them last. “She’s on a lot of drugs, she didn’t know what she said.”</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“I can’t. I promised myself I will give Agatha anything she wants.” Rio said, voice raw. “I have to give her <em>this</em>.”</p><p>“You are so stupid, Rio. This doesn’t count. She is so hopped up on drugs she couldn’t tell a giraffe from a zebra.” Jen squeezed her waist in a kind attempt to shake her.</p><p>Rio shook her head, “She seems surprisingly lucid, Jen.”</p><p>Rio turned to move away.</p><p>“So, that’s it? You’re giving up?” Lilia questioned, arms crossed.</p><p>Rio let out a low laugh and slowly shook her head like the whole idea was ridiculous.</p><p>Lilia patted Rio on the back. “Okay, good. Come on, let’s go home. We can come back in the morning.”</p><p>“No,” Rio shook Lilia off. “No. I am not leaving. I will stay here.”</p><p>“Overnight? Rio, come on, that doesn’t help anyone.”</p><p>“Do you really think I can walk away from her?” Rio looked up and eyed all three of her friends who all had different levels of pity and confusion plastered on their faces.</p><p>“I love her,” Rio said, voice breaking. “If she doesn’t want to see my face, fine, she won’t, but I am not leaving her. I promised her she will never be alone.”</p><p>Lilia shook her head. “You two…”</p><p>Rio turned and marched back to the waiting room where she held vigil for the next three days. She only left once to gather some things from Agatha’s house and another time because Jen yelled at her to shower (even then she did it in a record time of twenty minutes).</p><p>She was right there when Agatha screamed the first time. She was the one who found the nurse and sent her in blind panic.</p><p>Every night, Nurse Danvers would take pity on her and let her sit by Agatha’s bedside, hold her hand and whisper everything Rio wanted Agatha to know.</p><p>“I love you,” she would chant. “I love you, I love you. You are the love of my life. Never doubt that.” She would cry into her hair and kiss her forehead.</p><p>Every morning, she would hound the doctors for updates. When she found out Agatha was off the oxygen machine, she brought Señor Scratchy so she could hug him freely. When she found out that Agatha was okay enough to do some light reading, she went and brought a paperback she knew Agatha would love. When she heard that Agatha could use screens for a few hours, she broke into Agatha’s house and got her DVD copy of <em>The Parent Trap</em> so she could watch her comfort movie.</p><p>Nurse Danvers would always stop by where Rio sat in the waiting room, never questioning why Rio didn’t go in when Agatha was awake, always letting Rio know how Agatha was progressing. By the third day, the nurses were well aware of Rio’s constant presence and invited her to their break room to have her meals. Rio accepted their kindness gratefully, taking the distraction away from the pain of not being able to see Agatha’s face.</p><p>Well, that was technically a lie. She saw Agatha’s face every night when she secretly visited her as Agatha slept and every dawn when Rio finally got a few hours of sleep and dreamt of her. She cursed herself every waking breath for not telling her sooner, not even blaming Agatha once for not wanting to see her, accepting her punishment willingly.</p><p>Because Rio was a <em>fool</em>. A goddamn idiot for not admitting this sooner. Because she let Agatha go on for ten years not knowing how obscenely loved she was and she wasn’t going to let her go on another minute not feeling it.</p><p>It didn’t matter that Agatha didn’t want to see her. It mattered that she was alive. And Rio was going to count her blessings every goddamn day.</p><p>So, it was all okay, and then Agatha screamed again.</p><p>But it wasn’t a normal scream, no. It was <em>gut-wrenching</em>. It nearly shattered Rio.</p><p>“Nurse, nurse.” Rio flagged down the first nurse she saw. “You have to help her. Agatha, she’s in pain.”</p><p>Agatha screamed in pain again. The nurse ran in, and Rio contemplated staying out but when she heard Agatha begging and she ran in.</p><p>“Help,” she choked out. “Help, please.”</p><p>“I have given you all the pain medication I can, Agatha. I am so sorry.” The nurse responded.</p><p>“Please, I need more. This is not enough.” Agatha begged. Rio’s heart ripped itself apart.</p><p>“What is happening to her?” Rio yelled.</p><p>“I’m sorry, she is maxed out on pain medication,” The nurse replied, looking at Rio apologetically.</p><p>“Why did she pass out from pain then?”</p><p>“We switched her pain medication from fentanyl to codeine.”</p><p>“You had her on <em>fentanyl</em> this entire time?” Rio screeched.</p><p>“She came into the Emergency Room! It is commonly used for trauma patients! ”</p><p>“Did you not clock that even the smallest dose can cause her to go through withdrawal? What the fuck? So, you’re telling me not only is she now going to feel everything, she will also be in withdrawal for fucking <em>fentanyl</em>?”</p><p>The nurse cowered. “There is not much more I can do.” She said, running out the door, hopefully to get more help.</p><p>Agatha looked like she had passed out from the pain. Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand and pressed soft kisses to it.</p><p>“Please be okay,” she prayed. “I won’t survive losing you.”</p><p>She gave Agatha one last kiss and ran over to raise holy hell on the hospital staff. She was so not going to get invited to the break room after this performance.</p><p>Very luckily for her and very unluckily for Dr Banner, she found him almost immediately after exiting the room.</p><p>“You,” she pointed a menacing finger at him. He was right to cower in fear at the look in her eyes. “Why the hell was Agatha put on fentanyl for that long?”</p><p>“She had severe trauma injuries,” Dr Banner replied, starting what was probably going to be a very long spiel containing a lot of words Rio did not know.</p><p>Rio immediately ripped into him, “Did you not think she would go into withdrawal?”</p><p>“It was a risk, but with emergency patients it is commonly--”</p><p>“How bad is it going to be?” Rio all but yelled.</p><p>“She might have flu-like symptoms and vomit a lot. It shouldn’t be too--”</p><p>Rio was seeing <em>red</em>. “Okay, Dr Banner. Here is what you are going to do. This is a teaching hospital, right?”</p><p>Dr Banner nodded slowly.</p><p>“Good. You are going to get your most trusted intern to sit with Agatha and nurse her through this withdrawal.” Dr Banner opened his mouth and Rio immediately cut him off. “No, there is no room for you to tell me you can’t do this. You will do this. The love of my goddamn life is going to go through <em>hell</em> for twenty-four hours, she is going to be fucking taken care of the entire time.”</p><p>“Miss Vidal, we can’t just allocate hospital resources like this--”</p><p>“I know this is not your fault, Dr Banner. I know it’s the <em>system</em> and everything, but the woman I love is in pain and I can’t stop it but I can make sure that she makes it out as best she can. So please, help me. I will raise holy fucking hell if anything bad happens to her, so <em>help</em> me god,” Rio said, voice breaking.</p><p>The doctor's eyes softened, even in the face of Rio’s threats. “I will do what I can.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio nodded as the doctor briskly walked off.</p><p>“That was quite a performance,” Rio recognized the voice before she saw her. <em>Wanda</em>.</p><p>Rio looked up, nodding at Wanda but saying nothing.</p><p>“How is she?” Wanda asked, looking at Rio with too much pity for her liking.</p><p>“In a lot of pain. She has a hard night ahead.”</p><p>It was Wanda’s turn to nod. “Fucking broken system.”</p><p>Rio scoffed in agreement. “You have no idea, Wanda.”</p><p>“The woman I love?” Wanda said, no tease in her voice. “Did you two…” Wanda trailed off.</p><p>“I know you two are <em>something</em>,” Rio said, tears coming back into her eyes as she remembered Agatha wasn’t hers. “But please, let me have this. Let me take care of her.”</p><p>“Oh, boy,” Wanda sighed. “You two haven’t talked.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Wanda just shook her head. “I am only saying this because Agatha is fully dying right now and you need to hear it but it should have totally come from her, but nothing happened.”</p><p>Rio looked up, brows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>“That night,” Wanda continued. “When you showed up at her door in the middle of the night. We did nothing. She literally kissed me for two seconds and then spent three hours crying about how you don’t love her.”</p><p>“She-- <em>what</em>?” Rio spluttered.</p><p>“You mean so much to her, Rio,” Wanda said, squeezing Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Rio shook her head frantically. “No, I don’t.”</p><p>“Yes, you do.” Wanda rolled her eyes. ”You’re just being a dumb lesbian.”</p><p>“I am not.” Rio’s lip quivered, “She said she never wanted to see my face again.”</p><p>Wanda took a step back. “When was this?”</p><p>“Three days ago.” Rio looked down. She refused to cry in front of Wanda.</p><p>“What?” Wanda fumed. Rio would have appreciated the attempt at solidarity if she hadn’t been wanting to blip Wanda out of existence for the last few days.</p><p>“She doesn’t love me, Wanda.” Rio said, shoulders shaking with the intensity of the feeling burning in her heart. Before Wanda could say anything, they were interrupted.</p><p>“Are you Miss Vidal?” A young man in a white coat asked her.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied, wiping her tears. “Are you the person who is going to stay with Agatha?”</p><p>“Yeah, I am William Kaplan.” The boy said, nodding. “I am well prepped about her history and I will be spending essentially the next twelve hours with her.”</p><p>Rio grabbed his shoulder before he could move away. “William, this woman is everything to me. Please, please take good care of her.”</p><p>“Do not worry, Miss Vidal. I know she must be special. The whole hospital is talking about how you haven’t left the waiting room since she was admitted. You must really love her.”</p><p>“She’s the love of my life, kid. Don’t let anything happen to her.”</p><p>William flashed her a somber smile and entered Agatha’s room.</p><p>Rio turned around to find Wanda with big, large tears streaking down her face. “You haven’t left the hospital since she got admitted?”</p><p>“Well, besides to get things from Agatha’s apartment or the one time Jen forced me to shower, nope.”</p><p>“Even though you think she doesn’t love you?” Wanda choked out.</p><p>“Whether she loves me or not doesn’t matter, Wanda. I love her. I can’t pretend she isn’t everything to me anymore. Not after almost losing her.” Rio felt the tears coming back. “If she tells me to fuck off after she wakes up, I will. I will do whatever she wants me to because all I want is for the woman I love to be happy.”</p><p>Wanda looked both sorrowful and murderous at the same time.</p>

<p>Agatha Harkness felt like Death personified.</p><p>She woke up shivering, but her hair was wet with sweat. She felt like she had been wrung out, like a dirty rag that had been squeezed and pulled until it was half its size. Her broken leg burned and she could feel where her bone split in two because it was throbbing uncontrollably.</p><p>A wave of nausea hit her. She tried to find something to throw up in, but all she could really do was lean forward and hope she didn’t heave all over herself.</p><p>Someone put a bucket near her and caught it all, rubbing her back in circles to soothe her.</p><p>When Agatha was done, she was offered a cloth to wipe her face. She looked up to find a young man with kind eyes.</p><p>“I’m William,” he offered.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said weakly. “What is happening to me?”</p><p>“You are experiencing some effects of withdrawal,” William said softly. “I am happy to say we are mostly done with the hard part.”</p><p>“Mostly?” Agatha choked out.</p><p>“The physical effects are wearing off. You somehow slept through it which is rare but not unheard of, but you are going to feel a lot more pain for a little bit.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha wondered.</p><p>“You’re switching medicines, essentially. It’s like dining at a Michelin star restaurant and then going to a local restaurant. Sure, the food is going to be good at the local place, but your body will keep wanting the better food.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said, kind of understanding what he was saying, but her head was pounding relentlessly. It felt like someone had taken a long, serrated knife and was stabbing the back of her head consistently. “My head…”</p><p>“Are you having a headache?” William asked, scribbling something on a clipboard.</p><p>“It feels like my head is going to explode.”</p><p>William leaned over her head and injected something into her intravenous drip. “This should give you some comfort.”</p><p>Agatha did not feel comfort for another fifteen minutes. William sat there the entire time, monitoring her, giving her water and helping her get up.</p><p>“Don’t you have rounds or something?” She finally asked William after half an hour of him just sitting there.</p><p>“Not today,” William flashed a small smile.</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha leaned forward, feeling the medication kick in and provide some relief.</p><p>“I am under strict instruction to not leave you until the withdrawal symptoms have passed,” William said seriously.</p><p>“By whom?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Someone terrifying.” William smiled bigger. “Though she isn’t that intimidating when she’s <em>hiding</em>.”</p><p>Agatha swore she heard a sharp cough from behind the curtain on the left side of the room.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing, ignore me.”</p><p>“Who is there?” Agatha asked, very confused, craning her neck to look around the empty room.</p><p>“Would you like to eat something?” William asked instead.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at his attempt to change the conversation. “What aren’t you telling me?”</p><p>“We can get some food from outside. It isn’t hospital regulations but I can make an exception. What would you like? A burger? Pizza?”</p><p>William’s phone buzzed then. He looked down and then looked up. “Would you like a greek salad?”</p><p>Agatha relaxed a little, nodding. A greek salad sounded great actually.</p><p>“Is that the one with the tomatoes and mozzarella?” William wondered. Agatha looked aghast.</p><p>“You don’t know what’s in a greek salad? <em>Honey</em>.”</p><p>“I’ll find someone to get one for you.” William typed something on his phone, smirked and then looked up. “You should rest while you wait, preferably with your eyes closed.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brow. He shrugged.</p><p>She leaned back, closing her eyes but ready to snap them open at a moment’s notice. She heard something move, and opened her eyes just in time to make out a figure hurriedly exiting through the door and William trying very hard to not laugh.</p><p>“Who was that?”</p><p>“A ghost,” William said, a giggle escaping his lips.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t understand what was so funny.</p><p>Ten minutes later, someone knocked on the door and handed William a bag containing Agatha’s greek salad. She settled into her bed as William put on Lady and the Tramp, another one of Agatha’s favorite movies.</p><p><em>Wait</em>, how did this kid know?</p><p>“How did you know I like this movie?”</p><p>“A little birdie told me.” William said nonchalantly, but his smirk was back.</p><p>The second the opening sequence started, Agatha let go of the lingering questions in her head as to what the hell was going on and just enjoyed the first time in a few days she wasn’t dying from pain.</p><p>But her mind didn’t let her rest further. Because after the pain and anger faded away, all she felt was stupid.</p><p>Because how the fuck was she supposed to move on from this?</p><p>How the fuck was she supposed to live knowing that Rio existed in the world and was with someone else? How was she supposed to live with the fact she ruined the most important relationship in her life because she couldn’t keep her mouth shut? How did she push Rio away so far that she wasn’t even there when she woke up?</p><p>She could always apologize and tell Rio she was wrong and grovel and they would go back to being friends. That was the only way they were going to make it out of this and still be in each other’s life.</p><p>She could do that. No, she couldn’t.</p><p>Minutes later, Alice and Lilia came in, and William paused the movie.</p><p>“Who is this?” Alice asked, looking him up and down, noting his white coat.</p><p>“I am--” William began, only to be cut off.</p><p>“This is my pet. Say hi, <em>pet</em>.” Agatha said, eyebrows raised to see if he would take it.</p><p>“Hello,” William nodded seriously.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes further. <em>What the fuck was up with this kid? Was he being threatened within an inch of his life?</em></p><p>“Hello,” Lilia said, confusion clear across her face.</p><p>“We just wanted to check on you,” Alice said, coming to sit by her head. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Like I got hit by a car,” Agatha said, finger tapping her chin. “Oh wait, I did.”</p><p>Lilia shook her head, endearingly. “You’re sounding like yourself more.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I feel better, thanks to William here.”</p><p>William smiled back. “I’m going to leave you with your friends for a little, be back soon.” He left the room, closing the door slowly.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?” Agatha said after the door shut. Alice and Lilia nodded. “Is Rio dead in a ditch?”</p><p>They both looked at her like two deer caught in headlights.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Lilia said, regaining her voice first. “You said you didn’t want to see her, right?”</p><p>“Has that changed?” Alice chimed in, hopeful.</p><p>“Not really,” Agatha said, leaning back a little. Then, casually she added. “Just wanted to know where she was.”</p><p>Alice and Lilia shared a look.</p><p>“Um-- She--”</p><p>Agatha raised her brow. “What is everyone not telling me?”</p><p>“Your insurance got rejected and she has been trying to fix it!” Alice blurted out. Lilia smacked her arm.</p><p>“It was killing me Lilia, I can’t keep secrets, you know that.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha said, taken aback.</p><p>“Your health insurance company rejected your stay in the hospital, so Rio and Nat have been fighting them relentlessly.” Lilia said somberly.</p><p>“Nat?”</p><p>“Nat works in insurance, she helped get your claim fast-tracked or something. I have no idea what they are doing but there has been so much paperwork.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha said, suddenly feeling small. “So, Rio has been trying to help me?”</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said again.</p><p><em>This was how Rio showed her love.</em> Agatha realized. <em>This was always how she showed her love.</em></p><p>She was there when Agatha’s mother disowned her, sitting under the stars, making sure Agatha knew she was not alone.</p><p>She was there when Agatha’s dad died, holding her hand throughout the funeral, never making Agatha feel bad for not crying, pushing back against her mother’s taunts, helping clean up as Agatha sat, processing.</p><p>When Agatha got a B on her senior thesis, Rio tore the faculty a new one.</p><p>When Agatha wanted to stage a play, Rio dropped everything to come help her.</p><p>She was there through every bad grade, late night realization, and every doubt she ever had.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t surprised Rio was fighting the insurance company, this is just what she did. This is how she showed her love, by solving all the problems for the people around her so they wouldn’t have to worry about them.</p><p>“Can you send her in?” Agatha said, surprising even herself. “I want to thank her.”</p><p>“Didn’t you say you didn’t want to see her?” Alice said, leaning forward slightly.</p><p>Yes, she did. Yes, she was still unbelievably heartbroken and mad at Rio, especially since she didn’t visit her even once. But all the dreams she had been having made her miss her best friend and she just wanted someone in her corner that wasn’t looking at her like she was frail or would break like glass.</p><p>She needed to talk to Rio because she was the only one that always told her when she was wrong and stupid and helped her get back on her feet.</p><p>God, she just missed <em>Rio</em>. She wished she could just talk to her again without it being such a big deal. You know, without all the baggage and the Nat situation and the <em>feelings</em>.</p><p>She just wanted her <em>best friend</em> back.</p><p>“Just-- Can you tell her I am calling a pause on this fight or whatever this is? I just want to talk to her.”</p><p>They both nodded in understanding, synchronized in their approval and running out the door.</p><p>Agatha wondered if she did the right thing as Rio opened the door and walking in apprehensively, worried look on her face.</p><p>The second she looked up, and Agatha saw the tears in her eyes, she realized she made the right choice.</p><p>It wasn’t Rio’s fault that she was not <em>in</em> love with Agatha.</p><p>It wasn’t her duty to pacify and sit by her bedside and kiss her hand. She was doing what she could as a <em>friend</em>. It should have been enough</p><p>“Why didn’t you visit me?” Agatha said, crossing her arms unseriously.</p><p>Rio looked up, brows furrowed. “You said you <em>never</em> wanted to see my face again.”</p><p>“So, you should have sat here with your back towards me,” Agatha said like it was the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>Rio broke into a big beautiful smile. “Why didn’t I think of that?” A small laugh escaped her lips and she relaxed for the first time since she entered.</p><p>“Because you’re stupid.” Agatha gestured to the stool by the side of her bed and Rio quickly sat down.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” Rio asked, looking deeply into Agatha’s eyes. Agatha shrunk under the weight of Rio’s gaze.</p><p>“Like I got hit by a car,” Agatha tried to lighten the mood with the same joke again.</p><p>It did not work. Instead, the mood shifted into something serious. Rio reached forward and grabbed her hand like it was her lifeline. “You really scared me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, she just stared at their hands intertwined, heart stinging from the weight of everything she wanted but couldn’t have.</p><p>“I heard the insurance company is acting insane.” Agatha said eventually.</p><p>Rio sighed, gripping her hand further. “I am figuring it out.”</p><p>Agatha looked up then, noticing the bags under Rio’s eyes and the dried tears on her cheeks. “Thank you, Rio,” Agatha said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Anything for you, Agatha.” She said voice breaking. “You say the word and I will make it happen.”</p><p>Agatha let out a watery laugh. “So, how many insurance agents did you personally drive to tears?”</p><p>“None,” Rio said, nonchalantly. “Nat is taking care of that part.”</p><p>Right. <em>Nat.</em></p><p>Agatha let go of Rio’s hand like it had burned her, trying to ignore how her heart was clenching. “Tell her I said thank you.”</p><p>“I will,” Rio said, now looking down. “Agatha, Nat and I--”</p><p>“When can I go home?” Agatha cut in, not wanting to talk about Rio and Nat.</p><p>“Do you want to go home?” Rio said softly.</p><p>“Desperately. I am tired of the hospital. Get me out.”</p><p>“I will see how soon we can get you discharged.” Rio said, looking at where their hands were intertwined just a moment ago. She took a deep breath. Agatha knew that look on her face, the quiet determination as she fought through something she was scared to say. Oh, no. <em>No.</em> Rio was going to tell her something bad, something like how <em>she couldn’t see her anymore</em> or <em>she didn’t love her</em>. Something she would never recover from.</p><p>“I need to tell you something. Agatha, I--”</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>“Agatha, please, I--”</p><p>“<em>Please</em> don’t.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes searched Agatha’s face. Agatha’s lip quivered.</p><p>“I think I know what you are going to say," Agatha said, tears finding her again. “And I just can’t do that right now, Rio. Can we just go back to being Rio and Agatha, best friends forever? I’m sorry I messed it up, but I just-- <em>I need my best friend back</em>.”</p><p>Rio looked down again, shoulders shaking slightly. When she looked up, she had new determination in her eyes. “Whatever you need, Agatha. Whatever you want.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small smile. <em>The thing I want from you I can’t have.</em></p><p>Rio slowly got up, “Let me go find the doctor to see if we can get you discharged.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her wrist, holding her in place. “Rio, was it you who got me all the stuff?”</p><p>Rio nodded, a small smile curling on her lips. “Had to keep you entertained somehow so you didn’t rip the nurses to shreds.”</p><p>She squeezed Agatha’s hand before letting it go, door slamming slowly behind her. There were tears in Agatha’s eyes. She didn’t even try to wipe them away.</p><p>But they were friends again, <em>best friends</em>. She could live with this.</p><p>Because now she would at least still have a part of Rio, instead of nothing.</p>

<p>Rio Vidal was pushing a mattress up the stairs.</p><p>She would like you to know it was a very heavy mattress, even though it was a twin XL. Looks can be very deceiving. She cursed that neither she nor any of her friends had an air mattress, having instead to use the spare mattress from Lilia’s small guest room instead.</p><p>Agatha had gotten the all clear to be discharged from the hospital earlier that day. The hole in her lung had healed fully and she had strict instructions to be back in a week to get her stitches removed from her elbow, she was not allowed to walk without crutches and had to take all her medicines on time.</p><p>Rio had run around like a madman making sure that she had everything in order from picking up Agatha’s medicines from the pharmacy, which if she might say was unbelievably and unnaturally complicated, to making sure her fridge was stocked with enough healthy food that she would get through the next month, to now hauling a mattress into her studio so she could sleep there at night and not worry about hurting Agatha.</p><p>Because they were friends again.</p><p>Because she allowed Rio back into her life. After everything Rio did to hurt her.</p><p>And Rio was going to make sure she didn’t regret it.</p><p>Even though it broke her heart that Agatha stopped Rio from telling her how much she loved her. Even though Rio knew, for her, there was no going back to just being friends. Even though Rio knew she would spend her entire life being irrevocably in love with this girl.</p><p>Because she could see her face again. She could be around her. She could touch her and hug her and love her as a <em>friend</em>.</p><p>And it would be enough.</p><p>Rio finally shoved the mattress through the door, hauling it to lean against the wall as she  moved Agatha’s couch to be parallel with the kitchen counter, clearing space for the mattress on the foot of Agatha’s bed. She ran down to her car after setting the mattress, carrying up the bag of sheets and a comforter that she had kept from her college days, just in case she ever needed it, and a bag of her stuff so she could stay comfortably over the next week at the minimum.</p><p>After she was done, she drove quickly to the hospital so she could be there before Agatha woke up. She really was surprised she didn’t get pulled over even once. She honestly should have.</p><p>She was really becoming an unhinged presence on the street.</p><p>When she arrived Agatha was sitting in the bed, legs hanging over the edge, folding a shirt over the bandage on her elbow. When Rio walked in she flashed her a great big smile and Rio felt her insides melting.</p><p>How the fuck had she gone so long not knowing she loved this girl?</p><p><em>Idiot</em>. Idiot she was.</p><p>“Ready?” Rio said instead of <em>I love you</em>.</p><p>“Just need to find crutches.” Agatha gestured to where her sweatpants were cut off over the cast on her leg. “Doctor’s orders.”</p><p>“Did they not give you crutches?” Rio asked.</p><p>“There was a two day waiting list to get crutches from this hospital.” Agatha winced. “Might be better off just renting it.”</p><p>Rio nodded, rolling her eyes. “More fucking nightmare fuel.” She helped Agatha up from the bed, allowing her to lean against her as she limped out to the waiting room and let her slip into one of the chairs as Rio cleared the final discharge paperwork at the nurse’s station.</p><p>“So, finally going home?” Nurse Danvers asked as Rio signed the final forms.</p><p>Rio smiled as she signed the final forms and handed it back. “Thank you for all your help. Truly.”</p><p>“Of course,” the nurse waved her off. “It is wonderful to see the love you have for her.”</p><p>Rio smiled sadly and turned to walk away when she remembered. “Can you thank William for me too?”</p><p>“I won’t have to, you can do so yourself,” the nurse gestured behind Rio to where Agatha and William were laughing.</p><p>Something happened to Rio’s heart that very much resembled swooning. Over a laugh. She was so pathetic.</p><p>“I see you are back to rounds,” Rio said as she walked towards them, a folder of instructions and discharge papers in hand.</p><p>“Mhm, as fun as it was to spend time with you, Agatha, I do enjoy my training.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “You mean babysitting,” she teased.<br/>
Then, “Why were you babysitting me anyway?”</p><p>Rio felt her face pale.</p><p>“Uh-- I did-- because--” Billy stuttered, clearly remembering her threats.</p><p>
<em>“William,” Rio had said, entering the room five minutes after Wanda left. “How is she?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>William’s face was twisted in worry. “She is asleep, which is a small miracle. But her vitals are all over the place.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio sat down next to William, smiling sadly at Agatha. She took Agatha’s hand and held it over her heart. “Mi amor, we will get through this.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha trembled in her sleep.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Can I ask you a question?” William said, sitting on the other side of Agatha. Rio nodded.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Why didn’t you go home? Why did you stay?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I am worried something will happen when I am gone.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Why haven’t you been sitting with her then? You stay out during visiting hours.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“She wants to be done with me, she said she never wants to see my face again. Honestly, I don’t blame her. I have been acting like a dick lately.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Why?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio shook her head. “Why are you asking so many questions? What is wrong with you?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>When William simply kept staring at her, she caved. “Because I thought I could love someone else. I didn’t realize that my heart was already hers.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Why won’t you just-- just tell her you love her? I am sure she loves you too.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio left out a mangled laugh. “See that’s the thing, kid. Just because I love her doesn’t mean she loves me back. I-- I thought for a second she did, but I was wrong.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“What if I tell her?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’ll report you to the board and then burn your house down.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>William laughed. Rio narrowed her eyes further. “Don’t think I’m fucking around. I will get you fired if you utter a word of this or the fact she was on fentanyl or the fact that her insurance was denied.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>William raised his hands in mock fear. Rio turned her attention back to Agatha.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I don’t think you're lying so I will shut up now. Wait, no, final question,” Rio rolled her eyes but didn’t say anything to dissuade him. “What happens if she wakes up and she never wants to see you again?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was silent for a while.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Do you know what it feels like to breathe after you have been in a tight space for a long time? Like if you are in a small closet or tiny elevator and you think you're breathing fine and the second you step out your lungs inhale the air so fully that you realize that you had been holding your breath all along?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>William looked confused but didn’t stop her. “Agatha and I have been friends for ten years. I know her better than I know myself. I know what makes her laugh and I know when she has been crying, I melt when I see her happy and I want to tear the world apart when someone hurts her. But I never thought it was love. I always thought it was just a state of existence, like blinking or eating. Until now. Until I almost lost her and I realized I had been in that tiny closet all along, not breathing, too scared to walk out and suddenly there was air in my lungs. She is the air I breathe. So, to answer your question, I will walk away but never stop loving her, never be too far. Because I’m selfish and I only know how to breathe when I am near her. Because I only know love in terms of her.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>William was crying when she looked up.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“So, what, you’re going to stay away forever? You’re going to not tell her how much she means to you?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio shook her head. “I’m going to show her, William. I’m going to show her how much I love her every goddamn day. Whether she lets me stay or not.” </em>
</p><p>William kept muttering, opening his mouth and closing it like his brain was on fire.</p><p>“Because I am crazy,” Rio had said eventually, because it was true and also to just stop William’s muttering.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Where to?”</p><p>“The crutches store and then home,” Rio said as she helped Agatha into a wheelchair that a nurse brought over so Agatha could get to the car. William looked at them weirdly.</p><p>“Bye Agatha, bye Rio.” He waved, then he added. “I hope you two find a way to breathe together.”</p><p>Rio wanted to murder him and squeeze him. The <em>abomination</em>.</p><p>“What did he say?” Agatha asked when they got into Rio's car.</p><p>“I have no idea, what a weird kid,” Rio said, a small smile curling on her lips.</p><p>They successfully rented crutches from a small family owned store just two blocks away and reached Agatha’s apartment building by noon, but the second Rio pressed the elevator button, the little LED sign that showed the floor number blinked and flashed a ‘service not available’ message. She pressed it four more times but the elevator did not come.</p><p>
<em>It was just fucking working. Fucking hell.</em>
</p><p>Rio huffed and told Agatha to lean all her weight on her good leg and she moved Agatha’s crutches to rest against the wall. Agatha didn’t even have time to ask a question before Rio had hauled her into her arms and was carrying her, bridal style, up the stairs.</p><p>“Fucking elevator maintenance has really gone down lately,” Rio huffed. “What if you were alone here? How would you have gotten up the stairs? You should sue your landlord.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>Rio kept her eyes trained ahead, very focused on not dropping her. “What? He should get sued. He has not done a single fucking thing since you moved in. Useless man, remember when he got you to pay for a new fridge? And you did-- I still can’t believe you did that. Let’s see how long it takes for them to finish fixing this. If it's longer than a day, I swear I will sue him myself.”</p><p>Rio finally looked at her once they had reached the front door. Agatha was red and breathless, like she was the one who had climbed the stairs.</p><p>“You good?” Rio asked, tilting her head to her side, trying to read Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha refused to meet her eyes. “You can put me down now.”</p><p>Rio grinned and lowered a little and then pulled her towards her chest like she was curling weights at the gym. “I don’t know, this feels like a great exercise.”</p><p>Agatha flushed further. “Put me down, Rio.”</p><p>Rio slowly lowered her so Agatha could hop off and gently allowed her to unlock the door. Agatha stepped in, still leaning on Rio for support and immediately froze.</p><p>“What happened to my apartment?” she exclaimed.</p><p><em>Oh, yeah. Rio forgot to warn her.</em> “Shit, sorry, I forgot to tell you. I think I should stay here to help you. You still aren’t a hundred percent and I don’t want you to get hurt again trying to go to the bathroom yourself or eating your own cooked food.”</p><p>She gestured to the mattress. “Moved this in this morning so you wouldn’t have to worry about sharing the bed.”</p><p>Agatha was staring at the room in horror. Her flushed face was paling and a sinking feeling gripped Rio.</p><p>“Did-- do you not want me here?”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a while and then shook her head. “It makes sense for you to stay,” she mumbled.</p><p>Rio excused herself and brought Agatha’s crutches up the stairs, taking them two at a time, heart beating wildly.</p><p>
<em>Did she fuck up again? Did she overstep?</em>
</p><p>And then she walked into the apartment and Agatha had stomped her way to the bed and was sitting bundled up in blankets looking very much like an angry bean burrito, and she realized that she had an uphill battle ahead.</p><p>Because the one thing she knew about Agatha, almost like a preacher knew the  bible, was that she <em>never</em> accepted help straight up. She always had to be tricked into it.</p><p>Rio sighed. This was going to be a long week.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness was about to commit murder.</p><p>Specifically she was about to kill one Rio Vidal.</p><p>
<em>Why, you may ask?</em>
</p><p>Because her fridge was full for the first time in years, full of vegetables and meat and the cheese she liked from the grocery store forty minutes away she never found time to go to but thought about constantly. She was having not one, not two, but three home-cooked meals every day. Even though Rio put too much spice in the food and Agatha grumbled and moaned and ate all of it anyway.</p><p>Because Rio went out and bought bracelets with different protection stones, black tourmaline, obsidian, citrine, and forced Agatha to wear it. Even though Agatha didn’t know how the stones would protect her from getting hit by a car again, she did it so Rio could feel better knowing Agatha was safe.</p><p>Because Rio kept force feeding Agatha oranges and broth and applied funny smelling salves to her head hoping it would ease her pain. Because Rio would do things like be there to help her get up before she could even call out for her or wrap a plastic trash bag around Agatha’s cast so it wouldn’t get wet when she showered without Agatha even asking.</p><p>But mostly because Agatha couldn’t help but want <em>more</em>.</p><p>It consumed her how much she wanted this, forever. A future with Rio. How much she loved that Rio’s toothbrush was right next to hers in her bathroom. How much she loved that Rio’s shark pajamas (that Agatha had made fun of relentlessly) were actually made from pictures of sharks Rio had adopted online and tracked all around the world. How much Rio made her feel loved and worthy, just silently supporting her like a partner would, never asking for more, never asking her for anything.</p><p>It was making Agatha feel insane. Because they were not together. But Rio had been-- what is the word-- <em>overprotective</em> lately.</p><p>Agatha slept for thirteen hours straight when she came back from the hospital and was only woken up by Rio in a blind panic who was convinced she was ‘over-sleeping’ because she had spent four hours doom researching how patients recovered post-trauma and found out that sleeping excessively after a car accident ‘might indicate serious conditions like traumatic brain injuries, psychological stress, or physical injuries’. Agatha looked at her like she was bat-shit insane, told her to shut up and went back to sleep for another three hours.</p><p>In those three hours, Rio had printed out four different health plans that Agatha was going to follow, re-organized her entire apartment and cleaned it and taken her trash out and started to do laundry. When Agatha woke up and saw Rio wearing her bright pink ‘Kiss the Chef’ apron, she almost fell apart.</p><p>Because it was starting to feel dangerously like Rio was <em>hers</em>. And she couldn’t get used to the feeling. Because she had someone else.</p><p>But then Rio had started fixing things, like she lived there too. When Agatha was awake, she could hear a muffled drill or hammer or some kind of power tool that was just fighting the old charm of her crumbling apartment which was honestly held together with duct tape and prayers. She truly paid too much for this dump. Rio fixed the broken door handle, drilled her shelf into the wall because she was paranoid about it falling over in an earthquake, and fixed all the leaky faucets in the house.</p><p>She would have made a great superintendent actually. Or husband. Or father.</p><p><em>Nope</em>. Agatha chanted to herself, yet again. <em>Not yours. Not yours.</em></p><p>But then Rio would put down her tools when she noticed Agatha grab her head in pain and come sit next to her and they would talk about anything and everything. Rio would get easily excited, eyes burning with passion as she went off about some obscure fact about sharks or plants and Agatha would forget to breathe.</p><p>It all came back to this, to loving Rio. It all felt so domestic, like coming home to the love of your life. Because it was, in many ways. Loving Rio was as tied to her soul as breathing was to her body. No one even came close enough for comparison.</p><p>Agatha was so fucking screwed.</p><p>Because Rio didn’t stop at the cleaning or fixing, no, she would go ahead and do something so pure and vulnerable Agatha would feel sick. Like drawing a picture of a very pretty plant on her cast, refusing to tell her its name and when Agatha finally figured it out by using Google image and reverse searching it she almost fucking fell out of her chair.</p><p>Fucking bitch drew a bleeding heart. Agatha almost bought a knife and killed Rio right then and there. Because this plant Rio had so casually drawn signified <em>a deep and passionate, sorrowful love that went beyond life and death.</em> That is what Rio drew on her fucking cast.</p><p>Rio probably drew it because she liked the way it looked or because she meant it as a friend.</p><p>But Agatha had clearly lost her marbles because she was too happy to walk around with the woman she loved (who had a girlfriend!)’s drawing of a plant that signified eternal love for the next month. Why did she not rip the cast off her leg and bash Rio over the head with it? She had to <em>stop.</em></p><p>
<em>Did Rio know what she was doing to her?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Did Rio know she was irrevocably ruining Agatha forever? </em>
</p><p>She could feel it, she really was on the verge of snapping and becoming the next Ted Bundy.</p><p>Or snapping and shoving Rio against the nearest wall and fucking her into oblivion.</p><p>She couldn’t stop thinking about how Rio had so casually picked her up a few days ago and carried up the stairs. How strong she was. How much she wanted to jump her and fuck her until her eyes rolled over and she couldn’t speak, couldn’t move, couldn’t think of anyone else. About how she could see a sliver of Rio’s toned abs when she stood and stretched in the morning and it drove her feral. She wanted to mark every inch of Rio’s skin, she wanted to carve her name into her heart.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t going to survive much longer. (<em>She never wanted this to end.</em>)</p><p>She needed to fucking talk to someone about this. Someone who were not her friends and were not trapped between Agatha and Rio and forced to choose a side. She needed an objective viewpoint on a platform her friends would never check.</p><p>She opened Reddit.</p><p>As Rio manically cleaned the house, Agatha wrote out a heartfelt post about what was going on, hoping internet strangers would solve her problems. They did not. They may have made it worse. <em>Get out of the house</em>, they said. <em>It’ll give you some space.</em></p><p>Agatha suggested they go to the park, get some air and Rio agreed. Now, they have a bunny.</p><p>A poor abandoned bunny. Because those stupid, cute red eyes coupled with Rio’s big, brown, puppy ones meant Agatha did not stand a fucking chance.</p><p>It meant they spent a few hundred dollars on a visit to the vet.</p><p>It meant they bought a cage and a pen for the bunny to play in.</p><p>It meant their apartment smelled like pee and shit and Agatha loved every moment of it.</p><p>Because Señor Scratchy, Sr. (not to be confused with the plushy, who was also Señor Scratchy, now with the added Jr.) filled her heart with a little more joy. And watching Rio and the rabbit interact was taking years off her life.</p><p><em>She would make such a wonderful mother</em>. Snap out of it! <em>Not. Yours.</em></p><p>Even though Rio begged her to adopt the rabbit, you know with her love for animals and plants and nature, yada yada, Señor Scratchy, Sr. liked Agatha way more. It wasn’t even a competition. Agatha won by a million miles. He snuggled into her side any moment he got, and she played with his soft fur constantly. Agatha was suspicious that Rio was jealous of the rabbit.</p><p>She ignored what that thought did to her heart.</p><p>For the first few days, Agatha did nothing related to the rabbit. Partially because even though Rio would grumble in the morning about feeding the bunny, she would do it before Agatha woke up, and partially because Agatha was very much enjoying watching Rio chase the rabbit around the apartment like a headless chicken.</p><p>Agatha would catch Rio trying to bribe the bunny with homemade treats so it would like her, or trying to rub her scent on tissue paper and shoving it in his cage. But the second she let him go, he would come running to Agatha and burrow his face in her chest and Agatha would try and fail not to laugh.</p><p>After another day of the bunny straight up rejecting Rio’s love, she tried convincing Agatha to give it to a shelter.</p><p>“The apartment is too small for the bunny!” Rio whined. “We should give him to a home where he can jump around.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at the rabbit who snuggled closer to her. “Don’t attack my baby. He’s going nowhere.”</p><p>“The bane of my fucking existence,” Rio muttered under her breath. “I swear he is <em>smirking</em> at me.” She walked away still muttering.</p><p>“I fear your mother has lost the plot.” She said, ignoring the part where she acknowledged that she and Rio were this bunny’s parents and instead focusing on the part where Rio seemed to be beefing with a rabbit.</p><p>And then Señor Scratchy, Sr. shat all over Rio’s mattress while she was out running errands. Agatha didn’t notice until it was over, the smell reaching her suddenly and she limped over to throw open the windows just as Rio came in and saw what happened.</p><p>“You little--” Rio leaped after the rabbit but he burrowed himself in Agatha’s arms and she just looked at Rio through her eyelashes and Rio folded.</p><p>“Fucking roadkill,” she heard Rio mutter as she stripped the sheets and took them out in a trash bag. “When Agatha isn’t looking, I will gut you and cook you in a stew.”</p><p>Señor Scratchy, Sr. looked alarmed. Well, as alarmed as a rabbit could look. Agatha tried not to laugh.</p><p>Rio came back for the mattress that she rinsed and left outside in the apartment’s shared backyard to dry. Agatha put Señor Scratchy, Sr. back in the cage then, in his little punishment hole because she realized he had just made her life a <em>lot</em> harder.</p><p>Because Rio would not fit on the couch. And that meant one thing.</p><p>“Are you sure you are okay with me sharing the bed?” Rio asked for the hundredth time, just staring at the empty left side, refusing to get in.</p><p>“Rio just get into the bed, I don’t bite.” Agatha finally snapped. Rio immediately got under the covers.</p><p>She rolled over, back facing Agatha. Agatha stared at her sleep shirt loosely falling to reveal a slender shoulder and tried very hard to steady her breaths. She turned over too, so they were now back to back. This is not how she imagined the first time they shared a bed would be, backs against each other, not touching, not looking into each other’s eyes, but this was all she had.</p><p>And she would take this forever, even if she knew it would slowly kill her.</p>

<p class="reddith1">AITA [30F] for telling my best friend I never want to see her face again?</p>
<p class="redditcategory">Am I The Asshole?</p>
<p>I (30F) have been in love with my best friend (30F) since college. This is hard to admit because I have never really put it into words before. I have known it, deep inside, but I have always dismissed it because she is my best friend. Recently, she got a girlfriend and I *admittedly* spiraled. We got into a bad fight and coincidentally, I got hit by a car that very day. I saw her laughing with her girlfriend outside my hospital room when I woke up. She wasn’t even in the room with me like all my other friends were. I lost it further. I told my friends to tell her that I didn’t want to see her face. She never came to visit me. My friends finally told me that she and her girlfriend had been helping fight the insurance company cause there was some problem with my stay and now I feel horrible. We made up and she has also basically moved in with me to take care of me for a bit even though she has a girlfriend and a job she should be thinking about. It makes me feel horrible. I can’t really talk to my friends about this because they keep telling me we should be together, but I know she doesn’t love me. AITA?</p>

<p class="redditcommenttext">I don’t think you are the asshole! People get jealous, it’s totally reasonable. You just need to communicate with her about where your boundaries are, it doesn’t sound like living together would be best. Maybe go outside? Or tell her to go home for a bit? So you can get a break from each other! </p>

<span class="text">1) Agatha and Rio have been in love since college. 2) Agatha got very jealous of Nat and Rio and thinks Rio and Nat are still together. Rio and Nat have broken up (unconfirmed bec of accident?). 3) Rio thinks Wanda and Agatha slept together. She also thinks Agatha hates her and she is the reason Agatha got hit by a car. 4) Agatha thinks Rio didn’t visit her in the hospital even though Rio never left the goddamn place. 5) They both think the other doesn’t love them back, but Rio has moved into Agatha’s apartment and is now taking care of her (platonically?). 6) They have a rabbit together. </span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Alice</span><br/>
<span class="text">you know when you lay it all like this, the idiocy really shines through</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Wanda</span><br/>
<span class="text">wait, no some facts in ur summary are wrong…</span><br/>
<span class="text">I told rio we didn’t sleep together when i visited the hospital. she knows.</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Nat</span><br/>
<span class="text">And Rio and I broke up right before she found out about Agatha's accident! Had nothing to do with it!</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Alice</span><br/>
<span class="text">this makes so much more sense. i knew there was no way you two were still together but rio was in a different fucking universe this last week so we were too scared to ask what happened</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Nat</span><br/>
<span class="text">Wait, did you add me to a group chat to help bring Rio and Agatha together thinking I was still with Rio? Wtf?</span><br/>
<span class="breply">No, we knew you guys broke up. We just didn’t know if it was because of the accident or not. </span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Alice</span><br/>
<span class="text">i think rio still hasn't told agatha u two broke up, should WE tell agatha??</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Wanda</span><br/>
<span class="text">NO! This may help in bringing these two together!!</span><br/>
<span class="breply">Do elaborate.</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Lilia</span><br/>
<span class="text">We are listening.</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Wanda</span><br/>
<span class="text">so, we know jealousy works, right. cause the first time in ten years that they have gotten even close in admitting anything has been because agatha got insanely jealous of nat and rio got jealous of me. </span><br/>
<span class="breply">Yeah, but it also imploded horribly. </span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Wanda</span><br/>
<span class="text">yes, but what if we control it? invite them out for dinner to one of our places and kind of turn up the touchy-feely part?</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Alice</span><br/>
<span class="text">OR what if we lock them in a closet instead?</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Lilia</span><br/>
<span class="text">As endearing as both plans are, they will fail horribly. Wanda, jealousy won’t work because they need to communicate and this will only make them want to be friends more because they will think the other is with someone else. And Alice, they are literally locked in Agatha’s apartment together and only talking about sharks.</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Lilia</span><br/>
<span class="text">No, we need to get them to feel what it would be like to be together and maybe they’ll realize it’s what they wanted all along.</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Alice</span><br/>
<span class="text">they’re literally sharing a bed together already, would it matter if we got them to act like a couple?</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Nat</span><br/>
<span class="text">They need to just talk, so why don’t we tell them that Rio was there in the hospital all along and we broke up and Agatha doesn’t hate Rio and THEN lock them in a closet?</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Wanda</span><br/>
<span class="text">i literally told rio (verbatim) that agatha kissed me for two seconds and then spent three hours crying about how rio didn’t love her the night you four came to agatha’s and rio told me that i was wrong and agatha didn’t love her actually. </span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Nat</span><br/>
<span class="text">How can they be this stupid after this long??? HOW???</span><br/>
<span class="breply">Honestly, I think Lilia’s idea is the best. They need to team up so they can actually get on the same page. I think I have an idea but it would require Wanda and Nat to play ball...</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Wanda</span><br/>
<span class="text">i'm in.</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Nat</span><br/>
<span class="text">Me too.</span><br/>
<span class="breply">Wait, can I call?</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Wanda</span><br/>
<span class="text">yes</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Nat</span><br/>
<span class="text">Yeah.</span><br/>
<span class="time"><b>Today</b> 1:53 AM</span><br/>
<span class="grouptext">Alice</span><br/>
<span class="text">LETS GO TEAM IDIOTS</span><br/>
<span class="breply">Alice… we are not the idiots… </span><br/>

<p>Rio Vidal woke up with something tickling her face.</p><p>Something soft. At first, she thought it was Señor Scratchy, the plushy, then she thought that the stupid bunny has fucking escaped and sat on her head, but when she blinked open and looked at what was on her face, she noticed it was brown.</p><p>It was Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Because she was sprawled all over Rio. And Rio’s arms were around her, holding Agatha to her chest, her chin resting on top of Agatha’s head.</p><p>She was not brave enough to breathe, no, not when this meant everything. For this very brief moment, Agatha was hers. Only <em>hers</em>. She was in her arms and Rio could pretend for a little that she wasn’t going to run away when she woke up. She still couldn’t believe that she went so long not knowing she loved Agatha, that she spent so long right next to her and didn’t realize that Agatha held the key to her happiness in the palm of her hand. Being here made everything that had happened the week before lighter, easier.</p><p>She wanted to hope, but she was too scared. Hope felt like a cheating wife, coming in to give Rio some relief and then escaping, as sneakily as she entered, leaving Rio fucked and ruined.</p><p>Agatha let out a soft snore and snuggled further into Rio’s arms and Rio tightened her hold on her. For now, she had this. She refused to go back to sleep, instead, played with the ends of Agatha’s hair mindlessly as she imagined what it would be to do this every morning.</p><p>She really wished that she hadn’t lost the chance to do this forever.</p><p>Eventually, the alarm rang. Rio made no move to silence it, hoping to stay in this moment, hoping if she ignored it enough it would just stop. Eventually, Agatha’s eyes shot open and she reached over Rio to turn it off. When she pulled back from the nightstand, she seemed to realize how close they were and blushed.</p><p>“Sorry,” she mumbled.</p><p>“‘Tis okay,” Rio said, instead of her preferred response of come back here.</p><p>Agatha got up and scooted off, picking up her phone and running into the bathroom. Rio lazily stretched, disappointed but not surprised this ended the way it did.</p><p>
<em>Agatha just wanted to be friends. And Rio would respect the hell out of that, no matter what she personally wanted.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was not going to take more than Agatha was comfortable with giving.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She had taken too much already. </em>
</p><p>Rio opened her phone hoping for a distraction and she got one. There were a few panicked texts from Jen so Rio just decided to call her.</p><p>“Rio!” Jen said, picking up after a few rings. “Is Agatha around?”</p><p>Agatha chose that moment to walk out of the bathroom, hair still disheveled, the black floral robe she adored over her clothes.</p><p>“Yeah, she is,” Rio said, gesturing to Agatha to come back into the bed and putting the phone on speaker. “You’re on speaker.”</p><p>“Agatha, I know you are still hurt, but the Hospital Gala event is tonight,” Jen’s voice crackled into the studio.</p><p>“Oh shit, I totally forgot about that.” Agatha sighed as she sat down on the edge of the bed.</p><p>“See, the thing is I would tell you not to come at all, but it is literally in tandem with Westview Presbyterian and our bosses would really like to celebrate you and have you speak about both our company and the care you got at the hospital.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Care? Let me tell you something about the <em>care</em> Agatha got--”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha cut her off, placing a hand on her shoulder and rubbing slow circles, a gesture that made Rio’s heart stop. “Jen, I don’t know if I can do this. I’m still not ready to come back to work full time.”</p><p>“I get it Ags, I just thought this would be a good moment to show your face to everyone, make a speech and then immediately leave and not worry about work for another few weeks. Because otherwise they will make you come to the bug emporium benefit in two weeks.”</p><p>“Oh god, no, yeah. I don’t want to do that.” She sighed. “Fuck, you are right. I think tonight might be the move.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio asked and Agatha turned to face her, blue eyes looking into Rio’s so deeply she thought she would drown.</p><p>“I’m sure, if it's only for an hour or so, I will be okay.”</p><p>“Okay, great you and Rio can--”</p><p>“Rio? No, I will be fine on my own.”</p><p>“Yeah, I am not letting you go to this event alone,” Rio grumbled, tensing up.</p><p>Agatha looked surprised as if she didn’t already predict that Rio was going to come with her. “Rio, I don’t need a babysitter--”</p><p>Jen’s voice crackled through the phone. “Actually, about that, um, Agatha you might want to bring a date. Ralph has been, um, saying things about--”</p><p>“I don’t need to know,” Agatha cut in, eyes narrowing. “I feel like I have a very good idea of what <em>Ralph</em> has been saying about me.”</p><p>“Who’s Ralph?” Rio couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>Agatha looked away and mumbled something incoherent.</p><p>“Who’s Ralph?” Rio repeated, louder.</p><p>“He is this guy who works with us and he’s kind of, um, obsessed with Agatha,” Jen replied.</p><p>Obsessed?</p><p>Rio was going to rip him limb from limb.</p><p>“I’m sorry, why is this the first I have heard of this?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Because of this exact reason. You <em>cannot</em> hurt him, Rio. He is the nephew of the head of the company.”</p><p>“So, the PR firm will get a new nephew. Big deal, can you tell me his full name, Jen?”</p><p>“As much as I would enjoy this, Agatha is right. But there is something you may be able to do,” Jen murmured. Rio should have recognized the smugness in her voice for the blaring red signal it was.</p><p>“You two should come together.”</p><p>“Yeah, we are obviously--”</p><p>“No, you guys should come as a couple.”</p><p>Silence. Rio heard something fall in the distance. Probably the other shoe.</p><p>“I’m sorry?” Agatha strangled out. “You want us to--<em>what</em>?”</p><p>“Jen, what the hell are you saying?” Rio’s heart was beating wildly.</p><p>“I’m saying you two numbnuts should fake-date each other for one night so Ralph leaves Agatha alone forever, because let’s face it, Rio is scary.”</p><p>
<em>Fake date a girl she is in love with? This seems stupid even for Rio.</em>
</p><p>“Why me? Why not Wanda? Aren’t you two a--”</p><p>“Nothing happened between me and Wanda,” Agatha said softly. “We are nothing but friends.”</p><p>Jen sighed. “And I’m asking <em>you</em>, Rio, because you will go all fierce protector on Agatha all night and not leave her side and then bring her home anyway so you both are literally halfway there. All you have to do is sell it a little.”</p><p>Agatha looked like she was caught between blind panic and hysteria. “What about Nat? She won’t be okay with this, would she?”</p><p>“Uh, Nat and I--”</p><p>“Nat isn’t a problem.” Jen said confidently. “I talked to her this morning, she is all okay with this.”</p><p>“You talked to Nat this morning?” Rio almost screeched. “Why? Is everything okay?”</p><p>“Rio, you <em>really</em> need to call her back.” Rio could hear the laughter in her voice.</p><p>“Fuck, I know. I have been kind of trying to avoid that part but she has been texting me everyday with updates about insurance and everything else so I think I am pretty in the loop.” Rio was smiling as she turned to Agatha who looked like she had seen a ghost.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio questioned, reaching out but before she could touch her, Agatha flinched.</p><p>“I don’t know if it is a good idea to do this.”</p><p>“Agatha--” Rio started only to be cut off.</p><p>“Think of it this way. One night and you will be rid of two problems and you two can go back to whatever you’re doing and your bunny.” Jen said</p><p>Agatha tapped her chin like she was considering it. “Fuck it, if <em>everyone</em> is okay with it, yeah.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio questioned, searching Agatha for any discomfort.</p><p>Agatha nodded and got up, moving to Scratchy’s pen and lifting him up. “Yeah, one night and then everything goes back to <em>normal</em>.” Agatha seemed a little choked up, but Rio assumed it was from Scratchy fur getting in her eyes.</p><p>“Okay, great. I will see you both at five,” Jen said and hung up.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio asked, no harm in triple-checking or quadruple-checking too.</p><p>“Are <em>you</em> sure?” Agatha asked, eyes heavy with an emotion Rio couldn’t place.</p><p>Rio nodded mindlessly. <em> Anything for you.</em></p><p>“You should get ready at yours,” Agatha said a few moments later.</p><p><em>Don’t ask me to go.</em> “Why?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, looking at her as if she was stupid. “Because all your stuff is there?”</p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p>That is how Rio ended up at her apartment for the first time in two weeks. Her plants were alive, thanks in large part to Lilia, but everything else was covered in a thin layer of dust.</p><p>She had a long bath, possibly the first real one since Agatha got hurt. She rinsed off the crusted sweat and dried tears that had found their permanent place in her skin, hoping they would take all the feelings that had weighed on her soul with them.</p><p>She loved Agatha, she knew that, but there was a loud voice that constantly reminded her that she didn’t deserve Agatha.</p><p>Not after she spent ten years violently suppressing her feelings for her. Letting them build. Letting them rot. They had turned into mangled versions of themselves, carrying weight that would not have been saddled if she had simply let herself feel.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Because it was easier to admit they had nothing than it was to watch Agatha know and choose someone else.</p><p>It was easier to laugh and joke about it because talking about it would wreck her.</p><p>It was easier to run away than it was to know she would be rejected.</p><p>But it wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair to Agatha and it wasn’t fair to her.</p><p>Because Rio never let herself truly accept it or let it go. It always hung between them, a possibility, a future she was too scared to ask for.</p><p>She didn’t want to end up like her parents.</p><p>She couldn’t end up like her parents. Full of anger that consumed all their good parts, full of disdain and torment. How could you end up hating the person you love?</p><p>Could she end up hating Agatha?</p><p>
<em>No. But she could end up hating herself. </em>
</p><p>Fuck, she already did.</p><p>There was not one relationship she had not thrown a live grenade into when she was scared of being abandoned, not one shred of happiness that stayed once she brought out the machine guns and let them loose on herself, not one future that she didn’t rip apart with her own bare hands.</p><p>Because she didn’t deserve happiness.</p><p>And she sure as hell didn’t deserve Agatha.</p><p>But for the first time in her life, Rio wanted to <em>try</em> to be worthy.</p><p>Rio wanted to unleash all the love that had been building up inside her. No matter how many compartments and files and boxes she found in her mind to stash, hide, burn the love she had to Agatha, it came pouring back the second she looked into those blue eyes.</p><p>Because she was like the Titanic in that way, no matter how many compartments and buffer rooms she created out of thin air when she hit the fatal iceberg, the love still seeped in, filling, sinking, engulfing her until there was nothing but the soft tune of the orchestra and a million drowned reasons she shouldn’t do this.</p><p>And Rio was really tired of trying to claw her way back to the surface.</p><p>So, for possibly the first time in her adult life, she let herself feel.</p><p>And she let it all out. Everything she had bottled up. All the pain that was gnawing at her.</p><p>Of seeing Agatha in that fucking hospital room, attached to monitors, fighting through pain, not being able to do anything, not being able to help, not be able to tell her how much she is loved.<br/>Of watching her walk away time after time, not saying anything, trying not to feel anything, a prison of her own making.</p><p>Of loving someone and only getting crumbs. Being able to kiss her on the cheek but not on the mouth. Being able to be there for her constantly, but not being able to be there in the way that mattered.</p><p>And she loved Agatha so much.</p><p>She loved how Agatha was fearless and strong and never took no for an answer. She loved how Agatha blushed when you made an inappropriate joke but tried to mask it under a cough. She loved how she thought about the world, as if it was both beautiful and broken at the same time, but never let the ugliness eat her from within, never let her past define who she was.</p><p>But a part of that love was respect. And Agatha had made it very clear that she only looked at Rio as a friend.</p><p>Rio knew Agatha cared. Agatha clearly cared.</p><p>She ate Rio’s food even though the spices were too much and her eyes would water and she would cough. She secretly researched all of Rio’s hyperfixations and interests so they could talk about it together. She would keep all of Rio’s half finished projects as mementos.</p><p>Fuck, she even seemed to only be watching telenovelas lately, as though she knew had been trying to get better by watching the shows. She knew Rio didn’t know how to speak Spanish but still understood it and was struggling with that fact. Rio swore she caught Agatha twice in the bathroom practising how to speak Spanish, even though she violently denied it.</p><p>And Agatha had taken every protection bracelet and new diet and smelly paste Rio had thrown at her, never once telling Rio that her worry was too much, never once making her feel like she wasn’t wanted.</p><p>
<em>I think I know what you are going to say, and I just can’t do that right now, Rio. </em>
</p><p>Agatha cared and loved Rio as a friend.</p><p>And that is a fact she was going to get used to. She knew she would never fully move on, but she owed to herself and Agatha to give what she could until Agatha didn’t want it anymore.</p><p>
<em>Can we just go back to being Rio and Agatha, best friends forever? </em>
</p><p>Rio was tired of running and hiding and drowning. She was going to feel it all, all the love, all the rejection, all the fucking pain.</p><p>
<em>I need my best friend back.</em>
</p><p>She was going to stop hiding and face the music head on.</p><p>She loved Agatha Harkness and she wasn't afraid of it anymore.</p>

<p>Agatha Harkness was going to cry.</p><p>Her dress was not fitting over her boot, her goddamn hair looked like a rat’s nest and she ran out of concealer.</p><p>She was so ready to call this entire thing off when she heard Rio shuffle in, and she walked out, hair frizzy, makeup half on, a makeshift bib tucked into her collar and froze.</p><p>Because there stood Rio in a very sharp suit, black with little gray pinstripes running down, the collar plunging dangerously low, no shirt to hide the curve of her cleavage, and lips stained red.</p><p>As if Agatha wasn’t already having visceral visions of flinging her against walls when she was in shark pajamas.</p><p>Her heart really couldn’t handle this.</p><p>“You look beautiful,” Rio said, smiling wide and genuine.</p><p>“Don’t lie to me, I look like a kid just threw up on me,” Agatha rolled her eyes. Rio stuck her tongue in her cheek, trying not to laugh.</p><p>
<em>Breathe, you idiot. Fucking breathe. </em>
</p><p>“Let me help,” she said, grabbing her hairbrush and gently coming to stand behind her, combing her hair softly.</p><p>Rio looked so damn cute, eyes scrunched, focused.</p><p>
<em>Agatha had the desire to do something very stupid. </em>
</p><p>Something she probably shouldn’t do considering the last time she had this desire she threw a live grenade into their relationship.</p><p>“Rio?” <em>Idiot, idiot, don’t do it.</em> Rio looked up anyway.</p><p>“Why have you done all this for me? You’ve never been this,” she paused, trying to find the right word, “<em>involved</em>.”</p><p>Rio looked gutted. Agatha swore she saw her eyes glisten.</p><p>“I never thought you’d let me.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart lurched.</p><p>Rio paused and Agatha thought this was all she was going to get. She was wrong.</p><p>“I’ve always thought I didn’t deserve you so I held back, gave less, hid more. But sometimes things happen that make you realize that life is too short. I don’t want to live like this forever.” Rio took a deep breath.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shone. “What do you want to live like?”</p><p>“I want to be better. I want to love louder and live freer, away from the worry, away from the fear. I want to be <em>worthy</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart broke a little.</p><p>“Rio, you <em>are</em> worthy,” she said, finding her eyes in the mirror.</p><p>Rio scoffed and shook her head. “I am not, but it is okay. I will spend my entire life trying to be worthy of you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened and she stared into Rio’s eyes. This felt dangerously close to a confession.</p><p>They didn’t <em>do</em> confessions.</p><p>But, maybe they should.</p><p>“I don’t think I am enough either. I don’t think I am good. I don’t think I get to be happy.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened. “Agatha, of all the people in the entire world, you are the only person I know who deserves it more than everyone.”</p><p>“You’re just biased,” Agatha said, not stopping the slow smile that took over her face.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied, smiling too. “I am.”</p><p>They piled into the car five minutes later, silence descending over the car as the sun set in the distance, but this time, it was a bit lighter, a bit more companionable.</p><p>More intimate.</p><p>When they arrived, Rio ran over, opening the car door before Agatha could even try. They walked up in silence, not touching, but close enough that a small movement would cause them to.</p><p>“Ready?” Rio asked, turning to face Agatha in front of the entrance.</p><p>“Ready,” Agatha nodded.</p><p>Rio held her arm out to her. “Tonight you're mine,” she murmured under breath softly. So softly Agatha almost missed it.</p><p>Her heart started beating widely.</p><p>The Gala had just started as they entered, tall tables scattered around a large ballroom, waiters flicking between tables with trays of food, elegant decorations and flowers hanging all around.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p><em>Already?</em> Ralph wasted no fucking time. He was already by her side, leaning over to hug her when he was yanked backwards.</p><p>“I’m sorry, who are you?” Rio growled, holding the back of his collar.</p><p>“I’m Ralph Bohner,” he said proudly, raising his nose towards Rio. “I’m pretty important here. Who the hell are you?”</p><p>“I’m the girlfriend of the woman you just tried to hug. Here’s a piece of advice, don’t try again.” Rio’s eyes burned with anger and something that felt a lot like possession.</p><p>Tonight you're <em>mine. Mine.</em></p><p>It rang through Agatha’s head like a broken bell, loud and deep, filling every available corner.</p><p>
<em>Mine. Mine. Mine.</em>
</p><p>“I didn’t know she was dating someone,” Ralph was sweating. Rio brought herself close again, draping her arm around Agatha.</p><p>“Now you know, so can you stop bothering her or shall I find HR?”</p><p>“Nope, no, not again. I am gonna go, have a good night you two,” Ralph ran out.</p><p>The second he left, Rio dropped her hand, face relaxing.</p><p>“Well, that’s over. Now we just have to get through your speech and enjoy the night.”</p><p>“Yeah, where is the bar--”</p><p>Agatha froze as she came in contact with the one pair of eyes she thought she would never see again.</p><p>“Agatha.” That voice haunted her dreams.</p><p>“Mother.”</p><p>She was in many ways the same and very different. Same pale skin stretched out over sharp bones, but now her brown hair was fully white, and those emotionless eyes, frantic.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatha tried her best to sound brave.</p><p>“I am a donor of the hospital,” Evanora replied, a cold mask descending.</p><p>“In Westview?”</p><p>“It is owned by a trust that deals with many hospitals all along the east coast.” Cold. Harsh.</p><p>
<em>Like Agatha was stupid for not knowing. Like Agatha was a fool. </em>
</p><p>“Can we talk alone?” Evanora asked, almost dismissively.</p><p>Rio moved in front of Agatha, arms crossed, teeth bared, blocking her from Evanora’s view. Like a guard dog. “No.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, shaking her head. Her eyes pleaded with Rio. <em>No violence today.</em> “You get exactly ten minutes.”</p><p>Rio moved aside, arms still crossed, jaw set as she walked away, still within pouncing distance but out of earshot.</p><p>“So, what do you want?” Agatha asked, whipping forward, knowing there was some angle, some <em>thing</em> Evanora needed from her.</p><p>“Do I need to want something to see you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I just wanted to, you know, catch up.” Evanora said, sounding too eager, well as eager as a heartless bitch can sound.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“What are you doing with your life, Agatha?” Evanora finally said, arms raised, knife in hand ready to eviscerate Agatha’s emotions. “Is this all worth leaving your family over? Your mother over?”</p><p>“I didn’t <em>leave</em> you,” Agatha said, refusing to show any weakness. “You disowned me.”</p><p>“You did this to <em>yourself</em>. I see you, Agatha.” Evanora said, bracing for attack, eyes sharp, mouth curled in a feline smirk. “You and I are the same.”</p><p>“No, we are not.” Agatha’s confidence was wavering. She was literally confronted by her worst fear.</p><p>“Are we not? Because from where I am standing I see you alone, unloved, unworthy. All the things you swore I was all those years ago.”</p><p>“I am not--” Agatha began. But Evanora had sunk her blade right between Agatha’s chest and she was determined to rip her daughter to shreds.</p><p>“You are alone. You are no good. Everyone around you can see it. See that you are wicked.”</p><p>“I am not wicked.” Agatha said, but her voice was wavering.</p><p>Evanora saw that for what it was, an opening. “No one will ever love you. No one can. You are unloveable.”</p><p>“I am not,” Agatha said, almost pleading. “I have my friends. I have my-- <em>Rio</em>.”</p><p>“Your Rio, huh? And where is <em>your</em> Rio?”</p><p>Agatha looked towards the house and locked eyes with Rio who was now next to Wanda and Nat.</p><p>
<em>Nat.</em>
</p><p>She forgot about Nat.</p><p>She forgot that Rio wasn’t <em>hers</em>.</p><p>She forgot this was all fake.</p><p>“Oh, I remember her,” Evanora said, following Agatha’s gaze. “She’s your charity case. The friend she brought around everywhere, like your own personal bitch.”</p><p>Rage tore through Agatha at those words. “You have no right to talk to her like that--”</p><p>“Why are you so angry, Agatha,” Evanora said, narrowing her eyes and connecting the dots Agatha absolutely did not want her to connect. “Is it because you love her?”</p><p>Agatha said nothing, still staring at Rio, watching her whisper worriedly with their friends, still trying to build up her walls that had been completely destroyed by her mother.</p><p>“You do, don’t you? And let me guess, she doesn’t love you back.”</p><p>And with that Evanora tore open all the wounds Agatha had so painfully stitched together, pouring salt into the bleeding gash, watching as blood poured out of her daughter and grinning with joy.</p><p>
<em>Because she was right. Rio didn’t love her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No matter how much she tried to pretend she did, with this blissful week they just spent and the taking care of her, no matter how much she wished it to be true, Rio didn’t look at her that way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She didn’t want to be her girlfriend.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She didn’t want to be with her at all.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hell, she didn’t fucking visit her in the hospital.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because that is what it came down to, that is what it all came down to, Rio wasn’t there when Agatha needed her the most.  </em>
</p><p>“You know I am right,” Evanora said. “Come back with me. Come back home and run the firm, I’m getting old, I need a successor.”</p><p>Agatha turned away, tears blinding her vision. She heard a crash and then aggressive stomping but she couldn’t really process anything.</p><p>Because for once her mother was right.</p><p>Evanora was an awful, horrid human but a broken clock is right twice a day, and unfortunately, she was very right about this.</p><p>
<em>She was not loved by the one person she wanted. And it was killing her. </em>
</p><p>The next thing she knew multiple people were pulling Rio off her mother as Evanora yelled bloody murder.</p><p>“She broke my nose, the bitch, I’m going to sue her, I’m going to sue all of you.”</p><p>“I’d like to see you try,” Rio yelled back, fury engulfing her face.</p><p>Agatha should have felt triumphant that Rio defended her but all that was beating in her heart was <em>she doesn’t love you, she never will. You will never be good enough. You will always be evil. </em></p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said. Because that is all she could in that moment. “Stop.”</p><p>
<em>She didn’t visit you in the hospital. She will leave you. She will never love you. </em>
</p><p>Rio immediately stopped, fighting away from her friend’s grasps and walking towards Agatha.</p><p>The thing about the other shoe is that Agatha is that never waits for it to fall. She would rather rip it out violently on her own terms than be blindsided.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asked, voice alarmed.</p><p>“I’m unpausing.”</p><p>“Unpausing what?”</p><p>“I don’t want you here. I don’t want you in my life.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes melted into shock, her mouth falling open. “Agatha, what?”</p><p>“I want you to leave me alone.”</p><p>“But we-- but I-- what?”</p><p>“I never want to see your face again.”</p><p>“Agatha, I don’t understand what happened, we were fine-- we--”</p><p>“You never visited me in the hospital. You let me fucking rot there alone. You weren’t there when I needed you, Rio, did you think I would just forget that?”</p><p>“I never left-- Agatha, what is happening?” Rio was pleading.</p><p>Agatha stormed off, behind her mother, Rio trailing.</p><p>“Agatha, can we please talk this, you don’t know the full story--”</p><p>“Have your stuff out of my house before I come back.”</p><p>Agatha barely made it into the bathroom before the tears found her.</p><p>She was gutted, <em>devastated</em>.</p><p>No, devastated would be the wrong word. What is the word for when your mother drudges up all your past fears and throws them on your face and you realize the love of your life doesn’t love you and you tell them you never want to see them again even though you want the exact opposite and now you’ve broken your own heart and your bunny is now a child of divorce? That word, that word is what she is feeling.</p><p>Agatha was too caught up in making sure no one could hear her cry, shoving her fist into her mouth while her tears ran loose when she heard giggles and moans and a voice.</p><p>A very familiar voice.</p><p>“Baby, I missed you, fuck. We need to be quiet.”</p><p>
<em>Nat.</em>
</p><p>She could hear sporadic kissing, getting more heated with the moment. <em>Fuck, Rio wasted no time, did she? </em></p><p>“But you make it so hard, baby.”</p><p>It wasn’t Rio who said it, no, it was <em>Wanda</em>.</p><p>“Wanda, we can’t, not here,” Nat said between moans.</p><p>
<em>What the fuck? Was this bitch cheating on Rio? Agatha was going to gut her like a fish.</em>
</p><p>“Why not?” Wanda whined.</p><p>“Well, for starters, my ex is here.”</p><p>Ex? <em>Ex? They weren’t together? </em></p><p>“Rio wouldn’t mind.” Wanda said, and Agatha could hear a zipper being opened. “She would want you to move on considering she is literally moved in with Agatha.”</p><p>
<em>What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>“We just broke up, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda sighed. “Your relationship lasted like four days.”</p><p>
<em>Rio and Nat broke up? After only four days? That doesn’t make sense.</em>
</p><p>
<em>That doesn’t make sense.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because it meant that they were broken up the day Agatha got hit by the car.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But she saw them. She saw them laughing.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Friends laugh, a voice said in her head, fuck. Rio wasn’t with Nat. </em>
</p><p>“She seems so sad and miserable.”</p><p>“Well, that is their fault. If they can’t see what is right in front of them then it’s their fault.”</p><p>
<em>It couldn’t be. </em>
</p><p>“We have to stop.’</p><p>Wanda sighed heavier. “I know.”</p><p>The door slammed shut. She was alone again.</p><p>
<em>What the fuck just happened.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio wasn’t with Nat. Rio didn’t have a girlfriend. Rio was single.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha wanted to scream. Or cry. Or probably both. Hysterically. Uncontrollably.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She remembered what it felt like to wake up this morning. In Rio’s arms.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha had slowly opened her eyes, feeling warm and content and snuggled into her pillow for a moment. And then she felt something moving right next to her. Her eyes shot open as she took in their new position, suddenly losing sleep altogether as she found that she was curled over Rio’s chest and her face was in Rio’s neck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha wondered how she would get out of there without waking Rio. And then she felt it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was playing with her hair. Not just playing, no, twisting and curling and lazing around, wide awake and not bothered that Agatha was in her arms.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha almost cried.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The alarm blared next to them but Rio didn’t loosen her grip on Agatha and Agatha did not know what to do with this piece of information.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The alarm got louder and louder but Rio just lay there. Agatha did too, ignoring it, willing it away, but the sound of the alarm finally got too much. She reached over Rio to stop it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When she pulled back a little she could see Rio staring at her with the biggest, most beautiful brown eyes.</em>
</p><p><em>I want to kiss her</em>, Agatha thought.</p><p>
<em>Instead she bolted to the bathroom.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But Rio was single. She could have kissed her. She threw a live grenade into her life for no reason.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was single. </em>
</p><p>She needed to get out of here. She needed air. She needed <em>Rio</em>.</p><p>She tore out of the venue, tears blazing, no worry about her broken leg, no worry about anything.</p><p>Pain seared up her leg as she hugged a street light outside, collapsing against the weight of it.</p><p>She needed to tell Rio she was jealous. She needed to apologize. She couldn’t run home? Could she? <em>Fuck</em> Rio was taking all her stuff out of the room.</p><p><em>But just because Rio is single doesn’t mean she loves you</em>, a voice whispered in her head.</p><p>“Agatha, is that you?”</p><p>Agatha knew that voice, she just didn’t know from where.</p><p>“Agatha?” called the same voice. A face came into view, blurry behind her tears.</p><p>“Nurse Danvers?”</p><p>“I thought it was you,” Nurse Danvers said, rounding over to her and giving her a hug. “How are you? Where are your crutches?”</p><p>“Uh, I don’t know.”</p><p>“Oh, is everything okay?” The nurse looked at Agatha with concern, taking in her swollen eyes and running makeup.</p><p>Agatha nodded. Then shook her head.</p><p>“Where is Rio?”</p><p>“She is-- uh, she is--” Agatha choked, then a realization dawned on her. “Wait, how do <em>you</em> know Rio?”</p><p>“What do you mean, Agatha? Of course I know Rio,” Nurse Danvers chuckled. “When someone doesn’t leave the emergency room for five days, you tend to learn their name.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up. “What?”</p><p>“Oh, you are so lucky to have someone who loves you like that,” Nurse Danvers said, almost swooning.</p><p>“She didn’t leave the hospital for <em>days</em>?” Agatha’s tongue felt like it was on fire, her eyes were stinging with tears again.</p><p>“No,” Nurse Danvers said, ushering Agatha to sit on one of the benches near them. She placed a hand on her knee “Sweetie, are you okay?”</p><p>“Can you please tell me exactly what she did when she was there? Every last detail?” Agatha was trying to push away the feeling in her chest that felt like she was being pushed underwater.</p><p>“She came in as you got admitted into the hospital and didn’t leave until you left with her. I think she left once to grab some stuff from your house, I think, but she spent every waking hour begging anyone who would listen for updates about you and traumatizing poor Doctor Banner with questions about your medications and treatment plans. And oh-- when she found you you might be going in withdrawal, she almost threw Doctor Banner off a ledge. She got William assigned to spend the night with you. I still remember her saying something very romantic along the lines of <em>‘She's the love of my life, kid, don’t let anything happen to her,’</em> because William cried about it for a week.”</p><p>
<em>The love of her life?</em>
</p><p>She couldn’t breathe. It felt like her heart was being pumped into her body and ripped at the same time.</p><p>
<em>Rio wasn’t dating anyone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio held her through her worst nights.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio took care of their bunny and her and bought her protection bracelets and held her in her sleep.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She called her the love of her life.</em>
</p><p>“She said I was the love of her life?” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Oh, she said much more than that whenever she sat with you.”</p><p>“She <em>sat</em> with me?” Agatha spluttered.</p><p>“Oh, every night, sweetheart. She would hold your hand and kiss it all night long.”</p><p>
<em>Rio sat by her bedside, Rio never left the hospital, Rio nursed her back to health. </em>
</p><p>“I-- I need to go.”</p><p>
<em>Rio didn’t leave her, she didn’t abandon her. Could she hope?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Could she hope Rio loved her as much as she loved Rio?</em>
</p><p>Agatha feral barked at the Uber driver the entire way home, traumatizing him within an inch of his life.</p><p><em>She's the love of my life, kid, don’t let anything happen to her</em>, echoed in her head repeatedly, a hope, a prayer.</p><p><em>Please don’t leave</em>, she chanted in her head. <em>Please don’t be gone before I get to say I love you too.</em></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal was not sure what the fuck just happened.</p><p>Everything was fine until Evanora Harkness showed up.</p><p>
<em>I don’t want you here.</em>
</p><p>Why Agatha chose to talk to her mother, Rio will never know. But she did.</p><p>
<em>I don’t want you in my life.</em>
</p><p>Why did Rio punch her? Well, it was clear that Evanora was making Agatha cry.</p><p>Have your stuff out of my house before I come back.</p><p>Now was the reason enough for Agatha to tell her to fuck off? Yes.</p><p>But did she actually expect to hear those words again?</p><p>
<em>I never want to see your face again.</em>
</p><p>No, she did not.</p><p>Honestly, she was a fool. A fool for believing she was forgiven at all. Because if she was Agatha, she wouldn’t forgive her either.</p><p>Agatha stormed away. Rio stood still.</p><p>Her friends around her spoke but she couldn’t make out words.</p><p>
<em>Breathe in.</em>
</p><p>“Rio, Rio?”</p><p>
<em>Breathe out.</em>
</p><p>“What the hell happened?”</p><p>
<em>Breathe in.</em>
</p><p>“Where is Agatha going?”</p><p>
<em>Breathe out.</em>
</p><p>“Rio, what did you do?” Lilia said, next to her, staring at Evanora, her broken nose and the donors that crowded around her in the corner.</p><p>“I think Agatha and I are done for real this time.” Rio finally said, words harsh in her throat.</p><p>“What the hell?” Jen yelled near her.</p><p>Rio was walking away, she could feel her feet taking her outside. She leaned back against the wall. Air whipped around her face. She could feel the walls come up, she could feel herself build back her cages.</p><p>This was just like her parents, with their anger and fear and festering, bleeding each other dry, refusing to leave, refusing to stay.</p><p>How did they get here?</p><p>Her parents always yelled, always tore each other to shreds, always found what made the other person hurt and pressed.</p><p>Is that what she and Agatha did to each other?</p><p>They were different, but in many ways, they were the same.</p><p>They didn’t listen, they didn’t talk, they spent a lifetime living in between mumbled words and stolen glances, begging the other person to read their mind, forever trapped in the area between uncertainty and freedom.</p><p>
<em>Breathe in.</em>
</p><p>She didn’t want to be like her parents. She didn’t want Agatha to be the scar she wore for life.</p><p>
<em>Breathe out.</em>
</p><p>She had nothing to lose. Agatha was already stubbornly marching her way out of her life. She was already losing her.</p><p>
<em>Breathe in.</em>
</p><p>It was time for her to do something brave. Something <em>very</em> brave.</p><p>
<em>Breathe out.</em>
</p><p>“Why did you tell me to move on?” Rio asked, looking at all three of her friends. “That night, two weeks ago, why did you tell me to stay with Nat and not listen to Agatha because she was jealous. Did you mean it?”</p><p>“Because it just seems like you two keep hurting each other.” Alice said, unwavering in her passion. “We all see it, Rio. We all see how much you love each other. But you both keep running away, time after time. So, we told you to move on. We told you to move on because we thought it was the right thing for both of you. I guess we were wrong.”</p><p>“I am not running anymore.” Rio said, tears in her eyes. “If Agatha wants to never see my face again, truly wants me to leave, then I lose nothing by telling her how much I love her. Either way I lose the love of my life. But this time, I get to say I tried. This time, I get to say I gave it my all.”</p><p>Rio was in her car before anyone could stop her.</p><p>This time, Rio was going to be clear and mature and communicative. This time, Rio was going to be brave.</p><p>
<em>Because she had nothing to lose anymore. </em>
</p><p>When Rio got to the dark apartment, she slowly began gathering her things.</p><p>Everything was so scattered, like this wasn’t just Agatha’s apartment, like it was theirs. Her makeup was lying beside Agatha’s own, her clothes hung in the closet, mismatched, intertwined, her underwear lay mixed with everything else in the laundry pile.</p><p>How the hell was she supposed to just detangle her life from this and walk away?</p><p>Scratchy looked at her with those big fucking eyes. She didn’t know why she picked him up even though she knew he would give her a condescending smirk.</p><p>He did not. He looked at her with adorable eyes full of love like he was saying, <em>don’t go. Don’t go. </em></p><p>Rio cried into his fur.</p><p>
<em>I don’t want to go, baby. I will try my best to stay, but if your Mama tells me to leave, I will. </em>
</p><p>And then the door slammed open.</p><p>Agatha was standing there, tears streaked across her face, eyes frantic and worried. She let out a deep breath when she saw Rio still there, shoulders falling, chest relaxing.</p><p>“You’re still here,” she breathed.</p><p>Rio dropped her eyes back to Scratchy so Agatha wouldn’t let her see the tears. “I need to say some things before I leave, okay. I’ll look at the wall, you don’t see my face, just, please, listen.”</p><p>Rio was already facing the wall as she finished, but she could hear Agatha breathing. She held Scratchy close. “Nat and I broke up the day of your accident, but it had nothing to do with you. Well, no, it had nothing to do with your accident. It did have something to do with you. I-- I have been getting panic attacks for a long time. I never connected the dots until recently. I don’t exactly know why they happen.” Rio let out a deep sigh. “Nope, that’s a lie, I know exactly why they happen. I’ve been having them since sophomore year of college, um every time I let myself imagine a future with you and remember that uh, you don’t feel the same way.”</p><p>“You-- Nat-- panic attacks-- Why didn’t you fucking <em>tell</em> me any of this?” Agatha said, emotion heavy in her voice.</p><p>“I tried-- I tried in the hospital, but you shut me down--”</p><p>“I’m sorry did we not fucking live together for a week? There was not one fucking moment that you could have mentioned <em>hey, by the way I broke up with my girlfriend, you give me panic attacks, thought you would want to know.</em>”</p><p>“Agatha, come on, I thought you put it together! Did you seriously think I would move in here if I was still dating Nat?” Rio countered, trying to keep it together but the tears trickled down her face.</p><p>“I don't know what to think!” Agatha said, voice louder. Not screaming, but definitely not quiet.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said softly, a plea. “Agatha, please.” They still were not facing each other, but emotion hung heavy in the air, painting their silence with a weight that was almost too much to bear. “I need to get this out before I--”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha come closer until she was close behind her.</p><p>“Turn around then,” She whispered close to Rio’s ear. “Say it to my face.”</p><p>Rio did as she was told, slowly putting Scratchy back in his cage in the process. She met Agatha’s eyes, so wounded and broken and it made her want to rip her chest apart and serve her heart on a platter. And she would if she knew Agatha wouldn’t revive her and murder her on the spot.</p><p>There was nothing left between them now, no buffer, no hiding spaces. Just the truth. “I thought you never wanted to see my face again.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “I lie, Rio. Sometimes, I lie. You have to know that by now.”</p><p>Rio saw her eyes glistening. “I was there. At the hospital. While you were lying in that hospital bed, I never left. I couldn’t leave.”</p><p>A tear spilled out of the corner of Agatha’s eye. “Why?”</p><p>“It was my fault you ended up in the hospital--”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, taking her face into her hands. “Did you drive the car that hit me?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Why did it hit you, Agatha? How did you-- how did-- how did no one see it?”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut. “Because I crossed the street without looking both ways. Because I was crying about losing you and my eyes were blurry. Because he was speeding at noon on a street with a 25 speed limit. Because <em>shit happens</em> and people make mistakes. Hell, I have made so many. You were angry that day Rio, I get it. We both said some things we didn’t mean. You get to be angry. You never have to apologize for that.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Look at you pacifying me for <em>your</em> accident.”</p><p>“Is that the only reason you stayed there the entire time? You traumatized nurses and poor Billy and you moved in to take care of me. Was that the only reason? Cause you felt guilty?” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“I did it because I love you. Agatha, the only truth I know about myself is that I love you. I have never doubted it, only suppressed it so far within myself that I didn’t know I could still feel it. I thought I could run from it, I thought I could hide, but Agatha you are already etched into my soul. My heart already beats to your name, I am who I am because of you. I’m sorry it took me almost losing you to realize that. I am sorry that I didn’t tear the fucking stars out of the sky and lay them at your feet. I’m sorry I didn’t worship you, didn’t love you the way you deserve to be. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you before. I was scared. I was scared that if you found out about Nat or the hospital or the panic attacks you would know how much I love you and I know you just want to be friends and you don’t love me like that, I respect it, but I love you. I can’t just change the fact that you hold the key to my happiness,” Rio said, voice cracking. “And if I am losing you anyway, then you deserve to know that as long as I breathe there will not be a moment on this Earth where you are not so fully, completely loved.”</p><p>Agatha's face flashed through a myriad of emotions, lip quivering, brows furrowed as she finally said, “You think I <em>don’t</em> love you?”</p><p>“I know what you said in the hospital and I will respect your boundaries--”</p><p>Agatha almost shook her, grabbing her face with so much vigor that Rio’s eyes widened in surprise. “Do you really think I don’t love you with everything I have, Rio?”</p><p>Agatha traced her thumb across her face, wiping away her tears. “<em>You</em> are my happiness, Rio. You are my <em>everything</em>. I don’t need the stars or you worshipping me or anything else. I need <em>you</em>. I <em>want</em> you. I love you so much that I went insane when I thought you were dating Nat. Hell, I went crazy an hour ago when I thought you were still someone else’s. I lost my mind this last week because this, you being with me, taking care of me, loving me, <em>this</em> is all I want. I love you. I want to be able to love you every moment of every day. I want to be able to marry you and have kids with you and have forever with you. I want to call you mine.”</p><p>Rio was laughing. Rio was crying. “I’ve always been yours, Agatha. I have always been <em>yours</em>.”</p><p>Suddenly, their lips crashed into each other, their tears mingled, their hearts intertwined. Agatha thread her hands into Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, as Rio lifted her in one quick motion and laid her on the bed.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, deepening the kiss and Rio swore she understood why kings killed men for leering at their wives. Because she would commit mass murder against a city of men for the simple crime of <em>looking</em> at Agatha.</p><p>Their tongues danced, a slow but eager battle for domination, as Rio’s hands wandered under Agatha’s dress and Agatha slightly tugged Rio’s hair, causing her to moan, raw, eager.</p><p>That moan did something carnal to Agatha. Suddenly, she was biting Rio’s lower lip and struggling to unbutton her pants.</p><p>Rio groaned. “Baby, we--” Agatha had already pulled her back in, kissing her fiercely. Rio pulled away, panting. “Agatha, please-- you are still recovering.”</p><p>“This will make me feel better, I promise,” Agatha whined. “Please, Rio, <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s self control was waning. But then Agatha shifted and let out a soft whimper of pain, so quiet that Rio would have missed it if she wasn’t pressed over the woman. She tore herself away.</p><p>“No, <em>no</em>, you are not allowed to have sex until the doctors clear you.” Rio said, leaning back. Agatha looked so disheveled, pupils dilated, mouth bruised. “No strenuous activity.”</p><p>“Ooh, yes Doctor Vidal, I’ve been a <em>very</em> bad girl,” Agatha said, already pulling her back in.</p><p>Rio’s was not strong enough. “Agatha,” she moaned as Agatha nipped at her neck like she was trying to maul her.</p><p>“That tone is really working for me.” She whispered as she left another bruise on Rio’s throat.</p><p>Rio was so close to giving in when a very smart bunny who totally paid attention to Agatha’s health recovery plans jumped out of his pen and landed with a loud thud.</p><p>The sound startled them apart.</p><p>Rio burst out laughing. “Agatha, <em>Scratchy</em> has more sense than us.” She slowly pulled away and crawled off the bed again.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, did not find it so funny. “Didn’t think my own rabbit could be such a fucking cock-blocker,” she grumbled, arms crossed.</p><p>Rio laughed harder. “Don’t say anything to my baby.”</p><p>“<em>Your</em> baby? You wanted to send him to the shelter two days ago,” Agatha said, wiggling two fingers around.</p><p>“Yeah, well, that was before he took my side.” Rio slowly stripped off her suit, attempting to change into her night clothes.</p><p>Wrong move. Rio smirked then, looking up at Agatha. Agatha looked like she wanted to devour Rio whole. Agatha lunged forward, trying to straddle Rio and failing because she tripped over the boot that was still on her cast. Rio laughed loudly as she pulled a shirt over her head.</p><p>Agatha pouted.</p><p>“<em>Mi amor</em>,” Rio said softly, leaning in for a kiss. The term of endearment seemed to snap Agatha out of her sex daze. “I want <em>both</em> of us to enjoy our first time, okay? I need you to be a hundred percent fine and cleared.”</p><p>Agatha flung her arms around Rio and sighed into her neck. “Uh, I hate that you’re right.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Do you need any help getting out of the dress?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “That is the easy part. The hard part was putting it on.” She got up to go to the bathroom, but before she fully left the room, she leaned in and placed a gentle kiss on Rio’s mouth. “You make it so hard for me to not love you, you know that.”</p><p>Rio smiled wider, as she wiggled up her sleep shorts. “Well, then you're lucky I love you too.” She leaned over and kissed Agatha again.</p><p>“I am lucky. I love you so much,” Agatha murmured. Rio sighed as their foreheads touched.</p><p>
<em>This felt right. This felt like coming home. This felt like everything.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio loved Agatha and Agatha loved her. </em>
</p><p>After a few dozen more kisses, Agatha finally made it into the bathroom. She shuffled around in there as Rio settled on the bed, whipping her phone out and going on Facebook to post pictures of her apartment. How fast can she sell it?</p><p>When Rio next looked up, Agatha was leaning against the bathroom door in her robe, head tilted, a silly smile on her face.</p><p>“What are you thinking, <em>mi vida?</em>” Rio asked, a matching smile spreading over her face.</p><p>“Nothing, just how cute my girlfriend looks in my bed.”</p><p>
<em>Girlfriend. Agatha said Rio was her girlfriend. Rio might have a heart attack.</em>
</p><p>Rio blushed. “Well, you know what would be cuter? My <em>girlfriend</em>, in bed, with me.” She patted Agatha’s side of the bed.</p><p>Agatha pranced her way to the bed, once again ignoring the giant cast on her leg.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to yell at her for that when she noticed the other thing. “You aren’t wearing anything under the robe, are you?”</p><p>“The doctors said no strenuous activity but they didn’t say I couldn’t torment you within an inch of your life, now did they?” Agatha cackled.</p><p>Rio was <em>so</em> screwed.</p><p>Agatha seductively pulled the phone from Rio’s hand, trying to turn it off when she saw what was on the screen.</p><p>“Why are you on <em>Facebook</em>?” Agatha stuttered, looking closer. “Are you trying to sublet your apartment?”</p><p>“Agatha, I have already been living here for a week. I’m not going anywhere now. Me and my plants are moving in.”</p><p>“Oh, hell no. We have no space for them. Scooch over.” Agatha said, settling into their bed.</p><p>Rio’s heart sank a little.</p><p>“You know I can’t leave my plant-- What are you doing?” Rio asked as Agatha pulled out her laptop lying on the side table and opened Zillow.</p><p>“We’ll need more space for your stupid plants and the inevitable greenhouse you are going to build, Rio.”</p>

<p>Agatha Harkness woke up to an empty bed.</p><p>Scratch that. She woke up to an empty house.</p><p>No Rio in the kitchen. Or the bathroom. No note. No message. No Scratchy?</p><p>
<em>Did she dream all of last night?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Did she dream all of last week?</em>
</p><p>But then, the door burst open and in stumbled Rio, rabbit in her right hand, two coffees in a drink carrier in the left, grinning widely.</p><p>“You’re awake!” Rio beamed. “I got you coffee.”</p><p>“What time is it?” Agatha said, rubbing her eyes.</p><p>“It’s close to nine,” Rio said as she set Scratchy and the coffee down to pull off her shoes.</p><p>“You let me sleep in?” Agatha said, a bemused smile settling on her face. <em>Ever since Rio read about oversleeping, she wouldn’t let Agatha sleep for longer than ten hours at a stretch.</em></p><p>Rio grinned. “Didn’t have the heart to wake you.” She got up to put Scratchy in his pen and skipped over to put the coffee into two mugs. “You won’t believe the stupid line at the coffee shop today, I think the tourists have found our fucking spot, which means I need to either go earlier to get coffee or move spots but I like this spot because it is so close--”</p><p>Agatha looked at her bumbling around and was surprised at how much warmth spread through her chest, leaving a fluttering, tingling feeling behind.</p><p>
<em>Rio was hers. All hers.</em>
</p><p>
<em>God, she just wanted to kiss her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And god bless, she could.</em>
</p><p>“Babe?” Agatha called, eyes as innocent as she could make them. “There is something on your cheek.” She gestured vaguely to a spot on Rio's face.</p><p>Rio put down the coffee on the kitchen counter and wiped her cheek with her jacket sleeve. “Gone?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, eyes locking in on the prize, “Come here.”</p><p>The second Rio came close, leaning in, Agatha pulled her down, pressing their lips together into a searing kiss.</p><p>“You could have just told me you want to kiss me,” Rio murmured against her lips when they came up for air.</p><p>Agatha laughed against her smile. “You love me for my dramatics, don’t you?”</p><p>“I do,” Rio deepened the kiss, pulling Agatha closer until she was flushed against her chest. Agatha realized in that moment that she was still wearing the black floral robe, and only the black floral robe. The robe which had actually come undone just slightly, enough to reveal her left breast. Her nipple pressed against the metal of one of the zippers on Rio’s jacket and she let out a quiet hiss at the contact, arching her head backwards as Rio nipped under Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>“You really <em>are</em> trying to torment me, aren’t you?” Rio whined, feeling Agatha grind down on her leg, jeans and all, already wet and dripping.</p><p>Agatha simply looked down at Rio, eyelashes fluttering and noticed how much lust and possession filtered through her eyes as she considered when they should stop.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha moaned, shrugging the robe further off her shoulder so her breasts were exposed even more. “Look at how hard they are for you. Look at how they’re waiting for your tongue.” Agatha ground further into Rio’s leg to emphasize her point.</p><p>Rio looked like she was about to snap and fuck Agatha into oblivion. And Agatha knew exactly how to get her to cross the finish line.</p><p>“Are you going to waste it? Are you going to let me be so <em>frustrated</em> all day?” <em>A challenge.</em> Rio’s eyes flashed. But Agatha was nearing the kill, “I might need to find someone else to take care of— <em>oh.</em>” Rio tightened her hold on Agatha’s waist with one hand, bringing the other up to pinch her nipple.</p><p>Agatha hissed, tipping her head back further and Rio pressed heavy kisses along her collar bone.</p><p>“You don’t know how hard last night was,” she whispered against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Agatha smirked, looking down to lock eyes with Rio, so wide-eyed, so passionate, so easy. “Oh, I could feel it, my love. I could feel how your hands traced my skin, how you <em>hovered</em>,” Rio pinched harder, causing Agatha to moan. “How much you wanted me, I could <em>feel</em> it.”</p><p>“Just like how I can feel it now,” Rio said as Agatha resumed grinding down on her leg, her clit pulsing against the harsh, rugged jeans. She moved over to Agatha’s other nipple, flicking it, pinching it as Agatha moaned further.</p><p>“Rio, if you don’t put my tits in your mouth, I swear to <em>god</em>--”</p><p>Rio looked up and smirked, running her tongue over the bud, darting Agatha’s nipple around before taking it completely into her mouth. She sucked on it with abandon, as Agatha leaned back, a raw moan falling out of her lips.</p><p>“Baby, <em>fuck</em>,” she said, pushing further into Rio, wanting her, needing more. Pleasure was starting to build as Rio began pinching the other nipple too, and Agatha close, so close.</p><p>And the fucking alarm rang.</p><p>Rio stopped, looking up at her and shook her head. “Time to get ready for your doctor’s appointment.”</p><p>“No, please, come back,” Agatha tried pulling her back but Rio was already detangling. “I was <em>so</em> close,” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“You, my love, are a fucking menace.” Rio smirked, and Agatha saw the long, wet stain over her left thigh. “You really are tormenting me within an inch of my life, aren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha would have accepted the teasing if she hadn’t just been edged out of an orgasm. She crossed her hands. “I’m not moving until you finish what you started.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and walked back, lifting her chin with one finger. “Baby, you’re going to put on nice, proper clothes and we are going to the hospital in thirty minutes so we don’t miss our appointment.”</p><p>Agatha burned. “How sweet that you think you can tell me what to do, Rio.” She leaned forward, arms squeezing her breasts together. “I am the one in control here.”</p><p>Rio turned her hand to grab Agatha’s throat, pressing slightly. <em>Fuck.</em> That felt so good. It felt too good. “You can be in control if you want to be,” Rio said, smirk deepening. “But you’re also going to be a good girl and get dressed, aren’t you?”</p><p>Something about Rio’s tone made Agatha’s entire body transform into a squishy, jelly-like substance that only wanted to <em>take</em>. She had to viscerally fight the ‘Yes,’ on her tongue. Instead, she pulled away and ran into the bathroom, heart beating wildly.</p><p><em>Fuck, that was so hot. Too</em> hot. Agatha wasn’t a bottom though, she had always firmly been the dominant one. So, why did Agatha want Rio to wrap her hands around her throat again and squeeze until she saw God?</p><p>Rio followed Agatha into the bathroom seconds later, plastic bag in hand, still in those same cum-stained jeans. She fastened the bag over Agatha’s cast, staring into Agatha’s eyes the entire time. Just <em>that</em> sight, of Rio on her knees, looking up at her from under her eyelashes, made Agatha want to throw every last shred of caution to the wind and ride her in the shower.</p><p>But no, Rio got up slowly, kissing her on her cheek and slapping her ass. “Have a nice shower, baby.”</p><p>“You wish you were in here with me,” Agatha teased, slowly, seductively getting in. Rio shoved her tongue into the side of her mouth and smirked.</p><p>“We have to leave in twenty minutes.” Rio said as she closed the door.</p><p>“Oh and Agatha,” she heard Rio say from outside. “Don’t even <em>think</em> about finishing in there without me.”</p><p><em>Fuck.</em> She had never seen this side of Rio before. The one that demanded. The one that ordered. And the way her legs were barely supporting her up, she was beginning to think she was going to <em>really</em> enjoy seeing more of it. As long as Rio knew she was always going to be fully in control, obviously.</p><p>This could be like a dessert, a once in a while indulgence. A very <em>fun</em> indulgence. Having Rio on top, having her say all the filthy stuff she knew was bubbling inside her. Oh yeah, this would be a fun indulgence indeed.</p><p>She quickly showered, using very cold water, trying hard not to flick her angry clit and be done with the feeling of <em>almost</em> that haunted the space between her legs. When she stepped out in the towel, Rio had changed into a new pair of pants and was packing some sandwiches for the road.</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s eyes on her as she looked through their closet, raking over every inch of her skin, following every bead of water as it traced its path along her shoulders and down her legs.</p><p>She felt the heat, the <em>burning</em>, as if Rio was seconds away from throwing her against the wall and finishing what they had started earlier.</p><p>“I’ll wait in the car,” Rio said, giving her a soft kiss on the shoulder as she left.</p><p>Fucking Rio and her <em>stupid</em> self-control.</p><p>Agatha eventually made it to the car with only six minutes to spare for her appointment and Rio sighed and drove like a manic so they would make it on time. Agatha had to clutch the grab handles out of sheer concern when the car swerved too close to the sidewalk and almost hit a pedestrian.</p><p>“You’re a psychopath,” she said, looking at Rio in abject horror. “I'm dating a psychopath.”</p><p>“You’re being so dramatic,” Rio said, looking over at Agatha.</p><p>“Look at the road,” Agatha screamed. Rio swerved to avoid a car. <em>Why was there a car coming at them? Could it be possibly because they were on the wrong side of the fucking street?</em></p><p>“And we made it on time,” Rio said as they finally pulled into the hospital parking lot. Agatha felt like she had definitely lost one of her nine lives on this car ride.</p><p>“You know, for everyone’s safety, I’m really glad you stayed at the hospital the entire time,” Agatha said, clutching her chest.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and helped her get situated with the crutches as she exited the car. “Once again, so dramatic.”</p><p>“Babe, you almost ran over three people.”</p><p>“<em>Almost</em> being the key word.”</p><p>“Hello, are you here for an appointment,” the receptionist asked as they walked up to her.</p><p>“Yes, a check-up appointment for Harkness,” Rio responded, before Agatha could even open her mouth. The receptionist typed into her computer.</p><p>“I see you here, okay, great, you are right on time so just take a seat and we will call out for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart was still somehow pounding as they sat down. “I didn’t know I signed up to be a military spouse.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio said, half-listening. Then, almost as if she caught up to the lag in processing what Agatha said, she mumbled, “Military spouse?”</p><p>“I’m going to have to worry like an army wife about you every time you get in the car now, staring out of the window, hoping you come home, now won’t I?”</p><p>Rio grinned stupidly at Agatha. “Wife?”</p><p>“Is that the only fucking thing you took away from all this?” Agatha sputtered.</p><p>“Ms Harkness,” a nurse called, ending this topic. <em>For now. Agatha was going to make sure Rio drove like a safe, sane human, even if it was the last thing she did. She was not ready to be a fucking widow just yet.</em></p><p>“That’s us,” Rio said as she helped Agatha up. The nurse led them to a private examination room and took Agatha’s vitals. Rio stayed close to the door, monitoring closely.</p><p>“How are you related to the patient?” the nurse asked Rio as she finished up taking Agatha’s blood pressure and noting it down.</p><p>They both started grinning like idiots.</p><p>“She’s my girlfriend,” Agatha replied, a small blush creeping on her face.</p><p>“Girlfriend?” they heard a familiar voice behind them.</p><p>“Wiliam?” they said in unison as he entered. William laughed and came over to give each of them a brief hug.</p><p>“So, you finally talked and confessed your undying love for each other?” William teased, but Agatha and Rio just looked into each other’s eyes dreamily.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha swooned, “We did.”</p><p>“After only being stupid for a little bit.” Rio added, squeezing Agatha’s hand softly.</p><p>“Oh my god, you’re the lovebirds?” The nurse who was checking them in gasped. “You’ve been the talk of the hospital for a while!”</p><p>Agatha blushed deeper. Rio smiled shyly.</p><p>“All yours, Doctor Kaplan,” the nurse said as she left the room.</p><p>William beamed. “I requested to take over your appointment today, I hope you don’t mind.”</p><p>“Not at all,” Agatha smiled, looking over at Rio who wore a matching look of affection.</p><p>“Let’s start with checking your stitches,” William said, sitting in a stool next to her and pulling off her bandage on her elbow.</p><p>“Has there been any discharge from the wound?”</p><p>“Uh, I don’t think so?” Agatha replied.</p><p>“Yes, it was yellow and red for the first day but now it's firmly clear after I started the ointment you told me to get,” Rio responded from where she was sitting by the door.</p><p>“Have you been using the anti-scar ointment too?” William asked, gathering a clean swab and cleaning the wound.</p><p>“Yes, we have,” Rio responded before Agatha could. “And some homemade salves to boost healing.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “There have been a lot of salves.”</p><p>William chuckled. “Let me guess, do they have turmeric?”</p><p>Rio smiled and nodded.</p><p>“Good,” William said. “Very good. Okay, Agatha, your stitches look like they are ready to come out, so I am going to pull them out today. How are you feeling otherwise? How is your leg? How are your ribs?”</p><p>“It’s been okay.”</p><p>“She’s been heavily favoring her non-injured leg and now she is basically limping constantly.” Rio said, sighing.</p><p>“No, I have not!” Agatha protested.</p><p>“She also has not been using her crutches,” Rio added, folding her arms.</p><p>“Snitch,” Agatha stuck her tongue out.</p><p>William looked like he was choosing between smiling at their banter and frowning at their behavior. “Agatha, you have to use your crutches, otherwise you will have a hard, long recovery in physical therapy once your cast comes off.”</p><p>Agatha looked put off for being told off. “Fine, I’ll use my crutches, okay.”</p><p>“Okay, any other questions before I get the supplies to take the stitches out?”</p><p>Rio and Agatha shared a glance. <em>They couldn’t ask William this, could they?</em></p><p>“Uh, is Doctor Banner around?” Rio asked, lip twitching. “We have something we want to ask him.”</p><p>“Whatever you want to ask Doctor Banner, you can ask me too. Just because I am in residency, does not mean I am not a doctor.” William said, slightly puffing out his chest.</p><p>“Well, I wanted to ask if I am cleared to try to put a baby in Rio, but if you want to answer that, feel free,” Agatha smirked.</p><p>William’s face went white. “Uh, I-- you-- I’m going to go find Doctor Banner for you.” He fled out the door as both Agatha and Rio burst into laughter.</p><p>“Do you think I traumatized the poor boy?” Agatha said between laughs.</p><p>“Oh, you most definitely did,” Rio cackled.</p><p>“Fuck, that was funny.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, tone a little more serious. “Do you want to actually put a baby in me or did you just say that because you wanted to strap me?”</p><p>Agatha froze, mid laugh. “I-- Both?”</p><p>Rio shook her head and came closer and cupped her face. “I always thought you would carry first.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened and she leaned into Rio’s touch. “You’ve thought about kids with me before?”</p><p>A chuckle escaped Rio’s lips. “Every time I have thought of kids, I have always thought of <em>our</em> kids. They would have your eyes and my nose and all of our best parts. I still remember what Monica said that day. How they would drive us up the wall. Your stubbornness and my hyper-fixations and--”</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio soundly. “Me too, my love. Me too.”</p><p>Rio leaned back in and captured her lips in a gentle but loving kiss. They came up for air minutes later, breathless from the giddy joy and passionate pecks, leaning their foreheads together.</p><p>“Look at us, going from thinking that we don’t love each other to buying a house and planning children in less than twenty-four hours.” Rio laughed, happy but there were tears building in her eyes. “Do you think we’re going too fast?”</p><p>Agatha could feel the tears building too. “No, <em>mi vida</em>. This was ten years in the making.”</p><p>Rio’s lip quivered. “We wasted so much time.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “We have forever to make it up, my love. I love you.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes and sighed. “I love you too, <em>mi amor</em>. You and the six kids you will carry.”</p><p>“I’m afraid no one is having any children for a while,” Dr Banner said as he walked into the room. “Agatha, how are you?”</p><p>Agatha let out a watery laugh. “I’m much better.”</p><p>“Glad to hear it,” he said. Then, nervously, “Hello, Miss Vidal. How are you?”</p><p>“We’re all fine,” Rio said, tapping her foot impatiently. “What do you mean no children for a while?”</p><p>“Well, William told me you asked about when you can have sex next, and I am afraid that the broken ribs and leg will take almost six weeks to fully heal--”</p><p>“<em>Six weeks?</em>” Agatha screeched. Rio looked like he told her that Christmas was canceled for all eternity.</p><p>“She seems okay, though, compared to the things I read about rib fractures, there is no pain while breathing and she basically skipped around this morning,” Rio said, brows furrowing.</p><p>Dr Banner shook his head. “She has a hairline fracture, which luckily is not as painful, but still has a similar recovery time. I’m sorry, but since your body shifts while having sex, it might heavily interfere with the healing of your ribs, so yes, at least six weeks. At your next check-up in a month, we can evaluate progress, but you have a lot more healing to do before you can engage in strenuous activity without risk of complications down the line.”</p><p>Rio was seriously nodding along, which meant that she was screwed and there was no fucking way in hell Agatha was getting laid until this stupid doctor cleared her.</p><p>Dr Banner handed Rio some prescriptions and other recovery plans. Rio gave her a quick peck on the cheek and left with Dr Banner to settle payment and talk through the next steps.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, seething when William walked back in nervously.</p><p>“Here to remove your stitches!” He said, voice far too high.</p><p>“Chill kid,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes. “I won’t talk about lesbian sex.”</p><p>William’s eyes grew wider and he scrambled to open the new structure kit so he could get the hell out of there as fast as he could.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes lit up when she thought of something. “Actually, kid, can I slip you a twenty so you tell my lovely girlfriend that even though I can’t have sex, I <em>can</em> go down on <em>her</em> for the next six weeks?”</p><p>William looked like he wanted to die. “I-- uh-- I can’t do that.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Fine, okay. I will actually stop now.”</p><p>William came over and started snipping each stitch and pulling them out one by one. “Even though you keep traumatizing me, I am really glad you two are together,” he finally said.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened. “Me too, kid. Me too.” Then, taking pity on him. “Do you want to see the bunny we adopted?”</p><p>William squealed and Agatha swiped through her photos to show pictures of Señor Scratchy, smiling stupidly.</p><p>“Baby, are you done yet?” Rio said as she walked in fifteen minutes later.</p><p>Agatha looked up, nodding. William had already finished removing the stitches and re-bandaged the area and was now looking at the houses Agatha had short-listed on Zillow.</p><p>“It was fun seeing you both again,” William said, finally standing up. “Even though you both very much traumatized me for life.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, Billy boy,” Rio said, teasing.</p><p>“Have a safe drive home,” William said, waving on his way out.</p><p>“Speaking of driving home,” Agatha said as William closed the door. “I’ll stop trying to torment and fuck you for the next six weeks if you do six sessions of driving school.”</p><p>“I am not going back to driving school,” Rio whined. “I drive perfectly fine, okay, you have never had a problem <em>before</em>.”</p><p>“I am giving you an out, Rio, otherwise I will literally try to jump you every chance I get--”</p><p>“Four sessions.” Rio bargained, arms folded.</p><p>“Six and you have to get a certificate from the guy that says you can drive safely.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and grumbled, “Happy wife, happy life.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and patted her cheek. “Now, you get it.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Chapter 17</p><p>Rio Vidal was viscerally pissed off.</p><p>Agatha, the one who was notoriously bad at fucking planning anything to save her life, had somehow found a driving school that had a session at seven in the morning the very next day in fucking Eastview.</p><p>Agatha, who had never risen before nine willingly, had woken up at six and made Rio coffee and thrown her in the shower.</p><p>And Agatha, who at this point Rio was convinced had been abducted by aliens and rebooted somehow, had made no leers or jokes or not-so-innocent touches at all.</p><p>And that is why Rio found herself in a beat up Toyota Corolla at seven thirty in the morning with an old man who was chewing gum loudly and showing her different charts about the markings on the street.</p><p>“Listen,” she snapped after the man spent ten minutes talking about the stop sign, “I am here to get my girlfriend off my back. I can fucking drive. I have a fucking license, so let’s just do a practise drive and then you can give me a certificate and keep the money.”</p><p>The old man looked uninterested by her threats but nodded anyway.</p><p>Rio backed out and took the route he instructed, pulling the window all the way down and resting an arm on it while folding her left leg up to rest on her right thigh, a position she chose to drive in frequently. She turned up the music too, whipping her head to a Billboard Top 100 hit she didn’t know the name of but the lyrics too. When she pulled back into the driving school fifteen minutes later and turned over, ready to get out of there, she noticed that the driving instructor’s face was-- what was the word?</p><p>Petrified. Paralysed with fear. Bordering on unconscious.</p><p>His glasses were twisted on his face, hair blown back like he had stood next to a bomb, face locked in a mixture of worry, confusion and fear.</p><p>“Ma’am,” he said finally, voice small. “How did you get your license?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Will you give me the certificate or not?”</p><p>“One moment,” he said, almost falling out of the car. He walked into the main office and moments later, an older woman with short blonde hair and a wide smile walked out.</p><p>“Hello, my dear,” she said chirpily as she sat down in the passenger seat. “I heard you need some <em>specific</em> instruction in driving.”</p><p>“Who are you?” Rio questioned, eyes narrowing.</p><p>“Mrs. Davis, dear,” she said, still smiling through Rio’s tune, “You can call me Sharon.”</p><p>“Where’s the old dude?” Rio said, ready to get out.</p><p>“My husband mentioned you may be, um, what is the word he used… the worst driver he has ever encountered and a hazard to everyone on the road.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Why is everyone so dramatic?”</p><p>“I assume since you are here that someone cares deeply about you and wants you to get better at operating this piece of heavy machinery so you don’t meet a horrible death.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, face scrunching up.</p><p>“Who is it? Your mother? Your friend? Your partner?”</p><p>“My girlfriend,” Rio said, a small smile curling at the edge of her lips.</p><p>“Oh, how wonderful. She must love you so much. Okay, so let’s make you the best driver possible for her, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, sighing deeply. “O-kay.”</p><p>“Great, now Rio, put your foot down, pull the window up and back out <em>slowly</em>.”</p><p>Rio did as instructed and at the end of the session, Sharon told her she only broke six different traffic rules and did get thirty percent better, but still should probably not actively drive until their next session which was in two days. Rio heard the first part and then promptly got in her car and drove away.</p><p>She showed up to the little diner that her friends were all having their monthly get-together breakfast thirty minutes late and it was far more bustling than she had ever seen it. She found them all cornered in a booth, with Agatha sitting at the edge, leg propped up on a chair.</p><p>“What happened,” Rio said, zoning in entirely on Agatha’s leg. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Imfine,” Agatha mumbled between bites, too busy eating her waffles. “It was just hurting a little.”</p><p>“Where are your crutches?” Rio said, raising Agatha’s leg softly so she could slip into the chair and let the leg rest in her lap.</p><p>“They’re under the table, jeez. Stop worrying,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes. She passed Rio a plate of waffles from the center of the table, steaming and hot like Agatha anticipated she would be here any moment.</p><p>“I’ll stop worrying when you stop doing stupid shit,” Rio said, digging into the food. Agatha poured her a cup of coffee, stirring in the sugar and splash of milk, just the way Rio liked it.</p><p>“This is bold coming from you,” Agatha snorted, passing her the cup. “How was driving school?”</p><p>Rio grumbled, shoving food down her mouth instead. She took a swig of the coffee and gagged. “Is this fucking decaf?”</p><p>“You have already had a cup this morning and if you have too much you start bouncing off the walls. We already have a rabbit that finds jumping out of his cage fun. Can’t have his mother being hyper-active too.”</p><p>“Okay, are you two together or not?” Alice slammed her fist on the table, face twisted in some form of pain. Rio looked up to find Lilia, Jen and Alice stare at them with the focus and precision that a teacher uses while grading papers and the confusion of a person watching a monkey skateboard for the first time. “Because I can’t take it anymore. I’ve already bitten all my nails off.”</p><p>Rio locked eyes with Agatha, who was sporting a wicked smile. “I mean, aren’t we all together right now?” Agatha said nonchalantly, buttering her toast.</p><p>Jen groaned, Alice looked like she was being edged out of six orgasms and Lilia seemed to be ready to get up and leave.</p><p>“Give us a straight fucking answer,” Lilia said, eyes threatening.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “You want a straight answer? Ask a straight lady.”</p><p>Rio cackled as she saw the pure anger and frustration filter through their friends' faces. She shoved another piece of waffle into her mouth as she watched them alternate between wanting to storm off and tying Rio and Agatha down and forcing answers out of them. Rio rubbed Agatha’s knee softly under the table.</p><p>“Can you just--we didn’t-- are you,” Jen took a deep breath. “We didn’t break you guys with the whole ‘come as dates to the Gala’ thing did we?” Jen asked nervously.</p><p>“Because we were just trying to help with the whole Ralph situation,” Lilia added, lacking the usual tease or bite.</p><p>Agatha immediately softened. “You didn’t,” she answered sweetly. “Did they?”</p><p>“They did not.” Rio smiled back fondly.</p><p>The tension in the air broke immediately as Lilia, Alice and Jen all breathed a collective sigh of relief. “Oh thank god,” Alice sighed, happily. “I don’t think I could have taken more of your whole Romeo-and-Juliet saga level implosion.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “It wasn’t an implosion.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her hand, intertwining them. “Whatever it was, we finally found our way to each other and now no one is going anywhere.”</p><p>“Is that a threat, my love?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, leaning over to kiss her nose. “I’m not worried about you going anywhere, <em>mi corazón</em>. No threats needed.”</p><p>Rio smiled and brushed a very soft kiss on her lips. They heard a choked sob and looked over to the other side of the booth to see all three of their friends in some form of tears. While Lilia and Jen were just misty eyed, Alice was fully hysterical.</p><p>“I never thought I would ever see this day,” Jen spluttered. “Agatha Harkness soft? Rio Vidal not running away? Both of you admitting you’re in love? Has the apocalypse descended on us?”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Wait, until you see the houses Agatha has short-listed,” Rio smirked, sipping her coffee again. She blanched again when she remembered it was decaf.</p><p>“Houses?” Lilia exclaimed. “You’re already U-Hauling?”</p><p>“I think we already U-Hauled, Lilia,” Agatha laughed. “Rio hasn’t slept at her place in weeks.”</p><p>“I feel sorry for your poor neighbours,” Jen snorted. “You two must be going at it like mad bunnies.”</p><p>Agatha immediately collapsed into her hands, almost slamming her head on the table, and Rio threw her head back like she was in pain.</p><p>“What happened? Did you two break the bed already?” Lilia teased.</p><p>“No, much, <em>much</em> worse,” Agatha groaned, but did not elaborate, looking away instead.</p><p>“No sex, Doctor’s orders.” Rio said, nodding seriously.</p><p>“For how long?” Alice questioned.</p><p>Agatha sighed dramatically. “Six whole fucking weeks.”</p><p>Lilia burst out laughing. “You’re going to kill each other by then.”</p><p>“Oh, we will have to have a joint funeral, for sure,” Jen said, wiping her eyes.</p><p>“Oh, fuck off,” Rio snapped. “Agatha’s health matters way more than an orgasm, okay? I would literally not have sex for the rest of my life if that is how long she needed to fully recover.”</p><p>Agatha melted. “Really, baby? That long?”</p><p>Rio leaned in to kiss her again, smiling against her lips. “Of course, however long it takes.”</p><p>“I honestly didn’t expect you two to be this mushy,” Jen said, but there was no tease, no malice, just endearing observation.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio heard someone exclaim in the distance. Suddenly, she saw a very excited Wanda dragging a very dazed Nat across the diner. “You two kissed! Wait, are you two finally together?”</p><p>Agatha nodded shyly. Rio grinned widely.</p><p>“Oh my fucking god,” Wanda exclaimed, again. “Was it because of our plan? I thought it failed when Evanora showed up?”</p><p>Rio rubbed Agatha’s knuckles to soothe her at the mention of her mother. Agatha shot her a smile to let her know she was okay.</p><p>“Your plan?” Agatha asked, instead.</p><p>“Mission Idiot!” Wanda beamed.</p><p>Nat facepalmed behind her. “Wanda, that was not the name.”</p><p>“There was a plan?” Rio looked over to find Jen gesturing wildly for Wanda to cut it out. “You guys had a plan to get us both together?”</p><p>“We just, we--” Jen stuttered.</p><p>“We couldn’t take it anymore, okay. You both were miserable so we cooked up a plan so you could fake-date a little and you know, see that you are actually basically together and that Wanda and Nat would make you realise that you both have been together all along.” Alice spilled, looking like she would explode if she kept it in any longer.</p><p>Jen and Lilia sighed. “Next time, we are telling you nothing,” Lilia mumbled.</p><p>“Wait, what about Wanda and Nat?” Rio said, looking at them in confusion.</p><p>“We never got to that part of the plan, but they were going to come as a couple too, you know, hopefully make you both realize they weren’t in the equation anymore,” Jen said.</p><p>Agatha had a weird look on her face. “So, you two hooking up in the bathroom was <em>not</em> a part of the plan?”</p><p>Rio spit out the coffee she was drinking. Lilia froze mid sip of orange juice. Alice and Jen wore similar looks of sheer confusion.</p><p>“I’m sorry, what?” Lilia recovered, turning over to look at the redheads.</p><p>“How did you know?” Nat rubbed the back of her neck, a blush on her face.</p><p>“I fucking heard you two,” Agatha said, narrowing her eyes onto their intertwined hands. “So, are you together now?”</p><p>“Uh,” Wanda replied, looking at Nat like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>“Yeah,” Nat beamed. “We got to talking before the Gala and we, uh, we really clicked.”</p><p>“So, you’re telling me we got two lesbian couples together?” Lilia squealed. “<em>Fuck off</em>, this is great. Now, only you two are left,” she said, pointing her fingers at Alice and Jen.</p><p>Alice choked mid bite. Jen blanches. “We are literally only roommates, Lilia. Don’t make it weird.”</p><p>Agatha visibly tried to hold her laugh in, grabbing Rio’s thigh and pressing her nails into her jeans in an attempt to keep it together.</p><p>“Is this what we sounded like?” Rio asked Lilia, a chuckle escaping her lips.</p><p>Lilia nodded, shaking her head. “Yes, do you get why I was losing my mind now?”</p><p>“Guys, there is no <em>this</em> okay, let’s all move on.” Alice said, shoving more food in her mouth in an attempt to hide the growing blush on her neck.</p><p>Everyone laughed, groaned and rolled their eyes. <em>Always a new pair of idiots.</em></p><p>“Do you want to join us?” Agatha said softly, looking at Wanda and Nat. “We have space for two more.”</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled at the olive branch Agatha offered to Wanda and Nat. Wanda nodded enthusiastically and dragged Nat into the booth, both smiling wide.</p><p>Rio looked over at Agatha, brow raised considering she was ready to murder Nat less than two days ago, but she just flashed a shy smile, “Let bygones be bygones. Besides, we have a startling lack of redheads in this friend group.”</p><p>Nat let out a small laugh. Jen was already furiously typing on her phone. “I’m making a new groupchat and I have the perfect fucking name. <em>Coven of Chaos.</em> Genius!”</p><p>Alice shook her head, still grinning uncontrollably at Jen’s antics.</p><p>Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand, squeezed it and placed a small kiss on it. “That was very sweet,” she whispered softly. “Proud of you, my love.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile grew more vulnerable. “What can I say, you bring out the best in me.”</p><p>Rio kissed her cheek. “And you do too.”</p><p>After the breakfast, Rio drove them both home in a very calm and safe manner. Hell, she even checked her blind spot, something she had literally never done before.</p><p>Jen was right, she was <em>so</em> whipped.</p><p>Agatha, in turn, used her damn crutches for the measly five minutes from the car door to the apartment, but Rio’s heart swelled nonetheless.</p><p>But their apartment felt very different when they entered again, still sizzling from the events of this morning, bed still unmade, Rio’s jeans still on their spot on the floor from where she discarded them this morning.</p><p>“Tea?” Rio chose to say instead of talking about boundaries or a game plan or acknowledging that they were about to spend a month and a half trapped in a forced state of celibacy.</p><p>“Tea sounds great.” Agatha hooted.</p><p>Rio essentially jumped over to the kitchen, pulling out two mugs and throwing water in the kettle just to avoid the tension that had fallen over the room. She flicked through their selection of tea, searching for answers in dried leaves instead of her lovely girlfriend.</p><p>Now, when Agatha had chosen to come up behind her, Rio did not know. How Agatha was so fucking quiet as she entered the kitchen, considering she was literally in crutches and violently clumsy, Rio also did not know.</p><p>Rio had partially turned around to call out to Agatha but Agatha was already there and there was actually no room in their very small kitchen, actually it wasn’t even a kitchen it was a kitchenette, and they were a breath away and they were suddenly kissing.</p><p>It was messy and sloppy and everything Rio needed.</p><p>A warm feeling took over, stretching over her heart and using her blood to beat into every inch of her body.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, deepening the kiss, a soft moan caught between their lips. She thread her fingers through Rio’s hair, softly biting on Rio’s lower lip.</p><p>It felt like she was drowning and floating and breathing all at once, and simultaneously, for the first time in her life.</p><p>Agatha pushed Rio against the kitchen counter, her head softly hitting the top cabinets. And Agatha kept pushing, arm on either side of her, using her good leg to prod both of Rio’s open, pushing against the seam of her jeans, knowing they would hit her clit just right.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>, Agatha was going to make her lose all semblance of coherence and turn her into a poet all at once.</p><p>“Baby, you know we can’t--”</p><p>“There is no ‘we,’ Rio,” Agatha said, voice low and dangerous. “<em>I</em> can’t have sex. You, on the other hand, I can devour you whole.”</p><p>Rio moaned, back arching as Agatha pressed her knee between her legs again. “I can’t keep doing this Agatha. I can’t--”</p><p>Rio tore away, heart beating wildly. Before she could second guess it, her feelings were tumbling out of her mouth, “We won’t survive if you keep pushing like this, keep demanding I forget that you are, in fact, injured and just fuck you. I won’t do it. And if you keep acting like this, I will have to go live at my place, because we won’t survive this.”</p><p>Rio finally looked back at Agatha, who just looked so small. “I’m sorry,” Rio said, voice losing its frustration immediately. “I didn’t mean to snap at you.”</p><p>“I just-- this is <em>so</em> unfair,” Agatha sighed. “ I just want to fuck my very hot girlfriend, why is the <em>universe</em> fucking with me?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, coming closer. “It’s only six weeks--”</p><p>“But it isn’t though!” Agatha yelled, voice harsh and raw. “What happens after six weeks when you realize we aren’t sexually compatible? What happens in those six weeks when we aren;t fucking and I lose all my novelty? I can’t <em>lose</em> you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio was stricken. She closed the distance between the two of them and swept Agatha into her arms. “Agatha, I cannot emphasize enough how much you mean to me. You, not your body or how good you are in bed, no, I fell in love with your heart and mind and fuck, everything you <em>are</em>, okay? You’re not going to lose me over sex. I really doubt you’re going to lose me at all. I have no self-preservation instincts, zero, nada, I’ll go down with the Titanic every damn time.”</p><p>Agatha let out a wet laugh. “You really don’t have any self-preservation instincts.” She paused, looking for any sign of hesitation or reluctance on Rio’s face. “We’ll make it through the six weeks, won’t we?” Agatha asked, eyes shining with something very close to fear.</p><p>“I am sure we can make it through anything together, <em>mi amor</em>. We just need to keep talking to each other.”</p>

<p>Agatha Harkness was going to bury herself alive.</p><p>She wasn’t strong enough. She wasn’t strong enough to make it six weeks without pouncing on Rio if she kept up with her <em>behavior</em>. What behavior, you may ask?</p><p>Exhibit A, Rio’s Minecraft boxers. Now why in the hell would anyone who was over six wear those boxers? Agatha does not know. Why did they turn her on so fucking much that she spent almost twenty minutes screaming into a pillow in frustration? Agatha also does not know.</p><p>Exhibit B, the very vivid sex dreams she has been having, waking up wet and needy right next to Rio. And Rio looking anywhere but at her as she detangled herself from their cuddles to go to work.</p><p>And that leads us to Exhibit C, Rio coming back from her film shoots, white shirt tight on her arms, muscles flexing. It should have been illegal.</p><p>A small grace was that two days after they were told they could not, in fact, have sex, Rio was offered a gig on an indie film shoot that was shooting in New York. Since Agatha was feeling better and it was semi-local, Rio said yes and now spent thirteen of the fourteen waking hours away from Agatha, and even when she came home, she was tired and comatose, and immediately passing out most nights.</p><p>Agatha should have been happy that they weren’t festering in the sexual tension, waiting for their senses to snap, but also, she <em>missed</em> her fucking girlfriend.</p><p>Which is how she found herself cooking for the first time in a long time, going out of her way to find a recipe for <em>pasteles</em> easy enough for her to figure out but also authentic enough that Rio would want to savor it and stay awake. She tied the string wrong on the first attempt, causing the meat to fall out of the leaf, overcooked the dish on the second attempt, and finally, got somewhere close with the third one. And thank god, she was running out of banana leaves and those were surprisingly expensive (and she had to make Lilia drive to a grocery store forty minutes away to get the ingredients in the first place).</p><p>“Hey, I’m home-- why are you cooking?” Rio said, immediately dropping her bag at the door and running over. “Did something bad happen?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened when she realized exactly what Agatha was cooking. “Are you cooking <em>pasteles</em>? What did you do, Agatha? Did you murder someone and want me to hide the body? Are you <em>pregnant</em>?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “God forbid I do anything nice for you.”</p><p>Rio smiled, pulling her in gently. “Seriously, why all of this?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I just wanted to do something nice.”</p><p>Rio tightened her arms around her wait. “And?”</p><p>“Okay, I feel a little neglected,” Agatha said to Rio’s white shirt, refusing to look her in the eyes. “I know you have to work, but I miss you.”</p><p>Rio softened. “I’m sorry, <em>mi vida</em>. I haven’t been the most attentive lately.”</p><p>“I know you are working really long hours and I am basically doing nothing here waiting for you, but--”</p><p>“No excuses, baby,” Rio said, cupping her face. “Of course I can’t be here as much as before, but I will do my best to make sure you don’t forget how much I love you.”</p><p>“I know how much you love me,” Agatha mumbled, their foreheads connected softly. “I just, we never really got a honeymoon phase, now did we? It’s straight to real life relationship stuff like the house and being apart and taking care of Scratchy, and sometimes I just want to pause, you know. Get to be in the moment, now, with the love of my life.”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath. “I agree, my love. I <em>so</em> agree.”</p><p>Rio leaned in for a soft kiss that quickly turned into something heated, and Agatha found herself lifted onto the kitchen counter, Rio’s body between her legs, her tongue between Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Rio was the one who deepened the kiss further, threading her fingers through Agatha’s hair and pulling her closer. Agatha brought her hands up to cradle Rio’s face, peppering kisses all over her neck when they broke for breaths.</p><p>“Not to stop the make-out session, but we should eat these <em>pasteles</em> while they are hot,” Rio murmured eventually.</p><p>Agatha sighed into Rio’s neck. “Can we bring them to the couch and make out like sloppy teenagers while we watch a movie?”</p><p>Rio folded immediately. “Great idea.”</p><p>Moments later, Agatha pulled back from their heated make-out session with a glint of mischief in her eyes and asked, “If we are going the high school nothing below the waist route, can I at least leave a giant hickey on your neck so everyone knows you're taken?”</p><p>Who was Rio to deny her very loving, hot girlfriend?</p><p>Agatha watched Rio walk out the next morning with a larger purple bruise peeking out from under her shirt with a smug smile.</p><p>

</p><p>Agatha had resumed working from home, editing content from her laptop and ordering a small desk that folded over her bed so she could comfortably edit instead of balancing her laptop precariously on her knee.</p><p>Work was… work. It was something to do. But since Agatha was still not fully back, they didn’t give her any of the high stakes, quick turnaround stuff she loved, so Agatha still felt… unfulfilled.<br/>It might be because Rio was still on set. And because she hadn’t been dicked down.</p><p>Things between them were great, though. Rio would leave little notes for Agatha on post-its before she left for work. Agatha would wake up and immediately melt into a puddle. She saved every damn one. One day, she would laminate them and turn them into a coffee table book. Most nights Rio did pass out early, but Agatha appreciated the dedicated time she spent with her every night, holding her, telling her how her day was and what she did on set. Some nights they would have sloppy make-out sessions like they were horny teenagers, giggling uncontrollably.</p><p>Rio would send her texts throughout the day, telling her how much she missed her, sending her funny memes she saw online and Agatha would reciprocate with pictures of Scratchy and emojis that Rio would always come home and ask about.</p><p>“What does microphone and duck mean?”</p><p>“Talk your shit, obviously.”</p><p>Rio would groan and throw her hands up and bury her face in the pillows, while Agatha would make jokes about her being a Boomer and how she was still on Facebook unironically.</p><p>They only had one close call that week, when Scratchy gnawed the corner of Agatha’s prescription glasses and she had to get new ones, opting for large, square frames that blocked blue-light so she could use them while she edited too.</p><p>Rio came home to Agatha still working, glasses perched on the tip of her nose and Agatha saw in real time what a human looks like when they glitched. Rio’s eye twitched wildly, lip quivered and she looked torn between being so turned on she would come untouched and being so fucking depressed she was going to throw herself off a very large cliff.</p><p>“You okay there, sweetheart?” Agatha called after Rio hadn’t moved for fifteen minutes.</p><p>“You… you got new glasses,” Rio choked out eventually.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I sure did.”</p><p>Rio looked like she was going to faint. “I have to go shower. Cold shower.”</p><p>And if Agatha heard Rio loudly moan and come in the shower a few moments later, she said nothing, especially not about matching wetness between her legs.</p><p>
<em>Fucking hell, she wasn’t sure they would last. </em>
</p><p>Post glasses-gate, Agatha made sure to remove them before Rio came home and hid them in her side drawer, sticking to more stressful, less sexy topics like finding a house.</p><p>“I got a subletter,” Rio had said, the one odd time she called Agatha from work that week. “She’s this very sweet exchange student and she is willing to keep and water my plants until we find a place.”</p><p>Almost all of Rio’s stuff was moved into Agatha’s small studio, and it really was bursting at the seams. They needed to find a bigger place, like now, but honestly, between Agatha’s mid-level PR job and Rio’s freelance film work, they didn’t have a lot of disposable income to throw towards a down payment on a proper house. Agatha still spent an unruly amount of time on Zillow and other apartment and house hunting websites, looking for anything decent in their price range.</p><p>Their lucky break came from a very unlikely source.</p><p>“Agatha,” Nat said when she picked up, very confused because they did not have a casual calling kind of relationship. “Have you two found a house yet?”</p><p>“Uh, no--”</p><p>“Okay, great. Wanda wants me to move into her apartment cause it’s closer to both our workplaces, but mine is much bigger. Like two bedrooms, three bathrooms, a great living room, a huge kitchen kind of big.”</p><p>“O-kay, and you’re telling me this because--”</p><p>“You two should move in there!”</p><p>“Move into <em>your</em> apartment?”</p><p>“Just come look at it, okay? It’s a good in between until you find your forever house. And I can talk to the landlord to give it to you guys at my rent-controlled rate.”</p><p>That’s how Rio and Agatha ended up at Nat’s apartment the next morning (one of the few mornings Rio had off work) to take a look at Rio’s ex’s apartment, who was moving in with Agatha’s ex.</p><p>This was the most lesbian thing they had ever done, by far.</p><p>Scratch that. The most lesbian thing they had ever done was moving into the goddamn space.</p><p>Because Nat was right. It was <em>perfect</em>.</p><p>Rio lost her mind over the size of the kitchen, excitedly looking at the appliances, cooing at the storage space in the pantry and cabinets.</p><p>Agatha almost cried when she saw the bathtub in the master and the double sinks. Oh god, the toilet had heat control settings. She was ready to marry this fucking bathroom.</p><p>They both loved the double french doors that opened into a decently sized balcony, a place where Scratchy could roam and Agatha and Rio would still have enough space to add in some outdoor furniture for them to lounge in when the weather was good.</p><p>Agatha could see them making this their place. The soft, wooden finishes would blend so well with Rio’s plants, and the large windows would bring in so much natural light for Agatha who really enjoyed lazing in the sun like an unbothered cat.</p><p>“Thank you, Nat,” Agatha exclaimed as they signed the paperwork a few hours later with an astonishingly good price.</p><p>“No, thank <em>you</em>,” Nat said shyly, blushing deeply. “I would not have met Wanda if it weren’t for you both.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said gently, looking at Agatha with so much love. “I firmly believe, if it is meant to be, you will always find your way to each other.”</p><p>Agatha grinned widely and would have gone in for a kiss if she wasn’t using those stupid crutches.</p><p>The things you do for love.</p><p>

</p><p>Moving was not that hard for Agatha.</p><p>It was very hard for Rio and all their friends who not only had to help Rio and Agatha move in, but also help Nat to move out and into Wanda’s place.</p><p>Agatha sat on the newly moved couch, her leg propped up on cushions, sipping lemonade as Rio hauled the rest of the heavy furniture with the movers and while their friends carried boxes up the stairs. Rio had started the day with a flannel overshirt and a white t-shirt, and ended it with black tank after she sweated right through the white tee and Agatha couldn’t handle everyone seeing pretty much everything.</p><p>Agatha threw a new shirt at her, grumbling for her to change but following her into the bathroom where they made out for ten minutes before Jen yelled at them to get a move on.</p><p><em>No</em> one understood how good Agatha was being.</p><p>Hell, she had to start <em>meditating</em> because the sheer amount of filthy thoughts that filtered through her head when she saw Rio lift something heavy was doing no good for anyone.</p><p>Instead, she pulled out swatches and started planning wall colors for the living room (eggshell), their bedroom (pale blue) and the guest room/ Agatha’s makeshift office (pale yellow). She had dedicated Pinterest boards already about how the apartment would look elegant but comfortable, with lots of browns, soft colors for accessories like throws and pillows and random pops of jewel tones in the pots for Rio’s plants or the rug. It was going to be something from Architectural Digest and it was going to be <em>comfortable</em> and <em>fashionable</em> and <em>homey</em>, just you watch.</p><p>She had let Rio make her own dream home boards too, and was only mildly disgusted by the inspiration pictures, deciding instead to let Rio take care of the renovations so she would feel like she contributed but wouldn’t ruin the vibe of their home.</p><p>Because it was going to be <em>their home</em> and Agatha was going to spare no fucking effort in getting it there.</p><p>Later that night, as they settled into their new room, the first time without Scratchy since he got his pen set up in the second room, Agatha started crying.</p><p>“Baby, are you okay?” Rio looked worried.</p><p>“I’m so happy,” Agatha cried into Rio’s shoulder. “We have a great apartment and a rabbit and each other and I didn’t think I would ever get to be this happy.”</p><p>“Why not?” Rio asked, bringing Agatha’s face into her hands.</p><p>“My mother always told me I was born evil. That there was something very wrong inside of me, that I would never be <em>good</em>, never be <em>happy</em>.”</p><p>A tear fell down Rio’s eye. “You never told me this,” she whispered.</p><p>“How would I? It was always too close to the truth. There was always some part of me that believed it. That believed I was rotten and wicked and you would see it too.” Agatha said, looking down.</p><p>“Agatha, your mother was wrong, okay? So, so wrong. You are wonderful and perfect and you care so much about the people who are around you and you are the best mom to Scratchy. She is a horrible human being who wouldn't be able to tell a diamond from coal. Literally the Wicked Witch of the West. A house will fall down on her very soon, I promise.”</p><p>“Is that a threat?” Agatha said, a small smile gracing her lips.</p><p>“It can be if you want it to be. Say the word and I will pull out the sniper.”</p><p>A laugh escaped Agatha’s lips. “I love you.”</p><p>Rio held her close. “I love you, too, <em>mi vida</em>. You deserve all the good in the world.”</p><p>

</p><p>They were about halfway moved in a week later. Rio’s film wrapped three days ago and she had spent the last two days in essentially a coma. Rio had somehow woken up enough to get two coats of paint on all the walls between yesterday and today, so they were spending a night in Alice and Jen’s guest bedroom to avoid paint fumes.</p><p>Which is how she found herself sipping decaf tea at night while Alice and Jen shared a bottle of wine and Agatha tried, and failed, to pretend she wasn’t jealous of them.</p><p>“You can have a glass,” Jen offered after the fifth time Agatha’s mood soured mid conversation when Jen drank from her glass.</p><p>Agatha shook her head and sighed. “Besides the fact I shouldn’t for my own health, Rio would murder me if she walked in.”</p><p>“Rio is dead to the world,” Alice giggled.</p><p>Agatha smiled fondly, looking over to the door of the guest room. “Still, it’s the principle of it.”</p><p>“You are whipped,” Jen teased. “And you haven’t even had sex yet.”</p><p>Agatha sighed deeply, burying her face in her hands. “Don’t fucking remind me.”</p><p>Alice giggled again. “Agatha,” she said in a sing-song voice, “What happens if she is awful at sex. Like so, so bad?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “She isn’t bad at sex, Alice.”</p><p>“Indulge me, what if she is? Do you stay with her? Is it grounds for a break up?”</p><p>A soft smile graced Agatha’s lips. “I’m in it for the long haul, Alice. No matter how she is in bed, no matter how good or bad, Rio has my heart. There can never be anyone else.”</p><p>“<em>Fuck, you really are whipped.</em>”</p><p>Agatha laughed along but that night, when she lay back down next to Rio, she couldn’t help but wonder at their luck. Because honestly, there was a small, very small, part of Agatha that was glad they were not having sex. With the both of them and their communication issues,  it would have been so easy to get swept up in making love and exploring and banging each other to oblivion that <em>this</em>, the quiet intimacy of them loving and existing and knowing each other, would have never had time to solidify.</p><p>Agatha had never felt so… <em>secure</em>. So confident in the fact that Rio and her would make it through everything, so ready to take on the world. It didn’t scare her, no, it made her feel stronger, more capable.</p><p>She couldn’t even process that a month ago, Rio and Agatha were just friends sharing secret glances and words with double meanings, too scared, too cowardly.</p><p>And now, as she looked over at Rio, the love of her life, her partner in every sense of the word, she knew that it was maybe time to buy a ring.</p><p>As a precautionary measure.</p><p>So, if she accidentally blurted out the proposal that had been circling her mind lately, she would, at least, have a ring to seal the deal.</p><p>Because she wanted this forever.</p><p>

</p><p>Agatha and Rio sat in the waiting room for her one month check-up appointment. Rio’s leg bounced as she filed through what was now a folder of discharge papers, prescriptions and health plans.</p><p>Agatha leaned over and rubbed her bouncing knee. “I don’t think I ever said thank you, my love.”</p><p>Rio looked up in confusion.</p><p>Agatha shyly smiled. “For taking care of me and all the health plans and the insurance. I couldn’t have done this alone.”</p><p>“You don’t have to say thank you, baby. Anything for you,” Rio said, squeezing the hand that was on her leg.</p><p>“I know, but I want to. I love you.”</p><p>“I love you, too,” Rio said, leaning in for a quick kiss.</p><p>“My, my,” Agatha heard a familiar voice. “Is this Westview’s most loved couple?”</p><p>“Nurse Danvers,” Agatha exclaimed, rising quickly. “How are you?”</p><p>“I am good,” Nurse Danvers laughed. “You two seem very happy and in love.”</p><p>Rio blushed. “We are.”</p><p>Nurse Danvers smiled warmly. “Let’s get you all checked in so you can speak with Dr Banner, okay?”</p><p>Moments later they were in the patient room, vitals taken, staring at the door, hoping for good news.</p><p>“Hello, hello,” Dr Banner said cheerily as he entered. “Okay, so we are going to do a bunch of X-Rays and blood tests today to see where your bones are at and what the next steps should be. Agatha, Dr Kaplan will be taking you to get all of this done. Rio, I heard you have some questions for me about medications… again.”</p><p>Agatha heard the opening notes of Rio grilling Dr Banner about side-effects of one of the medicines and William wheeled her out in a wheelchair. “So,” William began apprehensively, “how were the last four weeks? Did you two murder each other?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. And then casually, “I’m buying a ring.”</p><p>“A ring?” William squealed. “No way. After only a month?”</p><p>Agatha had a goofy smile on her face. “When you know, you know.”</p><p>William squealed the entire way to and from the X-Ray room and while he took blood and while he dropped said blood off. Agatha let him, watching endearingly.</p><p>“William, what do your family call you? Bill, Will--”</p><p>“Billy. They call me Billy.”</p><p>“Can I call you Billy too?”</p><p>William softened. “I would really love that.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Well, Billy, you’re invited to the next Coven game night.”</p><p>“Ooh,” Billy cooed, “Can I bring Eddie too?”</p><p>“Now, who’s Eddie?” Agatha questioned as they came back into the room that Rio and Dr Banner were in, the latter of whom looked like he just came home from war.</p><p>“Please tell me you have the results,” he looked at Billy in panic, who handed him the scans and blood workup. Dr Banner flipped through them and hung the X-Ray radiograph on a lightboard, which both Billy and him looked at with wide eyes, cooing at it like it was a cute baby.</p><p>“This is incredible,” Billy stuttered.</p><p>“Phenomenal. Miss Vidal, I must say, you would have made a great nurse.” Dr Banner exclaimed, finally turning around to face them. “Full recovery in four weeks, I have so rarely seen this.”</p><p>Agatha began to hope. “Wait, full recovery, which means--”</p><p>“Cast is coming off your leg today. Your ribs look great. This is very possible, but most of the time the body never gets the rest and nutrients it needs in a month to fully heal, but here you are.”</p><p>“Doctor, I need you to repeat this like we are idiots. What does this mean?”</p><p>Dr Banner visibly suppressed a laugh. “You two can resume strenuous activity, though you might want to take it a bit slow at first.”</p><p>Rio and Agatha looked at each other with matching looks of surprise. “Not to sound like a horndog teenager,” Agatha said finally, “but can you rip this cast off my leg please?”</p><p><em><b>T minus, fuck it, it’s actually D-Day.</b></em> </p>

<p>Rio Vidal was in, what some would say, a state of shock.</p><p>Both Agatha and Rio, actually still dazed. They sat in the car, side by side, staring straight ahead, still processing the fact that Agatha had walked out of the hospital, no cast, full bill of health two weeks before she was supposed to be cleared.</p><p>“Backseat?” Agatha said, into the silence.</p><p>Rio was already halfway out the door.</p><p>They slid in the back, wasting no time in sinking into a hungry kiss. Rio grabbed Agatha’s waist and pulled closer, tongues wrestling for dominance, hands darting around, feeling everything, Rio’s cotton shirt, Agatha’s silk blouse, the lace of her bra, her disheveled hair, her soft skin, <em>fuck</em>. Agatha moaned into the kiss and Rio fought the urge to rip her clothes off immediately. Instead, she sloppily undid the buttons at the back of the blouse and pulled it over Agatha’s head, leaving her lacy black bra, stark against her creamy skin.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>, Rio almost growled, wasting no time in burying her face in those breasts, nipping, teasing, kissing Agatha’s chest. Agatha moaned again, whiny and needy, threading her fingers through Rio’s hair and roughly pulling her up to kiss her, harshly biting her lip when Rio moaned into this kiss. Agatha pushed her back further into the seat and climbed Rio like she was a goddamn tree, straddling her and shoving her against the car window.</p><p>“Fuck, <em>baby</em>,” Rio whimpered as Agatha grabbed her neck and pulled her into another rough kiss. Agatha retreated slightly, just enough to pull Rio’s shirt over her head and throw it somewhere in the car. Rio used this movement as a way to grab Agatha’s tits, yanking her bra down so she could access her pebbled nipples.</p><p>“Oh, look at how <em>hard</em> they are for me,” Rio groaned, burying her face between Agatha’s breasts again, fingers pinching both nipples.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Agatha hissed, head arching back as Rio sucked fiercely on the skin between her boobs, leaving dark purple bruises in her wake. “Rio, <em>please</em>.”</p><p>“Please, what?” Rio taunted as she came up for air, twisting Agatha’s nipples harder. She whimpered at the contact.</p><p>“Fucking <em>suck</em> on them,” Agatha demanded, trying to shove Rio’s mouth over her breast. Rio wouldn’t budge though, staring at Agatha through her eyelashes with too much defiance, not willing to hand over this <em>so</em> easily. Agatha looked fucking ruined already, mouth swollen, eyes dilated, hair messy. She grabbed Rio’s hands and threw them over her head, pinning them on the car window behind them with one hand, using her other one to shove Rio’s mouth into her tits.</p><p>“You’re going to be a good girl and suck on my tits, aren’t you?” Agatha taunted. Rio nodded, mouth full, already sucking away on her right breast with abandon, pulling, flicking, biting her nipple harshly. Agatha tightened her hold on Rio’s hands as they twitched to break out of the hold, instead, pressing her head closer, moaning loudly. “Fuck, baby, yes, that feels so <em>fucking</em> good.”</p><p>Agatha started grinding down on Rio’s leg, the friction dazing and burning her at the same time, clearly building into something more.</p><p>Rio let her go with a <em>pop!</em> A trail of saliva still connected her mouth to Agatha’s nipple, and Agatha cried, “No, please, go back. Not fucking <em>again</em>.”</p><p>Rio ripped her hands out of Agatha’s hold, Agatha’s strength no match for hers, and rose up a little, so they were at eye level, Agatha still straddling her with a look of desperation on her face.</p><p>“Do you think I’d let you come so easily? Do you think after four weeks of you <em>tormenting</em> me, of you being a desperate, <em>needy</em> slut, I’d let you come rutting like a little bitch on my thigh?” Rio grabbed her waist, sharply flipping her around so her back pressed up against Rio's bare front.</p><p>“You’re going to come when I say so,” Rio said, voice low. Agatha groaned, arching back into Rio and capturing her lips into a hungry kiss.</p><p>“Did you fucking hear me? You’re going to come when I say so,” Rio grabbed her hair and pulled it hard, growling into her lips.</p><p>“I’m going to come when you say so,” Agatha said breathlessly. “I’m going to do whatever you want, baby. I’ll be <em>such</em> a good girl for you. Please <em>fuck me</em>.” Agatha pulled her into another kiss, whimpering as the words she just begged for sunk in.</p><p>Rio used this time to undo Agatha’s jeans, only breaking the kiss so they could awkwardly pull them off, and just like that, Agatha was back to being pinned against Rio, ass pressed into Rio’s crotch, the thin thong not protecting Agatha from Rio’s rough jeans. Rio traced her fingers down Agatha’s bare stomach, feeling the muscles of her abs, strong and sinewy, trailing kisses down Agatha's neck, as Agatha’s hand found her hair again and pulled her into another needy kiss.</p><p>Rio didn’t even have to guess where Agatha’s clit was because when her fingers arrived at the front of the underwear, she found a soaked, dripping ‘x’ that marked the spot.</p><p>“<em>Baby</em>, you’re so wet for me, already?” Rio teased, biting into the skin of Agatha’s neck. Agatha whimpered as Rio traced her fingers over her core, a ghost of a touch, playing with the thick, brown curls at the start of her core.</p><p>“Please, Rio, <em>fuck me</em>,” Agatha demanded. “I can’t take it anymore, please, I’m begging, I’m going to go insane-- <em>oh my god</em>.”</p><p>Rio slid her fingers in, no teasing, no warning. Agatha arched further, her head resting on Rio’s shoulder, and let out a raw, guttural moan. Rio bit harshly at her neck, increasing the pace at which she thrust her fingers into Agatha.</p><p>“Harder, Rio, <em>harder</em>,” Agatha mewled. “<em>Fuck me harder</em>.”</p><p>Rio complied, pushing a third finger into her and using her other hand to push Agatha further down into her fingers, already knuckle deep, reaching into her core more deeply. Agatha was moaning and cursing Rio with abandon.</p><p>“Yeah, you like that don’t you, <em>fuck</em>, you’re taking my fingers so well, aren’t you? You didn’t even need an orgasm to be <em>this</em> wet. My perfect little <em>whore</em>,” Rio taunted, pulling her fingers in to find the spot near her entrance. Agatha’s eyes rolled into her head at Rio’s words, and she ground her hips into Rio more frantically.</p><p>“More, I need <em>more</em>,” she pleaded, voice hoarse from screaming.</p><p>“You’re too loud,” Rio said, moving her hand up to muffle Agatha’s howls. The second her hand made contact with Agatha’s mouth, tightening around her face, Agatha buckled, thighs quivering.</p><p>“Can I come baby, can I <em>please</em> come, please—” Agatha begged through Rio’s fingers, head tipped over, hitting the car window as she convulsed.</p><p>“Come.”</p><p>Agatha let the onslaught of the orgasm consume her, screaming loudly through Rio’s fingers. Rio shoved two fingers into Agatha's mouth for her to suck so she would quieten down, and kept going, thrusting into her with new vigor. She could hear the wet thumps of her fingers pounding into Agatha, her pussy so fucking wet it was a waterpark down there, taking Rio so easily.</p><p>Rio almost came at how well Agatha would take her cock. <em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>She brought her hand from Agatha’s mouth, already wet with her spit down to her clit, rubbing harshly as she kept pushing deeper and deeper into Agatha, now four fingers in, almost fisting her.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio, I’m going to come again.” Agatha cried, collapsing backwards into Rio, mewling filthy moans into Rio’s ear, already convulsing all over her fingers and dissolving into a ruined mess.</p><p>“Fuck, you-- <em>how</em>--” Agatha groaned, unable to for a coherent thought, as she melted into Rio’s embrace.</p><p>“Shhhh, baby, don’t say anything,” Rio said, leaning in and placing a gentle kiss on her lips. “You are so wet, <em>fuck</em>.” Rio said, dipping into her again, and smearing her cum all over her legs and thighs.</p><p>Agatha turned then, hugging her fully and kissing her neck. “Give me like ten minutes, and I will fuck that stupid shit-eating grin off your face.”</p><p>Rio was, indeed, wearing a shit-eating grin. “Hmm, I don’t know baby,” Rio was playing with her hair. “You came in like five minutes, and I don’t come that easily.”</p><p>Agatha was clearly revived through pure spite, because she tore out of their embrace, outrage clear on her face, and pushed Rio to sit up, sinking down in the footwell between the seats and all but ripping Rio’s jeans off.</p><p>“Ooh, someone is desperate to prove herself,” Rio taunted, still helping Agatha pull her clothes off.</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Make me,” Rio challenged.</p><p>“Hold my fucking hair,” Agatha said and dove headfirst into Rio’s pussy, licking her like she was a woman starved.</p><p>“Fuck, <em>fuck</em>,” Rio mewled immediately, grabbing her hair into a makeshift ponytail and slightly fearing of her life at the intensity at which Agatha was eating her out.</p><p>Agatha quickly found Rio’s clit, circling it with her tongue and flicking it back and forth as Rio tightened her legs around her head, and then latching onto it, sucking relentlessly. Rio bucked up into Agatha’s mouth, harshly shoving her face further into her pussy, eyes rolling into the back of her head as the first waves of pleasure hit her. Agatha sucked harder, somehow still being able to use her tongue to flick Rio’s clit while still keeping the pressure intact. <em>Fuck</em> Rio had never been eaten out like this.</p><p>Agatha looked up at Rio then, nose and mouth buried deep in her, arms gripping Rio’s thighs, so much lust and hunger and adoration in her eyes that Rio almost buckled under the sheer weight of what they were doing.</p><p>This wasn’t some regular, casual fuck.</p><p>This was everything she ever dreamed about. This was her future and her three wishes and everything she secretly prayed for when she thought no one was looking.</p><p>This was fucking <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>Rio could feel the orgasm build somewhere within her, deep and low, growing stronger, getting bigger, and then Agatha pressed the tip of her teeth on Rio’s clit and she felt the pressure engulf her, seeping into every aspect of her being. She cried out, not caring where they were, not caring who heard them, almost screaming Agatha’s name while holding her face in place.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, Agatha, that was-- <em>oh my fucking fuck</em>,” Rio tipped her head back again as Agatha shoved two fingers into her, still terrorizing her clit and now thrusting relentlessly into Rio.</p><p>
<em>Was this a fucking murder attempt?</em>
</p><p>Agatha pushed on Rio’s clit with her tongue, and pressed her long fingers further, finding a spot, finding the fucking spot and Rio convulsed over her again, still riding the last orgasm, feeling it all blend together, her vision becoming blurry, sound losing all meaning.</p><p>Fuck, Agatha’s fucking tongue. Fuck, Rio could die a thousand times on her tongue.</p><p>“Baby, fuck, you fuck me so good,” Rio said, tried to pull Agatha up to kiss her, but Agatha simply looked at her from her place between her legs and mumbled something into her core, head bobbing as she pulled her fingers out and licked the entire length of Rio’s pussy.</p><p>“Are you trying to fucking kill me?” Rio whimpered, once again trying to pull Agatha into her arms. But <em>no</em>, Agatha held her in place, and Rio was convinced her girlfriend was on a mission to make Rio eat her words by eating her to death.</p><p>Agatha shoved her tongue deep inside Rio, thrusting it back and forth, in and out, nose rubbing up against Rio’s clit as she buried tongue in Rio. Rio didn’t even last a minute, third orgasm spilling into the first two with so much gusto that Rio thought she blacked out.</p><p>She collapsed, limp, against the car seat. <em>Was she dead and buried now? Is this what heaven felt like?</em></p><p>She looked down to where Agatha was kissing her thighs, cum spread all over her face, practically dripping off her chin.</p><p>“Do you have fucking gills, Agatha?” Rio whined, “Am I dating a fucking fish?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, crawling up to kiss Rio. “Shall I take that as a glowing review of how well I ate you, baby?”</p><p>Rio moaned into the kiss, tasting herself on Agatha’s face. She licked her cum off Agatha’s chin.</p><p>“I don’t come easily, my ass.” Agatha laughed against her cheek.</p><p>“Oh fuck off, how did I know you would eat me out like <em>that</em>,” Rio whispered, before recovering slightly and remembering where they were.</p><p>Rio blushed furiously. “We can never come back to this hospital, Agatha. I think the entire block heard us.”</p><p>Agatha laughed into her neck. “The entire block didn’t survive four weeks of not being able to bang their hot fucking girlfriend, who tastes divine by the way, like seriously, I will get addicted to licking you. Fuck, everyone in this hospital and block and city can <em>fuck off</em>.”</p><p>Rio groaned from a mixture of lust and embarrassment. Agatha laughed louder. “Let’s get out of here,” she said, looking around for her blouse. “We can continue this at home.”</p><p>
<em>Why did Rio think she was getting off easy? Of course, there was more.</em>
</p><p>“I don’t think I can drive,” Rio said weakly, legs still shaking.</p><p>Agatha giggled, pulling up her jeans, “Aww, baby, did I really fuck you that hard? I don’t feel that worn out, maybe you didn’t do such a good--”</p><p>Rio pulled her in for a rough kiss. “Never mind, I will get us home in fifteen minutes so I can strap the living shit out of you.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breathless laugh. “You think you will strap <em>me</em>? Honey, I don’t think so. Come on, pretty boy, pull your pants up and drive us home so I can show you what a true strap-on experience is.”</p><p>Rio complied like the loyal dog she was.</p><p>They were home in five. This time, Agatha didn’t complain about Rio’s insane driving.</p>

<p>Agatha Harkness was staring at not one but <em>two</em> straps in their fun drawer.</p><p>“We both can’t strap, Agatha,” Rio said next to her.</p><p>“I <em>fucking</em> know that, Rio. Why won’t you let me just fuck you?”</p><p>“Because, you just fucking made me come, I get to do you now,” Rio almost whined.</p><p>Agatha eyed Rio’s green strap wearily. She had never really had one <em>that</em> big.</p><p>“It’s too big,” Agatha shook her head. “I don’t think I can take it.”</p><p>Rio rubbed her back. “Baby, I know it looks big, but you’re so fucking wet, okay. You almost took my entire hand in the car. You are so fucking <em>ready</em> for it, you’ll take it all <em>so easily</em>.”</p><p><em>Yeah, no, Agatha was</em> not <em>doing that.</em></p><p>And if Rio thought <em>she</em> was relentless, it was time to show her who the boss was around here.</p><p>Agatha turned and grabbed Rio, throwing her on the bed and looming over her. “You wanna talk, <em>handsome</em>?” She trailed a finger over Rio’s core, her jeans wet from where Agatha came earlier and Rio’s growing wetness from Agatha’s antics. “Come on, baby. Let me <em>reward</em> you for being such a good girl.” Agatha traced the finger over Rio’s jaw, watching Rio consider her words. “Let me rail you so fucking hard you forget the last four weeks.”</p><p>Rio almost looked convinced. Lucky for her, she knew exactly how to get her over the finish line. “I’ll even put on the glasses while fucking you.”</p><p>Rio let out an involuntary moan. Agatha knew she had won.</p><p>Agatha flipped her on the bed in a show of strength she didn’t even know she possessed, pulling her jeans out and pushing her head into the duvet.</p><p>“You’re going to be a good little girl and stay there for me, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio moaned and nodded into the blanket.</p><p>Agatha tore off her clothes, not caring then she heard something rip, and threw on the harness, tightening the straps with familiar ease. The purple dick hung between her thigh, all seven and a half inches of its glory, and she turned on the in-built vibrator, not positioning over her clit just yet. Instead, she trotted over to the side table by their bed, throwing on the glasses. She caught a look of herself in the floor length mirror that hung over the closet and tilted her head.</p><p>
<em>Something was missing. </em>
</p><p>She threw open the door to the closet, pulling out a blue-button up and throwing it on, leaving it unbuttoned and fluttering.</p><p>She turned back to find Rio staring at her, still on her hands and legs, eyes dark and a string of saliva dripping down the side of her mouth.</p><p>“<em>Daddy</em>,” she drawled, looking fucking ruined and ravaged and they hadn’t even begun.</p><p>“Daddy?” Agatha mirrored, half in shock, half in blind lust.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, like she hadn’t meant to say it out loud. “I-- I didn’t--”</p><p>But Agatha was already walking towards her, leaning forward and gently threading her hands into Rio’s hair, and yanking her up so that she could look her in the eyes.</p><p>“Did I say you could move?”</p><p>Rio shook her head frantically.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s hair. “Then why did you?”</p><p>“You took too long,” Rio whimpers.</p><p>“I took too long? Oh, I was mistaken. You’re not a <em>good</em> girl are you?” Agatha whispered, leaning close and slapping her ass. “You’re a very, very <em>bad</em> girl.”</p><p>Rio gasped. “I am, I am a <em>very</em> bad girl.”</p><p>Agatha shoved her head down, lifting up the dildo with her other hand. “Suck.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her cock and stuck it in her mouth, taking the entire length into her mouth as Agatha adjusted the vibrations to match her center. “Yeah, you're going to suck Daddy’s cock so well.”</p><p>Rio groaned into the silicone, still bobbing her head back and forth, taking as much as she can into her mouth. Every time it hit the back of her throat, the simulator on her clit pushed up against it and sent a shiver through Agatha.</p><p>But it wasn’t <em>enough</em>.</p><p>Agatha grabbed her hair again, holding her in place as she pushed her dick into Rio’s mouth, deeper and deeper, until she almost gagged, deepthroating it completely.</p><p>“Yeah, you gonna take it all?” Agatha moaned, “Your mouth is <em>mine</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost rolled over as Agatha pounded her dick in and out of Rio’s mouth, the vibrations that were pulsing through the dildo almost making her come. Rio looked like she was going to explode. Agatha pulled out of her mouth, grabbing Rio’s neck and throwing her back onto the bed.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio groaned, “That was so fucking hot, baby. You’re gonna make me come untouched.”</p><p>Agatha crawled onto the bed, dick tracing over Rio’s thigh. “Fuck, please put it in me. I’m a dirty little slut you need to <em>punish</em>, Daddy. Fuck <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Agatha blushed at Rio’s words, the tips of her ears burning, even though she was the one on top, she was the one about to fuck Rio raw.</p><p>Rio and her fucking <em>mouth</em>. Agatha really needed to shut her up for good.</p><p>But first, “Pick a safeword, my love,” Agatha said, momentarily breaking out of her hunger to check in with her girlfriend. Rio snapped out of her daze a little too, a smile returning to her face.</p><p>“Uh, can my safeword be safeword?” Rio said, shit-eating grin also, unfortunately, returning.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “No, because how am I supposed to ask if you are okay and need to safeword if the safeword is safeword.”</p><p>“Agatha, the whole point of this is that I safeword whenever it’s too much, you don’t need to ask me about it.” Rio said, biting her lip to contain her laughter.</p><p>Agatha whined. “Rio, I am not a fucking dominatrix. You are my girlfriend, whom I love and care for, and I need to be able to check in on you, so, pick a different fucking word.”</p><p>Rio softened. “Okay, what about knife? I need something easy to remember but not something I can make dirty, cause you know I talk up a big storm.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly. “Knife it is.”</p><p>She reached forward when Rio stopped her with a hand to her chest. “What’s yours?”</p><p>Agatha was a little taken aback. She had never really had use for a safeword before. “Uh, um, maybe magic?”</p><p>“Magic?” Rio rolled her around in her mouth. “Magic works. Okay, you can continue again, Daddy. Fuck me.”</p><p>Agatha tried, and failed, not to laugh at how fast Rio switched back into it. “You really are something,” Agatha said fondly.</p><p>“No, go back, <em>go back</em>,” Rio whined. “I want the feral Agatha, the one that wanted to rail me into tomorrow. Bring her back.” Rio was pouting.</p><p>“Well, you won’t get her if you keep whining,” Agatha said, pursing her lips to keep more laughter from escaping.</p><p>Rio scrambled to get up, launching herself at Agatha’s lips. They kissed sloppily, wide mouthed, tongues pressing. “I’m such a fucking slut, <em>Daddy</em>,” she whispered filthily into Agatha’s ear when they broke apart, pressing her stomach into the dildo, trapping it between the two. It felt cold and hard against Agatha’s skin. Rio locked eyes with her, hooded and blown, and pulled back slightly, saliva dripping from her mouth as she deliberately spit downward, a slow descent that landed on the tip of the dildo between them.</p><p>Something burned in Agatha then, a carnal fucking <em>need</em>, and she grabbed Rio’s ass and slapped it, earning a throaty moan from Rio. “Yeah, you want me to fuck you? Teach you a lesson?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, I do,” Rio enthusiastically nodded.</p><p>Agatha ran her hands down Rio’s body, until they found her core, circling her clit, feeling her whimper at the contact. Agatha pushed harder when she found the little bead at the top of her core, flicking it relentlessly, pushing, chasing, teasing it as she felt Rio buckle over her. “What happened to the dirty talk, Rio? Words failing you?”</p><p>Rio looked at her through her hooded eyes. “Baby, I love you but you are so fucking far from getting me to shut up and you don’t even know--”</p><p>Agatha shoved her tongue into Rio’s mouth, grabbing her neck and squeezing slightly. Rio moaned into her mouth, bringing her hands to string herself around Agatha’s neck, as Agatha sped up her movements, making Rio come in fucking minutes.</p><p><em>I don't come easy</em>, she had said earlier. All bullshit.</p><p>Agatha slipped her fingers into Rio to see how wet she was and was immediately met with so much fucking wetness she wondered if she even fucking needed lube.</p><p>“Baby, you’re dripping,” Agatha groaned, still reaching over to grab the lube she had set out when she strapped herself and squeezing some into her hands anyway.</p><p>“Guess why? Rio pants, “Guess why my pussy is fucking dripping.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t have to guess. She saw the way Rio looked at her glasses and button up shirt and messy hair. She saw the hunger, the pure carnal desire.</p><p>Fuck, she felt it too when she saw Rio all willing and pliant, big brown eyes looking up at her in challenge, mouth quirking into some tease. No one had ever quite driven her to this much animal madness.</p><p>Because that is exactly what she felt like, a <em>caged, suppressed, feral</em> animal. And the only prey she wanted was currently orgasming on her fingers.</p><p>Agatha brought her cock up to Rio’s pussy, positioning the tip in front of her opening, looking into her eyes to make sure it was all okay.</p><p>“Are you ready, <em>mi vida</em>?” Agatha asked, and Rio almost broke her neck nodding.</p><p>Agatha slid the tip into Rio, and waited, letting her adjust to the size. But <em>no</em>, Rio couldn’t wait, could she? Rio thrust downward, taking the entire length of the strap into her at once, moaning loudly as it hit her spot.</p><p>The movement pushed the vibrator at the end of the cock into Agatha with such force that she jerked forward, pushing in deeper.</p><p>“Yes, baby, fuck, keep going,” Rio mewled. Agatha grabbed her legs, flinging them around her waist, thrusting in and out of Rio wildly, hips moving fluidly, Rio slamming into the base of Agatha’s cock with such vigor it was <em>ruining</em> Agatha in a way she never thought it could. This was so fucking different than every time before, and looking at Rio riding her was almost enough to make her come.</p><p>Rio was crying out, moans bouncing around every wall of the room. “Just like that, Daddy, just like that, keep going, don’t stop, don’t <em>stop-- fuck!</em>” Rio cried out as she came all over Agatha’s cock, walls pulsing, thighs shaking, cum streaming down the purple dildo.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, kissing her soundly. “Fuck, you took me so well.”</p><p>Rio kissed her back intensely and Agatha pulled out, loosening the harness around her.</p><p>“Wait, was that <em>it</em>?” Rio said, no tease in her voice, just sheer confusion.</p><p>Agatha looked back at her, unsure if she should be offended or embarrassed. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Rio leaned back, confusion clear across her face, eyes raking across Agatha’s body as she searched for something, reassessed something.</p><p>
<em>And Agatha hated it.</em>
</p><p>“I’m sorry, am I not fucking good enough for you?” Agatha spat, getting up to walk away when Rio grabbed her hand.</p><p>“Baby, take your dick off and come here so we can talk about this like the big, mature adults we are, okay?” Rio said simply, laying on their bed, still naked and waiting.</p><p>Agatha was ready to run away, pick a fight or yell her way out of this. But the four weeks without sex and the multiple orgasms Rio had already given her pulled her back in, and she removed her harness and plopped on the bed, defenses still up though, still grumbling.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio began, turning to face her. “Have you ever been fucked with a strap before?”</p><p>Agatha immediately froze.</p><p>
<em>How the fuck did Rio figure this out literally the first time they had sex? Literally no one had figured it out to this date.</em>
</p><p>Rio just stared at her, hair messy, lips swollen. No judgement, just a question.</p><p><em>No use in lying now.</em> “No.”</p><p>“Can I ask why?” Rio said gently.</p><p>Agatha sighed, turning over and facing the wall. “I don’t think I will like it.”</p><p>Rio furrowed her brow. “Don’t lie to me, Agatha. You’re a penetration girl through and through.”</p><p>“I’m a <em>what?</em>”</p><p>“Penetration, you like it. You almost took my entire hand today, no problem. All signs point to you enjoying the strap, so why have you never tried this?”</p><p>Agatha sighed again, this time deeper. “I-- I always got pigeon-holed into the dominant role, not because I wanted to, but because most of the women I was with were just pure bottoms. Case and point, <em>Wanda</em>.’</p><p>Rio snorted, “Understood, carry on.”</p><p>“I asked a few times at first, but no one was ever, um, willing to strap me, even like service top me, so eventually I gave up and just only took the dom role, even though I don’t fully feel comfortable in it. I don’t usually, um, come from strapping, it just, uh, feels like something I <em>have</em> to do for my partner, not something I particularly enjoy.”</p><p>“I could pick that part up, baby.” Rio said, moving a piece of her hair behind her ear. “The way we fucked in the car and the way we fucked now was so different, not in a good or bad way, just <em>different</em> and I think it’s because of your unresolved feelings towards the strap.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, not meeting Rio’s eyes. “I think so too.”</p><p>“If it’s okay with you, I would love to top you,” Rio said tenderly. Agatha’s eyes shot up. She opened her mouth, but no words came out.</p><p>
<em>Is this what she wanted?</em>
</p><p>“You don’t have to say yes or no right now, okay? I just, I have experience using a strap and I am not afraid to be the top and I would love to strap you, you know, so you can explore the whole other side to sex you that you have never got to explore until now.”</p><p>
<em>Agatha’s heart almost burst open. </em>
</p><p>“You would do that for me?” Agatha said, voice full of emotion.</p><p>Rio leaned over and kissed her slowly. “Of course, my love. You know, ignoring the fact that I explicitly begged for it earlier and the fact that I have been dreaming about it for years, I would, in fact, top you for you and <em>only</em> you, and not for <em>me</em> at all.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but pulled Rio close. “I would love it, but I don’t know if I am ready to do it right now.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, my love,” Rio smiled. “We have so much time to explore this. Let’s take a nice shower and nap and then get ready for Alice’s birthday.”</p><p>“Fuck, is that today?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Well, I guess you should lead the way to the shower.”</p><p>Rio smiled and held her hand out to Agatha, who took it gratefully, leading her into the bathroom. Rio stepped into the shower first, fidgeting with the water pressure as Agatha brought over their robes and slippers. When Agatha stepped into the shower, she was surprised to find it hot.</p><p>Rio usually ran the showers colder, while Agatha preferred to be boiled alive. Her heart melted a little at the gesture.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha called out to her, kissing her against the shower wall, holding her close, deepening the kiss, slow and easy.</p><p>But god, forbid Rio do <em>anything</em> slow and easy.</p><p>Rio tightened her hold on Agatha’s hair, yanking it back softly to break the kiss so she could pepper kisses all the way down Agatha’s chest. Agatha let herself moan into the sensation, not trying to tell Rio where to go or what to do, trying to get used to the feeling of not always having to be so tuned up during sex.</p><p>So, when Rio flipped her around, pressing her against the glass wall, Agatha didn’t hide the hiss. And when Rio pulled her hair to refocus her gaze, arm tightly wound against her stomach, pulling her into a sloppy kiss, Agatha leaned into it, simpering at how strong Rio was, how she could so easily move her around. And, finally, when Rio asked her what she wanted to do, Agatha begged Rio to fuck her <em>right now</em>.</p><p>
<em>Because she hadn’t come, no, not in their home, not yet.</em>
</p><p>And Rio complied, pressing her further against the wall, the glass cold against her nipples, her fingers already harshly thrusting inside her.</p><p>“You like that, baby?” Rio growled into Agatha’s ear. “You like it when I fuck you like the little whore you are?”</p><p>Agatha melted completely. “I do,” she chanted, as Rio plunged her fingers deeper. “I do, I do.”</p><p>“And do you like it when I talk to you like <em>this</em>? Do you like being degraded and disrespected like a little bitch?</p><p>Agatha could feel the pleasure building within her. “I fucking love it, baby. I love it when you tell me what a <em>whore</em> I am.” Agatha’s tongue lolled out of her mouth. She felt like a rabid animal again, and Rio’s two fingers were not enough.</p><p>“<em>More</em>,” she choked out between moans. “Fucking put more fingers in.”</p><p>Rio compiled so easily, adding her third and fourth finger in together, causing Agatha hiss and press down harder. “Just like that, baby, I’m so close, I’m so close.”</p><p>And then Rio did something diabolical. She squeezed her thumb in too, shoving her entire hand into Agatha, pushing until it was in up to her wrist and Agatha was so full, so fucking full that she canted into it, rolling her hips as moans tore out of her throat. Rio bit her neck and she came in seconds, vivid clouds of pleasure rolling in and engulfing her senses.</p><p><em>She felt fucking free. She felt seen and heard and she needed</em> more.</p><p>“I know I said not right now but I changed my mind. I need you to shove your dick in me, baby. I need you to fuck me so hard you come inside me, you fucking <em>impregnate</em> me.” Agatha drawled, and Rio’s eyes immediately darkened.</p><p>“Are you sure?” She asked, tightening her hold on Agatha’s arm. “I don’t want you to feel pressured.”</p><p>“I love you but you were right I can take your entire hand so just imagine how well I would take your cock,” Agatha moaned, face still pressed up against the wall, “Rio, baby, please, get your fucking strap and fuck me the way we both need you to fuck me.”</p><p>Rio bolted out of the shower, and Agatha tried not to fall apart at the emptiness she felt between her legs. She turned off the water, stepping out of the shower and into the cold bathroom.</p><p>A wave of worry approached her, unsure if she was ready for this, but the second she saw Rio walk in, harness strapped, green dildo hanging between her legs, Agatha knew this is what she wanted. No, this is what she <em>needed</em>.</p><p>She was on her knees before Rio was even fully in the bathroom, pulling her in so she could take her entire length into her mouth, letting it reach all the way into her mouth, gagging as the tip hit the end of her throat and loving every moment of it. It wasn’t super big, only around six inches, but fuck, it was so fucking <em>thick</em>.</p><p>She looked up, lust fluttering through her eyelashes and understood why Rio had gone so crazy sucking her off because Rio seemed to be almost coming from looking at Agatha on her knees.</p><p>“Fuck, baby, just like that,” Rio said, holding her head in place as she ground against the pad on her end of the dildo, clit rubbing wildly as Agatha let her thrust in and out of her mouth. Rio, so open and wanting from being fucked earlier didn’t last long, coming with a cry, legs shaking, dick still in Agatha’s mouth. She slumped against the sinks as Agatha let go of the cock, a trail of saliva following her on the way out.</p><p>“Rio, I need to feel you in me,” Agatha cried. Rio grabbed her hair again, pulling her up and pushing her against the rough stone that tiled three sides of their bathroom. Agatha could feel her positioning the dick at her opening, somehow fully lubed up and ready to enter.</p><p>“Baby, are you sure?” Rio asked.</p><p><em>Agatha had never been more sure.</em> “Please, please <em>fuck</em> me.”</p><p>Rio slowly pushed into her, starting with only the tip. “Fuck,” Agatha mewled, “<em>Fuck.</em>”</p><p>She felt something close to, but not really, pain. It was so big. She felt her walls trying to adjust, opening and stretching to take Rio’s length.</p><p>
<em>Fuck. </em>
</p><p>Agatha was going to lose her fucking mind and it wasn’t even an inch into her.</p><p>“Can I push further?” Rio asked, and Agatha nodded against the wall, worried about how words had seemed to completely leave her and they hadn’t even fully begun.</p><p>Rio pushed in a little more and Agatha felt like she was being split open. “Motherfucker,” she cried out, “It feels so fucking good.”</p><p>Rio seemed to breathe a sigh of relief behind her, softly dropping a kiss on her shoulder. “I’m about a little more than halfway in, baby, do you want me to go in more?”</p><p>Agatha was losing her sanity. “You’re not even completely in?” she whimpered. “You’re telling me there is <em>more</em>?”</p><p>Rio pulled her in for a soft kiss, holding her wait very firmly so she wouldn’t go more into Agatha. “It’s okay if you want to stop, we can--”</p><p>“Don’t you fucking dare stop,” Agatha growled. “It’s so big baby, you have such a fucking big cock. It’s filling me <em>so</em> well.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost rolled into her skull at those words. “Agatha,” she panted, “Do you want me to go all the way in?”</p><p>“Ye-- Yeah,” Agatha choked out.</p><p>Rio thrust into her, slower than she had been with her hands but powerfully nonetheless. Agatha saw stars.</p><p>
<em>Real stars.</em>
</p><p>The kinds that made <em>galaxies</em>. The kinds that lived and died so beautifully people wrote sonnets about them. For a moment there, she was a cosmic being, above life and death and the universe.</p><p>Because the tip of the dildo was hitting her in the right fucking spot. And Agatha lost all sense of the world.</p><p>Before she could even understand what she was doing, Agatha thrust into Rio deeper and deeper feeling the sensation of her cock pushing into the spot, the fucking spot, the magical fucking spot, Rio’s hands found her tits, pulling, twisting, torturing her nipples as Agatha canted into Rio, quickening her pace, slamming into Rio again and again, cries, whimpers, moans escaping her mouth but Agatha didn’t even realize she was making them.</p><p>There was nothing in her mind, nothing except how fucking full of Rio her pussy was, and how deep her cock was and how the hell had Agatha <em>never done this before?</em></p><p>Rio grabbed her stomach and pulled her closer, arm tight around her waist, raising Agatha to the tips of her toes and ramming into her as Agatha fell apart over the cock, pulsing, shaking, convulsing as she came all over Rio, white-hot pleasure ripping through her, consuming her, her cunt clenching around Rio’s cock, her cum dripping down the length of the dildo and both their legs.</p><p>Agatha tried to stand on the balls of her feet but Rio raised one of her legs and plopped it on the sink, angling herself so she could have better access to Agatha’s pussy and before she could even fully recover, Agatha was being railed against the bathroom sink. She leaned down, nipples rubbing against the cold marble of the bathroom sink, faucet dangerously close to her head, loud, filthy sounds filling the room.</p><p>“You like that, huh?” Rio was saying in the background, voice slightly muffled. “You like being my filthy whore?”</p><p>Rio was pounding into Agatha so fully that Agatha could feel the start of the harness Rio was wearing rub up into her with every thrust.</p><p>“Baby, I’m fucking losing it, I’m going to come again, I’m going to-- <em>Papiii</em>,” Agatha cried out as another powerful flood of pleasure overtook her, blinding her momentarily, as Rio stood calmly, still buried deep within her.</p><p>But Rio was not calm, no. She grabbed Agatha's hair and yanked it back and Agatha saw the fire burning in her eyes. “What did you call me?”</p><p>Agatha had no idea what she was talking about. She wasn’t even sure she used words until now.</p><p>“Say it again,” Rio demanded, pulling her hair harder. “Say it.”</p><p>“<em>Papi</em>,” she cried.</p><p>
<em>Agatha had no idea where that word ripped out of, she swears!</em>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Rio growled, pulling out of Agatha and flipping her over, lifting her so she could sit on the space between the two sinks. “You are taking me so well,” Rio murmured, kissing Agatha deeply. “You’re being such a good girl.”</p><p>“No, no,” Agatha drawled, “I’m fucking filthy. I’m horrible. You need to fuck it out of me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened again. “You’re my little bitch, aren’t you,” Rio teased, using the tip of the dildo to flick Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“I am,” Agatha moaned.</p><p>“You’re in fucking heat, rutting about, trying to get railed, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Y--Yeah,” Agatha whimpered.</p><p>Rio slapped her pussy, hard. Agatha’s eyes rolled back into her head. “Who’s pussy is this?”</p><p>“Yours, yours,” Agatha chanted.</p><p>Rio fingered her clit and sunk her mouth into Agatha’s wet core. Agatha grabbed her hair, and pushed her face further in, “Fuck, yes, you wanted to taste me, huh?”</p><p>“I did,” Rio said into her pussy, vibrations rumbling through her. “Fuck, you taste so good.”</p><p>Rio pressed down on her clit, using her tongue to chase it around, circling, hunting, trapping the little bead until Agatha came all over her face, slumping against the bathroom mirror, almost going limp.</p><p>But was Rio done? No.</p><p>She shoved her cock into Agatha again, thrusting heavily into her, rolling her hips. Agatha looked up and saw, for the first time, how she was affecting Rio, eyes hooded, mouth ajar, breaths uneven as she slammed into Agatha deeper and deeper like she wanted to split her down the middle.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t tell you where the last three orgasms she had started and ended, but looking at Rio look so fucking affected, so fucking destroyed, she felt such a powerful wave engulf her she did, in fact, black out, white spots in her hazy vision, Rio also coming in the distance, collapsing over her, dick still inside.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio mewled. “Fuck, that was incredible.”</p><p>
<em>Agatha didn’t know what words were.</em>
</p><p>Her mouth was only capable of producing filthy cries and deep moans and whimpers. She was beyond fucked, she was so desperately ruined that she would never be the same again.</p><p>Rio was still quivering over Agatha, both their cum mixing as Rio slowly removed the dildo from Agatha.</p><p>
<em>How the fuck was Agatha supposed to move on from this? </em>
</p><p>Like she hadn’t just had her world rocked, no, she had had her world destroyed and stitched back together. Like Rio was an immortal, cosmic being, harbinger of life and death. She fucking took and demanded and forced and gave and gave and gave.</p><p>She was imagining Rio with a crown and a scythe. She was still kind of seeing white spots in her vision. She felt like she was on a cloud. She felt empty.</p><p>“Baby, do you want to go back to the shower?” Agatha heard Rio say, but she couldn’t really move.</p><p>Agatha had never thought sex could be this good. Or <em>fun</em>. Or <em>equal</em>.</p><p>She had always had to give in sex, shaping herself into whatever the other person wanted, into a dominant, hard person, and don’t get her wrong, she enjoyed that side, but this was the <em>first</em> fucking time in thirty years of her existence that someone was wiling to give her everything, ask for nothing, fill her needs, take over control, so for a little bit, she could just follow instead of always having to fight.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio called out, voice now laced with concern. “Baby, are you okay?”</p><p>
<em>Agatha swore she was immortal now, some kind of celestial spirit. Agatha swore she was dead. Either way, she was definitely not a human being.</em>
</p><p>“Agatha, you’re scaring me,” Rio was now above her, gently cupping her face, trying to make sure everything was okay.</p><p>“I will never be the same again,” Agatha whispered out. “I don’t know how to be <em>normal</em> now.”</p><p>Rio’s face broke into a large grin. “Shit, I got so scared.” She lifted Agatha from her place between the sinks and carried her into the shower, setting her softly on the stone bench in it.</p><p>“Let me take care of you, my love,” Rio said. “It’s the least I can do.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio turned on the water, gently bringing her in and lathering shampoo in her hair.</p><p>“That was a life changing experience, my love,” Agatha whispered as Rio ran her fingers through her hair.</p><p>Rio giggled into her shoulder, wrapping her arms around her waist. “I had a feeling you would like it.”</p><p>“Fuck, I am so happy I got to do that with you, though. With someone I love and trust and I will get to do this with again and again,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>Rio pulled her closer, burying her face in her neck. “I love you, <em>mi amor</em>. I can’t believe I get to spend forever with you.”</p><p>They languidly showered, washing each other’s hair, peppering kisses and dueting love songs and giggling uncontrollably at the thought that they could do this forever.</p><p>When they got out, both in matching silk robes, Agatha’s black and purple, Rio’s green and brown, both in bunny slippers, they made their way to the kitchen, hunger quickly catching up to them.</p><p>“What would you like to eat?” Agatha asked, looking through their fridge.</p><p>Before Rio could respond, they heard two loud knocks on the door.</p><p>“Were we expecting someone?” Rio asked. Agatha shook her head slowly.</p><p>Rio looked through the peephole, “Oh <em>fuck</em>.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Rio opened the door and let Wanda and Nat in. “Are you guys ready for Alice’s-- why are both of you in robes?”</p><p>“Oh, fuck, Alice’s birthday,” Agatha froze, horrified that they forgot. Also, it was just like two in the afternoon an hour ago?</p><p>Nat waved a finger between them. “Rio, why does Agatha looked like she got fucking mauled?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her reflection in the shiny fridge, making out some very angry purple bruises that littered the front of her chest and her neck, going all the way up to her jaw.</p><p>“Rio!” she chided, pulling the robe closer.</p><p>Rio’s face was twisted between a smirk and a grimace.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Wanda said, eyes wide. “You two finally had sex.”</p><p>Nat crossed her arms. “Aren’t you two <em>not</em> supposed to have sex for another two weeks?”</p><p>Rio rubbed the back of her head. “Uh, Agatha got cleared this morning by the doctors.”</p><p>Nat sighed. “And you two fucked like rabbits all day. Okay, I am starting to understand what just happened here.”</p><p>“We can let the rest of them know that you guys are running late,” Wanda said, pulling out her phone. “Do you still want to carpool? Should we wait?”</p><p>“No, it’s okay,” Agatha said, moving towards their bedroom. “We can Uber and be there in twenty minutes.”</p><p>“See you both there,” Nat called out as Rio closed the door.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha said, when Rio walked in, staring at herself in the mirror.</p><p>“I know, I know,” Rio blushed. “I went a little crazy with the hickeys. I won’t--”</p><p>“That’s the least of our problems, Rio.” Agatha said, finding her eyes in the mirror. “I don’t know how to be normal about this. I don’t think I can be a person right now.”</p><p>“Still?” Rio said, eyes wide. A smirk grew on her face.</p><p>“You’re going to be unbearable tonight aren’t you?” Agatha sighed.</p><p>Rio’s shit eating grin was all the response she needed.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal would like the jury to know that she did not mean to break her girlfriend.</p><p>It was truly and honestly a series of unfortunate coincidences.</p><p>Some facts to establish the scene leading up to the charge committed by the defendant:</p><p>1. Rio Vidal had, single-handedly and with full mental and physical faculty, introduced Agatha Harkness to God’s most mighty and fine invention: <em>the dildo</em>.</p><p>2. Rio Vidal had, single-handedly and with full mental and physical faculty, introduced Agatha Harkness to the very delicate and wonderful experience of being a bottom.</p><p>3. Rio Vidal had, with some help from the dildo and retaining full faculties, fucked Agatha Harkness into receiving more orgasms than she had probably ever had in her life.</p><p>And, if she could say so herself, Rio Vidal <em>did</em> fuck Agatha Harkness into oblivion. <em>(Author would like the jury to know that this was said with the most amount of smugness recorded anywhere in the world that entire year.)</em></p><p>But it did not stop there. It would have been totally fine if it stopped there.</p><p>But god forbid Rio ever do anything in healthy, manageable doses.</p><p>
<em>Unfortunate Circumstance #1: The Dress</em>
</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha had somehow pulled herself together enough to throw on a black sleeveless top and a patterned scarf that hid all the damage Rio inflicted to her neck and chest. She paired it with loose black dress pants, gold accessories and kept on her glasses, the last part was specifically to tease Rio.</p><p>Rio knows that because Agatha tilted them down seductively and winked before she walked out of their room.</p><p>In Rio’s defense, Agatha had clearly done something to tease Rio first.</p><p>So, when, while trying to choose between a green and black overshirt to go with her black tank, Rio accidentally pulled out the brown strapless dress she enjoyed wearing to parties in college, she was very tempted to try it on, if only for the reason to tease Agatha back.</p><p>Not in Rio’s defense, you can’t compare a molehill to a volcano.</p><p>Because this was the same brown dress that had triggered Agatha into being non-verbal for half an hour ten years ago. <em>(Not that Rio would know, the daft idiot.)</em></p><p>The one that was just tight enough to show the curve of Rio’s breasts, now larger than they were in college, but just like before, her erect nipples poked through the thin fabric. Yet, she had gained a lot more muscle since college, legs now more toned, arms sinewy, even her ass seemed to be far more sculpted. She chose to do a simple makeup look instead of the darker smokey one she had loved to do before, only keeping the heavy eyeliner on her lower lid and a swipe of brown gloss on her lips. Her hair was loose and casual, still wet from washing it earlier, and her cheeks still red from the events that finished barely thirty minutes before.</p><p>These changes made it look a lot less like the dress was meant to tease and a lot more like it was meant to kill.</p><p>Agatha did not stand one fucking chance.</p><p>Her eyes widened and she stood there, phone in hand, mouth opening and closing, looking like someone had strapped electrodes on her brain and tried repeatedly to jump start her like a car.</p><p>
<em>Author can confirm her brain short-circuited more times within a thirty second span than in recorded human history.</em>
</p><p>
<em>In hindsight, medics should have been called at this moment.</em>
</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks light up under Agatha’s gaze, not realizing how close to death her girlfriend actually was.</p><p>“No,” Agatha finally choked out. “You have to change.”</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed at the rejection right as the Uber notification chimed on Agatha’s phone. She stared at her phone and then at Rio, rapidly swinging her head until she finally sighed and stomped into her bedroom.</p><p>“Are we still going?” Rio called out, something close to tears bubbling in her throat.</p><p>“I forgot something,” Agatha appeared moments later, a stylish bag in her hand, tucking her shirt into her pants. She stormed by Rio and slammed open the door, not waiting for Rio to follow.</p><p>
<em>Unfortunate Circumstance #2: The Curb</em>
</p><p>The car ride was interesting.</p><p>Rio thought Agatha was mad at her. She did not look at, talk to or touch Rio, not even a casual brush or snarky comment.</p><p>Agatha was internally (and externally) hyperventilating. If Rio looked at her through those long lashes, touched her in <em>that</em> dress or even said one word, Agatha was one hundred percent going to combust. And honestly, her Uber rating <em>could not</em> handle that right now.</p><p>Rio tried touching her on the knee to comfort her.</p><p>Agatha yelped and jumped as far as the car would take her, squeezing her face in the mirror as if she was a dog trying to stick her head out of the window.</p><p>Rio tried not to take that as another rejection, letting out an awkward laugh, feeling unsure of herself for the first time since they had sex.</p><p>“Agatha, are we okay?” she asked, looking at her twitching thumbs, shoulders downturned. “I know I get a little… <em>excited</em> during sex, but I can stop with the dirty talk—”</p><p>“I need you to shut up,” Agatha growled.</p><p>Rio stared at her in disbelief.</p><p>The Uber chose this very moment to pull up to the bar. Agatha all but bolted out of the car, slamming the door as she tried to make it the <em>four feet</em> to the bar’s entrance without any incidents.</p><p>Rio followed her, mind whirling in confusion, trying to figure out what the hell was up with her girlfriend, why she was walking so weird, why she was acting so weird?</p><p>Agatha stumbled over the curb. Rio caught her, obviously.</p><p>And shit hit the fan.</p><p>Agatha Harkness, the very, <em>very</em> attractive, confident, grab-you-by-the-balls woman that she was, turned into a steaming hot mess.</p><p>“I can’t do this, baby,” she whined into her neck, her body becoming so limp that Rio had to grab her with both hands and have her lean on Rio’s front for support.</p><p>“Can’t do what?” Rio asked, worried about what Agatha was going to say next.</p><p>
<em>Did she not want them to have sex anymore?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Did she not want them to be together anymore?</em>
</p><p>Agatha buried her face in Rio’s neck and let out a whine. “I don’t know how to be normal about this, okay, I literally do not feel like a <em>person</em> anymore. I feel like a ghost or a spirit that doesn’t have a physical body. And you look so hot and I can’t fuck you because I can’t feel my toes yet. Why can’t I feel my toes?”</p><p>Rio bit her bottom lip in an attempt to not burst out laughing. She tightened her hold on Agatha’s waist bringing up a hand to brush away her hair and cup her cheek. “My love, do you want to go home?”</p><p>“We can’t,” Agatha pouted. “Jen and Alice won’t let me hear the end of it. They already think I am whipped.”</p><p>Rio failed to keep her laugh in, a chuckle rippling out of her. “Well, if the shoe fits,” she teased.</p><p>Agatha didn’t get outraged like Rio expected her to, instead, she shrunk into Rio’s neck further, babbling incoherently about her body being akin to jelly and how she would fall apart if Rio let go.</p><p>Rio just bit on her bottom lip and tried not to let it get to her head (which was a far more Herculean task then one would normally expect).</p><p>After five minutes of this, Rio steered herself and her little parasite into the bar, Agatha’s face still buried in Rio’s neck, and found their friends.</p><p>“Oh look, what do we have here?” Jen smirked when she laid eyes on them, their friends hooting and whistling behind her.</p><p>“Wanda and Nat told us about your little ‘escapade’ today,” Alice giggled, clearly already drunk.</p><p>Agatha groaned, clinging to Rio further.</p><p>“She’s going through something,” Rio said, gesturing to Agatha, while pressing her lips shut to keep from laughing.</p><p>Rio watched all of Jen’s ‘Agatha’ alarms beep all at once.</p><p>“Everything okay?” Jen asked, wanting to see if her friend was okay before launching into the merciless teasing.</p><p>Agatha muttered something incoherently.</p><p>“What did you say?” Jen questioned, and Rio pulled back a little so Agatha’s words were less muffled.</p><p>“I got my shit rocked.”</p><p>Chaos descended on their table at once— Jen’s jaw finding the floor, Alice banging her head repeatedly on the table in laughter, Lilia choking on her drink, Wanda and Nat almost on the floor.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t done. “Did you know that strap-ons were so <em>good</em>?” she asked no one in particular.</p><p>Rio suppressed another laugh and rubbed her back. “Yes, baby. I am sure we all did.”</p><p>“Did you get the existential crisis too? Cause I feel like jelly and like the world around me is different but the same and I don’t know why humans talk or go to work when they could just spend all day fucking in bed.”</p><p>The table proceeded to lose it further.</p><p>“Let me get this right,” Jen said between laughs. “You got railed for the first time in your life and now you're latched onto your girlfriend like you’re a knight and she is the Holy Grail and you’re having an existential crisis?”</p><p>Agatha nodded into Rio’s neck. This time, Rio broke, throwing her head back and laughing.</p><p>“Et tu, <em>Brute</em>?” Agatha mumbled into her neck.</p><p>Rio kissed the top of her head in an apology.</p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha. I can’t believe you’re acting like this. I would have never pegged Agatha I’m-the Top Harkness to be such a <em>bottom</em>,” Wanda teased.</p><p>Rio froze at those words, realizing the weight of why this was such a big deal for Agatha. Words like these can wound deep, especially for switches who are scared to explore a different side.</p><p>She realized then that Agatha had never had this before, the safety of being under someone who she trusted’s control, the space to explore her desires openly and without judgement.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to shut Wanda up, but Agatha beat her to it, loosening her hold on Rio and turning around, still firmly in Rio’s arms. “Wanda, I had more orgasms today than in our entire year and a half long relationship, so if I was you, I would shut up.”</p><p>Wanda stared at her in shock, mouth hanging open. Nat rubbed her back in an attempt to comfort her, but didn’t seem to hold any ill will towards Agatha or her comment. Everyone else broke further, with Alice laughing so hard that her face went red and she forgot to breathe.</p><p>Agatha seemed to calm down after that exchange, but continued to hold the title of simpering mess for the rest of the evening.</p><p>Which brings us to the following:</p><p>
<em>Unfortunate Circumstance #3: The Drink</em>
</p><p>After about thirty minutes, Rio finally managed to untangle herself from Agatha to go order them both a drink.</p><p>This should not have been as sacrilegious as it was, but with all the pouting and shooting of dramatic, destitute looks, as if Rio had <em>personally</em> shot her dog and drove over her foot, Rio knew that somehow, on Agatha’s scale, she had royally messed up.</p><p>The bartender seemed to notice too, leaning over the bar to ask, “Is that woman your girlfriend or is she just really down bad?”</p><p>Rio giggled. “Both.”</p><p>The bartender let out a low laugh. “You’re a lucky girl.”</p><p>Rio turned around to look at the woman, who had short blonde hair and was covered in a pathwork of tattoos. “I know,” she said, her mouth bursting into the biggest smile. “She’s the love of my life.”</p><p>Rio turned back to look at Agatha to see if the pouting and whining had dampened, but she found Agatha seething and shooting daggers at them instead.</p><p>“Uh oh,” Rio whispered, “I would go to the other end of the bar <em>right now</em> if I were you and cared about the safety of my life.”</p><p>The bartender’s brow furrowed in confusion, following Rio’s gaze and sighing, “Possessive?”</p><p>“Very.”</p><p>“I’m going to have Juno hand you your drinks,” the woman said, chuckling softly.</p><p>"Good call," Rio laughed as her phone buzzed with a text.</p><p>
<em>Alice [9:57 PM]: agatha is plotting the bartender’s murder.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice [9:57 PM]: thought u should know. </em>
</p><p>Rio shook her head and typed back a response.</p><p>
<em>Rio [9:58 PM]: tell her i am coming back and will spend the rest of the night attached to her like a leech.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice [9:59 PM]: ew, no. not gonna tell her that. </em>
</p><p>Moments later, someone left two drinks behind her and she grabbed them, slipping a ten in the tip jar and flashing the bartender an apologetic smile.</p><p>She carefully walked her way back with the drinks, setting the cocktail in front of Agatha while taking a sip of her beer.</p><p>“So, the fact that you had mind-blowing sex means Agatha got cleared… I hope?” Lilia asked, trying to steer the conversation away from any mention of the jealousy radiating off Agatha like the stink lines in an old-school cartoon.</p><p>“Yes, she is all cleared, thanks in part to her very loving girlfriend who took care of her like she was an injured soldier and <em>only has eyes for her</em>, ” Rio said, leaning in to kiss Agatha on the cheek. Agatha kept pouting, but accepted the peace offering, nonetheless.</p><p>“So, Alice, are you having a good birthday,” Rio asked, in her own attempt at deflection.</p><p>Alice nodded eagerly. “I can’t believe I’m thirty, guys. I have like so much more I want to do.”</p><p>“Like what?” Jen asked, leaning with a practiced nonchalance that Rio immediately clocked as <em>desperate crush</em>.</p><p>“Like I don’t know, I want to go sky-diving and swim in a lake and I honestly thought I would be in a relationship by now, you know, like you two,” Alice said, pointing to Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“We just got into a relationship, Alice. Like barely a month ago,” Agatha said, reaching out to squeeze her arm. “You will find your Rio, too.”</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled at the statement and she had to cough back tears. Agatha returned to her arms and Rio placed soft kisses to the top of her head.</p><p>Alice sighed dreamily. “See, that. I want that,” she said, folding into the table, head perched on her arm, sighing deeply.</p><p>“And I think you’re done for the night,” Jen said from next to her, hopping off the bar stool. “I’m going to close out her tab.”</p><p>As Rio saw Jen’s retreating figure, she saw a moment of opportunity.</p><p>
<em>Rio [10:23 PM]: alice, you should go talk to the bartender</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice [10:23 PM]: what?? why?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio [10:23 PM]: its gonna make jen jealous</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice [10:23 PM]: why would jen get jealous if i talked to someone</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio [10:24 PM]: why would u get jealous if jen talked to someone?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice [10:24 PM]: i wouldn’t</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice [10:28 PM]: things have been weird lately</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice [10:28 PM]: jen hasn’t been as touchy</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alice [10:29 PM]: maybe its all in my head</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio [10:30 PM]: well there is a way to find out. if she gets jealous, you'll know</em>
</p><p>Alice drummed her fingers on her lips. “I’m going to go talk to the bartender,” she announced as Jen slipped back in her chair.</p><p>“I just closed out your tab,” Jen said, grabbing her hand. “You don’t need to go up there.”</p><p>“Uh, I just wanted to see if I could get her number,” Alice murmured, pulling her hand out of Jen’s grip.</p><p>Agatha and Lilia whipped their heads up in surprise.</p><p>Jen opened and closed her mouth. “Uh, okay.”</p><p>As Alice turned around, Jen called out. “Alice?”</p><p>Alice looked back, all hopeful and excited. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Her name is Carol.”</p><p>“Oh.” Alice seemed to deflate, slowly walking to the bar and plopping on one of the stools, head in her hands.</p><p>Jen deemed despondent.</p><p>Lilia seemed pissed.</p><p>Rio knew she fucked up.</p><p>“What did you do?” Lilia snapped, just loud enough for Rio and Agatha to hear.</p><p>“I thought I was helping!” Rio squealed, then whispered, “I told Alice that a little jealousy might work in getting Jen.”</p><p>“Oh, shit. That's not good, I told Jen a few days ago to pull back from Alice a little so she would realize that what they have is not entirely friendly,” Agatha whispered from beside her.</p><p>“Both of you, <em>outside</em>,” Lilia hissed.</p><p>Agatha and Rio had the good sense to follow her with the air of chided school-children.</p><p>“Now why in the hell did you two intervene?” Lilia barked. “Do you hate them?”</p><p>Agatha and Rio cowered. “I— We just wanted to help,” Rio said slowly.</p><p>“Why did you think Alice making Jen jealous was a good idea?” Lilia almost screamed.</p><p>“I mean— it worked, for us.”</p><p>Lilia rubbed her face and pushed her hands through her hair. “It almost broke you two. And even then, do you think that Alice and Jen are anything like you?”</p><p>Agatha and Rio looked at each other, and shook their heads.</p><p>“Then why would you think it would work?” Lilia snarled.</p><p>Embarrassment flushed on both their faces.</p><p>Lilia sighed, feeling like they were sufficiently scolded. “Both of you, <em> just stay out of this</em>.”</p><p>They nodded but before they could walk back in, the doors slammed open again and a drunk Alice stumbled out, quickly followed by Jen.</p><p>When Alice noticed that Jen had followed her, she launched her arms around Jen’s neck, sobbing into her shoulder.</p><p>“I swear I didn’t want her number,” she cried. “I wanted yours.”</p><p>A blush graced Jen’s face as she held Alice closer. “You have mine, Alice.”</p><p>“You know what I mean,” she said, looking up at her, both their noses a breath apart.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “You know, Jen.”</p><p>Jen smiled, soft and small. “Let’s go home, Alice. We can talk tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio, Agatha and Lilia watched their friends with the same look of surprise, jaws unhinged, eyes bulging.</p><p>“I take it back,” Lilia said, turning to them as Alice and Jen got into their Uber, almost holding hands. “Please, intervene more.”</p><p>Rio laughed the entire way back into the bar, reveling in her victory, until a man spilled her drink entirely on the front of her dress.</p><p>“Fucking bastard,” Lilia said, bolted after the man, and Rio cussed and looked around to try to find napkins.</p><p>What she found instead was Agatha, eyes dark and mouth watering, looking at Rio as if she was a particularly delicious piece of meat.</p><p>She leaned in slowly and whispered into Rio’s ear. “<em>My turn.</em>”</p><p>And in the case of <em>Rio Vidal vs. the State of New Jersey</em> for the manslaughter of Agatha Harkness, this is where all the unfortunate circumstances and questionable choices come to a head.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness wasn’t a person anymore.</p><p>She’s something closer to a hungry, insatiable immortal monster ready to slaughter anything in her path.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, she was the only thing in Agatha’s path.</p><p>Rio doesn’t know how they made it into the bathroom, all she knows is she was pushed up against the metal door, Agatha’s tongue down her throat, her hands pinned on either side of her head.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha moaned, “This fucking dress, <em>god</em>.”</p><p>“God isn’t my name but I’ll respond to it,” Rio giggled.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s hands and pulled them above her head. With her other hand, she untied the scarf from around her neck and tied Rio’s hands to the coat hook on the door.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Rio groaned. “I love this.”</p><p>Agatha grinned against her neck. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you were a little rope bunny.”</p><p>“<em>Fuckkk</em>, this is really turning me on,” Rio mewled, eyes already hooded as she squirmed against the door.</p><p>Agatha traced her hands over Rio’s core, trailing under her dress to find Rio’s particular underwear choice for the night.</p><p>“You’re not wearing any panties,” Agatha growled, breath hot against her ear.</p><p>Rio’s smug smile came back as she shook her head. “Never did then, either.”</p><p>Agatha snarled, grabbed her hips and pushing her knee between her legs. Rio hissed at the contact, rough and harsh and straight on her clit.</p><p>Agatha pulled her strapless dress down, burying her face in Rio’s perky tits.</p><p>“You haven’t been wearing anything under this all night?” Agatha groaned into her breasts.</p><p>“You wanted to— <em>Fuck</em>,” Rio moaned as Agatha opened her legs and positioned Rio’s core towards the middle of her pants. “Agatha, are you <em>packing</em>?”</p><p>Agatha grinned wickedly. “You’re not the only one with a surprise today,” she said, pushing Rio onto her bulge further.</p><p>“How did you— Fuck, baby, <em>how did I not notice</em>,” Rio whined, grinding into the bulge with new vigor. Quite an achievement with her tied hands.</p><p>“Loose dress pants,” Agatha said smugly in her ear, hands pulling Rio’s legs around her waist, fingers dipping into her muscle, holding her in place. “Here I was thinking I would have to give you an orgasm or two, but you’re going to come untouched, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio <em>really</em> was. She could feel the heat growing in her stomach, clit rubbing furiously over the button on Agatha’s pants, her hands pinching her nipples too hard. Agatha leaned in then, pulling Rio’s breast into her mouth, suckling hard. Rio felt her eyes roll over.</p><p>Rio was <em>so</em> close.</p><p>“Are you going to come for Daddy?” Agatha whispered, tongue still circling the pebbled nipple, looking up at Rio through those damn glasses.</p><p>And Rio came so hard all over Agatha’s fancy pants. So easily, it would be embarrassing if she wasn’t so <em>tied</em> up.</p><p>“You ruined my pants,” Agatha tutted, pulling back a little but keeping her hold on Rio’s convulsing thighs strong. “Such a bad, <em>bad</em> girl. How <em>ever</em> are you going to make up for it?”</p><p>“However you want, Daddy,” Rio chanted. “Fuck me. Use me. Do whatever you want with me.”</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly at Rio’s words. “You’re going to regret that, baby.”</p><p>“Is that a challenge?” Rio smirked.</p><p>“No, my love, it’s a fucking <em>promise</em>.” Agatha grinned, sinking to her knees in the dirty bar bathroom stall and shoving her tongue into Rio.</p><p>Rio hissed and bucked forward, hands grabbing the top of the door she was tied to to keep her upright as Agatha burrowed into her further, licking the bundle of nerves right above to Rio’s entrance, nose rubbing against her clit. Rio leaned back, going on her toes as another orgasm tore through her, white-hot and powerful, biting on her tongue to keep from screaming.</p><p>Agatha threw Rio’s legs over her shoulders, sticking and pulling her tongue in her pussy repeatedly, and Rio looked down only to be ruined more.</p><p>Because Agatha looked fucking <em>delicious</em> with those large glasses, deep in Rio’s pussy, staring up at her like she would like to die this way, nose and mouth deep in her, no space for air.</p><p>Rio felt the third orgasm crash into her barely fifteen minutes in, building off the ebb of the previous two, sending a filthy, loud scream through the bathroom.</p><p>Before she could say anything, dirty or not, Agatha’s hand was clasped over her mouth, hard and firm, and her dick was positioned over her entrance.</p><p>“You’re too loud,” Agatha taunted. “Loud girls don’t get a good dicking down.”</p><p>Rio squirmed under Agatha’s hold.</p><p>“Will you be quiet for me?” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>“Do you want me to put it in?” Agatha teased her entrance with the tip of her cock.</p><p>“More than anything,” Rio moaned through her fingers. “Please, please put your cock in me.”</p><p>Agatha thrust into her, no lube, no warning, but Rio was wet enough that she was convinced she would absorb the entire thing.</p><p>Her walls opened so easily to take Agatha’s length. It wasn’t that wide, but fuck, it was so long. It hit the jackpot within seconds, and Rio closed her eyes, head tipping back as Agatha pounded into her like her fucking life depending on it.</p><p>“Fuck, my little whore,” Agatha mewled into her ear, seeming close to her own orgasm, “You such a <em>handsome boy</em>, aren’t you?”</p><p>Something about being called a handsome boy while being tied up and railed into oblivion did something to Rio’s brain chemistry.</p><p>Something that altered it <em>irrevocably</em>.</p><p>The pleasure that consumed her in that moment was unlike any orgasm she had had before, no, it was a different level of carnal, the one that was up there with eternal.</p><p>It made Rio want to murder and steal and commit any number of crimes for the chance to do this again and again and again.</p><p>It filled a part of Rio that she had always kept hidden in the frozen realm of her mind, the hungry part that wanted to be pushed, prodded, forced into submission.</p><p>And now that she was here, it felt like nothing she could even explain the sensation.</p><p>It felt like entering a world where everything was magical, where everything held the undercurrent of congeniality and hope and possibility. It felt like the future, it felt like the past, it felt like everything that is and was.</p><p>Rio never deemed herself a poet, but in this moment, all she needed was a pen and a notepad and she was ready to gift the world untenable sonnets.</p><p>When she thought she had reached the pinnacle of the world, she opened her eyes and realized she wasn’t even halfway to the summit. Because before her was the most beautiful sight she had ever seen— Agatha with her eyes twisted in pleasure, lips bruised, tongue peeking out from the corner of her mouth, equally focused in concentration and lost in the pleasure of it all.</p><p>Rio could tell she was close from her breathing alone, and the feeling of Agatha coming in her, legs shaking, chest heaving, moans loud and lewd in the air thrust Rio into another orgasm, so consuming, so powerful.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, adoring comments on the edge of her tongue, when Agatha flipped her around, arms crossing over each other, still tied over her head, and pushed her against the metal door. Rio canted into her girlfriend, who was already inside her again,  with a long moan as Agatha began thrusting relentlessly. Agatha pulled Rio’s hair, earning a heated hiss, and pushed her head closer, taking her mouth into a kiss.</p><p>“You’re taking Daddy so well,” Agatha said filthy into her ear, “such a <em>pretty boy</em>,” as Rio’s world turned blurry, another orgasm pushing through, engulfing, submerging, immersing her entirely.</p><p>She swore Agatha was a God then, doused in some kind of ethereal glow, white, tinged with purple on the ends, her messy hair her crown, and Rio her royal subject.</p><p>In another world, Rio had the power to rip the shreds of the universe for Agatha. In that world, she burned it down until there was nothing except the charred remains and time that existed languidly, only for them.</p><p>Agatha thrust deeper now, like she was trying to bruise Rio’s cervix, trying to get Rio’s walls to convulse so hard and fast that they rip out of her all together. She raised Rio's leg, hooking it over her waist as she pummeled further into her, hitting it perfectly again and again and again.</p><p>“<em>Fuckkkkk</em>,” Rio screamed, head pressed into the cold metal of the door, arms shaking, body shaking, fuck, her mind shaking at the seventh orgasm in a row Agatha had pulled out of her.</p><p>But Agatha was nowhere close to stopping.</p><p>“Fuck, baby, knife, <em>knife</em>,” Rio panted. Agatha immediately pulled out, untying Rio’s hands quickly and holding her face, eyes searching for signs of distress.</p><p>“Are you okay?” she whispered into Rio’s forehead, but Rio couldn’t speak, not now, not when she was coming down from like seventeen hundred orgasms.</p><p>“Baby, do you want me to go?” Agatha asked, voice a bit louder this time.</p><p>“No,” Rio croaked out, pulling her into a loving embrace and snuggling deeper into Agatha’s arms. “I couldn’t take another orgasm… you are… need a minute… or an hour.”</p><p>Agatha sighed in relief, kissing the top of Rio’s head. “I’m sorry, baby. I will give you a lot more room between them next time.”</p><p>Rio nodded into her chest. “You’re like a machine. Unstoppable,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha smiled into her hair. “Want to go home and eat greasy pizza in bed, <em>mi amor</em>?”</p><p>“Yes, please.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness was close to tears.</p><p>She had planned it out perfectly.</p><p>She had the best window. Rio was away at her driving lesson this morning and she had a full two and a half hours to figure this out.</p><p>Enough time, right?</p><p>
<em>Wrong.</em>
</p><p>Why did no one warn her ring shopping was going to be <em>hard</em>?</p><p>Like <em>soul-crushingly</em> hard?</p><p>She couldn’t decide on whether the band should be gold (matched Rio’s undertones) or silver (matched the one-of-a-kind dagger she bought at the renaissance fair). She got crazy for a minute and threw in rose gold too (that was just a moment of weakness, more than anything).</p><p>Then, she couldn’t decide if it should have a stone or not. If yes, how big? Two carats? Three? Should that stone be a diamond, or sapphire, or emerald, or ruby, or <em>why were there so many fucking options?</em></p><p>Don’t get her wrong, she knew her girlfriend enough to know what she would like in an engagement ring. Something simple yet beautiful. Elegant yet practical. This, she knew.</p><p>In fact, she had found <em>a lot</em> of rings she knew Rio would fawn over on other people.</p><p>There was a princess cut black diamond set within an arrangement of many smaller diamonds with a white gold band that Agatha briefly stared at for a while before deciding it was too elaborate for Rio to wear everyday and she really did not want a wedding ring that would end up sitting in a safe half the year.</p><p>There was a gold ring with half-carat diamonds lining the entire circumference in small intervals. That seemed like a good middle until she realized it was far too… <em>bling-y</em> for Rio’s taste.</p><p>There were three diamond rings that could pass as pretty engagement rings.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t want Rio to just like the ring.</p><p>She wanted Rio to love it.</p><p>She now understood why all those girls on TikTok sent pictures of themselves with their preferred ring in the background, all pulled up, ready for purchase.</p><p>She needed one of those pictures, right now.</p><p>Actually, what she needed was someone’s opinion. She dialed a trusted number.</p><p>“Hello, Baby?” Rio’s voice came through.</p><p>Fuck, can’t be Rio.</p><p>“Uh, sorry, called by accident,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Rio’s voice crackled through her phone.</p><p>“Yup, everything is great,” Agatha bit her lip.</p><p>“Cool, see you at brunch.”</p><p>“Brunch?” Agatha choked, thoughts already left her brain when she looked at the last ring.</p><p>“In an hour… Baby, are you <em>sure</em> you’re okay?”</p><p>Agatha hung up.</p><p>
<em>Motherfucking hell.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Brunch.</em>
</p><p>She only had an hour.</p><p>She needed the big guns.</p><p>“Jen, I need you to drop everything and come to me, right now?” Agatha pleaded when Jen picked up.</p><p>“Hello, to you, too, Agatha,” Jen drawled. “I am actually busy—”</p><p>“I’m buying Rio a ring.”</p><p>Jen was quiet for a second. “Say that again.”</p><p>“I’m buying Rio a ring and I really, <em>really</em> need help.”</p><p>“I’ll be there in ten.”</p><p>Jen found Agatha dramatically sprawled over one of the display cases, forehead pressed to the glass, sighing dramatically.</p><p>“Okay, okay, what is going on?” Jen said, rubbing Agatha’s back in an attempt to soothe someone very clearly hanging by a withering thread and a jewelry store was absolutely not the place to snap and lose all sense of sanity.</p><p>Or maybe, it was.</p><p>“I can’t find <em>her</em> ring,” Agatha whined.</p><p>“Do you have any options yet?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head furiously. “Nothing even comes close, Jen.”</p><p>“Okay, deep breaths. You know her better than anyone does. Close your eyes and think, what would Rio want?”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>She could see Rio with an elaborate emerald ring, watching it glint off her finger as she patted Agatha's arm at their child’s graduation. But she could also see her with a simple gold band while making pancakes on lazy mornings or grabbing a backpack during school drop off in the morning.</p><p>She thread her hands through her hair.</p><p>“I’m literally losing my mind, Jen. I want to get her the prettiest, most elaborate emerald ring I can but I also want to get her a simple gold band and I don’t know what way to go… <em>what?</em>”</p><p>“Agatha, you can obviously have both. An engagement ring and wedding band is very common, you know that.” Jen tipped her head, “What is <em>really</em> going on?”</p><p>Agatha slumped on the display case again.</p><p>“I feel like I am going insane,” she mumbled.</p><p>“About what?” Jen asked, rounding over so they could talk to each other face to face.</p><p>“I love Rio so much, but it feels like we’re moving too fast but also not fast enough. Like I want to be married to her <em>yesterday</em>, I want her to knock me up <em>right now</em>, but also at the same time, I don’t think I am ready for any of it.”</p><p>“You think you’re moving too fast?” Jen asked, voice sympathetic.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “But also not fast enough, if that makes sense.”</p><p>Jen smiled softly. “It makes perfect sense. A very lesbian thing to do.”</p><p>“What? Panic?”</p><p>Jen laughed. “No, U-Haul. Which is what you two did, even before you began dating.”</p><p>“Every lesbian U-Hauls,” Agatha mumbled under her breath.</p><p>“But not every lesbian has severe attachment issues like both of you.”</p><p>“You sure?” Agatha snarked, looking back down when Jen raised her eyebrow.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “It felt right, Jen. It wasn’t hurried or forced. We just fit into each other’s lives so easily.”</p><p>“I don’t doubt that,” Jen reached forward and gently grabbed her hand. “But both your avoidance issues won’t disappear overnight, Agatha. Both of you don’t do well with conflict <em>or</em> rejection. Just because you finally admitted you both love each other won’t really make all the other stuff go away.”</p><p>Agatha traced a pattern on the glass as she considered Jen’s words. “I know you’re right, but I don’t know what to do about it. Rio and I, we really haven’t had any issues with communication, yet. She’s been perfect. <em>Too</em> perfect. I’m just worried it’ll all break soon. I’m worried I will buy this ring and two days later I will be standing on the curb, all alone and heartbroken.”</p><p>Jen squeezed her hand. “I think you need to tell Rio that, Agatha. I think you might find that she might feel more similarly than you think.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “Rio? Jen, I know my girlfriend enough to know that she processes things three months after it initially hurts her. That or when there is a gun to her head.”</p><p>Jen softened immediately. “Is that what you think is happening here? You think you’ve put a gun to her head?”</p><p>“I think the accident was the gun,” Agatha whispered, voice still somehow heavy with emotion. “I don’t think we would be together if it wasn’t because of it.”</p><p>“Does Rio know you feel this way?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. Jen pursed her lips.</p><p>“I know. I know I have to talk to her. I just… I just don’t want to be the reason that our perfect little illusion shatters.”</p><p>“It’s not an illusion, babes. Anyone with two eyes can see what you have is <em>real</em>.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, eyes tracing the display case, looking at an emerald ring set with vines creeping on the edges and small diamonds in the shape of leaves. “I think this is her ring, but I can’t bring myself to buy it.”</p><p>“She won’t leave, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s lip trembled. “You don’t know that.”</p><p>“I know Rio. I know that you are half her existence. I know you have been for the last ten years.”</p><p>Agatha let out a wet laugh. “Last ten years, huh?”</p><p>“Talk to her, Agatha. You both need to start talking if you want to make this work forever.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, still eyeing the ring.</p><p>Jen looked at her phone. “We should walk to brunch if we want to get there on time. I think it’s only fifteen minutes away if we walk.”</p><p>Agatha followed her out of the store, still eyeing the ring as they left.</p><p>“They must think we are nuts,” Jen smirked as they left.</p><p>“Speaking of nuts,” Agatha smiled wickedly, “What is happening with you and Alice?”</p><p>Jen choked on air. “How does that have anything to do with nuts?”</p><p>Agatha just smirked. “So, when two people have sex—”</p><p>“Okay, okay, you deserve to be neutered,” Jen said, hands over her ears, blocking Agatha out.</p><p>Agatha pulled her arms down, cackling widely, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Okay, I’m serious now. Tell me, what happened?”</p><p>“Why do you think anything happened?” Jen mumbled.</p><p>“Because you sulked all night and then got in an Uber together.”</p><p>“How did you know that?” Jen jerked her head back in surprise.</p><p>“Secrets,” Agatha smirked. “I know things.”</p><p>“I also know things, Agatha,” Jen narrowed her eyes. “I don’t think you want to play this game with me.”</p><p>“There is literally nothing you can say that will surprise—”</p><p>“You sure, <em>Daddy</em>?”</p><p>Agatha reddened immediately. “What?” she choked out, ears, cheeks, neck everything burning.</p><p>Jen cackled almost manically. “Three separate texts from Lilia, Nat and Wanda about how you two had horrible sex in the bathroom and were so <em>loud</em> you got all of us <em>banned</em> from the bar for eternity.”</p><p>“All of us? When they called they only said it was me and Rio,” Agatha squeaked.</p><p>“So, you admit it!” Jen pointed, catching Agatha red-handed. Well, she was already very red everywhere.</p><p>“We’re never living this down, are we?” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“No, you’re not, <em>Dad-dy</em>,” Jen sing-songed.</p><p>Agatha hid her face in her hands. “I’m gonna kill myself. And Rio. And everyone else.”</p><p>Jen smiled hard. “It’s cute seeing you like this. I’ve only ever seen you hard and snarky. I love seeing you so soft.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks hurt with how hard she was smiling. “This is the first time in my life I feel like I have the happiness I have always craved. This is the first time I think I deserve it.”</p><p>Jen reached over and squeezed her hand. “Good, then make sure you and Rio keep taking all the steps you need to in order to ensure you keep it forever.”</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself. “Now, when you say it like that it makes it sound so easy.”</p><p>“It’s because it literally is,” Jen shook her head. “Just because you two can’t get your head out of your asses and communicate, doesn’t mean that you don’t— <em>what?</em> Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><p>“You’re literally as bad, if not worse, than me,” Agatha said, quite baffled. “Can you just tell me what happened with Alice last night?”</p><p>Jen looked down and mumbled something.</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“We kissed.”</p><p>Agatha stumbled over nothing, quite dramatically.</p><p>“This is why I don’t tell you things,” Jen mumbled, a small smile on her face regardless.</p><p>“You <em>kissed</em>? And then what?” Agatha almost bounced.</p><p>“Calm down. She was drunk, I don’t even think she remembers it. She didn’t say anything this morning,” Jen said, fidgeting with her thumbs.</p><p>“Well, there is one way to find out,” Agatha said as she pushed open the door and led Jen into the brunch place.</p><p>“How?” Jen wondered, following close behind.</p><p>Agatha spotted Rio sitting on a fairly large table alone, scrolling through her phone.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha leaned down and kissed Rio on the cheek. “How many times did Alice call you this morning?”</p><p>“Uh, six?” Rio said as Agatha slipped into the chair below her and Jen sat opposite them.</p><p>“She remembers,” Agatha said to Jen.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked, looking between the two of them. “Baby, what is going on? You’ve been weird all morning.”</p><p>“Later,” Agatha whispered, kissing Rio on the forehead again.</p><p>Alice bounced in then, excitedly greeting Rio and Agatha and Jen, though the last one was a little awkward, tinged with an undercurrent of a shared denial.</p><p>“<em>Soooo</em>,” Agatha began, a little obnoxiously, “How was last night? Anything fun happened?”</p><p>Alice blushed. Jen kicked her under the table. Rio hid a laugh behind a cough.</p><p>Alice cleared her throat. “Uh, we—”</p><p>Rio’s phone rang. She took a glance at it and her smile dropped, body stiffening so viscerally that all three stared at her with concern.</p><p>“Baby, are you okay—”</p><p>“I need to take this, sorry,” Rio said with a tight smile, slipping out of the chair and walking out of the restaurant.</p><p>“Who could that be?” Alice asked, looking back to try to see if she could spot Rio.</p><p>“Excuse me,” Agatha said, throwing her napkin on the table and following Rio’s path, finding her leaning on the wall outside, hand clutching her heart.</p><p>“Yeah, no, what? No, no you can’t. What do you mean?” Rio squeaked.</p><p>“<em>What’s happening?</em>” Agatha mouthed, but Rio just held a finger up.</p><p>“You can’t just do this—” Rio sighed. “Okay, let me ask Agatha. You know Agatha— she’s my girlfriend. No, not— We live together, you know this. Jesus Christ. Fine. I’ll see you.”</p><p>Rio stared at Agatha then, looking haggard, like she had just come home from war.</p><p>“My mother is coming.”</p><p>“<em>Here?</em>” Agatha spluttered.</p><p>Rio nodded. “She’s going to be staying in the guest room.”</p><p>Agatha stared back, mouth slightly agape.</p><p>“But haven’t you not spoken since—”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“And didn’t she promise that—”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly. “I’ll move Scratchy to our room. Should we go back in?”</p><p>Rio groaned into her shoulder. “She landed twenty minutes ago.”</p><p>“<em>What?</em>” Agatha gasped.</p><p>“She’s on her way now.”</p><p>
<em>Motherfucker.</em>
</p><p>“You should drive,” Agatha said, whipping out her phone to text their friends. “We have <em>a lot</em> of cleaning to do.”</p><p>Rio groaned louder. “We’re so fucking screwed.”</p><p>“We will be fine,” Agatha said as Rio broke seven traffic laws getting them back home. “We will be totally okay.”</p><p>
<em>It was more a prayer than a fact.</em>
</p><p>Because Victoria Vidal was something, for sure.</p><p>A hurricane, tornado, <em>black hole</em>.</p><p>Something that sucked all the attention around it, leaving room for nothing else.</p><p>
<em>(Between you and I, they were, most definitely, screwed.)</em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal was hyperventilating.</p><p>She couldn’t seem to catch her breath, it was always running away just as she got close to catching up.</p><p>She couldn’t seem to tamp down her thoughts, wild and rabid, tearing open wounds she was  very sure she had stapled shut.</p><p>Very luckily for her, it didn’t seem to freeze her, no, it seemed to make her a <em>machine</em>.</p><p>She stripped the sheets off the bed, threw on fresh sheets, tucked in the duvet and arranged the million plush throw pillows Agatha had bought at Bed, Bath and Beyond in the same amount of time it took Agatha to place an UberEats order for grocery delivery.</p><p>She scrubbed the bathtub with vigor, attacking the toilet while the bleach rested, and then polished all the taps and showerheads until they shone, cleaning every crevice while Agatha moved Scratchy and his cage to their room.</p><p>When groceries were delivered, she all but grabbed them out of the poor delivery guy’s hands, beginning to arrange them in the fridge even before the door fully closed.</p><p>“I’m beginning to understand why the people in the hospital were scared of you,” Agatha joked when she walked out and watched Rio shove an entire bunch of carrots into an already very full vegetable drawer.</p><p>No response. Rio was focused on winning the war against the freezer.</p><p>A sigh. “Baby, you need to slow down.”</p><p>
<em>Nope.</em>
</p><p>Rio needed to go <em>faster</em>.</p><p>Rio finished shelving the groceries and moved on to their bedroom, stripping their sheets and throwing them in the laundry.</p><p>“Baby, those sheets are clean,” Agatha said, leaning on the door frame as Rio zoomed around the room.</p><p>“Not clean <em>enough</em>,” Rio grumbled, stripping off the mattress topper too, “They still smell like sex.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, “Who’s fault is that?”</p><p><em>Fine</em>, Rio ate her out this morning. She was <em>hungry</em>.</p><p><em>Sue her</em>.</p><p>Rio didn’t acknowledge Agatha’s comment with anything external, choosing instead to tear open a spare pack of sheets they kept on the highest shelf in their closet and start to tuck it into the corners of the mattress. Agatha joined in on the other end, helping Rio in silence.</p><p>Once they were done, Rio moved on to the drawers, rearranging and folding haphazardly thrown in clothes and finally, pulling the drawer with all the fun toys out.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, arms crossed.</p><p>“Hiding the straps,” Rio said casually, putting all of the toys in the appropriate cloth bags, “Can you find me an empty shoebox?”</p><p>“Rio. They’re already in a drawer,” Agatha remarked.</p><p>Rio scoffed and shook her head.</p><p>“Agatha, my mother is going to stick her head in every crevice of this house and unless you’re okay with her finding our toy drawer and all the questions that would come with it, we need to put them all in a box and, just to be safe, <em>burn</em> them.”</p><p>Agatha just stared at her girlfriend, mouth slightly agape. “Baby, come here,” she said, finally, walking over to her and trying to pull her into a hug.</p><p>“I don’t have time for this,” Rio clawed out of her embrace. “I love you and whatever, but we need to finish cleaning.”</p><p>Agatha looked hurt.</p><p>Rio would apologize, <em>later</em>.</p><p>Because in less than five minutes, her mother would be standing in this apartment.</p><p>And Rio was holding a silicone dick.</p><p>“Can you light candles?” Rio asked, running over to their closet and grabbing one of Agatha’s shoeboxes. “It’ll get the smell out.”</p><p>Agatha looked aghast. “Rio, those are expensive shoes, you can’t just…”</p><p>Rio had already removed them, and placed them on the ground with all of their other shoes.</p><p>“I need the box,” Rio said as she began throwing in all the toys, “I’ll return it when—”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said firmly, “No.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ll use another box,” Rio said, doubling back and placing the shoes back in the box with as much care she could at that moment and opening one of her own shoeboxes.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, grabbing her arm. “We’re not doing this… you can’t <em>shut</em> me out.”</p><p>Rio tried not to flinch. It felt like Agatha’s touch was burning her skin.</p><p>Rio pulled out of her hold, head down, kept going. “I’m not shutting you out, Agatha. I’m saving <em>both</em> of us from uncomfortable questions.”</p><p>“Why won’t you look at me?” Agatha all but screamed.</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>
<em>Paused.</em>
</p><p>Looked up at Agatha and then:</p><p>“I know you’re not stupid, Agatha,” Rio scrunched up her face. “So, why are you choosing <em>this</em> moment to pick a fight?”</p><p>“You’ve been ignoring me since you found out your mother was coming,” Agatha wrapped her arms around her middle. “Don’t invalidate my feelings.”</p><p>“I’m not trying to…” Rio sighed, clutching her head. “Look, I'm sorry I haven’t been <em>looking</em> at you, but I have clearly been doing,” she waved her arms around the room, “other things. And, I’m sorry I <em>thought</em> you had a little more <em>faith</em> in our relationship.”</p><p>Agatha’s lip wavered. “That’s not what I’m worried about.”</p><p>Rio shoved the box of sex toys under the bed, pulling the duvet down to hide it.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Rio, I’m trying to talk to you—”</p><p>“Why, Agatha? Why are you choosing <em>now</em>?” Rio snapped. “I don’t have the time for this. I don’t have the space for this. I can’t talk about this <em>right now</em>, so why are you forcing this down my throat?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, eyes shining.</p><p>Rio internally cringed and opened her mouth again with a reluctant apology, when:</p><p>There was a knock on the door.</p><p>Rio froze, locking eyes with Agatha, fear surging through her veins.</p><p>Another knock. More impatient.</p><p>Rio couldn’t move.</p><p>She was stuck, captive, bound to that spot.</p><p>It was happening.</p><p>
<em>She was here.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was going to ruin everything.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was going to show Agatha how broken Rio was. </em>
</p><p>A series of knocks. Very impatient.</p><p>
<em>Rio had to stop this.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Had to stop her.</em>
</p><p>She looked up towards Agatha, emotion coursing through her eyes.</p><p>Agatha snapped into action, rushing over to the door and unlocking it with the best smile on her face.</p><p>“Victoria,” she said in the background while Rio stared at the spot on the floor where her girlfriend stood moments before.</p><p>“Do I have the right apartment?” she heard her mother say. “<em>Rio?</em>”</p><p>Rio’s head whipped up, her mind returning to her body.</p><p>“Hi, mom,” she said, running over and coming up behind Agatha, arm firmly around her waist. “You’ve met Agatha before, haven’t you.”</p><p>“Oh, yes,” Victoria said enthusiastically, pulling Agatha into a big, sweeping hug, “Of course, I remember you. Rio’s <em>best</em> friend, right? You’ve changed so much. Last time I saw you was so much younger. What was it? Almost ten years ago!”</p><p>“Yes, at graduation, how are you—” Agatha said, smiling apprehensively as Victoria pulled away and launched herself at Rio.</p><p>“My baby, my darling, my little girl,” Victoria said, plastering Rio’s face with kisses. “It’s been too long since you last came home.”</p><p>“I was home three months ago,” Rio murmured, but Victoria barged further into their house, dragging Rio along and was now looking around with her hands on her hips.</p><p>“This is such a nice place you have, Rio,” Victoria giggled, letting Rio go so she could prance over to fiddle with the coffee table decor.</p><p>“Thank you, mom,” Rio trailed after her, “It was all <em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>“How sweet of Agatha to decorate <em>your</em> place,” Victoria nodded as she looked out the window, noting their outdoor furniture. “Why do you fake grass on your terrace?”</p><p>Rio wanted to shake her.</p><p>
<em>How typical.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her mom always did this, glazed over everything that was important to Rio. Well, usually until a certain someone was mentioned.</em>
</p><p>Rio felt Agatha come up next to her and she looked her in the eyes, trying to emit a non-verbal apology. Agatha sighed and pulled her in, snaking her arm around her waist and leaving a soft kiss on her temple.</p><p>“We have a rabbit, mom,” Rio said, gaining some courage from Agatha’s presence. “We live together. I know you know this because when I sent this in the family group chat, you sent me four pride flag GIFs. Or was that just because <em>Dad</em> was also in the chat?”</p><p>Victoria whipped around. “Don’t mention him,” she said, plopping down on the couch. “I know you two live together, like <em>roommates</em>—”</p><p>“She’s my girlfriend, mom,” Rio snapped. “If you don’t respect that, there is the door.”</p><p>There was silence as Victoria and Rio stared each other down.</p><p>Rio could feel the nervous energy radiate off Agatha, an un-willing third wheel through it all.</p><p>Finally, Victoria huffed, crossing her arms. “You’re so <em>emotional</em>, Rio. Can’t even make a joke around you. It was supposed to be <em>funny</em>,” Victoria rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You’re not <em>funny</em>, mom.”</p><p>“Agatha thought it was funny, didn’t she?” Victoria smirked.</p><p>
<em>A clear trap. </em>
</p><p>Agatha took a sharp breath in.</p><p><em>Don’t respond. Don’t respond.</em> Rio chanted in her head.</p><p>Agatha coughed, moving to sit in one of the seats adjacent to the couch as she weakly said, “Sure.”</p><p>“<em>See!</em>” Victoria triumphed, smiling contently. Then, she drew back and pointed her finger at Rio, “You’d throw your <em>own</em> mother out on the street?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, unhesitantly.</p><p>She felt Agatha stiffen near her, almost bracing for something.</p><p>Victoria just rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Why are you here, mom?” Rio moved to face her mother on the couch, “What happened?”</p><p>“So, are you two <em>serious</em>?” Victoria asked instead, looking between the two of them, suddenly a protective mother.</p><p>Rio heard Agatha gulp.</p><p>Rio stared at her mother, searching her face. The clear signs that this was all a joke to her, the curve of her lips, the peek of her tongue, they were all missing.</p><p>“We are, mom,” Rio said softly, taking her mother’s hand in her own, willing her to be normal about this. “Agatha is <em>it</em> for me.”</p><p>Victoria gasped, brown hair swaying as she moved her head. “Like marriage, <em>it</em>?”</p><p>Rio looked back and grabbed Agatha’s hand with her own. “Like in every way she’ll have me, <em>it</em>.”</p><p>Agatha smiled back, watery and deep.</p><p>Victoria eyed both of them and tilted her head. “Your father cheated on me,” she proclaimed.</p><p>Agatha gasped.</p><p>“Victoria, I’m so sorry,” she said, but Rio patted her leg, shaking her head slowly.</p><p>“With <em>what</em>, mother?” Rio said calmly. “A real person, this time?”</p><p>Victoria leaned back, clutching her chest dramatically, “Obviously.”</p><p>“Forgive me for questioning. Last time, it was with a cheese grater. And did they have <em>sex</em>?”</p><p>Victoria was suspiciously quiet. “Your father doesn’t love me anymore,” she announced, getting up and pacing the room. “He’s cheating on me, I <em>know</em> it.”</p><p>“You told me you didn't love him, like, when I was <em>six</em>,” Rio muttered, leaning back on the couch, arms crossed. “Why do you <em>care</em>?”</p><p>“That’s not the point,” Victoria said, threading her hands through her hair. “He doesn’t get to screw me over and move on.”</p><p>“As far as I understand, he has screwed no one.”</p><p>“You’re just your father’s little bitch, aren’t you?” Victoria spat.</p><p>Agatha’s arm flew to her leg, grip tightening, but this was nothing Rio had not seen before. “My relationship with him does not mean I love you any less, mom. But you do see that you’re being irrational.”</p><p>“<em>Irrational?</em>” Victoria roared. “How am I being <em>irrational</em>?”</p><p>“Did you even try to <em>talk</em> to him? Or did you listen to half a fucking sentence and jump the gun?”</p><p>Victoria reeled. “You don’t understand what I am going through, Rio. You don’t understand how <em>trapped</em> I feel in this marriage. Your father alternates between being perfect and being horrible and I can’t keep doing <em>this</em>.”</p><p>“Then <em>leave!</em> No one is stopping you.” Rio sniped.</p><p>“Why can’t you just tell me I’m <em>right?</em> Why do you always have to give me solutions?” Victoria thundered. “Why can’t you just hold my hand and tell me it will all be okay?”</p><p>“I’m your daughter, not your spouse. Call Dad,” Rio said, quite dismissively.</p><p>She felt Agatha look at her, mouth agape.</p><p>“So, you are taking <em>his</em> side,” Victoria screeched.</p><p>“For the love of God,” Rio clenched her temples. “I don’t give two flying fucks what you both do unless you show up at my <em>doorstep</em>, so I’ll say whatever I need to get you to <em>stop</em>.”</p><p>Victoria stared at her, mouth unhinged, eyes filled with (faux) tears.</p><p>“What you two are doing is unnatural, you know that? You can’t get married, no one will show up,” Victoria snarled.</p><p>“Ro and Kai will. Our friends will. <em>Dad</em> will. I don’t need you.”</p><p>“My mother was right, you are <em>unnatural</em>. You were a still born, you were Death, reincarnate,” Victoria mumbled wildly under her breath.</p><p>
<em>Low blow.</em>
</p><p>But Victoria always pulled them out. She always needed the last word.</p><p>“Feel free to get the fuck out now,” Rio screamed behind her.</p><p>“You would throw <em>your mother out on the streets?</em> Fine, I will leave tomorrow. From now, you won’t have a mother anymore,” Victoria howled.</p><p>“Empty threats, mom,” Rio yelled after her, “Please actually cut me out this time!”</p><p>Victoria stomped off to the guest room, slamming the door.</p><p>Rio sighed.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them said anything, just sitting in the echo of the door slam.</p><p>“What the <em>hell</em> just happened,” Agatha whispered behind her.</p><p>Rio sighed again. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” Rio announced, gesturing to the closed guest room door. “<em>Victoria Vidal.</em>”</p><p>“No, Rio,” Agatha’s voice was shaking. “Why the hell did <em>you</em> behave like <em>that</em>?”</p><p>“Like what?” Rio said, defenses rising.</p><p>“Like she was insane,” Agatha waved her hands wildly.</p><p>“Because she <em>is</em>,” Rio sighed.</p><p>“You were so dismissive of her, so <em>cold</em> towards her,” Agatha whispered, voice raw.</p><p>“You don’t understand, Agatha,” Rio pressed her temples, squeezing her eyes shut. “This is how she is, like fucking <em>whiplash</em>. I don’t have time for this shit in my life.”</p><p>“You’re shutting her out,” Agatha almost cried, “Just like you shut me out earlier.”</p><p>“How is this about <em>you</em>?” Rio grouched, “When did this become about <em>us</em>?”</p><p>“I knew you there was something I was missing,” Agatha said, threading her hands through her hair, “I knew the other shoe would drop.”</p><p>“What other shoe?” Rio snapped, “What the hell are you talking about?”</p><p>“You’re emotionally avoidant, Rio. Fully fucking <em>detached.</em> You don’t care. You don’t care about your mother or about me or my feelings—”</p><p>“I don’t care?” Rio growled. “You can’t say that to me, Agatha. After everything we have… You don’t get to—”</p><p>“This was all an act, wasn’t it,” Agatha’s voice rose from the hushed whispers they were talking through, louder now, “You being this perfect girlfriend, doting on me, taking care of me, <em>this was all an act.</em>”</p><p>Rio reeled back, gasping almost as if Agatha had physically slapped her.</p><p>In some ways, what she said was worse.</p><p>Those words, the way it was levied, this exact conversation, it reminded Rio of the one thing she dreaded the most.</p><p>They were becoming her <em>parents</em>.</p><p>Same bite, same hunger, trying to maul each other before the other one can.</p><p>
<em>She couldn’t breathe.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The walls were closing in. </em>
</p><p>“I need to go,” Rio said, heart beating wildly. “<em>I need to go.</em>”</p><p>
<em>She couldn’t breathe.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe her mother was right.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe she was Death reincarnated.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe she did kill everything she touched.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Somehow, she hoped it was different this time.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Different with Agatha. </em>
</p><p>She burst out the front door and ran into the night, running where she didn’t know, just as long as it was far from <em>here.</em></p><p>
<em>Far from home.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Was this it?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Were they doomed from the start?</em>
</p><p>
<em>What had they come to?</em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness truly believed it was all going to be okay.</p><p>Why wouldn’t it be?</p><p>Victoria Vidal was always an elusive figure in Agatha’s life.</p><p>They had met a handful of times, college graduation, Rio’s birthdays, occasional visits, but nothing longer than passing pleasantries, nothing that would truly allow Agatha to judge her character.</p><p>So, Agatha always saw her through Rio’s eyes: an equal mix of judgement and pain, loving her mother, being grateful for her but wanting nothing more than to escape her purview.</p><p>Personally, Agatha never understood the last part.</p><p>Rio’s parents were always there for her. Messy and erratic, but present. They called each other once a week. They sent her money when times were hard. They sent flowers on important occasions. They listened to her aspirations and dreams and they pushed her towards greater things.</p><p>They weren’t the best, but they were there.</p><p>Which was more than Agatha could say about her parents.</p><p>Agatha’s father was a distant memory, a blur that swept through her mind at times. Even though he passed when she was in college, he was never really there.</p><p>He went about life as if he was alone. Work, eat, sleep, work, eat, sleep, work, eat, sleep until he died.</p><p>Evanora, on the other hand, was too present.</p><p>Hell bent on shaping her only child in her image.</p><p>She was too particular. Too discerning. Like a flash of lightning, sharp, tight, blinding.</p><p>And Agatha was never enough.</p><p>Not popular enough. Not smart enough. Not pretty enough.</p><p>Hell, she wasn’t even good enough at <em>chores</em>.</p><p>Every time Evanora would come home from work, she’d tear through the house, fixing all of Agatha’s ‘mistakes,’ ripping things out of the dishwasher, refolding her clothes, remaking the bed, all seemingly casual, but Agatha knew they were taunts.</p><p>They were punishments.</p><p>
<em>I don’t think I am good.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t think I get to be happy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t think I am enough either.</em>
</p><p>So, Victoria Vidal was a hurricane, yes. Large and deadly and left you with a new appreciation for your home, but she wasn’t <em>unmanageable</em>.</p><p>So why was Rio acting like she <em>was</em>?</p><p>Agatha expected Rio to hyperventilate. She expected Rio to freeze. She expected her to call this entire thing off.</p><p>But she didn’t expect her to become stoic. Robotic. Almost… <em>numb</em>?</p><p>She tore through the house, methodically, sharply rearranging it to something more presentable, and Agatha knew, she knew deep down that it was not about her, this was about Victoria, but everything Rio changed, every way Rio tweaked something, it <em>stung</em>.</p><p>Rio, who never cared enough to pick out the guest room colors, was rearranging her throws to look more palatable.</p><p>Rio, who reluctantly cleaned the bathroom after like twenty reminders, sped through it in fifteen minutes.</p><p>Rio, who would go grocery shopping and then forget to put away the groceries for hours, was stocking the shelf with vigor Agatha had never seen before.</p><p>She knew, she <em>knew</em> it was not about her.</p><p>But it still felt so, so <em>personal</em>.</p><p>
<em>As if Agatha wasn’t good enough at maintaining the house. </em>
</p><p>Even though it was <em>their</em> house.</p><p>
<em>It still felt like somehow, Agatha should have done better. Should have kept it cleaner. Should have done more. </em>
</p><p>Even though Rio had never said or implied that Agatha was responsible for the cleaning or maintenance of their house.</p><p>
<em>Still, it felt like a punch to the gut.</em>
</p><p>Agatha tried pushing it away.</p><p>“I’m beginning to understand why the people in the hospital were scared of you,” Agatha tried a joke. Lightening the mood.</p><p>No response. <em>Was Rio ignoring her?</em></p><p>Agatha sighed. <em>Maybe she should be checking in? That’s what a good girlfriend would do.</em></p><p>“Baby, you need to slow down.”</p><p>No response. <em>Rio was definitely ignoring her.</em></p><p>
<em>It meant she had fucked up somehow. </em>
</p><p>She rubbed her arm, biting her lip as Rio sped past her, not even acknowledging her presence.</p><p>Agatha almost trembled at this.</p><p><em>Rio wasn’t angry at her. She wasn’t…</em> Agatha tried reasoning with herself.</p><p>But the voice was too strong.</p><p>
<em>Everyone around you can see it. See that you are wicked.</em>
</p><p>Agatha pinched her hand.</p><p>
<em>She was not wicked.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Everything was okay.</em>
</p><p>Deep breaths.</p><p>She followed Rio into the room. She had stripped all the sheets.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know why, but that brought a smile to her face.</p><p>“Baby, those sheets are clean,” Agatha said, leaning on the door frame, lips curling up.</p><p>“Not clean <em>enough</em>,” Rio grumbled, stripping off the mattress topper too, looking a lot like a little gremlin, “They still smell like sex.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, “Who’s fault is that?”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Agatha felt her smile drop.</p><p>
<em>Okay, it really seemed like Rio was mad at her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>If not mad, then shutting her out.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Punishing her for something.</em>
</p><p>Nope. <em>Nope. Not punishing her.</em></p><p>
<em>She was not going to do this.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was not going to shoot herself in the foot.</em>
</p><p>Agatha grabbed the other end of the sheet, helping Rio in silence. If Rio needed a silent companion, Agatha would give it to her.</p><p>Whatever Rio needed right now, Agatha would focus on giving that to her.</p><p>Once they were done, Rio moved on to the drawers, rearranging and folding haphazardly thrown in clothes and finally, pulling the drawer with all the fun toys out.</p><p>This stung a lot more than Agatha would like to admit.</p><p>
<em>But it’s fine.</em>
</p><p>
<em>All fine.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She absolutely wasn’t going to ask—</em>
</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, arms crossed.</p><p>“Hiding the straps,” Rio said casually, too casually, putting all of the toys in the appropriate cloth bags, “Can you find me an empty shoebox?”</p><p>“Rio. They’re already in a <em>drawer</em>,” Agatha noted.</p><p>Rio scoffed and shook her head.</p><p>Something in Agatha snapped.</p><p>That <em>scoff.</em></p><p>
<em>The condescension.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It made Agatha seem like she was stupid.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was not stupid.</em>
</p><p>“Agatha, my mother is going to stick her head in every crevice of this house and unless you’re okay with her finding our toy drawer and all the questions that would come with it, we need to put them all in a box and, just to be safe, <em>burn</em> them.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>
<em>Oh.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was just scared.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha was so stupid.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Everything was fine.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She just needed to comfort her girlfriend.</em>
</p><p>“Baby, come here,” she said softly, walking over to her and trying to pull her into a hug.</p><p>
<em>It was all going to be okay.</em>
</p><p>“I don’t have time for this,” Rio clawed out of her embrace. “I love you and whatever, but we need to finish cleaning.”</p><p>
<em>What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was angry at her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She had to be.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She just fought out of Agatha’s embrace.</em>
</p><p><em>She said I love you and</em> whatever.</p><p>
<em>Whatever.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Like Agatha meant nothing to her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Like she didn’t love Agatha anymore.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, no. Agatha didn’t want to fall through that rabbit hole.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, Rio loved her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was going to apologize.</em>
</p><p>Rio looked at her and then looked away.</p><p>
<em>No apology. </em>
</p><p>“Can you light candles?” Rio said instead, moving over to their closet and grabbing one of Agatha’s shoeboxes. “It’ll get the smell out.”</p><p>
<em>What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>What the absolute god-fearing fuck. </em>
</p><p>Agatha was <em>right.</em></p><p>
<em>She was right.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was pretending.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was trying to be perfect.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But this was her. The true her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Avoidant. Dismissive. Cold.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, no. She was her girlfriend, no, she got the benefit of the doubt.</em>
</p><p>“Rio, those are expensive shoes, you can’t just…”</p><p>Rio had already removed them, and placed them on the ground with all of their other shoes.</p><p>
<em>Motherfucker, she removed her Manolo Blahniks from their box?</em>
</p><p>
<em>The shoes Agatha had spent three paychecks saving for?</em>
</p><p>
<em>They touched the ground?</em>
</p><p>“I need the box,” Rio said as she began throwing in all the toys, “I’ll return it when—”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said firmly, trying not to screech, pinching her wrist again to ground herself, “No.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ll use another box,” Rio said, doubling back and all but throwing the shoes back in the box with little care and opening one of her own shoeboxes.</p><p>
<em>Agatha was going to black out from the sheer spike of rage.</em>
</p><p>
<em>If she was hooked up to those blood pressure machines, it would have beeped like a rogue car alarm.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was pushing her away.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was punishing her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She didn’t get to do that.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She didn’t get to throw Agatha out like trash and get away with it.</em>
</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, grabbing her arm firmly. “We’re not doing this… you can’t <em>shut</em> me out.”</p><p>If Agatha’s eyes weren’t so firmly trained on her, she wouldn’t have caught it, but she did.</p><p>Rio <em>flinched.</em></p><p>
<em>She flinched from Agatha’s touch.</em>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>Rio pulled out of her hold, head down, kept going. “I’m not shutting you out, Agatha. I’m saving <em>both</em> of us from uncomfortable questions.”</p><p>
<em>Agatha felt gutted.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She felt like this was the start of the end.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This was Rio pulling away.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was going to lose her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, she could still stop this.</em>
</p><p>“Why won’t you look at me?” Agatha all but screamed.</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>
<em>Paused. </em>
</p><p>Looked up at Agatha and then:</p><p>“I know you’re not stupid, Agatha,” Rio scrunched up her face.</p><p>
<em>Rio thought she was stupid.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio thought she was irrational.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio thought she was insane.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Suddenly, Agatha felt very small.</em>
</p><p>“So, why are you choosing <em>this</em> moment to pick a fight?”</p><p>
<em>A punch in the gut.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha wasn’t going to survive the loss of this relationship.</em>
</p><p>“You’ve been ignoring me since you found out your mother was coming,” Agatha wrapped her arms around her middle, suddenly feeling stupid, and insane and irrational. “Don’t invalidate my feelings.”</p><p>“I’m not trying to…” Rio sighed, clutching her head. “Look, I'm sorry I haven’t been <em>looking</em> at you, but I have clearly been doing,” she waved her arms around the room, “other things. And, I’m sorry I <em>thought</em> you had a little more <em>faith</em> in our relationship.”</p><p>
<em>Another punch in the gut.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This one was harder.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This hurt more.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She had faith in their relationship… right?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yes, she did.</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s lip wavered. “That’s not what I’m worried about.”</p><p>Rio shoved the box of sex toys under the bed, pulling the duvet down to hide it.</p><p>
<em>She needed Rio to see that she was breaking.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed Rio to know her in this moment.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed Rio. </em>
</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Rio, I’m trying to talk to you—”</p><p>“Why, Agatha. Why are you choosing <em>now</em>?” Rio snapped. “I don’t have the time for this. I don’t have the space for this. I can’t talk about this <em>right now</em>, so why are you forcing this down my throat?”</p><p>
<em>Agatha felt her heart in her throat.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She knew she fucked up.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was going to leave her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was going to leave forever. </em>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her, eyes shining.</p><p>
<em>Please, my love.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Please know I love you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Please know I am sorry. </em>
</p><p>Rio opened her mouth but before she could say anything there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Rio froze. Agatha felt it.</p><p>Rio finally, <em>finally</em> looked at Agatha.</p><p>
<em>She looked scared.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, she looked terrified.</em>
</p><p><em>Deep breaths,</em> Agatha told herself.</p><p>This is not about you.</p><p>Another knock. More impatient.</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p><em>This is not about you.</em> Agatha chanted in her head.</p><p>
<em>This is about Rio.</em>
</p><p>A series of knocks. Very impatient.</p><p>Rio looked up towards Agatha, so much emotion coursing through her eyes.</p><p>
<em>Agatha could fix this.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha needed to fix this.</em>
</p><p>Agatha snapped into action, rushing over to the door and unlocking it with the best smile on her face.</p><p>
<em>Deep breaths. Deep breaths.</em>
</p><p>“Victoria,” she said cheerfully, flashing a big smile.</p><p>Victoria Vidal stood at the other end, soft brown hair tied up in a messy ponytail, dressed in a colorful mismatch of patterns and shapes, white skin shining with a flush of someone who just heaved themselves up the stairs.</p><p>“Do I have the right apartment?” Victoria said, head tilted in emotion. Agatha blinked back at the lack of recognition.</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>?”</p><p>Rio appeared behind her, draping her arm firmly around Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha leaned into the contact. Trying to ground herself.</p><p>
<em>It was all going to be okay.</em>
</p><p>“Hi, mom,” Rio said, firmly. “You’ve met Agatha before, haven’t you.”</p><p>“Oh, yes,” Victoria said enthusiastically, pulling Agatha into a big, sweeping hug, “Of course, I remember you. Rio’s <em>best</em> friend, right? You’ve changed so much. Last time I saw you was so much younger. What was it? Almost ten years ago!”</p><p>
<em>Agatha tried shaking off her words.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Best foot forward.</em>
</p><p>“Yes, at graduation, how are you—” Agatha said, smiling apprehensively as Victoria pulled away and launched herself at Rio.</p><p>
<em>It was all okay. It was all okay. It was all okay.</em>
</p><p>“My baby, my darling, my little girl,” Victoria said, plastering Rio’s face with kisses. “It’s been too long since you last came home.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to smile at the affection.</p><p>
<em>Victoria loved Rio, that was for sure. </em>
</p><p>“I was home three months ago,” Rio murmured, but Victoria pulled Rio further into the house.</p><p>“This is such a nice place you have, Rio,” Victoria giggled, letting Rio go so she could prance over to fiddle with the coffee table decor.</p><p>
<em>Breathe in and let it roll off your back.</em>
</p><p>“Thank you, mom,” Rio trailed after her, “It was all Agatha.”</p><p>
<em>Breathe out and be thankful for your girlfriend.</em>
</p><p>“How sweet of Agatha to decorate <em>your</em> place,” Victoria nodded as she looked out the window, noting their outdoor furniture. “Why do you have fake grass on your terrace?”</p><p>
<em>Breathe in and try not to bash your own head in.</em>
</p><p>Agatha walked up next to Rio.</p><p>
<em>Breathe out and try not to kill your future mother-in-law.</em>
</p><p>Rio looked up at her then, eyes soft and pleading, as if she was trying to communicate with Agatha, admitting some kind of non-verbal apology.</p><p>She looked so soft and terrified and Agatha wanted to wrap herself around her and never let her go.</p><p>
<em>It was all going to be okay.</em>
</p><p>Agatha sighed, allowing her heart to fill with joy again, and pulled her girlfriend in, snaking her arm around her waist and leaving a soft kiss on her temple.</p><p>
<em>Somehow that helped both of them.</em>
</p><p>“We have a rabbit, mom,” Rio said, with new determination. “We live together. I know you know this because when I sent this in the family group chat, you sent me four pride flag GIFs. Or was that just because <em>Dad</em> was also in the chat?”</p><p>Victoria whipped around. “Don’t mention <em>him</em>,” she said, plopping down on the couch. “I know you two live together, like <em>roommates</em>—”</p><p>“She’s my girlfriend, mom,” Rio snapped. “If you don’t respect that, there is the door.”</p><p>
<em>Agatha froze.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was being so combative.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Didn’t she know, didn’t she know her mother could hurt her?</em>
</p><p>
<em>She had to protect Rio.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She had to protect herself.</em>
</p><p>Victoria huffed, crossing her arms. “You’re so <em>emotional</em>, Rio. Can’t even make a joke around you. It was supposed to be <em>funny</em>,” Victoria rolled her eyes.</p><p>
<em>Too emotional.</em>
</p><p>Agatha tried inhaling, but the air had left the room.</p><p>“You’re not <em>funny</em>, mom.”</p><p>
<em>She was almost choking.</em>
</p><p>“Agatha thought it was funny, didn’t she?” Victoria smirked.</p><p>
<em>A clear trap. </em>
</p><p>Agatha took a sharp breath in.</p><p>
<em>She was fucked either way.</em>
</p><p>She coughed, moving to sit and weakly saying, “Sure.”</p><p>“<em>See!</em>” Victoria triumphed. She drew back and pointed her finger at Rio, “You’d throw your <em>own</em> mother out on the street?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, unhesitantly.</p><p>
<em>Does she have a fucking death wish?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Does Rio want to be bitch-slapped?</em>
</p><p>Victoria just rolled her eyes.</p><p>
<em>What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>How is Rio alive?</em>
</p><p>“Why are you here, mom?” Rio moved to face her mother on the couch, “What happened?”</p><p>“So, are you two <em>serious</em>?” Victoria asked instead, looking between the two of them, suddenly a protective mother.</p><p>Agatha gulped.</p><p>
<em>This was it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This was when they died.</em>
</p><p>“We are, mom,” Rio said softly, taking her mother’s hand in her own, willing her to be normal about this. “Agatha is <em>it</em> for me.”</p><p>
<em>Agatha felt her heart swell.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha felt her heart explode.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio still loved her.</em>
</p><p>Victoria gasped, brown hair swaying as she moved her head. “Like marriage, <em>it</em>?”</p><p>Rio looked back and grabbed Agatha’s hand with her own. Agatha stared back, eyes watering.  “Like in every way she’ll have me, <em>it</em>.”</p><p>
<em>Fuck, she should have bought that ring.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She would have gotten down on one knee at that moment. </em>
</p><p>Agatha smiled back, big and watery and deep.</p><p><em>I love you too</em>, she wanted it to say. <em>I love you too.</em></p><p>“Your father cheated on me,” Victoria said suddenly, almost a proclamation.</p><p>Agatha gasped.</p><p>“Victoria, I’m so sorry,” she began, but Rio patted her leg, shaking her head slowly.</p><p>“With <em>what</em>, mother?” Rio said calmly. “A real person, this time?”</p><p>Victoria clutched her chest dramatically, “Obviously.”</p><p>“Forgive me for questioning. Last time, it was with a cheese grater. And did they have <em>sex</em>?”</p><p>Victoria was suspiciously quiet. “Your father doesn’t love me anymore,” she announced, getting up and pacing the room. “He’s cheating on me, I <em>know</em> it.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her wearily.</p><p>“You told me you don’t love him, like, when I was <em>six</em>,” Rio muttered, crossing her arms. “Why do you care?”</p><p>“That’s not the point,” Victoria said, threading her hands through her hair. “He doesn’t get to screw me over and move on.”</p><p>“As far as I understand, he has screwed no one.”</p><p>“You’re just your father’s little bitch, aren’t you?” Victoria spat.</p><p>Agatha flinched at the comment, rage building in her, arm flying to Rio’s leg.</p><p>But Rio seemed… unbothered.</p><p>“My relationship with him does not mean I love you any less, mom. But you do see that you’re being <em>irrational</em>.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help it, but she flinched.</p><p>How was Rio so… <em>distant?</em></p><p><em>“Irrational?”</em> Victoria roared. “How am I being irrational?”</p><p>“Did you even try to <em>talk</em> to him? Or did you listen to half a fucking sentence and jump the gun?”</p><p>Agatha’s entire world stilled.</p><p>A throwaway comment.</p><p>Nothing to note.</p><p>Except this is exactly what Agatha did, didn’t she?</p><p>
<em>Did you even try to talk to him?</em>
</p><p>Tell Rio we are done. I don’t want to see her face ever again.</p><p>
<em>Or did you listen to half a fucking sentence and jump the gun?</em>
</p><p>I don’t want you in my life. I want you to leave me alone.</p><p>
<em>It was stupid, irrational, but deep down, it felt like Rio was talking to her.</em>
</p><p>I never want to see your face again.</p><p>
<em>She knows it was crazy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She knows it was wrong.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But it almost felt as if she saw herself in Victoria.</em>
</p><p>
<em>In the way she carried herself.</em>
</p><p>
<em>In the way she jumped to conclusions.</em>
</p><p>
<em>In the way she talked to Rio.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She knew it was crazy, she did.</em>
</p><p>But she believed it anyway.</p><p>
<em>Did you even try to talk to him? Or did you listen to half a fucking sentence and jump the gun?</em>
</p><p>The words Rio so casually flung at her mother, was everything Agatha was scared she would realize.</p><p>Maybe she already had.</p><p>Maybe she had already picked up on Agatha’s worst habit.</p><p>
<em>I don’t want you here.</em>
</p><p>She wants to say she didn’t know where all this came from.</p><p>
<em>I don’t want you in my life.</em>
</p><p>But she did.</p><p>
<em>I want you to leave me alone.</em>
</p><p>The one thing Agatha could always count on was her ability to self-destruct.</p><p>
<em>I never want to see your face again.</em>
</p><p>Her ability to take something pretty sitting in the palm of her hand and crush it.</p><p>
<em>Have your stuff out of my house before I come back. </em>
</p><p>“Why can’t you just tell me I’m <em>right</em>? Why do you always have to give me solutions?” Victoria thundered in the background, voice already dangerously muffled as Agatha tried to breathe. “Why can’t you just hold my hand and tell me it will all be okay?”</p><p>
<em>Yes, yes, why can’t you Rio?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Why can’t you help me?</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’m broken.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’m defective.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’m unhappy and evil and undeserving.</em>
</p><p>“I’m your daughter, not your spouse. Call Dad,” Rio said, quite dismissively.</p><p>
<em>Rio didn’t care.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio wouldn’t understand.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was broken beyond repair.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She had to protect Rio.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She had to protect her from herself.</em>
</p><p>Did you listen to half a fucking sentence and jump the gun?</p><p>
<em>Because that is what she did, didn’t she?</em>
</p><p>
<em>She threw a live grenade into the situation before the other person could even try to talk.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She hit them where it hurt.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She destroyed them from within.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because deep down, deep down there was a part of her that believed she was evil. Bad. Unloveable.</em>
</p><p>I don’t think I am enough either. I don’t think I am good. I don’t think I get to be happy.</p><p>I don’t think I get to be happy.</p><p>I don’t think I get to be happy.</p><p>
<em>She knew it in her soul. She knew the other shoe would drop.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She should just urge it along.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Why spend years with Rio? Better to know now, right.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Better to know before she does something stupid and buys a ring.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Better to know before she was stupid and caught unaware.</em>
</p><p>The door slammed.</p><p>“What the <em>hell</em> just happened,” Agatha whispered behind her.</p><p>Rio sighed again. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” Rio announced, gesturing to the closed guest room door. “<em>Victoria Vidal.</em>”</p><p>
<em>How did Rio still not see it?</em>
</p><p>“No, Rio,” Agatha’s voice was shaking. “Why the hell did you behave like that?”</p><p>“Like what?” Rio said, defenses rising.</p><p>“Like she was <em>insane</em>,” Agatha waved her hands wildly.</p><p>
<em>Like I was insane.</em>
</p><p>“Because she <em>is</em>,” Rio sighed.</p><p>
<em>No, no, no.</em>
</p><p>“You were so dismissive of her, so cold towards her,” Agatha whispered, voice raw.</p><p>
<em>Are you going to be like that towards me?</em>
</p><p>
<em>When we get married, are you going to be that way towards me?</em>
</p><p>“You don’t understand, Agatha,” Rio pressed her temples, squeezing her eyes shut. “This is how she is, like fucking <em>whiplash</em>. I don’t have time for this shit in my life.”</p><p>
<em>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Is that what Rio thought she was?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Whiplash?</em>
</p><p>“You’re shutting her out,” Agatha almost cried, “Just like you shut <em>me</em> out earlier.”</p><p>“How is this about <em>you</em>?” Rio grouched, “When did this become about <em>us</em>?”</p><p>
<em>Isn’t it?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hasn’t it always been?</em>
</p><p>
<em>In this light, Rio almost looked like someone she was always running away from, someone with the same cold touch and dismissive tone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But on some level, so true.</em>
</p><p>“I knew you there was something I was missing,” Agatha said, threading her hands through her hair, “I knew the other shoe would drop.”</p><p>
<em>Rio was so much like her mother.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio would start hating her too.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was too perfect.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was never meant to be happy.</em>
</p><p>“What other shoe?” Rio snapped, “What the hell are you talking about?”</p><p>“You’re emotionally avoidant, Rio. Fully fucking <em>detached</em>. You don’t care. You don’t care about your mother or about me or my feelings—”</p><p>“<em>I don’t care?</em>” Rio growled. “You can’t say that to me, Agatha. After everything we have… You don’t get to—”</p><p>
<em>How didn’t she see it before?</em>
</p><p>
<em>How didn’t she see through all of this before?</em>
</p><p>“This was all an act, wasn’t it,” Agatha’s voice rose, “You being this <em>perfect</em> girlfriend, doting on me, taking care of me, <em>this</em> was all an act.”</p><p>Rio reeled back, gasping almost as if Agatha had physically slapped her.</p><p>In some ways, she had.</p><p>“I need to go,” Rio said, heart beating wildly. “<em>I need to go.</em>”</p><p>
<em>Of course, Agatha wasn’t going to get a conversation.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Of course, Rio was just going to run away.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Of course, this was going to end just like Agatha knew it would.</em>
</p><p>She wanted to hate Rio at that moment.</p><p>But all she hated was herself.</p><p>As she stared at the door, slam still thundering through the room, all she could feel was intense amounts of self-loathing.</p><p>
<em>Because the one thing Agatha could always count on was her ability to self-destruct.</em>
</p><p>I never want to see your face again.</p><p>
<em>Her torturous ability to take something pretty sitting in the palm of her hand and crush it.</em>
</p><p>I don’t want you here. I don’t want you in my life.</p><p>
<em>This is how it always ended.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Because somewhere deep within her, she knew her mother was right.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was evil.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was rotten.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was unloveable.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t think I get to be happy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t think I get to be happy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t think I get to be happy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She knew it in her soul.</em>
</p><p>And she would have believed it all too.</p><p>If she didn’t walk into their room and see Scratchy in his cage, eating a special treat Rio had so painstakingly made for him.</p><p>If she didn’t see the little post-it Rio had left for her on the vanity mirror earlier that morning.</p><p>
<em>Hope you aren’t questioning the universe, today. I love you &lt;3</em>
</p><p>If she wasn’t literally ring shopping that <em>morning</em>.</p><p>If every single part of her didn’t fully know she loved Rio.</p><p>
<em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was a fucking idiot.</em>
</p><p>
<em>What was she thinking?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Why did she do this?</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to find Rio.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to run after her.</em>
</p><p><em>She needed to</em> fix <em>this.</em></p><p>She didn’t even know how she was outside, her legs carried her long before her mind accepted it, running outside, air hitting her face, looking wildly around for any hint of where she would have gone.</p><p>
<em>Fuck, she should have called her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio could be anywhere right now.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Where’s her phone, where’s her keys—</em>
</p><p>Rio was in the car.</p><p>In the driveway.</p><p>
<em>She was still here?</em>
</p><p>
<em>She stayed?</em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know if she should go in, she didn’t know if Rio would still want to see her.</p><p>But she had to try to <em>fix</em> this.</p><p>Agatha slipped into the car silently.</p><p>Rio stared ahead, hands on the wheel unmoving.</p><p>Agatha raced through all the different things she wanted to say to Rio, but her courage never arrived to open her mouth.</p><p>Eventually, Rio murmured, “I’m going to say something, and I need you to not be mad at me after.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath.</p><p>
<em>Was this it?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Was this the end?</em>
</p><p>She nodded, pulling one of her legs up to her chest and hugging it close to her chest.</p><p>“I think you’re being irrational.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, dropping her head to her knee.</p><p>
<em>She was, wasn’t she?</em>
</p><p>Rio stiffened, “You promised you wouldn’t get mad at me.”</p><p>Agatha let out a laugh, watery and deep.</p><p>“You’re right,” she mumbled. “I am being irrational.”</p><p>Rio blinked against the darkness.</p><p>“You <em>are</em>… I just can’t understand why,” Rio said softly. “Why would you take her side after she called our relationship unnatural and told us no one would show up to the wedding and told me I should have been a still born.”</p><p>“Because— <em>she what?</em>” Agatha screeched.</p><p>
<em>When the living fuck did Victoria say all that?</em>
</p><p>Rio just stared at her, eyebrow raised. “Did you not hear that part?”</p><p>
<em>Absolutely fucking not, she did not.</em>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. Disgust, rage and hatred bubbling within her with vitriol.</p><p>“I’m going to murder your mother,” Agatha growled, but Rio reached out and grabbed her hand before she could make any real effort to move.</p><p>“Can we talk first?” Rio said softly. “<em>Please?</em>”</p><p>Agatha laid her hand over Rio’s, lip quivering.</p><p>“I understand if  you want to break up with me,” Agatha started, emotion choking her voice.</p><p>Rio blinked again. “Agatha, <em>what?</em>”</p><p>“I know I fucked up, I shouldn’t have said what I did… I’ll understand if you don’t want me anymore,” Agatha blurted, trying to keep her tears at bay.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Do you think my love is so fickle that one fight is going to break it?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, breaths uneven.</p><p>
<em>Rio was looking at her with so much love, so much devotion. </em>
</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>
<em>She wanted to believe it, but her body was still wracked with the memory of her doubts. </em>
</p><p>“I have spent the last <em>ten</em> years loving you, Agatha,” Rio reached out to cup her face. “I know you, I know you well. I was there when you broke up with Wanda and you tried to shove your tongue down my throat to make her jealous. I was there when you chose to tell me you love me two days after I got a girlfriend—”</p><p>Agatha’s defenses shot up. “That’s not my—”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio urged her softly. “It took a lot for me to muster up the courage to say this. I don’t… I usually need <em>space</em> after things like this. But I know you won’t sleep if we don’t at least start talking this through, so <em>please</em>, let me say my part.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered under the weight of her words, nodding quickly.</p><p>“I know that you have the tendency to self-destruct, I know you do, but I also know it comes off the back of something that’s eating you up inside. I don’t know what it is, but I can make a good guess. You— you don’t have to tell me, I just— did I do something wrong? Over the last… two months we have been together, did I not show you how much I loved you every day? Where did I leave space for doubt?”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut. “You didn’t,” she mumbled, leaning into Rio’s touch. “I just… I don’t think… It was all too perfect. You were perfect. I guess,” Agatha’s voice cracked under the weight of the emotion she had been unknowingly carrying, “I guess I just was waiting for the other shoe to drop. For you to realize that I am not <em>worthy</em> of you.”</p><p>Rio traced her thumb along her face. “Here I was thinking I wasn’t worthy of <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot up, surprise on the tip of her tongue, “You are Rio. Why would you think otherwise? You’ve been the <em>best</em> girlfriend, the <em>best</em> partner. You hear me, you anticipate my needs, you love me for who I am, I couldn’t ask for anything more.”</p><p>“Neither could I,” Rio’s eyes shone, “I don’t know why you can’t see it. Why can't you see how <em>wonderful</em> you are? How <em>caring</em> and <em>loving</em> and <em>dependable</em> you are?”</p><p>Agatha was silent. “I don’t know,” she muttered eventually, “I think I’m broken inside.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “I don’t think you’re broken, Agatha. I think you feel like you have to hold the weight of the world on your own. But I am here… I’m here telling you… no, <em>asking</em> you, <em>begging</em> you to let me carry some of it too.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, tears falling free of her eyes. “I don’t know how to do that, Rio. I don’t know how to turn my mind off. It’s always yelling something at me, telling me you don’t want to hear what I want to say, telling me I’m burdening you with something you don’t need.”</p><p>Rio paused, considering her words. “I know it’s hard, but you need to talk to me. I can’t read your mind. I— You… You need to <em>talk</em> to me. We aren’t partners if we don’t do this <em>together</em>.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, letting out a watery laugh. “You’re right. You’re right. When did you get so wise?”</p><p>Rio was silent, staring at her with a tenderness Agatha reveled in, before she said, “When you got hurt…” Rio took a shaky breath, “When you got hurt, I promised myself I would <em>try</em> to be <em>worthy of you</em>. Up until that point, I thought I hadn’t been. So, everyday, I think, what would make me worthy of Agatha. A Rio worthy of you would communicate, so I tried to do that right now.”</p><p>Agatha reached forward and cupped her face. “Thank you. Thank you for staying. Thank you for talking to me. I needed this. I know… I know you process things... <em>later</em>.”</p><p>Rio chuckled grimly, “I do.” A sigh. “I’ll be honest, I got into the car and I was ready to drive away but I couldn’t start the car. I <em>couldn’t</em> drive away. Because the only person I wanted to run to was you. The only person I want to talk to when my life is falling apart is <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s words flooded through her.</p><p>
<em>She really was an idiot.</em>
</p><p>
<em>How could she ever think that Rio would abandon her?</em>
</p><p>
<em>When Rio was sitting here, fighting every impulse, trying to make sure Agatha was okay, how could she even think…</em>
</p><p>
<em>How could she even think that they weren’t it for each other?</em>
</p><p>
<em>After months of consistent affirmation.</em>
</p><p>
<em>After so much love and care and sheer devotion shown by Rio.</em>
</p><p>
<em>How could she?</em>
</p><p>
<em>And in the face of so much honesty, what could she do but rip her own heart open?</em>
</p><p>“I’m scared you’re only with me because of the accident,” Agatha blurted out. “I’m scared it’s because I got hurt that you figured it out, but I’m even more scared that it’s guilt. Like some fucked up reason that you think you need to take care of me. I know it’s irrational and insane, but it’s scary. Things have been too <em>perfect</em>. And perfect things don’t happen to me…” Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, dropping her head into her folded legs. “I’m sorry, I know I must sound batshit crazy…”</p><p>“You’re not crazy to me,” Rio whispered, soft and loud at the same time. “I understand. I understand this feeling. God, trust me I do. But you need to know, I almost hung up on the hospital twice.”</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brow. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I had a panic attack. That day. Jen’s brunch. I started imagining a family with you and I spiraled. Nat calmed me down and then told me that there was no point in us having a relationship when I was <em>so clearly</em> in love with someone else. I kept declining the hospital’s call because I was trying to call you, trying to find you so I could tell you I loved you.”</p><p>Agatha felt all the air drain out of her body. In the same breath, she felt it fill with love.</p><p>“You wanted me <em>before</em> the accident?”</p><p>Rio leaned forward and pressed their foreheads together. “I wanted you the moment I met you.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I wanted <em>you</em> the moment I met you.”</p><p>“We’re idiots,” Rio laughed.</p><p>Agatha opened the car door and ran to the other side, opening the door for Rio. Rio awkwardly climbed out and Agatha took her into her arms, embracing her fiercely, cradling her head in her arms, holding onto her like she was Agatha’s lifeline.</p><p>Because in every way, she was.</p><p>“I know we have a lot more to talk about,” Agatha murmured into her neck, “But I needed this. I needed to know that you still loved me.”</p><p>Rio held her tighter, melting into the embrace. “I needed it too. I am still processing my feelings about what you said tonight… I need some time with that.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath. “Take all the time you need, my love. I’m not going to rush you.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio pressed a kiss onto her shoulder. “Until my mom leaves, can we be a united front?”</p><p>Agatha nodded into her neck. “We <em>are</em> a united front. We’ll just have strategy meetings after that invasion ends.”</p><p>Rio laughed into her hair. “Deal. You promise you’ll keep talking to me?”</p><p>Agatha nodded solemnly. “I do. I <em>promise</em>. Do you promise you’ll keep talking to me?”</p><p>Rio gasped softly, “I do.”</p><p>
<em>They held each other in the faint glow of the porch light for what seemed like forever.</em>
</p><p>
<em>For a little bit, Agatha felt the world become lighter.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Tomorrow, she will have to wake up and deal with the aftermath.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But right now, standing in Rio’s arms, hanging onto each other like they were each other’s salvation, it felt like the sun was rising after a long dark night.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was everything she never knew she could have.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Trust. Stability. Honesty.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And slowly she began considering the possibility that maybe Rio was right.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe she was enough.</em>

<p>Rio Vidal woke up to a very angry rabbit.</p><p>Scratchy was on her chest, chewing on her hair, silently seething.</p><p>“<em>Uhhhh,</em>” Rio groaned. “Scratchy, you okay there bud?”</p><p>Scratchy wrinkled his nose in rage and, <em>honest</em> to God, growled at her.</p><p>Rio tried lifting him up but he snapped at her hand.</p><p>“<em>Agathaaa,</em>” Rio cried out, staring at the bunny in pure terror. “Our baby is trying to murder me.”</p><p>The door quickly opened and Agatha stumbled in, wearing her bright pink ‘Kiss the Chef’ apron, hair all tied up, flour on her cheek.</p><p>“What happened?” she panted, clutching her knees. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Rio pointed at the rabbit seething on her chest.</p><p>“Uh, just a <em>slight</em> suspicion, but I think our son is mad at us.”</p><p>Agatha breathed a sigh of relief. “Oh, <em>thank god</em>,” she approached the two of them, wiping her hands on her apron. “Fuck Rio, all I heard was <em>Agatha</em> and <em>murder</em> and I thought someone had broken in.”</p><p>Agatha easily scooped up the bunny.</p><p>And the traitor let her. Without a single huff.</p><p>Un-<em>fucking</em>-fair.</p><p>Rio grumbled and stumbled out of bed, rubbing her eyes.</p><p>“How’s my baby this morning,” Agatha cooed.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Rio groaned. Then, she looked up at Agatha who had paused mid-belly rub, Scratchy still tucked in her arms, a look of guilt flashing across her face.</p><p>“You were talking to Scratchy, weren’t you?” Rio pouted.</p><p>“You’re both my babies,” Agatha tried pacifying, but Rio was already stomping towards the bathroom.</p><p>“I can’t believe this is what it’s come to,” Rio whined as she put toothpaste on her toothbrush. “I’m displaced by a <em>rabbit</em>.”</p><p>“Baby, he’s <em>yours,</em> too,” Agatha called out behind her, shuffling in the room.</p><p>Rio heard Scratchy’s cage being bolted shut.</p><p>“I think he’s just feeling a little neglected,” Agatha said, appearing in the bathroom doorway.</p><p>Rio scoffed as she spit out the toothpaste.</p><p>“Neglected,” Rio rolled her eyes. “He literally sleeps between us most nights.”</p><p>Agatha dissolved into a sweet smile, coming up behind Rio and sliding her arms around her waist.</p><p>“We have been having a lot of sex these last few days,” Agatha murmured, kissing her shoulder. “I think he just misses his Mami.”</p><p>Rio hummed and leaned into her touch. “He’s spoiled.”</p><p>Agatha nuzzled her neck. “He’s just the beginning.”</p><p>Rio scrunched her brow. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Agatha kissed her cheek. “What do you think happens when we start this family you keep hinting at?”</p><p>Rio broke into a giant smile.</p><p>“<em>Family</em>, huh?” she said, spinning in Agatha’s arms.</p><p>Agatha nodded, suddenly shy. “I want to think about the future if you want to,” she mumbled, playing with the ends of Rio’s hair. “But only if you think we’re ready—”</p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>Partially to shut her up.</p><p>
<em>But mainly because it was finally happening.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was all finally falling together.</em>
</p><p>She and Agatha were going to have the most <em>beautiful</em> kids.</p><p>They would have Rio’s smile and Agatha’s nose and wear stubbornness like an overcoat.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha asked, pulling back to search Rio’s face. “There were a lot of heavy emotions last night and I don’t blame you—”</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio said.</p><p>It was all Rio could say.</p><p>
<em>Let it stay buried.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Let it stay done.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t break it open, just yet.</em>
</p><p>Agatha nodded softly, flashing a small smile, one that did not reach her eyes.</p><p>“I made—”</p><p>Rio grabbed her face and kissed her again, deep and long, hoping that the apology on her lips would make it to Agatha’s heart.</p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist, holding onto her as if she was lost at sea and Rio a lone buoy in shark-infested waters.</p><p>And Rio clung further, because Agatha was the key to her absolution, the only way she was going to make it out of this mess <em>alive</em>.</p><p>When they finally surfaced, Rio could see Agatha’s heart had calmed a little.</p><p>Her breaths were more even, her smile more warm.</p><p>“How do you always know what I need?” Agatha almost choked out, burrowing further into Rio’s arms. “How do you know what I need <em>before</em> I even know?”</p><p>“Because I love you,” Rio murmured against her forehead. “And I know you better than anyone else.”</p><p>“That you do,” Agatha said, kissing her on the cheek. “I made breakfast.”</p><p>Rio pulled back a little so she could look Agatha in the eyes. “You made <em>breakfast</em>?”</p><p>“Oh, don’t sound so surprised,” Agatha huffed.</p><p>“What did you break? Or maim? Or steal?” Rio teased.</p><p>“I hate you,” Agatha grumbled, but leaned in for another kiss anyway.</p><p>Rio grinned against her lips. “Did you make pancakes?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha blushed.</p><p>Rio giggled as she stripped off her pajamas and bolted into the shower, the water hissing as it turned on. “Oh, I love guilt pancakes— <em>Baby</em>, come in quickly!”</p><p>Agatha poked her head into the shower, fully clothed. “I had a shower already— <em>oh</em>, don’t look at me like <em>that</em>.”</p><p>“You <em>hate</em> me,” Rio pouted.</p><p>Agatha softened. “I love you so much, baby,” she mumbled as she leaned into the shower, still fully clothed, trying to dodge the water.</p><p>Rio met her in the middle for a kiss. “If you loved me, you would come into the shower.”</p><p>Agatha looked so torn.</p><p>But she composed herself, leaned in and kissed Rio again, the tips of her hair and the edge of her shirt getting wet under the spray. “I can’t, but come to the kitchen when you’re done, I <em>have</em> something for you.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio mumbled against her lips. “You’re really going to give up showering with your <em>very</em> naked girlfriend? Especially when she will let you do <em>whatever</em> you <em>want</em> to her?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, and pulled back, hovering near the entrance of the shower. “Baby, your mom is still here.”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>And suddenly it all crashed into her, a tidal wave of suppressed emotions.</p><p>
<em>What you two are doing is unnatural, you know that?</em>
</p><p>
<em>You can’t get married, no one will show up.</em>
</p><p>
<em>My mother was right, you are unnatural.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You were a still born, you should have stayed that way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>From now, you won’t have a mother.</em>
</p><p>Suddenly, the thought of children didn’t seem as endearing as Rio thought they were, and suddenly, all she could see was a little boy with tears in his eyes asking Rio why she and Agatha spent all day screaming. All she could think about was a house but not a home, of too much anger in the silences, of lives lived separately, out of sync, in spite and loss and hatred. A life where she might end up looking at Agatha one day and finding that she didn’t look at Rio with any love anymore, with any happiness anymore—</p><p>“Breathe in.”</p><p>Something was cupping her cheek.</p><p><em>Agatha</em> was cupping her cheek.</p><p>
<em>Agatha was there.</em>
</p><p>“Breathe out.”</p><p>There was a hand on her chest, pressing softly above her heart.</p><p>Agatha brought Rio’s hand to her own chest, holding it there so Rio could feel her heart beat.</p><p>“Focus on my heartbeat, baby.”</p><p>
<em>Thump, thump, thump.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Soft, gentle, kind.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And present.</em>
</p><p>“Focus on it, my love,” Agatha was saying in the distance, but it was muffled. “And we breathe in,” Agatha took a deep breath, her chest rising. Rio followed, air flowing into her lungs with such force she almost fell to the ground.</p><p><em>Wait</em>, she was already on the ground.</p><p>
<em>How did she get here?</em>
</p><p>“Okay, good,” Agatha mumbled. “Now tell me five things you can see.”</p><p>“What?” Rio choked out, but her voice came out hoarse and raw.</p><p>“Five things you can see around you,” Agatha urged.</p><p>Rio looked around the shower in a daze. The shower was still running, everything was blurry and messy and a daze.</p><p>But Agatha wanted her to do something.</p><p>So, Rio was going to try.</p><p>“I see a shower head, uh, the door, um, the soap, your pink apron, and you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and nodded.</p><p>“Good, my love. Now four things you can touch.”</p><p>“Touch?” Rio stuttered.</p><p>The world felt liquid in this moment, soupy, molten.</p><p>“Yes, what are four things you can touch? How do they feel?”</p><p>Rio moved her thumb slowly where it rested against Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“I feel your blouse. It's wet.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, soft and low.</p><p>It encouraged Rio to keep speaking.</p><p>“I feel your hair. It’s thick and soft and also wet.”</p><p>Agatha took another long, deep breath, and Rio followed, air entering her lungs slowly.</p><p>“I feel the stone beneath my legs,” Rio continued, feeling the rough surface rub against her shin. “It’s hard and gritty.”</p><p>“One more,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio nodded, looking around for something else. Until, “I feel the water. It’s cold.”</p><p>“Very good, baby,” Agatha praised. “We’re halfway there. Can you name three things you can hear?”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath and said it all in one exhale, “I hear the water, and your breathing and your heartbeat.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand. “Two things you can smell?”</p><p>Rio wrinkled her nose. “I can’t really smell anything here. Except the water.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Last thing, what can you taste? Doesn’t have to be something you’re tasting right now, just imagine it, focus on it.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes.</p><p>And all she could think about was Agatha’s lips.</p><p>So, she leaned forward and captured them.</p><p>This kiss wasn’t hurried or desperate.</p><p>It was a whisper, a promise, a routine.</p><p>One that gave Rio a glimpse into soft mornings and rainy evenings, wrapped up in Agatha’s heart, listening to her heartbeat as the world drudged on around them.</p><p>This was what she had dreamed about for the last decade. Her only shot at a happy future.</p><p>And when Agatha pulled away, she felt like she was herself again.</p><p>She could feel movement in her toes, air in her lungs, and the soft tinging of their kiss on her lips.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio just stared.</p><p>The shower was still running in the distance and now Rio could see that Agatha was fully soaked, head to toe, her bright pink apron now a dark magenta.</p><p>“You’re wet,” Rio noted. “Why did you come into the shower with your clothes on?”</p><p>Agatha scrunched up her nose.</p><p>“You had a panic attack,” she said. “Nothing else mattered.”</p><p>
<em>Oh.</em>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know when she started crying, but this was definitely the moment she started bawling.</p><p>She slammed the shower knob shut and launched herself into Agatha’s arms, immediately burrowing her face in Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“You didn’t have to do that,” Rio mumbled into her neck, voice thick with emotion.</p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s middle and held her close to her heart. “You’re acting like you literally won’t jump into a pit of snakes for me if I asked you too.”</p><p>“It doesn’t mean you have to jump too,” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Oh but it does,” Agatha affirmed. “You jump, I jump, Jack.”</p><p>Rio wanted to laugh, but something was still pushing in on her neck, making her dizzy and light-headed.</p><p>“Agatha, you don’t have to do this. This is my family, my mess. You don’t need to fix it. Fix <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to swallow her words, but Agatha beat her to it.</p><p>“Rio, last night you told me that you want to carry my share of the world. Do you still mean it?”</p><p>Rio nodded quickly.</p><p>“Then why do you think that I <em>don’t</em> need to reciprocate the same love you show me?”</p><p>Each word was slow, carefully chosen.</p><p>But they hit Rio with the same damning force.</p><p>“I don’t know,” was all she could say.</p><p>It was all she knew to say.</p><p><em>Let it go</em>, her heart beat, hoping Agatha would hear it without the words leaving her mouth.</p><p>
<em>Don’t bring it up, please.</em>
</p><p>But Agatha had that determined look in her eye that only came when she sniffed out a lie and was hell-bent on uncovering the truth</p><p>“Does it have anything to do with…”</p><p>
<em>Her mother?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her father?</em>
</p><p>
<em>The two bat-shit crazy people who were her parents?</em>
</p><p>“It does,” Rio mumbled, holding Agatha closer. <em>Please don’t leave me.</em></p><p>Maybe if Rio held her hard enough, she wouldn’t want to leave.</p><p>“Have you ever thought of setting boundaries with them?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>“I can’t cut them off,” Rio cried into Agatha’s neck, words pouring out of place she didn’t even know feelings could hide. “I know I have to, at the back of my head, I know I have to, but they’re my <em>parents</em>. For all the horrible shit they have said to me, I have also said shit back, <em>so much shit</em>, Agatha. I literally told my mom to kill herself when I was fourteen. I’ve said worse stuff to my dad. I know it isn’t healthy the way we exist, but,” Rio felt her voice crack, “I can’t just <em>cut</em> them out of my life. But I don’t know how to keep going like this. I’m <em>scared</em>. I’m so, <em>so</em> scared that we will become <em>them</em>.”</p><p>Agatha cupped her face, thumbs gently tracing her skin.</p><p>“I never said you have to cut them off,” Agatha pacified. “Just that you have to set some ground rules—”</p><p>“They don’t respond to ground rules,” Rio said firmly. “I learned the hard way that I just have to roll over and take it. The screaming, it’s just the way we fight. I promise you it’ll blow over. But if I try to leave, if I try to push back, it won’t go well, trust me, I’ve tried—”</p><p>“Rio, Rio, breathe in, baby.”</p><p>Agatha was breathing in with her again.</p><p>
<em>Had she talked herself into another panic attack?</em>
</p><p>By the look in Agatha’s eyes, she had.</p><p>
<em>Goddamn it, why couldn't she just handle it herself—</em>
</p><p>“Baby, this may not be the right time, but I think you need to hear this,” Agatha spoke, pulling Rio’s focus back towards her. “Love is not <em>conditional</em>. There is no check-list of things you have to do. There is no fixed way it will be delivered to you. You’re allowed to ask for more. You’re allowed to ask for change. It won’t go away if you ask it to come to you a little differently.”</p><p>“But it almost has,” Rio choked out. “Every time I try to fight back, my parents remind me of all they have done, of all the ways they were hurt by their parents— what do I say in the face of all that?”</p><p>“You say <em>enough</em>,” Agatha said firmly. “You say <em>not anymore</em>.”</p><p>“I can’t,” Rio breathed.</p><p>“Will you let me then?”</p><p>“No— Agatha, don’t get in the middle of this, don’t—”</p><p>But Rio stopped short.</p><p>Because Agatha looked very, <em>very</em> guilty.</p><p>“Oh <em>no</em>, what did you do—”</p><p>“I was only trying to help, promise—”</p><p>The door bell rang.</p><p>And all hell broke loose.</p><p>“Rio,” her mother banged on the bathroom door. <em>“Why is your father here?”</em></p><p>“You called my father here?” Rio screeched.</p><p>“We kept in touch, I thought he would help—”</p><p>“This is the exact opposite of <em>helping</em>, Agatha—”</p><p>“Just let me <em>explain</em>—”</p><p>But Rio was already scrambling out of the shower and throwing on her discarded nightclothes to greet the absolute shit-show that was probably brewing outside.</p><p>But she opened the door to silence.</p><p>Rio bolted into the living room to find her father and mother talking… <em>normally?</em></p><p>In polite, hushed tones?</p><p>
<em>Had the apocalypse descended on them?</em>
</p><p>But then Victoria reared her head, “So, this is the trick up your sleeve—”</p><p>“Victoria,” a voice cut through the room.</p><p>It wasn’t Rio’s. Wasn’t her father’s either.</p><p>Agatha stepped through the doorway of their bedroom, still sopping wet, a single sheet of paper in her hand.</p><p>“I talked about this with Bertie today, but I’m suggesting this for the <em>both</em> of you,” Agatha leaned forward and put a piece of paper before them.</p><p>She looked up at Rio while Victoria read the piece of paper.</p><p>“Stop me anytime,” she whispered, voice thick with unshed tears. “I’m going to try my best not to, but stop me if I cross a line.”</p><p>Rio just stared at her, heart beating wildly in her chest.</p><p>Agatha was playing a dangerous game.</p><p>And Rio didn’t want the woman she loved to get hurt.</p><p>But before Rio could even try to stop her, Agatha started talking.</p><p>“I spent all night looking into a bunch of therapy clinics in your area, and I found one with a lot of therapists that specialize in relationship and family therapy. I didn’t want to pick one for you, so, um, I paid for five sessions with the clinic. Three for couples therapy and two as an individual season, each.”</p><p>She gulped and sneaked a quick look at Rio to check in, flashed a small smile, before quickly continuing. “I can’t make you do anything, but I really hope you <em>try</em>. Because Victoria the way you spoke to Rio will <em>never</em> happen again. It was not appropriate. It was <em>not okay</em>.”</p><p>Agatha took a shaky breath. “And I know it’s hard to leave all your scars behind. But as someone with," Agatha's voice cracked, "<em>not</em> great parents, I see one very big difference here. You both seem to care enough to show up. To try. So, now what I, we, are asking from you. You can’t hide your knife behind your love anymore. It’s hurting the woman I love, so please, <em>please</em>, if you love your daughter, then <em>try</em>. Try to be <em>better</em>. Try to <em>do</em> better. And maybe along the way you’ll heal yourself too.”</p><p>The world was blurry now.</p><p>Rio was sure there were tears in her eyes.</p><p>She wanted to throw her arms around Agatha just for <em>trying</em> to fix this.</p><p>Just for trying to <em>help</em>.</p><p>But she was so scared of what was coming next.</p><p>Victoria opened her mouth.</p><p>Bertie squeezed her knee softly.</p><p>And Victoria snapped it shut.</p><p>And nodded.</p><p>Rio staggered back.</p><p>
<em>This had never happened before.</em>
</p><p>“Today was the first time in probably ten years that your father told me he still cared about me,” Victoria choked out. “I don’t know where it came from, but I didn’t know how much I missed it until now.”</p><p>Bertie let out a small scoff, but there was no anger in it, only amazement.</p><p>“Today was the first time in a long time I realized that I do still have a <em>wife</em>,” he nodded, looking up at Agatha. “That if I tried, I might be able to salvage this.”</p><p>“So, I would like to try,” he said, turning to Victoria. “But you have to promise me, you leave the kids out of this. This is between you and me, and if the ship sinks, so be it.”</p><p>Victoria’s lip quivered under the weight of his words.</p><p>But she still nodded.</p><p>“I’ll send you the details,” Agatha murmured and moved to walk into the room, eyes lowered, hands trembling.</p><p>Rio wanted to run after her, but her mother caught her arm.</p><p>“I’m sorry, honey,” she said, eyes filled with tears. “For whatever it’s worth.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know where it came from, but she opened her mouth, “Show me,” Rio mumbled, courage rising. “Don’t say you’re sorry, <em>show me</em>.”</p><p>And possibly for the second time that day, completely ruining Rio from the inside and shattering her entire worldview, Victoria just nodded.</p><p>No fireworks, no fanfare.</p><p>“Victoria, can you go grab your stuff?” Bertie asked, moving up behind her.</p><p>Victoria silently moved away, leaving Rio alone with her father.</p><p>“Dad, what the hell is going on?” Rio blurted out the second the door closed.</p><p>“Did you know you could send 20,000 characters in a single text on iMessage,” Bertie said, opening his phone, and squinting at the text.</p><p>“I—<em>huh?</em>”</p><p>“Because I didn’t,” he nodded, then holding up the screen toward Rio, “Until I got this message this morning.”</p><p>There was a massive gray text bubble that consumed the entire screen and then more. Bertie tapped a small ‘show more’ at the end which opened even more text which he scrolled for a good few seconds and did not reach the end.</p><p>“Agatha wrote all of that?” Rio spluttered.</p><p>“Your girlfriend writes wonderfully, by the way,” Bertie said, pulling the phone back, before Rio could actually read any of it. “Real gift.”</p><p>“She— she wrote all <em>that</em>?”</p><p>Bertie nodded. “Imagine me, I wake up to a very long text from my daughter’s girlfriend which starts with <em>your wife is in our house, hope you know</em>. I did not know, by the way. My wife flew across the country and I did not even know.”</p><p>Rio’s mind was reeling.</p><p>Her heart felt so full.</p><p>Her brain, so impossibly heavy.</p><p>“What did Agatha say?”</p><p>Bertie let out a small laugh and shook his head. “So much, trust me <em>mija</em>, your girlfriend did not hold back.”</p><p>He took a deep breath, placing his hand on Rio’s shoulder. “I didn’t get it the first time I read it. I got really angry, actually. I didn’t like that someone from outside our family was telling me what to do.”</p><p>But then, in a warm, almost soft voice, “But I had nothing to do on the plane. So, I read it again. The second time, I understood it a little more. By the third time, I could cede that she had a point. And by the time I landed, I felt how deeply I had <em>failed</em> you.”</p><p>His voice cracked at the end. Rio had never seen her father cry.</p><p>“Because Agatha was right,” he whispered, voice thick with emotion. “You have been the bandaid covering the gaping hole in our marriage. We asked you to take on the mantle of parent when you were so young. You shouldn't have— Agatha said it has a psychological name, I think, uh, parentified child...? I have it written down on my notes app. I will read about it more."</p><p>But then he cleared his throat, eyes entirely glassy. "All I am saying is I agree with her. We have put you in such an awful position, and it is not <em>fair</em>. I love you, Rio. You’re <em>mi vida</em>. My entire life. I held your little hand in mine when you were born and promised you that I would not let anyone hurt you. And then I turned around and did just that.”</p><p>He leaned forward and brushed a tear from her cheek.</p><p>“But not anymore,” he promised. “This stops with me. Your mom and I, we’re going to figure it out. We’re going to be better. I can’t promise that your mom and I will fix things overnight, but just looking at her right now, backing down when I told her I still cared, it makes me think Agatha was right about yet <em>another</em> thing.”</p><p>Rio let out a wet laugh. “I’ve realized she’s right about most things.”</p><p>Bertie joined in, soft, joyful laughter ringing through the room.</p><p>“Something else particular happened,” Bertie stated, looking at Rio somberly. “You know how we lost your grandmother’s ring after her funeral?”</p><p>Rio nodded, sadness pinging in her heart.</p><p>She had always loved that ring.</p><p>It had a purple garnet in the center of a beautiful diamond azalea.</p><p>Years ago, she had begged her grandmother to give her the ring, because even fresh-out-of-college Rio Vidal knew it was <em>meant</em> for Agatha Harkness.</p><p>But the ring had disappeared right after the funeral five years ago.</p><p>“Well,” her father said, patting around his breast pocket, “In my hurry today, I grabbed the wrong jacket from the back of the coat closet, and guess what I found.”</p><p>He pulled out <em>the ring</em>.</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Rio gasped, grabbing it from his hands. “It can’t be.”</p><p>But Bertie just nodded enthusiastically. “Sometimes, things are just meant to be.”</p><p>Bertie kissed the top of her head.</p><p>“I know you don’t need my blessing or anything,” he said softly. “And I should probably give it to <em>her</em>, not you, but it’s so rare to find someone who will stick it to the world just to stand up for you. Don’t let a love like this slip from your hands.”</p><p>Rio stared at the ring in awe.</p><p>
<em>This had to be fate.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This had to be destiny.</em>
</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio murmured. “I’ve been planning a proposal for like two years.”</p><p>“Didn’t you only get together two months ago?”</p><p>Rio stared at her father with the best serious look she could muster in the face of all softness. “Yes.”</p><p>Bertie nodded, a giant smile breaking through. “I was thinking of inviting the <em>both</em> of you to dinner, but I think me and your mom should just go alone. Give you some time to make up properly.”</p><p>Rio shoved his shoulder.</p><p>He rubbed it in fake indignation. “You’re too big to be pushing me around. I’ll report you to your wife.”</p><p>“I’ll report you to your <em>wife</em>,” Rio threatened.</p><p>Bertie loosened his collar in mock horror. ‘Oh shit, mine is much scarier.”</p><p>Rio giggled with her father, feeling so damn <em>light</em>.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Victoria’s voice came into the room as she opened the door.</p><p>Bertie nodded, giving Rio one last kiss on her forehead, and trotted over towards their bedroom where he knocked twice.</p><p>Agatha opened the door apprehensively, now changed into dry sweatpants and a t-shirt.</p><p>“Thank you,” Bertie said before he took Agatha into a hug.</p><p>Agatha squeezed him tight and Rio could see how much it meant to her to have a parent-figure show her love.</p><p>It made Rio’s heart shatter into a million pieces.</p><p>Her parents left in a blur of quick farewells and promises to check in and suddenly the door slammed shut and it was just the two of them.</p><p>Rio could hear Agatha’s breath waver.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she stuttered out. “I—I didn’t want to overstep, I just wanted to help—”</p><p>But Rio had already closed the distance.</p><p>She kissed Agatha like she was <em>air</em>.</p><p>Like she was the answer to her prayer, water after a draught, a gift bestowed upon her by a cosmic entity.</p><p>Like she was her <em>salvation.</em></p><p>Because, in every single way, she was.</p><p>This weekend alone proved it.</p><p>Proved that they could handle the good with the bad.</p><p>Proved that they could do this, <em>forever.</em></p><p>When they surfaced neither of them said anything.</p><p>They just stood there, foreheads pressed, in the silence of the aftermath.</p><p>
<em>Because the storm has finally passed.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But they had made it through.</em>
</p><p>“We should go check on Scratchy,” Agatha mumbled eventually. “When I was in there, he was thumping against the cage like crazy.”</p><p>Rio let out an endeared scoff. “He’s so dramatic."</p><p>“He’s our son,” Agatha affirmed as she led Rio into their room.</p><p>And as Rio walked in behind her, going into their bedroom, in their home, to their bunny, with Agatha’s engagement ring tucked safely into her pocket, she had never felt safer.</p><p>Never felt happier.</p><p>Now all she had to do was keep her big mouth shut and not get on one knee until the time was right.</p><p>
<em>How hard could it be?</em>

<p>Agatha Harkness was expecting some kind of blow up.</p><p>She had probably crossed like seventeen lines in the last thirty minutes.</p><p>As she paced in the room, trying to give Rio and her parents some space after basically forcing therapy down their throats, she tried her best to not burst into tears.</p><p>Because she just wanted to <em>help.</em></p><p>And by the look on Rio’s face when she found out Agatha had texted her father, she did <em>not</em> help.</p><p>Scratchy thumped softly against the cage again and again, trying to get her attention, but she was too focused on the soft laughter ringing through the closed door.</p><p>That was a good sign, right?</p><p>Right?</p><p>Agatha was now very, very close to tears.</p><p>She didn’t mean to throw a live grenade into Rio’s life.</p><p>She didn’t mean to cause pain.</p><p>She had good intentions.</p><p>Fuck, she was doing it again, she was making it all about <em>her</em>—</p><p>There was a knock at the door.</p><p>Agatha quickly moved to open it and saw Bertie on the other end, eyes warm and amused.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said simply, and moved to give her the biggest hug.</p><p>Agatha burrowed into it, so fucking glad she hadn’t entirely destroyed Rio’s life.</p><p>And a small part of her broke and healed in this hug, at the non-transactional show of appreciation from a paternal figure.</p><p>She had never had that before.</p><p>Bertie softly whispered in her ear before they pulled away, “Remember what I said, okay? Don’t wait too long for the next step.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened and when she pulled back there was a teasing gleam in Bertie’s eyes.</p><p>
<em>Next step.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Would they even make it?</em>
</p><p>Agatha still blushed and stepped back, rubbing her chest to ease the sinking feeling in her chest.</p><p>Because when all was said and done, and the door slammed shut, Agatha couldn’t help but want to spiral all over again.</p><p>She expected, actually, no, <em>deserved</em>, Rio to tell her off, or seethe, maybe even yell.</p><p>But the last thing she expected Rio to do was jump into her arms and kiss her like she was everything.</p><p>Rio had actually been doing a lot of that today.</p><p>Shutting Agatha up with her lips.</p><p>Agatha should have been ashamed by how easily it fucking worked.</p><p>But she wasn’t.</p><p>She couldn’t help but bask in the warmth that came from Rio’s lips, the way she held her waist and tried to absorb her into her heart.</p><p>But she knew they had a lot more talking to do.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, Rio did not seem to share that idea.</p><p>Because minutes after Agatha led Rio into the room to check on Scratchy, Rio had her pinned to the wall, her knee between Agatha’s thighs, tongue down her throat.</p><p>“I can’t believe you did that,” Rio murmured against her lips as they pulled apart to take a few shaky breaths.</p><p>“I thought you would be mad—”</p><p>But Agatha’s words got swallowed by their next kiss.</p><p>Rio was really coming at her as if she was a woman <em>starved.</em></p><p>And Agatha would have been really into it if they weren’t carrying the weight of an important conversation on their back.</p><p>“Baby,” she panted when she pulled back. “We <em>need</em> to talk.”</p><p>“Later,” Rio mumbled, trying to pull her back in.</p><p>Agatha was not <em>strong</em> enough.</p><p>But as Rio’s hands trembled against her skin, she realized that this was another way Rio was running from something she didn’t want to say.</p><p>And she realized, in that moment, that maybe she needed to be strong enough for both of them.</p><p>“I’m scared,” Agatha blurted out as they rose for another round of air. “I am so scared.”</p><p>Rio stilled, arms dropping from their place under Agatha’s shirt as she pulled back.</p><p>“I’m scared, too,” she mumbled, lip quivering.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it,” Agatha asked, already hating the way Rio seemed so broken.</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes shut, but nodded anyway.</p><p>“I, uh, don’t know where to start,” she whispered, eyes tracing the ground.</p><p>
<em>Oh, my love.</em>
</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said, reaching out to take her hand and leading her towards their bed. She sat down, legs crossed on the covers and Rio did the same.</p><p>They were facing each other, fingers still intertwined, but Rio was still looking down, looking away.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio mumbled, her finger traced a pattern into the duvet.</p><p>“I love you, too,” Agatha affirmed, squeezing her hand. “You don’t have to talk about anything you don’t have to.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio whispered, squeezing her eyes shut. “Can I ask you a question?”</p><p>“Of course, baby.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, a sliver of a smile shining through. “What did you write to my Dad?”</p><p>Agatha never had a greater urge to crawl into a hole and die.</p><p>“Uh, just a little something,” she mumbled, rubbing her neck.</p><p>“I thought we were being honest here,” Rio raised her brow. “Where did all of this come from Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha sighed deeply and shook her head.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to make fun of me for this,” she threatened.</p><p>Rio tilted her head in confusion but nodded anyway.</p><p>“Okay, sometimes, only when I am really, really confused,” Agatha took a deep breath. “Sometimes I go on… Reddit.”</p><p>Rio gulped, eyes wide and then burst into laughter.</p><p>“You promised you wouldn’t make fun of me for this!” Agatha whined, snatching her hand from Rio’s and crossing her arms.</p><p>Rio squeezed her lips shut and tried to compose herself.</p><p>Agatha pouted, but continued, “I, <em>sometimes</em>, log into Reddit just to get advice on things I can’t ask people in real life about… <em>stop laughing.</em>”</p><p>A snicker escaped before Rio composed herself.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. <em>Continue.</em>”</p><p>“Last night, I couldn’t sleep because, well, everything that happened…” Agatha sighed again, squeezing her eyes shut.</p><p>Suddenly, Rio wasn’t laughing anymore.</p><p>She reached forward and grabbed Agatha’s hand again, squeezing it softly.</p><p>“I, uh, asked for advice on what to do. I— I didn’t mention any details, promise. Just that your mom said some horrible things and how guilty I felt for making it worse.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, tears pricking her eyes.</p><p>“What did Reddit say?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>“Someone on Reddit told me to write it all out. Like just get all my feelings down on paper and sometimes it helps to write it like a letter and before I knew it I was writing a letter to your dad. I don’t know why… actually I do know why. He’s probably the only parental figure I’ve kept in touch with…”</p><p>“You kept in touch with my Dad?” Rio asked, eyes wide.</p><p>Agatha gulped. “Uh, he sends me birthday wishes on Facebook and I keep him updated on the big milestones and stuff, and, uh, sometimes we text each other to check in on you.</p><p>Rio looked like her brain was caving in.</p><p>“He even texted me when we got together,” Agatha blurted out.</p><p>“He did?” Rio blinked, bewildered.</p><p>Agatha nodded, a soft smile setting on her lips. “He did. He said something sweet too… wait, let me find it.”</p><p>Agatha pulled out her phone and scrolled past the insanely long ramble she had sent Rio’s dad as fast as she could before finding the messages from two months ago.</p><p>“He said, <em>thank god you two finally saw what we’ve been seeing for a decade. Please don’t wait this long before the wedding.</em>”</p><p>“He did not say that,” Rio groaned, grabbing the phone from her hand and reading his texts. “Wow, he is not subtle at all.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “What does that mean?”</p><p>“Uh, nothing,” Rio said far too quickly.</p><p>Agatha pouted again. “Honesty goes both ways.”</p><p>“Trust me,” Rio shook her head. “If I tell you what I am thinking right now, you <em>will</em> murder me.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, but let the discussion drop.</p><p>Instead, she picked up a far more lethal thread.</p><p>“Do you think we’re moving too fast?”</p><p>Rio blinked into the silence as the question rolled over her.</p><p>“Too <em>fast</em>?” she spluttered. “Do <em>you</em> think we’re moving too fast?”</p><p>Agatha rubbed her temple, “I—I don’t know. I want to marry you like now, I want to have your adorable, stubborn children, but it’s only been <em>two</em> months, Rio. You’ve had <em>foot fungus</em> for longer than that. Am I crazy?”</p><p>“You’re not crazy,” Rio said softly, cupping Agatha’s cheek. “You’re not crazy because I want it too.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>“You know I do,” Rio smiled, a tease creeping through the softness. “I think I’ve been very clear about how much I want <em>you</em>. How much I want a <em>future</em> with you.”</p><p>Agatha looked down, lower lip trembling. “I know, but I don’t want to rush this. I don’t want to fuck it up because we are going too fast.”</p><p>“We’re ten years in the making, Agatha,” Rio gently brushed her thumb along her face. “We have ten years worth of knowing each other—of loving each other— under our belt. Two months is crazy for strangers. But you and I, we were always destined to end up here. From the moment I met you, there could never be anyone else.”</p><p>Agatha gasped, leaning into Rio’s touch, feeling the weight of her confession seep into her bones.</p><p>“Liar,” Agatha mumbled, unable to help herself. “You literally had a girlfriend three months—”</p><p>“I’m never living this down, am I?” Rio groaned.</p><p>“You can’t say you loved me <em>forever</em> when you had a girlfriend who was not me—”</p><p>“For like <em>two</em> seconds Agatha. You spent longer in the <em>hospital</em> than I did with Nat—”</p><p>“Still,” Agatha pouted. “I can’t believe you <em>dated</em> her.”</p><p>“What’s this actually about, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>
<em>Why did Rio need to know her so well?</em>
</p><p>“Sometimes, and I know this is irrational, but sometimes, I don’t entirely believe you mean it when you say you love me. It feels a little too perfect, like this is all a giant prank and someone is going to come out of this and say <em>fooled ya!</em> any second.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio sighed, pulling her a little closer. “I swear if you rip my chest open at this moment, there is a ninety-nine percent chance your name is etched into the muscles of my heart. I’m not joking, I think it’ll show up in an MRI.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but nothing to stop the lightness which was spreading rapidly around her chest.</p><p>Agatha should have let it roll over her entirely.</p><p>But she was never good at just letting things be.</p><p>“Can I ask you a question, too?”</p><p>Rio nodded softly.</p><p>“Do you ever feel like I don’t love you enough?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio fluttered, as if this was never a thought that crossed her mind.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I mean, you have all these ways of making me feel so loved— the post-its every morning, the driving lessons, the times you come home from work so we can spend time together. I just— I don’t feel like I do <em>enough</em> for you.”</p><p>Rio grazed her thumb against Agatha’s cheek, soft and grounding.</p><p>“Why do you think it has to be equal?” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “So, you admit it—”</p><p>“No, my love,” Rio cut through, “I just think that sometimes there will be days where you will have more love to give, just like there will be days I will have more. If we fall into this trap, into who loves who more, into how much is being bartered, it stops being about love and starts being about everything else.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>“You’re right,” she nodded, taking another studying breath.</p><p>“I just can’t get that voice out of my head that keeps telling me that you’re too good to me, that you will leave, too.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, nudging her to open her eyes. “This might not be about me loving you. I think this has to with you loving yourself.”</p><p>Agatha gasped, feeling the air seep out of her body.</p><p>But Rio, in true Rio fashion, continued, “That voice will always be there until you see it too, you see all the ways that you are wonderful, you find all the things about you that are good.”</p><p>“This cannot be about self-love,” Agatha scoffed, her walls rising instantly. “You sound like one of those millennial posters with a cat on it.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, a small smirk creeping in, “You can deflect all you want, Agatha. But I’ll start sending you Pinterest quotes every single day until you start thinking about it seriously.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and shoved her, and Rio fell back on the bed, laughing relentlessly.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but join in, and when they collapsed from all the giggles, they were both on their backs, facing the ceiling.</p><p>“Do you?” Agatha asked, head still looking up.</p><p>“Do I what?” Rio murmured.</p><p>“Do you love yourself?”</p><p>Rio took a long, deep breath in, considering her words.</p><p>A moment passed, the curtains fluttered in a soft breeze from the cracked window, Scratchy nibbled on something, and they just lay there, open and raw.</p><p>“I don’t think I hate myself,” Rio mumbled into the silence, still facing the ceiling. “My parents were always good at that, at making me feel like I was worth the world.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, nodding along.</p><p>“But I don't think I love myself either,” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Why?” Agatha breathed.</p><p>Rio kept staring upwards, clearly fighting some impulse.</p><p>“I guess they also were really good at making me feel small,” she sighed. “It’s weird, I don’t know how to explain it. It was like I was royalty and the dirt at the bottom of a shoe all at once. Like I had no power, but at the same time, I was the most powerful being in the world.”</p><p>“Like Death?” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>Rio looked over, and asked a confused, “What?”</p><p>“Like Death,” Agatha said, turning over on her shoulder to face Rio, “Like you are the most feared entity in the world, but you have no power to kill, just take.”</p><p>“Yeah, something like that,” Rio nodded, turning over on her shoulder, too.</p><p>“So, we both need to work on it, huh?” Agatha asked, reaching over to twirl a strand of Rio’s hair. “The self love?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio affirmed. “We probably need a lot of therapy too.”</p><p>“You’re so lucky I spent last night researching this very thing,” Agatha smiled. “I weaseled us into a session for Tuesday.”</p><p>“You booked one <em>already</em>?” Rio spluttered, rising up slightly.</p><p>Agatha gulped. “I’m sorry if I assumed, I just thought—”</p><p>“When were you going to tell me?” Rio asked, there was no anger in her tone, but Agatha felt it anyway.</p><p>“Now?” Agatha trembled. “Are you mad?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, leaning on her head on her folded arm. “Stop assuming I’m mad, baby. I’m not, I’m just… I wish you would loop me into all of this. I wish you had woken me up last night and talked to me.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I didn’t want to disturb you—”</p><p>“You always get to disturb me, Agatha,” Rio blurted out. “I’ll put it in writing, I’ll stamp it on the walls. You can always wake me up or call me or… burst into the shower, I don’t care. I just want to be in the game. I am okay with it as long as I <em>know</em>. So, we can do it together.”</p><p>Agatha let her confession linger in the air.</p><p>She let it settle in her heart.</p><p>She let herself believe she could do it.</p><p>“We can,” Agatha nodded. “We can do it together.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward and pressed her forehead to Agatha’s, tears brewing in her eyes.</p><p>“I love you,” she murmured.</p><p>“I love you, too,” Agatha smiled and kissed the tip of her nose.</p><p>“I guess I have to write a thank you note to Reddit now,” Rio mumbled, picking up Scratchy from her lap where he was twitching uncontrollably and nuzzling his fear.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You have <em>no idea</em> just how much you have to thank Reddit for, okay?”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>“Agatha… what else do I have to thank Reddit for?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and tried to get up but in one swift move Rio pulled her back down.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” she said in that particular tone of hers that left absolutely no room for bullshit.</p><p>“Okay, fine,” Agatha snapped, pushing Rio off her slightly so she could look anywhere else. “Do you remember that guitar pick I got you for your birthday four years ago? Reddit. And the color of the guest bathroom? Reddit. And Scratchy? Also Reddit.”</p><p>“What do you mean by Scratchy is because of <em>Reddit</em>?” Rio squeaked. “We rescued him on a walk.”</p><p>Agatha sighed for the upteenth time, quite annoyed that she was revealing this part of herself.</p><p>“I <em>might</em> have been crashing out a <em>little</em> when you were taking care of me…” Agatha whispered, eyes focused on Scratchy. “And I went on Reddit and someone suggested we should get out of the house, you know, get some space between us. And now look at us, we have a rabbit.”</p><p>Rio looked like her brain was malfunctioning.</p><p>“You went on Reddit because you were crashing out because of… <em>me</em>?”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her and pouted.</p><p>“I was in deep, <em>deep</em> denial, okay?”</p><p>Rio smirked and leaned down to kiss her.</p><p>“Will you let me read one of those posts one day?” she asked between kisses.</p><p>“I hate you,” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>“No, you <em>loooveee me</em>,” Rio sing-songed back.</p><p>And she leaned forward to shut her up with her lips, but Rio caught her kiss and deepened it immediately, bruising her with a long, sentimental one that left not a single doubt in her head that they were in this together.</p><p>“Good job, baby,” she muttered against Rio’s lips.</p><p>“For what?” Rio asked as she leaned in for another kiss.</p><p>Agatha deepened it immediately, snaking her tongue into her lips and threading her hands in her hair.</p><p>They pulled back for a breath, and Agatha continued, “For talking, and communicating, and—”</p><p>Rio was kissing her again, pulling herself onto her lap and raking her fingers over her back.</p><p>“You too,” Rio praised, breaking the kiss to pepper a few on her neck. "We should get some kind of reward.”</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Agatha panted, as Rio sucked into the soft flesh of her neck. “What kind of reward?”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, brown eyes sparkling as she whispered, “The kind where you make me forget my own name.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, tracing her thumb down Rio’s jaw. “Yeah, like the bathroom a few days ago?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened.</p><p>“Yes, Daddy, exactly like that,” Rio cooed, and then gagged.</p><p>Agatha gulped. “Since your father visited and is fresh in our brains, why don’t we retire the Daddy moniker for a bit.”</p><p>“Yes, please,” Rio shuddered. “I cannot be thinking of them while we do it.”</p><p>“I guess we have to find something new to call each other,” Agatha teased, pulling Rio’s shirt over her head leaving her in her black sport’s bra.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio breathed as she haphazardly tried to pull Agatha’s sweatpants off. “Like what?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha teased. “What about… <em>wife</em>?”</p><p>Rio froze, arms falling limp against her side, eyes boring into her own.</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brow, “Rio?”</p><p>“What did you say?” Rio choked out.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, leaning close towards her ear and rubbing her hips against Rio’s jeans.</p><p>“I said,” she murmured, breath hot against Rio’s ear. “Make me your <em>wife</em>.”</p><p>Rio began panting uncontrollably, staring at her with those big, beautiful brown eyes, “Do you want that?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, grinding into the thick material of her jeans faster now.</p><p>“So desperately, baby,” Agatha moaned. “I want to be yours.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her hips and slowed her down, forcing her to look at her in the eyes again. “Do you <em>truly</em> mean it?”</p><p>Agatha leaned down and kissed her.</p><p>“I do,” she murmured into her lips. “I am already entirely <em>yours</em>.”</p><p>Rio nodded as if she was considering something.</p><p>Agatha pushed her down and hopped off her, falling to knees and fishing their toys out of the box they were banished in.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Rio called out behind her as Agatha opened the door.</p><p>“I am not about to have toys that have been sitting in a shoebox underneath our bed be used without a thorough washing,” Agatha sniped as she sauntered into the kitchen with the shoebox.</p><p>Rio did not follow.</p><p>Honestly, Agatha did not expect her too, she was probably still dazed.</p><p>Carefully, she unwrapped the two straps from their cloth bags and rinsed them with soap and water, as she brought a pot of water to boil (in her special blue pot that was wildly different from all the other pots and pans and explicitly demarcated for non-cooking purposes).</p><p>She heard Rio scramble around in the room, and moments later, she tumbled out, still in her sport’s bra and jeans, and bolted into the guest room.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha called out, “What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio walked out of the room with an armful of candles.</p><p>“Do we have any more of these?” Rio asked as she walked back to their room.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked again, as she dropped the silicone in the water.</p><p>“Romance,” Rio yelled back.</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows.</p><p>
<em>Well, who was she to stop her girlfriend?</em>
</p><p>“There might be some more candles in the storage closet,” Agatha called out and Rio bolted across the room again, whipping open the storage closet next to the door.</p><p>She ruffled around it for a second and pulled out a giant tub of scented candles from the absolute bottom of the closet.</p><p>“Why do we have so many candles?” Rio asked, blinking at the at least sixty candles of varying shapes, sizes and scents in the plastic lidded box.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “I like candles.”</p><p>“Good enough for me,” Rio shrugged and waddled back into the room.</p><p>Agatha looked back at her task then, noting that the toys needed about three more minutes, began wetting a dishcloth for the vibrators.</p><p>Rio ran past her again, whipping open the door and grabbing two plastic bags of something Agatha couldn’t exactly figure out but was sure she would find about in a moment.</p><p>She plucked the dildos out of the boiling water with a pair of tongs, and laid them to rest with the wiped down vibrators.</p><p>“Rio,” she called out, “Come pick which one we are going to use.”</p><p>“Come in here first,” Rio yelled back.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and picked the purple dick, walking back towards the room with a silly smile on her face from the effort Rio was putting in to make this moment sweeter.</p><p>“What is all this fuss about,” Agatha teased as she swung open the door.</p><p>And then she paused.</p><p>And blinked a few times.</p><p>And tried not to faint.</p><p>Because the lights were off and Rio was illuminated by the flickering light of her hundred-or-so candles, and there were rose petals on the floor and their bed was all neatly made, and Rio was on the floor, on one knee, with a goddamn ring in her hand.</p><p>No box, no.</p><p>Just the ring.</p><p>Rio looked at her eyes shining.</p><p>Her fingers were slightly trembling.</p><p> Rio wasn’t wearing a shirt. </p><p> Agatha wasn’t wearing pants. </p><p>She was holding a fake dick in her hands.</p><p>It was entirely unplanned.</p><p>But it couldn’t have been more <em>perfect.</em></p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>
<em>“Yes.” </em>
