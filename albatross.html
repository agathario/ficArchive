<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>If there was one thing Rio was ever taught by her parents, it was to put her family above all else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was an easy thing to follow when she was younger. A missed birthday here, a college decision there. Everything she did, Rio believed it was for the best, both for herself and her family. That was what you were supposed to do. That was what it meant to be a good daughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio never questioned this philosophy until now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio stared out the car window, there was a heaviness in the air that only worsened her anxiety. Out of a habit, she lifted a hand to gnaw on the nail of her thumb. The finger barely brushed her lips before her mother, Paola, slapped it away. Rio flinched and pressed her hands to her thighs. She didn’t need to look at her mother to see the admonishing look on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Remember,” Luis said, “All you have to do is smile.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luis Vidal used to be Rio’s hero. Growing up, Rio used to follow her father around whenever she could, awed by the way he commanded a room and persuaded others to follow his lead. It was like having a super power in her eyes, this ability to make things happen the way Luis seemed to do. When Rio asked her father how he managed to do this, he sat her in front of a chessboard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luis was merciless in the way he taught her chess, but Rio only worked harder to meet her father’s expectations. As they played together, Luis explained how every meeting he had was like a game of chess. He winked at her and said, “It’s all about strategy. You just have to know your opponent’s next move.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, at the age of twenty-nine, Rio found herself one step behind her father, a helpless pawn set out for the sacrifice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’ll be okay,” Paola told her. She placed her hand over Rio’s before she could start picking at them. “They’re a good family.” Paola’s laugh was forced and light. “But you know that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Making small talk over a glass of champagne was much different than marriage, Rio wanted to point out. Instead, she gave a wan smile and kept her eyes firmly on the window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Far too quickly, they arrived at the Harkness Estate, a sprawling piece of land in Upstate New York. Although Rio had grown up privileged, she felt the enormity of the wealth that came with being the bloodline of old money. Rio stepped out of the car and eyed the looming house with trepidation. Calling it a house felt like an understatement. Rio had seen museums smaller than this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed her parents to the door, where they were greeted by a maid who ushered them inside and took their coats. As she glanced around, she took note of the decor. Antiques littered the tables and walls, and Rio had no doubt that each one was at least a few centuries old. None of them were ugly at least, but Rio always wondered what the point of collecting such expensive, useless items was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our honored guests! How lovely it is to see you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stiffened, but she still turned to greet their host with a smile. She held out her arms and accepted the brief hug Evanora swept her into, barely refraining from flinching as Evanora’s breath ghosted against her cheek as a kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you are still absolutely stunning,” Evanora said. She squeezed her arms and added, “Goodness, I see the summer sun has been kind to you. You look positively exotic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The smile nearly dropped off Rio’s face, but she managed to hold onto it. Rio’s voice was remarkably even as she answered, “Thank you, Mrs. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Evanora. We’ll be family soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course. Evanora.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were led into the sitting room, and while her parents joined Evanora on the couch and the armchairs, Rio took a deep breath as she met James where he stood by the window. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It hadn’t been that long since she last saw him at an event, and James looked just the same as he always had. Objectively, he was handsome with round, brown eyes, a square jaw, and neatly styled brown hair. Rio didn’t feel an ounce of attraction towards him though. Not even as he leaned in and gave her a hug, letting his hands rest firm against her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” James said warmly. “I hope the drive wasn’t too arduous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not at all,” Rio replied. She smiled, trying to match his ease. “Thank you for inviting us. Your home is beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This, at least, Rio could handle. There was a kind of small talk Rio could do in her sleep, and that was all that was required of her so far. A simple cycle of compliments and catch-ups, never dipping into anything more than carefully feigned interest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When a maid slipped into the room and whispered into Evanora’s ear, the woman stood up and announced, “I hope you’re starved. I had my chef prepare a special set of courses for us tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started to move when Luis said, “Is your daughter not joining us?” He had an eyebrow raised in an expression Rio was well accustomed to. “I was under the impression this was a family affair.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s smile became strained as she said, “Unfortunately, Agatha lives by her own schedule. She will join us when she joins us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio caught a glimpse of dismay cross her father’s face, and when she glanced at James, she saw a similar expression. When he caught her looking though, James schooled his face into a charming grin and guided her to the dining room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The reactions made Rio curious. Of course, Rio had heard of Agatha before. Everyone knew about Agatha Harkness, the black sheep of her family. The youngest daughter of the Harknesses, Agatha had always been at the center of any discourse. In the beginning, it was of her potential. Stunning in a way that was almost aristocratic, quick thinking in every subject, and practically a prodigy at the cello. Destined for greatness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, Agatha had rebelled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Three years her junior, Rio had only been eleven when she first heard news of Agatha’s transformation from socialite darling to family embarrassment. It was only rumors, but Rio heard it all, the sex and drugs and run-ins with the law. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It became clear that Agatha Harkness was not fit for the world she’d been born into. Too rough around the edges. Too willing to cross the lines. Too curious for her own good. Too much of everything, apparently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had always wondered how it must feel to live like that. To disappoint everyone who loved you. But also, to be free.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone had just taken their seats when the front door opened, followed by the giggles of one of the maids. If Evanora’s smile had been strained before, it was brittle now. One move away from shattering her shiny facade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Speak of the devil,” Evanora said. She inclined her head to a spot behind Rio. “Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, Mother. You know how traffic is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The voice was low, but the tone was flippant. Rio felt a shiver pass through her at the sound. A hand brushed against the back of her chair before Agatha passed by, falling into Rio’s line of sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, Rio noted, must take after their late father. She was nothing but sharp features, something that was only further emphasized by her long, dark hair against pale skin and bright blue eyes. Agatha was beautiful, just as the rumors always said. Unlike the dresses Rio and the other woman wore, Agatha wore a tailored suit like the men, complete with a maroon tie that matched the color painting her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes felt too intense as they landed on her. With a slight curl of her lips, Agatha said, “And you must be the bride-to-be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Rio said. A blush spread across her cheeks, one that only worsened as Agatha’s smile grew. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat down in the only seat left, right across from Rio. It made sense, in a way. Evanora and Paola sat across from each other, as did James and Luis. Why would it be odd from Rio to sit across from her future sister-in-law?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite telling herself this, Rio felt out of sorts all throughout dinner. She could hardly taste the food that was placed in front of her, eating it robotically. Every time she tried to follow along with the conversation, she felt her eyes drawn back to Agatha, who made no effort to hide her stare. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why were you late?” Rio finally asked. Beside her, Luis was asking James about a meeting he’d had with a city council member recently. Rio couldn’t have cared less. She had to say something to someone though, or else she’d go mad with the way Agatha’s eyes seemed to be burning into her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Agatha looked surprised to have been asked a question, but then she picked up her wine glass and gave it a contemplative swirl. “Traffic. Didn’t you hear?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost laughed. She kept her voice quiet as she said, “We both know there was no traffic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My, my, are you trying to imply something?” Agatha said. There was no actual offense in her voice. Amusement, more than anything. She rested her chin on her hand and tilted her head at Rio, a thread of condescension to the action that made Rio bristle. “I mean, as eager as I was to meet my brother’s fiancée, I do have a life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which was it, drawing up the papers for someone’s divorce or kicking another woman out of your brownstone?” Rio said without thinking. She hadn’t meant to mention the tawdry details included in the rumors surrounding Agatha. She held her breath, waiting for the yelling, but Agatha only looked like she was holding back a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pout was nothing but mocking as she said, “Aw, is someone jealous of my job?” She smirked and leaned in, “Or maybe my sex life?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m a doctor,” Rio hissed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not for long,” Agatha said without missing a beat. “And I don’t hear any denial about the sex.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand tightened around her knife, but before she could do much more than that, James asked her for her opinion on locations for the honeymoon. Rio tried to deflect, letting her mind process the back-and-forth that had just happened. Her hands were clammy, and her heart was beating just a bit faster than normal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t normal for Rio to not get along with others. Even at work, Rio usually ended up with the most prickly of nurses because her more easy-going attitude made things run smoothly. There was just something about Agatha though, something that made Rio’s walls go up and pushed her to attack first. Rio didn’t want to think of a conversation where Agatha had the upper hand. Or, </span>
<em>
<span>more</span>
</em>
<span> of an upper hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As dinner continued, Rio was included in more of the conversations, leaving her to pretend to care about what kind of napkins would be used at the reception and how she might style her hair for the wedding. It wasn’t until dessert was served that Rio felt something brush her ankle. She nearly fell out of her chair from startling so badly. While everyone asked if she was okay, Rio found her gaze drawn to Agatha, the one person to not look surprised. Rio knew she hadn’t imagined it, a pointed heel against her leg. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Rio said. She forced a clumsy laugh and said, “I think my foot fell asleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>James wore an indulgent smile, but Rio saw the disapproval in her father’s eyes. When she looked away, she was met with Agatha’s smile, a knowing edge to it that made Rio want to bolt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t try anything else during the meal, but when their families said good-bye, her hug was far tighter than courtesy required with her hands lingering on Rio’s hips and back. “Until next time,” Agatha whispered in her ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t get out of that house fast enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t until she was in the car, heading back into the city, that Rio let herself relax. Of course, that didn’t last for very long. A few minutes into the drive, Paola said, “I think that went well, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio said nothing, thinking she was talking to her father, but when the silence went on too long, she looked away from the window to find both of her parents looking at her expectantly. “It was fine,” Rio said. She lifted her hand to her mouth, and this time, Paola did not stop her as Rio bit at her thumb nail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be like that,” Paola sighed. “You could be a little more excited, you know. You’re getting married, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exciting, isn’t it?” Luis chimed in. He reached out and tugged Rio’s hand away from her mouth, clutching it in his own. “My little girl is getting married in just one month.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only smiled and let her hand eventually fall from his grip. The conversation shifted away from her, and Rio was left to stare out the window once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’d been three weeks since Rio found out about this marriage. It’d been two weeks since Rio accepted it. It’d been one week since Rio received a diamond ring that fit her perfectly, delivered by courier with a handwritten note from James.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’d been fifteen years since Rio knew she was a lesbian.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was the crux of it all. It didn’t matter how kind or thoughtful or handsome James was. It would never matter. This, Rio could have lived with. A loveless marriage to a man who could have been worse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But then, there just had to be Agatha, an infuriating woman that made Rio’s unfortunate situation even worse. Yet even as she rankled Rio’s nerves and made her want to crawl out of her skin to avoid her gaze, she would always be infinitely more attractive, more </span>
<em>
<span>interesting</span>
</em>
<span>, to Rio than James. And she was, both attractive and interesting, no matter how much Rio loathed her at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had thought she had more time to deal with the fact that she’d never have what she desired most, but now, it was just one month. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One month. That was how long Rio had to reconcile the fact that for the rest of her life she would want her sister-in-law in ways she would never want her husband.</span>

<p>
<span>If there was one thing Rio was going to miss when she inevitably moved, it would be her garden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure if garden was an exaggeration for the handful of planters and pots scattered around her balcony, but she loved it all the same. Whenever she came out here, watering and tending to her plants, Rio got a few minutes of peace, a few minutes to breathe. It was easily her favorite part of the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Would it be possible to take her plants with her? Would James allow that?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Immediately, Rio cringed at her own thoughts. Allow. Like she was some naive child begging to bring a stray dog home, instead of a grown woman wanting to take her belongings with her once she was married. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached underneath one of the chairs on her balcony, digging through a dirty blanket until she found a plastic bag. Inside was a half-filled carton of cigarettes and a lighter. This was the one thing Rio had done in her youth that would have even remotely qualified as rebellious, and it was a habit that had stuck with her through the years. While she didn’t smoke nearly as much as she had in college, Rio still found herself reaching for it whenever she was particularly stressed or upset. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Leaning against the railing, Rio looked out at the city beneath her and sighed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What the hell had she gotten herself into?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was contemplating this question when her doorbell rang. Knowing who it was, she didn’t bother to put out her cigarette as she went to answer the door. Alice looked unsurprised to see it in her hand, but she still said, “That bad?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m marrying a man,” Rio replied, stepping back to let her in. “What do you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you should be day drinking, not smoking, but what do I know?” Alice said with a shrug. She checked her phone and asked, “Should we go ahead and leave now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took another drag from her cigarette. There was an appointment at ten to look at wedding dresses. It was the kind of thing that should evoke a sense of excitement, not an ever-increasing dread. Rio’s lack of enthusiasm had been palpable over the phone last week, so as a show of good will, Paola encouraged her to invite Alice, her longtime friend from college. Really, the only person Rio talked to outside of family these days. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Might as well,” Rio said. “Let me grab my coat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>To kill a bit of time, not to mention dispel some of the smell of smoke clinging to her, Rio and Alice walked to the boutique where Rio was sure her dress would cost as much as a small car. As they walked, Rio caught Alice up on the details of her impending marriage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“At least he’s not a total stranger,” Alice reasoned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not a stranger but not a friend either,” Rio said. “Not that it really matters in a political marriage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice bumped her shoulder against Rio’s. “And his views?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Could be worse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As in?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, “Not a complete idiot, but he’s definitely more traditional.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So it’s like that,” Alice said with a wince. She shoved her hands deeper into the pockets of her jacket. “But he treats you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled sharply through her nose. Not quite a laugh but amused all the same. “Alice, I haven’t spoken to him for more than ten minutes, and it’s never been alone,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some guys are pretty fucking awful from the start,” Alice pointed out. Her eyebrows were drawn together, and her voice dropped into a grumble. “Forgive me for checking to see if he’s one of them.” Her lips were twisted into a frown, and Rio noticed just how tense her shoulders were. She was reminded that she wasn’t the only one unhappy about this arrangement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio murmured. “I just don’t like thinking about how little I know about him. About all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice didn’t say anything at first. They walked in silence for a minute or two, arms brushing as they went. When she spoke, Alice kept her eyes straight ahead. “You could just not marry him,” Alice said quietly, almost indistinguishable over the noise of traffic. It wasn’t the first time Alice had said this to her, and it certainly wasn’t going to be the last.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The memory of Alice finding out about the marriage was still clear in her mind. Tipsy, indignant Alice grabbing Rio by the shoulders and spewing half-formed plans about running away and changing their identities. When Rio had laughed and shaken her off, telling her she didn’t want to leave or change her name or do any of that, Alice had said the same thing. Just don’t marry him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, Rio’s smile softened into something mournful. “We both know I can’t do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reluctantly, Alice met her gaze. She nodded once before looking away, lips pressed together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If there was anyone who would understand the pressure of doing right by her parents, after everything they sacrificed for her, it was Alice. It had been a long, tearful conversation the night Rio broke the news to her, but at the end of it, there had been a painful resignation. Alice didn't like it, but she understood it. After all, Alice’s mother had died for her to be where she was today, something Alice hated to talk about. It didn’t get any more guilt-inducing than that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You deserve to be happy,” was all Alice said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, “Yeah, well, who’s actually happy these days?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice looked like she wanted to say something, but after a moment, she shook her head and asked how her plants were doing. It was easier to pretend everything was normal with a topic like that, and Rio relished in falling into the comfort of talking to Alice. It had always felt natural with Alice, like finding a kindred spirit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That feeling was what Rio clung to as they stepped inside the bridal boutique, immediately blinded by all different shades of white in every material imaginable. Rio sidled closer to Alice, standing half-behind her as if she might be able to protect her from what was to come. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s thumb had just jammed itself into the cuticle of her index fingers when Paola called out, “Rio, over here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the back corner of the boutique, Paola, Evanora, and Agatha were waiting for them. While Paola and Evanora sat together on one of the couches, Agatha sat in a single chair, arms crossed. Rio wondered if Agatha had come from work, given the tight pencil skirt and blouse she wore. It cut a much more feminine figure of her, but no less domineering. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forced her eyes away from her as she walked up to the group.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello,” Rio greeted, giving a polite nod. “I hope you weren’t waiting too long.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just a few minutes,” Paola said. She stood up and hugged her briefly, and to Rio’s relief, Evanora and Agatha made no move to do the same. “It gave us a chance to pick out some dresses for you already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yay,” Rio said, trying to sound excited, but going by both Alice and Agatha’s snorts, it wasn’t very convincing. Rio elbowed her friend and said, “This is Alice, everyone. My friend from college. She’ll be my maid of honor.” That was the deal. They would each have one person standing with them at the altar. For Rio, it would Alice. For James, it would be Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s nice to meet all of you,” Alice said with a perfunctory smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your English is very good,” Evanora replied, to which Alice looked at Rio with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio could only wince, Alice said, “Thanks, I sure hope it is. I grew up here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This made Agatha smother a laugh, hand trying to hide her smile. It was a relief, if Rio had to be honest, to know that someone else recognized the absurdity of the comment, even if it was Agatha. Evanora only tilted her head though, considering her. “And where are you from?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m from California.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t quite hide her laugh that time, earning herself a glare from Evanora. “Your family,” Evanora said, a thread of disdain obvious in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Korea,” Alice said, and Rio could feel the way she’d grown tense beside her. This was getting too close to talking about her mother, and Rio knew Evanora wouldn’t let it go if they got onto that topic. “And before you ask, South Korea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio blurted out. She stepped forward, physically blocking Alice from Evanora’s view. “Dresses? You mentioned dresses. Where are they?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, there are so many for you to try on,” Paola said, acting as if the previous exchange hadn’t happened at all. Paola’s smile hadn’t faltered once, even at Evanora’s more ignorant remarks. Rio wondered if Evanora had made the same comment when she first met Rio’s parents. Could Evanora even point to Puerto Rico on a map? “Let’s go to the dressing room,” Paola said, gently pushing Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let herself be steered to the dressing room, but she couldn’t help but glance over her shoulder to check on Alice as she went. Her friend only smiled and shrugged before pointedly choosing to sit in the chair on the other side of Agatha. Rio wasn’t sure what to think of Agatha and Alice talking, but at least Agatha, while a bit of a jerk, wouldn’t be racist. Hopefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if I don’t find one?” Rio asked as they walked. It was a genuine concern she’d had, forgotten momentarily by Evanora’s comments. “What if I hate all of them?” No dress, no wedding, right? Rio almost laughed at herself. Yeah, right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will find a dress,” Paola said firmly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How will I know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll just know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and stepped into the dressing room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Knowing she’d be trying on all sorts of dresses, Rio had put on a strapless bra and nude underwear, and that was what she stripped down to once inside. There was a silk, white robe hanging off one of the hooks inside, and Rio shrugged it on while she waited for the first dress to arrive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unsurprisingly, it was extravagant with a skirt so poofy that Rio was sure she’d drown in it. With help from one of the boutique’s workers, a quiet but efficient woman named Tessa, Rio put it on. Rio looked at herself in the mirror before she walked out. She wrinkled her nose, and Tessa wore a sympathetic smile as she grabbed the train so Rio wouldn’t trip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was just the beginning. Dress after dress, Rio found herself in over-the-top gowns that she would never wear, not even on her wedding day. While the dresses picked out by Paola were borderline gaudy, the ones chosen by Evanora were even worse. They were modest, almost comically so. They all had high necklines and long sleeves, barely hugging Rio’s figure. Rio was beginning to think Evanora was picking out all the ugly ones on purpose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the longest you’ve had people try on dresses?” Rio asked as Tessa helped her take off her twentieth dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you really want to know?” Tessa replied. When Rio just stared, Tessa said, “Nine hours. From open to close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously?” Rio gaped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tessa nodded, “Mother-in-law had a lot of opinions, and let’s just say the bride didn’t agree.” She gave Rio a conciliatory pat on the shoulder. “Hey, maybe if you’re lucky, they’ll let you stop for lunch.” With that, she slipped out to grab the next round of dresses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned and dug the heels of her hands into her eyes. This was ridiculous. She was either going to get married looking like a fairy tale princess or a failed nun, and both options sounded generally terrible. Rio might not care about this wedding, but that didn’t mean she wanted to look bad either. Knowing her parents, not to mention the Harknesses, photos of her were going to be in at least one or two magazines.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she heard the curtain to the dressing room open, Rio dropped her hands and turned around, expecting her mother or Tessa. Instead, it was Agatha standing in the doorway, eyes slowly roving over her bare body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Rio gasped. She ripped the robe off the hook and wrapped it around herself haphazardly. “What the hell are you doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes finally snapped up to meet hers. Rio wasn’t sure if she was imagining how dark they looked. She blinked a few times, as if she was coming back to herself. Agatha looked down at her hand then lifted the hanger up. “My mother asked me to bring you another dress,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you’ve brought it,” Rio said curtly. “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked further into the dressing room. The hanger rested on a single finger. She tilted her head and asked, “You don’t need any help?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The worker can help me,” Rio said, fighting the urge to take a step back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure? I don’t mind.” Agatha stopped right beside her and ran her hand down Rio’s spine. She splayed it against the small of her back, and Rio was reminded of James doing the same at dinner. Was that a thing with this family? A seemingly friendly yet possessive touch? Agatha's hand was smaller than James's but her long fingers dug in, warm through the thin fabric of the robe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped away now, folding her arms over her chest. “I’m sure,” she said. “Get out. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t leave immediately. She kept looking at Rio with those blue eyes, haunting in their beauty. Her lips twitched into a smile, and for a second, she looked as though she might say something. Agatha said nothing though. She took one slow step back before she turned and left without another word. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a sigh of relief once she was gone. She hadn’t let herself dwell too long, or rather, at all, on her confusing feelings for Agatha, and after this, Rio was annoyed to find that she found her just as attractive and infuriating as last time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the curtain was drawn open again, Rio snapped, “God, didn’t I tell you to leave?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t Agatha standing there this time. It was Alice, arms full of something white, with a raised brow. “Someone’s cranky,” Alice remarked. She shut the curtain behind her and dropped into the lone chair in the dressing room. “I’d ask how you’re doing, but the answer is obvious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just want to be done,” Rio sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s worse? Your mom, his mom, or his sister?” Alice asked. She wore that teasing half-smile, just like she always did when she was trying to cheer her up. “Personally, I think his mom has a special place reserved in hell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What gave it away? The dresses that cover me up more than a nun’s habit or the casual racism?” Rio snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was just talking about the dresses, but if you want to unpack the fact that you’ll be dealing with that for the rest of your life, be my guest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, let’s keep that sealed up tight,” Rio said quickly. If she thought too long about that, she’d lose her mind well before the wedding. She walked over to Alice and nudged the fabric in her lap. “Let’s talk about what you’ve got there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A dress that’s actually something you’d wear,” Alice said with a proud smile. “You’re not the only one tired. I think Agatha might murder Evanora first honestly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now, I’d pay to see that,” Rio murmured. She took the dress from Alice and gave her a warm smile. “Thanks for doing this. Being here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice gently kicked her leg and said, “Are you kidding? I just love spending my Saturday making small talk with your future sister-in-law, who, by the way, isn’t nearly as bad as you made her seem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, she’s not a cocky asshole?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, she definitely is,” Alice said, and Rio laughed. Alice grinned and continued, “I don’t know though. She kind of owns it, you know? And at least with her, you know where you stand. After all these years, I still can’t tell if your mom likes me, and Evanora? I don’t think she likes me, but she looks at me like she’s wondering if I could do the math on her taxes for her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and sent Alice out, so she could change. Knowing where you stand with Agatha? It didn’t sound quite right to her. Rio had no idea where she stood with Agatha. While she was fairly confident Agatha didn’t hate her, she didn’t have much more than that. Based on their last dinner and today, Agatha seemed to find her amusing, like a toy to entertain her during the wedding proceedings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe that was all she was to Agatha, and Rio actually did know where she stood with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Tessa returned, Rio put on the dress Alice brought her. It was a simple dress with long sleeves that cuffed at the end, leaving them to billow slightly. The skirt fell loosely around her, no poof to be found, and the bodice was fitted. The neckline dipped lower than Rio would have chosen for herself, but it admittedly looked flattering on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your friend has good taste,” Tessa said. She clipped Rio’s hair into an updo and pinned a veil into the top of it to complete the look. For the first time all morning, Rio didn’t hate her reflection.  “Let’s see what everyone else thinks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she walked out, Rio watched everyone’s faces brighten at the sight of her in the dress, but the most surprising was Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of the sneer she’d been wearing the last few hours, Agatha’s face had softened into something Rio wanted to call awe. She wasn’t sure what to call it because she’d never seen Agatha look at her like this before. Eyes wide, lips parted. Vulnerable in its honesty. Rio could see the exact moment Agatha realized she was staring because the expression was gone in an instant, smoothing out into the indifferent frown from before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This one,” Rio blurted out, eyes still on Agatha. “This is the one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look gorgeous! Like a real bride!” Paola cried. She leapt to her feet and swept Rio into a hug. Somewhere, to the side, Evanora was saying something about adding fabric to the neckline to make it more appropriate. “I told you that you would know,” Paola told her, kissing her cheek. “You always know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, but it was less genuine than before. She had known, just like she said, but it wasn’t for any reason Rio would have guessed. It wasn’t seeing herself in the mirror. It wasn’t watching her mother’s overjoyed reaction. It wasn’t Alice trying to act tough even as her eyes teared up. It wasn’t even the dizzying realization that the wedding was really happening that made Rio know that this was the dress for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Agatha looking at her like she was beautiful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Why the hell had she looked at her like that in the first place?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was wrong. She had no idea where she stood with Agatha at all, and suddenly, she wasn’t so sure if Agatha knew either.</span>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>After an awkward coffee date, Rio finds herself alone with Agatha for the cake tasting.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio stared at her half-drunk coffee as her fingers tapped absently against the side of the mug.</p><p>Across from her, James looked like he was just as lost and uncomfortable as her.</p><p>For the last half hour, the two of them sat in a coffee shop, trading stilted small talk. There was only so much to say to someone about how your work and family was though. Even the wedding talk had run dry. If she cared enough, Rio knew she could have shared a funny story from work or talked about her plants, but she didn’t care. She didn’t want to be here. The only reason she was here was because her mother tricked her into thinking she was meeting her for coffee, not James.</p><p>It had been almost a week since Rio bought her wedding dress, and the purchase only seemed to worsen her malaise. The reality of her situation was settling into the recesses of her mind slowly but surely, and with every day that they drew closer to the wedding, Rio felt her anxiety climb. </p><p>“Listen,” James finally said. He sat back in his chair, running a hand through his hair before he smoothed it out in a compulsive move. “I understand this wasn’t your choice. It wasn’t really mine either, to be honest, but it doesn’t have to be bad. Or weird.” James flashed a smile that was almost boyish. Maybe if Rio liked men, she would have found it attractive. As it was, Rio just tried not to sigh.</p><p>“I agree,” Rio said. “I just want us to be…” She trailed off. She actually wasn’t sure what she wanted them to be. “Friends?” It came out as a question. It seemed like the easiest answer. Better than strangers, certainly better than enemies or lovers.</p><p>“What, you don’t think you’ll fall for my charms eventually?” James joked.</p><p>Rio forced a laugh and simply said, “No, I don’t think so.”</p><p>Thankfully, James didn’t look offended. He shrugged, saying, “Okay. Friends then.” He glanced at his watch and said, “Maybe we’ll have a proper conversation next time. For now though, I have to get to a meeting.”</p><p>“Have fun,” Rio offered. It seemed like the polite thing to do, even if it came out a bit more sarcastic than she meant. </p><p>James just smirked though. He said, “It’s about taxes. I’ll be lucky if I don’t fall asleep.” He stood up and hesitated for a moment. Rio tensed, hoping he wouldn’t try to touch her. James smiled awkwardly and said, “Have fun at the cake tasting. It sounds like you’ll be having more fun than me.” He gave her a brief wave before he departed, leaving a twenty dollar bill on the table as he did.</p><p>Rio didn’t even try to hide her envy as she watched him leave. Of course, James didn’t have to be involved in the wedding planning. He didn’t have to sit through endless appointments and attend to little details he didn’t care about. Rio did though. Rio had to clear her schedule and spend day after day with their mothers, organizing a wedding that really just needed her to show up for. More than once, Rio considered asking for just the time and place and saying, “See you there.”</p><p>Paola would never let that happen, and neither would Evanora. The fallout of even trying that would be unimaginable. No, Rio was trapped in this nuptial hellscape. One that would be continuing well into the afternoon as she went to try various cake flavors. At least with this errand, Rio was being fed.</p><p>Rio killed another half hour at the coffee shop, scrolling on her phone and sipping at her now cold coffee, before she caught a cab to the bakery. During the ride, she got a text from Paola, informing her that she wasn’t going to make it. Rio rolled her eyes. She wished she could start charging these people for her time, especially if they weren’t going to be involved themselves.</p><p>When Rio arrived at the bakery, she was surprised to find only Agatha standing out front. She got out of the cab slowly, approaching her the same way you would a predator in the wild. Although, that was more or less what Agatha actually was. Today, she wore black slacks that hugged her ass and a striped button-up. A simple look but it still looked so much nicer than the jeans and t-shirt Rio had thrown on. </p><p>“Hey,” Rio greeted her. “Where’s your mom?”</p><p>“Busy,” Agatha said. “Where’s yours?”</p><p>Rio felt like she’d be knocked upside the head very hard with something very heavy. That was the only way to explain the way she suddenly felt so dizzy. “Busy,” Rio repeated back. She blinked a few times, trying to wake herself from this nightmare scenario.</p><p>“Oh, would you relax?” Agatha rolled her eyes. “You look like you’re about to throw up.” She crossed her arms over her chest and said, “I don’t bite.”</p><p>“Are you sure about that?” Rio asked warily. Agatha definitely looked like she would bite, whether as an attack or as foreplay, Rio wasn’t sure.</p><p>Agatha batted her eyelashes at her and said, “Wouldn’t you like to know?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, hoping her blush wasn’t too obvious. “Whatever,” Rio muttered. “Let’s just get this over with.”</p><p>Once the names Vidal and Harkness were mentioned inside the bakery, the two of them were earnestly ushered into a separate room where the owner promised to bring out a slice of every possible combination for them. Rio half-heartedly told him that wasn’t necessary, already expecting the vehement insistence that they try everything they had to offer.</p><p>“Someone’s looking for a good tip,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“More like they’re hoping we tell every other rich person we know to come here,” Rio sighed. </p><p>It had been over twenty years since Rio’s family began their ascent from scrounging to make ends meet to high profile political assets, but Rio had never fully accepted or adjusted to the change. As stupid as it was, especially given how privileged she was now, Rio longed for the days where Luis and she would sit on the stoop of their apartment building and share a bar of chocolate as a secret treat just between the two of them. Things had been simpler then.</p><p>As slices of cakes were brought out in a seemingly endless rotation, Rio took an obligatory bite of each one, making note of which ones she liked on the paper they gave her. Agatha did the same, but with every bite she took, she had a comment along to go with it.</p><p>“This tastes like a child was set loose in the kitchen,” Agatha said after trying a vanilla cake filled with colorful sprinkles and covered in a sickeningly sweet icing. A moment later, she said, pointing to another slice, “This one tastes like someone’s grandmother’s perfume got dropped into the batter.”</p><p>If Rio didn’t know any better, she would have thought Agatha was trying to cheer her up. As it was, she probably liked the sound of her own voice so much that she couldn’t resist filling the silence with it.</p><p>Rio merely hummed and nodded to whatever Agatha said, but apparently, that wasn’t enough attention for her because Agatha finally said, “Is my brother that awful that wedding planning makes you look like you’d rather put a gun to your head?”</p><p>“What?” Rio said, startled. She processed what Agatha said and shook her head hastily. “No. He’s fine. I just…” She winced. “Don’t care.”</p><p>Once again, Rio saw a strange resemblance between the two siblings as Agatha didn’t seem offended at all, shrugging. When James shrugged though, it was kind of jerky, like he wasn’t in complete control of his limbs. When Agatha shrugged, it was an oddly graceful movement, like she couldn’t have cared less. Rio watched as Agatha pressed her fork against one of the cake slices, making it crumble. Without looking at her, Agatha asked, “Didn’t dream about white dresses and flowers as a little girl?”</p><p>“No, I’m pretty sure I was too busy trying to catch squirrels,” Rio said honestly.</p><p>She tried to hide her smile at the way Agatha’s head perked up, a startled expression on her face. Agatha dropped her fork and looked at her properly. “Squirrels?” Agatha repeated before she shook her head and asked, “Why were you trying to catch them?”</p><p>“I wanted one for a pet,” Rio explained. “My apartment wouldn’t let us have dogs or cats, but I figured a squirrel was small enough to hide.” She bit her lip and added, before she could stop herself, “I also heard from an older kid in the complex that they dissected a squirrel at school, and I thought I could do the same if I caught one.”</p><p>“You’re weird,” Agatha said with an odd sense of admiration. There wasn’t a trace of disgust or judgement.</p><p>Rio ducked her head, feeling her cheeks redden. She’d said that to throw Agatha off, to bring back some of the scorn she was used to seeing from her. Instead, she felt like she’d left herself open to her eyes, sharp and knowing. Rio cleared her throat and looked back up, asking, “What about you? Did you ever dream about having a wedding?”</p><p>“Me?” Agatha snorted. “No.” She didn’t elaborate, and Rio didn’t press.</p><p>After that though, it became easier to talk to Agatha. They mainly spoke about wedding planning, and it exposed the biggest difference Rio found between the Harkness siblings so far. </p><p>James was undeniably easy-going with his charm being how he seemed to simply accept things and move on, even if he disagreed. Rio noticed it when they had coffee earlier. When Rio told him about what they’d decided on the wedding so far, she’d catch him making a face. It prompted Rio to ask if he wanted her to change anything, but he had just smiled and assured her that whatever she chose would be fine.</p><p>Meanwhile, Agatha, who wasn’t even the one getting married, had something to say about everything, it seemed. Rio couldn’t simply tell Agatha that the wedding colors were navy blue and gold. She had to tell the insufferable woman <em> why </em>the wedding colors were navy blue and gold, only for Agatha to tell her why she would never want that for her wedding. It went on like that for everything.</p><p>It was exasperating, being more or less lectured about why her wedding was going to be awful, but it was also refreshing to speak to someone who somehow abhorred the whole thing even more than her. Agatha was one of the only people to tell her that this whole thing was stupid, even if she was coming from a place of aesthetics, and Rio admittedly enjoyed hearing that more than she should. </p><p>Agatha was growing on her in a weird way because of this. Or maybe Rio was just that desperate to find some kind of camaraderie. </p><p>“Was there anyone else in the picture when your parents asked you to marry my brother?” Agatha asked as they sampled their last round of cakes.</p><p>Asked was a much kinder way of phrasing how her parents had guilted her into this whole thing, but Rio still answered, “No. I haven’t dated in a while.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t dated anyone seriously since college, and even then, Rio had been secretive, nervous, and terrified. Dating her during that time consisted of a lot of dates in her apartment, and while her girlfriend at the time had understood, it had also ultimately been the reason they broke up.</p><p>Since then, Rio occasionally hooked up with women, but it was never more than once. It wasn’t what Rio wanted at all since she’d always been a bit of a romantic, but that wasn’t exactly possible then. It certainly wasn’t possible now.</p><p>Before her mood could be completely ruined, Rio said, “Should I even bother asking you if there’s anyone in the picture?”</p><p>“Depends on what you mean by in the picture,” Agatha replied with a shameless grin. “But there’s always someone.”</p><p>“Classy,” Rio snorted.</p><p>“Well, of course,” Agatha said with exaggerated condescension. “I’m a Harkness, dear.”</p><p>The two of them shared a smile just as one of the workers came in to clean up the plates. It was an older woman, probably in her sixties or seventies. She smiled warmly at them and said, “I hope you enjoyed everything. When’s the wedding?”</p><p>“Thank you, we did,” Rio said. “It’ll be June 5th.” </p><p>The woman's eyes went wide as she said, “Well, isn’t that soon!” Then, she blushed and said, “I apologize. I meant to say congratulations.” She looked between them and added, “The two of you make a beautiful couple.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth fell open while Agatha sat up, waving her hands.</p><p>“Couple?” Agatha repeated. “No, no, no. Not us.” Rio half-listened as Agatha explained the situation, distracted by the way her pale skin turned bright red, spreading across her cheeks and all the way down her neck until it disappeared beneath her shirt. It was the first time Rio had ever seen her flustered. It was endearing, seeing the usually overly confident woman fumble with her words.</p><p>After the woman left, Agatha refused to look at her. Her face was still flushed, and she fidgeted with the rings on her hands. </p><p>Rio decided to have mercy on her. “Thanks for staying,” she said. When Agatha turned to her in confusion, Rio explained, “You didn’t have to stay with me, especially when neither of our mothers were here to make you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, turning to look out the window. Her fingers still messed with one of her rings, spinning it around and around. “It was nothing,” Agatha said. “Just eating some cake.” When Rio opened her mouth to argue, Agatha added, so quietly under her breath Rio wondered if she was meant to hear it at all, “Someone should be with you for this.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say to that, so she cleared her throat and picked up her paper. “So, I was thinking about choosing the chocolate.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio was one week away from her wedding and one conversation with her mother away from completely losing her mind. </p><p>Even though it seemed as though everything was planned, Paola kept finding more, inconsequential things to fuss over. She couldn’t just deal with it herself though. No, Paola just had to show up at her apartment at all hours of the day to pester her about it, as if Rio wasn’t going to just tell her to do whatever she wanted anyways.</p><p>The latest issue was the type of lighting for the venue. There were three different settings, along with a truly egregious number of options for additional lighting. Rio hadn’t done the math, but she was pretty sure there were more than fifty variations. As Paola went through each of them, they began to blur together too, making it feel like there were closer to ten that she just kept going over.</p><p>“What do you think?” Paola asked.</p><p>“Whatever you want,” Rio said tiredly. </p><p>Paola sighed, like Rio was the difficult one here, and said, “Rio, this will determine how you look in your photos. Let’s really think about it.”</p><p>Rio was saved from responding when her phone lit up in a call. She eagerly snatched it up, only to pause when she saw it was Agatha who was calling her. Although they’d exchanged numbers at their mothers’ insistence, just in case, they had never bothered to text or call each other. </p><p>Since the cake tasting, Rio had seen Agatha twice, once to finalize the seating arrangement and again to choose Agatha’s bridesmaid dress. Both times had only worsened Rio’s growing feelings for the other woman.</p><p>While they planned the seating chart, Rio could see Evanora regret inviting her daughter every time Agatha made a snide suggestion. The highlight was actually when Agatha said it was imperative to sit a divorced couple together to remind them of where they failed. Apparently, Agatha informed her in a whisper, the husband had cheated with his business partner’s wife, who he would also be bringing to the wedding. Agatha wanted to run a bet on who would snap first. Her best guess was the ex-wife. Rio agreed. Evanora and Paola had ignored them both.</p><p>For Agatha’s bridesmaid dress, Rio had actually tried to get out of going. Like everything else about the wedding, Rio didn’t care. Agatha could have shown up in a neon yellow dress, or hell, even white, and Rio would have been fine with it. </p><p>Paola insisted though, so Rio had shown up in sweat pants and a cap in protest. It’d gotten her a stern look from Paola and a reproachful look from Evanora, but it had been worth being able to comfortably sink into one of the chairs and sulk. Not to mention, Agatha had looked like she wished she was wearing that instead of the parade of dresses Evanora had picked out for her.</p><p>In the end, Agatha ended up with a satin dress in a color reminiscent of the night sky. It was a halter neck and floor length, but it left most of her back bare. Evanora had tried to protest it, but Paola had gushed over the dress and how Agatha looked in it, singing it praises, until Evanora had reluctantly agreed. To Rio’s amusement, Evanora had also made sure to buy her a wrap to go with it.</p><p>When they asked Rio for her opinion, she had tried to focus her eyes on everything but the bare skin revealed by the dress. She ended up looking somewhere over Agatha's head as she said, “It’s nice. You should get it.” From the edge of her periphery, Rio had seen Agatha smile.</p><p>As she picked up the call, Rio couldn’t quite hide her confusion as she said, “Hello?”</p><p><em> “Rio,” </em> Agatha said, sounding surprised that she answered. <em> “Good. Hello. How does a drink sound?” </em></p><p>“Amazing,” Rio said without hesitation.</p><p>
<em> “Okay, then repeat after me: Yes, Agatha. I can meet you right now. I know that’s important to your mother.”  </em>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, but she hesitated. Was she really going to just trust Agatha and meet her for a drink? Although they seemed to have reached a commonground, Rio wouldn’t exactly say they were close enough to just hang out with each other. It was an excuse to get away from her mother though, not to mention see Agatha, so Rio said, “Yeah, Agatha. I can meet you. I know that’s important to your mother.” </p><p><em> “Good girl,” </em> Agatha said, and Rio’s hand tightened around her phone. <em> “I’ll meet you at Salem in half an hour.” </em> Then, without another word or explanation, Agatha hung up.</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Paola asked.</p><p>Rio stared at her phone dumbly for a moment before she nodded slowly. “Yeah, Agatha just needs me to come over and help out with something for Evanora. I think something about the guest list,” Rio lied.</p><p>“I won’t keep you then,” Paola said. She stood up from her couch and cupped Rio’s cheek. It was a tender touch, and Rio found herself caught between tensing and leaning into it. “I’m glad you’re getting along with Agatha. She’ll be your family soon.”</p><p>“I have a family,” Rio said with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>“Your family is growing,” Paola replied. “It’s a good thing, Rio.”</p><p>Rio clamped her mouth shut and walked her mother to the door. Once she was gone, Rio went to her bedroom to change. Something told her that track pants and a t-shirt wouldn’t work for wherever she was meeting Agatha. She dug through her closet, holding up various shirts and pants, before she settled on a pair of dark jeans and a black shirt with the top buttons undone. </p><p>The bar Agatha told her to meet her at ended up being a lot more casual than Rio expected. It was the kind of place where people went to grab a drink with coworkers after work, and that looked to be the majority of the people there as Rio walked inside. Looking around, Rio took in the simple, vintage aesthetic and low lighting that made the bar feel intimate.</p><p>Rio was debating whether to go to the bar when she felt a hand on her back. She tensed at first before she registered the familiar press of long fingers. Rio swallowed before she turned and found Agatha at her side, dressed in a fitted, black dress. She looked like she just came from work.  </p><p>“Glad you could make it,” Agatha said. “I reserved a table.”</p><p>“You were that confident I would come?” Rio asked as she followed her. </p><p>Agatha smiled and replied, “I would have used the table either way.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure that was true, but she didn’t call her on it. The table was a circular booth tucked away, half-hidden behind some plants. It was private. Rio was both relieved yet nervous at the fact, and she tried not to think too hard about it as she offered to grab them their drinks.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Agatha wanted a martini, and Rio rolled her eyes when Agatha informed her, “I like it extra dirty.” </p><p>Once they had their drinks, Rio wasted no time, saying, “So, how’d you know?” Agatha raised a brow, and Rio clarified, “That I’d need this.”</p><p>“My mother was starting to stress me out,” Agatha explained. Her index finger tapped idly against the table. “If that was what was happening with me, I could only imagine what your mother must have been doing to you.” </p><p>“And why help me?” Rio asked. </p><p>Agatha looked amused, a smirk on her lips. “I’m not so heartless as to let you go insane,” she said, only to follow it up with, “There’s plenty of time for that after you’re married to my brother.” Rio’s laugh was quiet, barely a huff, but Agatha looked immensely pleased to have gotten the reaction. “See? Aren’t I so kind? You’re relaxed already.”</p><p>“Don’t flatter yourself,” Rio replied. She took a pointed sip of her rum and coke. “It’s the alcohol.”</p><p>“Oh, is that it?” Agatha hummed.</p><p>Her first drink went quickly as Rio complained about the last week, lamenting her mother’s obsession about every detail. It was easy to talk to Agatha, and maybe Rio shouldn't be surprised by that anymore, but she was. There was something about the way Agatha seemed so focused on her when she spoke, the clever retort she had to every story. It was the kind of chemistry Rio didn't find often.</p><p>By the time she was starting her third drink, Rio felt warm and lazy. Her head lolled against the back of the booth as she stared at Agatha, whose cheeks were flushed and eyes were hazy.</p><p>Agatha toyed with the toothpick her olive had come on and said, “Don’t you think about just saying fuck it and skipping town?” </p><p>Rio didn’t answer at first. She was certainly feeling the effects of her drinks, but she wasn’t so far gone as to not recognize the danger in answering this honestly. Instead, Rio turned it on her, asking, “Is that what you would do?” </p><p>“Honey, I wouldn’t have gotten engaged in the first place,” Agatha said with a harsh laugh. “In case you’ve forgotten, I’m not exactly one to do as my mother says.” She wrinkled her nose, and Rio smiled at how cute it was, the way her nose crinkled and lips twisted. “You didn’t answer my question, you know.”</p><p>“That was on purpose,” Rio said. She thought she’d let it go, but then Agatha tilted her head and fucking pouted at her. It shouldn’t have worked, this grown, infuriating woman pouting at her, but it did. Apparently, Agatha could be stupidly adorable when she wanted to be. Or maybe, she was just this cute because they were both drunk. Rio sighed and said, “My parents, they gave up a lot for me. They worked so hard for me to have this life, and what kind of daughter would that make me if I just spat in their face and ran away?”</p><p>Agatha sounded like she couldn’t decide whether she was angry or confused. “So that’s it? They just get to have your life when they already have their own?” </p><p>“You don’t understand,” Rio said.</p><p>“Then make me understand.” </p><p>Rio turned her head and found Agatha much closer than she expected. When had she moved? They started the night a few feet away, but now, Agatha was less than a foot from her. Rio blinked hard as she tried to remember her words. This close up, Rio couldn’t help but notice the pink of Agatha’s lips and the long, dark lashes that framed her blue eyes. </p><p>“I don’t think you can,” Rio said, speaking so softly that Agatha leaned in even closer to hear her. Rio didn’t move away. Instead, she tilted her head forward. “My family couldn’t afford for me to have a rebellious phase. We weren’t destitute or anything, but we scrimped a lot when I was a kid. Nothing extravagant, nothing fancy. A lot of box dinners and stuff.” Rio licked her lips, trying to find the words. “If I had even a fraction of the scandals you had when you were younger, it would have been over for us. We didn’t have the money or status to sweep things under the rug and keep our standing. All we had was my father working his ass off, charming the right people and letting other men treat him like a dog to let him in on their connections.” Rio’s lips curled into a humorless smile. “Do you know what that’s like?” </p><p>“Rio–”</p><p>“My parents fought for their place here,” Rio told her. “And I’m not going to let my selfishness ruin that.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything for a moment. She just let her eyes, so impossibly blue, bore into hers. Finally, Agatha came even closer and whispered, “And is that what you think of me? Some spoiled, selfish brat who’s never struggled a day in her life?”</p><p>No, that wasn’t what Rio thought at all, but to hear Agatha take what she said and boil it down to something like that, Rio couldn’t help but say, “Yes, that’s exactly what I think.”</p><p>Rio thought she saw a flash of hurt cross Agatha’s face, but it was gone before she was sure. She thought about apologizing, but then Agatha leaned in, not to say anything but close enough that their lips almost touched. Rio stopped breathing. She jerked away, not far enough to create any real distance between them but just enough to keep her head from spinning. Just a scant few inches that made it possible for Rio to breathe again.</p><p>“You’re right, Rio,” Agatha murmured. Her eyes were half-lidded, but Rio could see the way her pupils had almost swallowed her irises. “I am selfish.” Her hand, hidden beneath the table, reached out and grabbed a fistful of Rio’s shirt. Rio gasped, but still, she didn’t move. Agatha leaned in, letting their noses brush. Rio could feel her breath hot against her lips. “Tell me to stop.” </p><p>Agatha’s hand was tight around her shirt, curling slowly so that Rio was drawn closer ever so slowly. Agatha tilted her head closer, but then she moved away, her lips ghosting just out of reach. Both of their breathing was heavy and uneven, and Rio wondered if this was what it was like before they’d even kissed, what would happen after?</p><p>Agatha licked her lips. Her eyes fluttered shut, and she leaned in with purpose.</p><p>Rio’s eyes slammed shut.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Her breath was trembling when she opened her eyes again. Agatha stared at her with an unreadable expression for so long that a part of Rio recklessly thought about kissing her anyways. Just as the traitorous thought crossed her mind, Agatha let go of her shirt and pulled away completely, moving to sit at a respectable distance.</p><p>Her eyes were glassy, staring off into space. Her hands clenched around the stem of her martini glass. “You should go,” Agatha said. “I’ll cover the bill.”</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Their eyes met, and Rio fell silent. She wanted to say something, but she didn’t know what.</p><p>“Good night, Rio,” Agatha said with a note of finality.</p><p>Rio shut her eyes for a moment and sighed. When she opened them again, she said, “Good night, Agatha.”</p><p>Getting up from the booth felt impossible. Her head was spinning, and her legs felt weak; both had nothing to do with what she’d drunk tonight.</p><p>Although she didn’t look back, Rio could feel Agatha’s eyes on her as she left. </p><p>Stepping into the warm summer air, Rio buried her face in her hands and tried to ignore the tears that pricked at the corners of her eyes and the panic that clawed its way up her throat.</p><p>Rio couldn’t do this. She could not do this. She could not have feelings for her future sister-in-law. This had to just be some stupid crush, something she’d get over eventually. Right?</p><p>A muffled sob tore at her throat.</p><p>By the time a cab arrived, her eyes were swollen and her throat was scratchy. Hazily, dangerously, Rio wondered what would happen if she turned around and went back into the bar. </p><p>Rio got into the cab, and she went home.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The party had just begun, and Rio was already pleasantly buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the night before her wedding, and at Alice’s insistence, Rio was having a bachelorette party. With some generous funding from her parents, Alice had rented out the penthouse suite of a hotel downtown and invited Natasha, Maria, and Gamora, their friends from college, to drink and eat to their hearts’ content. As far as bachelorette parties went, Rio knew this was a fairly subdued one, but even this felt like too much. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Natasha said, plopping down beside her on the couch. She shoved another shot into her hand. “Enjoy yourself. Who knows when the next time you’ll be able to do this will be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m getting married,” Rio replied. “Isn’t the idea that the next time is never?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never say never,” Natasha smirked, guiding the shot up to Rio’s lips. Rio rolled her eyes but took the shot. “Attagirl. Now, remind me again why you’re getting married.” When Rio glared at her, Natasha waved her hand, “No, I mean, why this guy? There must be plenty of other boring men your parents could have pawned you off on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Natasha,” Maria said warningly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a valid question,” Gamora said with a shrug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them turned to Rio expectantly while Alice sighed and announced she was opening another bottle of vodka. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s a Harkness,” Rio said, which should have been enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha made a face though and said, “Explain it to me like I’m dumb. I don’t give a fuck about politics or business.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Gamora snorted while Maria rolled her eyes. Rio gratefully took the drink Alice gave her and took a large gulp. “They’re rich and well-connected,” Rio explained. “His family has been involved in politics probably since the U.S. was founded, whether it’s being actual politicians or providing money for campaigns. Not to mention, they’ve got stocks and shares in every major corporation that runs this country.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Old money,” Gamora hummed. “So they’re conservative?” At Rio’s nod, Gamora raised a brow and said, “And he’s getting married to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been wondering about that,” Alice spoke up. She gave Rio an apologetic look and said, “I mean, Evanora was saying some really fucked up things when you got your wedding dress.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had honestly lost track of the ignorant and offensive things Evanora had said. What she said to Alice was just the tip of the iceberg. She sighed and said, “Well, let’s not act like there aren’t minorities who are conservative. Exhibit A: my dad.” She pasted on a smile as she said, “And imagine how good it looks to see me as James’s wife. A ‘good’ one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In unison, Rio’s friends all made noises of disgust. It was Maria who grabbed the vodka and poured Rio another shot. “Here,” she said. “You need this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She needs twenty,” Natasha scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But he’s not bad?” Maria asked. “James?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Could be worse,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gamora smirked, “Wow, don’t flatter him too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, and as she took her shot, Alice said, “The whole family’s not bad though. Agatha is pretty cool. Hot, too.” Rio didn’t expect the last part, and she choked on the vodka. She wheezed as the alcohol lingered and burned her throat, eyes tearing up as Alice smacked her back. “Dude, are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wrong pipe,” Rio coughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha, the perceptive little shit, tilted her head and said, “So what’s this about Agatha? Who is she?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“James’s sister,” Rio explained. She wiped her mouth and winced. She got up and grabbed a bottle of water off the counter. She chugged half of it and said, “She’s fine. Definitely not as bad as her mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And is she hot?” Maria asked, catching on to what Natasha was getting at.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned. It wouldn’t be an issue to admit this to them. They all fooled around within the friend group during college, so they all knew everyone here was at least a little into women. “Yes,” Rio said, trying to keep her voice even. “She’s hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Natasha and Maria shared a knowing look, Rio tensed, but she was saved from them by Alice, who said, “Hey, speaking of Agatha, have you heard anything from her? Your mom made me invite her to this, but she never replied.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t decide if this was better or worse than whatever Natasha and Maria would have said. As it was, Rio’s entire body tensed even further, making her feel like a tightly coiled spring. She hadn’t seen Agatha since the bar. When Rio and Paola met with Evanora for last minute wedding plans this past week, Agatha had been noticeably absent. When Paola asked about it though, Evanora had only smiled and said, “Work. You know how it is.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, Rio shook her head. “No, I haven’t heard from her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, Alice only shrugged and suggested they play a drinking game next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the next few hours, Rio let herself forget about her impending marriage, simply enjoying the time with her friends since she didn’t get to see them that often. They snacked sporadically, but there was always a drink in Rio’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was definitely going to have a hangover tomorrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was flushed and giggly, listening to Gamora tell a story about her ex, when there was a knock at the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That better not be a stripper,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, not yet,” Alice said as she clambered to her feet to answer the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up, only to wince as her head spun. “What do you mean ‘not yet’?” Rio called after her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice didn’t answer, but when she walked back into the main area, Agatha was with her. She was dressed in slacks, a blouse, and suspenders. Her blazer was held over her shoulder, and it was unfair how good she looked when she didn’t even seem to be trying. The sight of Agatha felt like a slap to the face, and whatever drunkenness she was feeling evaporated in an instant. Rio blinked hard, hoping she was imagining it, but no, Agatha was still there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look who finally decided to show up,” Alice said. “Agatha, this is some of our friends from college: Natasha, Maria, Gamora. Everyone, this is Rio’s future sister-in-law, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winced while Agatha’s smile only faltered slightly. “Now, now, Alice, I’m much more than that,” Agatha said lightly. She shook each of their hands. “I’m also an accomplished divorce lawyer and my mother’s biggest disappointment.” Although her tone was playful, Rio couldn’t help but notice the bitterness that tinged her words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha came to sit down beside her on the couch, and belatedly, Rio realized they were alone. The group had dispersed. Alice and Maria were mixing more drinks in the kitchen while Natasha and Gamora were doing something in the restroom. Taking pictures from the sounds of it. Rio tried to fend off the panic that began to buzz inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was an awkward pause before Agatha asked, “So, the wedding planning all went well?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was fine,” Rio answered curtly. She knew it was ridiculous to act so petulant. Agatha made it clear she wasn’t interested in wedding planning, and there wasn’t really a reason for her to be there for any of it. She didn’t owe Rio her presence, and Rio shouldn’t care so much about whether her abrasive sister-in-law gave her opinion on the silverware they used at the reception.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just this stupid, annoying crush. A fleeting attraction that Rio needed to shove down and ignore if she was going to survive her marriage. Rio couldn’t care about Agatha, and Agatha didn’t care about her. It should be that simple. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That was if she could move past what had happened between them though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why did you do that?” Rio blurted out. She hadn’t meant to ask that. She sighed and rubbed at her temples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “Do what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When we got drinks, you almost–” Rio stopped abruptly, glancing around to check that no one was listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I almost what?” Agatha said. Her eyes were dark and knowing. A taunting smile was on her lips. Agatha wanted her to say it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to keep her anger reined in as she whispered, “You almost kissed me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha searched her face for a moment before she leaned back against the couch and shrugged, “What’s a drunken mistake between two friends?” Neither of them were drunk enough to excuse that. And they weren’t friends. Sensing her dissatisfaction, Agatha reached out and touched Rio’s wrist. “Don’t be like that, Rio,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snatched her hand from Agatha’s touch as if it burned. It might as well have. Rio’s wrist tingled where Agatha’s fingers were. “This isn’t a game,” Rio snapped. She wasn’t sober enough for this. Her head felt like it was spinning as Agatha seemed to bat her between her paws. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who said it was?” Agatha said with a tilt of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted and said, much more harshly than she meant to, “Oh, and what are you going to do? Put a ring on it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pointedly looked down at the diamond ring on Rio’s hand. It was larger and more ornate than anything Rio would have chosen for herself, but it was undeniably beautiful. Agatha’s face pulled into a dismissive sneer as she said, “Well, it looks like I’m too late for that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coward, Rio wanted to say. She wasn't sure if she meant herself or Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not that I’m really the marrying type,” Agatha continued airily. “But I guess someone in the family had to do it, and better James than me.” Her smile was sardonic as she added, “Not that anyone is exactly eager to marry me from our circles.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio sighed. “I don’t suppose they are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rested her arm on the back of the couch and leaned in, lowering her voice. “Do you really want me to apologize for the other night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clenched her jaw as she stared straight ahead, avoiding her eyes. She knew the answer to that. She just didn’t want that to be her answer. “I’m marrying your brother,” was all Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha said quietly. Her fingers brushed against Rio’s hair, and this time, Rio didn’t move away. “But correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think you look at him the way you look at me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her sharply, but Agatha only met her gaze evenly. “Why are you doing this?” Rio asked. She tensed and looked around, but her friends were all still busy. Rio took a deep breath and kept her voice at a whisper. “You could have any woman you want. Why me? Why your brother’s fiancé?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Haven’t you ever wanted what you can’t have?” Agatha countered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a bitter laugh. “So is that it? If I wasn’t your brother’s fiancé, you wouldn’t want me at all?” When Agatha hesitated, Rio shook her head. “Fuck you, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You wish you could fuck me,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood up, glaring down at her, but whatever she was going to say, something she’d definitely regret saying in a hotel room full of people, was interrupted by another knock at the door. Rio shut her eyes and sighed. “Alice,” Rio gritted out, “I swear to god.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry!” Alice exclaimed, only sounding half-apologetic. “It’s your bachelorette party. I had to!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her eyes just in time to see Alice open the door to a beautiful woman with long, dark hair. Before she could react, Natasha and Gamora were at her sides, keeping her where she was, while Maria pushed the furniture out of the way and left a single chair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guys,” Rio tried. She was still reeling from her conversation with Agatha. This was the last thing she wanted to do right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Natasha said. “You’re getting a lap dance, and you’re going to like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, she’s definitely going to like it,” Gamora murmured. The woman had just taken off her coat, leaving her in white, lacy lingerie. Gamora patted Rio’s head. “Have fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reluctantly lowered herself onto the chair in the middle of the room, going as far as to sit on top of her hands. She didn’t expect to actually touch the woman, but it felt safer this way. She cleared her throat awkwardly, trying to ignore her friends’ cheers and hollers as the lights dimmed and music began to play.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This actually wasn’t Rio’s first lap dance. During college, Natasha had dragged her to a club for her birthday and paid for her to have one. Rio wasn’t sure if it was because that was her only frame of reference, but she felt just as she did then, young and inexperienced, caught between intrigue and terror. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman smiled down at her and said, “Call me Venus.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like the goddess,” Rio commented, eyes straying up to the ceiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you smart?” It was said in a purr, and Rio fought back the blush that threatened to spread across her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Venus began to dance, Rio struggled with where to look. She knew she was supposed to look at the scantily clad body right in front of her, but it felt too awkward for her. Not to mention, it felt strange to do this with all of her friends there. Rio’s eyes darted around until they landed on Agatha, who stood a few feet in front of Rio and Venus, leaning against the island counter with her arms folded over her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unlike the raucous, teasing jeers that everyone else gave, Agatha’s face was impassive. There wasn’t a flicker of amusement. Rio felt her breath catch as their eyes locked. Suddenly, it was like they were the only two in the room. Rio bit down on her lower lip, remembering Agatha’s hand on her wrist and her fingers against her hair. Agatha raised a brow, and Rio curled her hands into fists beneath her thighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure how long they stared at each other, but it was only Venus moving into her line of sight that broke Rio from her daze. A reflexive smile pulled at Rio’s lips as Venus leaned in. She stopped just before their lips met, but Rio didn’t even flinch. She just chuckled. Somehow, that hadn’t felt even a fraction as electric as Agatha’s gaze on her earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon enough, the song was over. Rio waved off another dance and stood quickly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw, come on,” Venus said, tugging on Rio’s shirt. Her smile was coy as she said, “Your friend paid for a full hour. Don’t you want another dance?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I really don’t,” Rio said with a kind smile. “Don’t get me wrong. You’re beautiful, but this just isn’t my kind of thing.” Rio waved a hand at her friends. “Why don’t one of you have a turn?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before any of her friends could say anything though, Agatha stepped forward and said, “I wouldn’t mind a lap dance.” When Rio’s head snapped towards her, Agatha wore a pout. “It’s been an awfully stressful week at work, you know,” Agatha said, and the slight mocking edge to her voice made Rio bristle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio said nothing though, everyone else whooped their encouragement. Agatha strode forward and slouched into the chair, legs spread wide with a lazy smirk on her face. Rio swallowed and moved away from her friends, taking the spot Agatha had previously stood. No one seemed to notice, too busy calling out crude jokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The music began again, and just like before, Rio found herself far more focused on Agatha instead of whatever Venus was doing. Except this time, Agatha didn’t look at her. Her blue eyes never strayed once from Venus. Rio pressed her lips together and took a deep breath. Agatha looked up at Venus like she wanted to devour her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The longer the song went on the more Rio could feel herself grow sick with jealousy. The feeling only made Rio feel worse because it was so stupid to feel that way. Hadn’t she just been angry at Agatha for only liking her because she was forbidden? Rio couldn’t stop it though, and it only worsened when Venus said something that made Agatha laugh. Rio took a step forward. The sudden lurch forward made her realize the nausea was more than just jealousy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slapping a hand over her mouth, Rio stumbled to the bathroom and barely made it to the toilet before she vomited. She faintly heard the shouts from her friends, and then Alice was there, holding back her hair while Natasha yelled for someone to get her water. It would have been embarrassing if Rio hadn’t been too busy losing everything in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she slumped against the toilet, dizzy and seemingly done, she was helped to the nearest bed. Climbing into the bed, Rio noticed Venus was gone. So was Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t make it to the toilet before she threw up again.</span>

<p>
<span>Of all the different iterations Rio imagined her wedding day, not one of them included the mother of all hangovers making it impossible for her to see straight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was practically drowning herself in water in an attempt to feel less dehydrated. That, some pain medication, and a slice of toast was all that was holding her together at the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could not have told you much about getting ready for her wedding. She was vaguely aware of the flurry of movement around her, her mother at her side, scolding her for drinking too much, and the people doing her hair and make-up. It was around eleven in the morning, she was pretty sure, and the ceremony would be at two in the afternoon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are you holding up?” Alice asked. She was the only one left from their friend group. Everyone else had been ushered out when Paola arrived that morning, and Rio was grateful to still have her here. She felt like the only piece of normalcy left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel like hell,” Rio muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bet,” Alice laughed. “But they did a pretty good job at hiding that fact.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, who’d had her eyes closed the last hour to get her make-up done, looked at Alice through half-lidded eyes. “Yeah?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“See for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio opened her eyes fully, she could only stare. She’d never been particularly skilled with make-up, and most days, her hair was just down in its natural waves or up in a clip. It was jarring to see herself now, professional make-up making her skin look smooth and an elaborate bun at the base of her neck. It felt like looking at a stranger, and Rio couldn’t help but think that it seemed fitting for her to feel that way today. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look beautiful,” Paola said, walking up to her side. She tenderly ran a hand over Rio’s hair and leaned down to press a kiss to her forehead. “Now, time to go. We’ll get you dressed at the church.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt like a stray piece of seaweed swept away by waves, guided wherever someone pushed her. In what felt like the blink of an eye, Rio was taken to the church where the ceremony was taking place, a beautiful church in Upstate New York, not far from the Harkness estate. It was an elegant, stone building with stained glass and ornate wood structures that felt a little bit like a fairy tale. If Rio had to give Catholicism anything, it was that the aesthetics were unmatched in their beauty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is insane,” Rio mumbled under her breath as Alice helped her into her dress. It was just the two of them in the bridal suite. Her mother was off somewhere, yelling about flowers. It was a welcomed reprieve for Rio, a chance to breathe a little. “Alice, what am I doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s hands paused over the buttons. She looked up and met Rio’s gaze in the mirror. “You’re getting married,” Alice said gently. She rested her hands on her shoulders and squeezed them. Her smile was a small quirk of her lips. “But if you’ve changed your mind, I’ll hotwire a car, and we can be out of here before your mom even notices we’re gone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and felt tears prick the corners of her eyes. She wanted to say yes so badly. She wanted to rip off this dress and wipe off all of this make-up, and she wanted to run away and never look back. Rio was afraid though. To get married, yes, but also to disappoint her parents, to sow discord between them and ruin their relationship irreparably. She wanted her life, but was it worth the cost of losing her family?</span>
</p><p>
<span>A trembling breath left Rio before she whispered, “Just promise you’ll still be my friend?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Rio,” Alice sighed. She wrapped her arms around her waist and rested her head on her shoulder, hugging her tight. “You can’t get rid of me that easily, no matter how much your mother probably wishes that was true.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and accepted the tissue Alice handed her. She dabbed at her eyes, trying her best not to ruin the make-up. She let Alice finish helping her into her dress and put on the veil. “For what it’s worth,” Alice said. “You make a beautiful bride.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” Rio said softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them shared one more hug before Alice left to get ready herself, and Rio found herself alone for the first time all day. It was an odd feeling, the stillness and quietness that pervaded the room, but Rio savored it. It was likely her only chance for the rest of the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Standing in front of the mirror, Rio smoothed her hands over the skirt of the dress and took a deep breath. Instinctively, her hands came together, and her nails bit into the skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio was a little girl, it was true that she didn’t dream about her wedding day. When she wasn’t chasing squirrels or climbing trees, Rio thought about wild adventures she’d go on. She would be an astronaut and see the stars. She would be a veterinarian and treat the most exotic of animals. She would be a pilot and travel the world. Rio had dreamed of a lot of things, and in every single one, she always imagined coming home to her parents to tell them about what she'd done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although both of her parents had been busy when Rio was growing up, she’d always felt their love. She felt it in the way Paola would always cook Rio’s favorite foods, especially if she knew she’d had a rough day. She felt it in the way Luis would sit and read with her every chance he had, using silly voices for the characters. She felt it in the way her parents would squeeze her tight every time they said good-bye, even now as an adult. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had always felt the value in her family, in her parents, but as she stood here on her wedding day, the weight of their love suddenly felt like a burden. A heavy thing against her shoulders that kept her in this spot, unmoving, instead of running away as Alice offered. Something she had to work to keep, to fight to maintain, and to stop for one moment meant to lose it altogether. Rio wondered if it would ever feel lighter or if it would only worsen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The door to the bridal suite opened, and Luis stepped in. Rio’s hands dropped back to her sides. His eyes grew misty at the sight of her, and there was nothing but adoration in his face. “My little girl,” Luis said. He didn’t hesitate to pull her into a hug, and Rio hugged him back, probably too tight but she didn’t care. “You are a sight to behold,” he murmured. He pulled back and ran his thumb over her cheek. “Are you ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>No.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, and Luis smiled back. The heaviness on her shoulders ebbed ever so slightly. “Yes,” Rio said. She took her father’s hand. “I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone else was gone by the time Rio stepped into the hall, and it was only a moment before it was her turn to go with her hand tucked into the crook of her father’s arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked down the aisle, Rio felt herself begin to distance her mind from what was happening. It felt more like letting someone else walk down the aisle. That way, some small part of her whispered, it was like someone else was getting married too. Rio barely noticed the walk or even being handed off, and when she stood there with James, it felt like a dream. Not in the sense that it was perfect or something she longed for, but in the fact that she felt a little removed. There was a lack of control to all of this, right down to the smile she gave him as he took her hands, the same way you seem to have no choice over what happens in your dreams.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a long ceremony between the mass and the actual marriage, but somehow, she made it through. As she stepped up to James to say her vows, Rio felt herself snap back into place, forced to be in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yet, even as her mouth opened to repeat the vows, Rio hardly paid attention to them or him. Instead, her eyes were focused just past James to where Agatha stood. When they eyes met, Agatha flinched minutely, but she held her gaze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was Rio’s first time really processing the fact that Agatha was also here. Rio had so desperately tried to ignore everything that was happening that she hadn’t even allowed herself to notice Agatha not even five feet from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps it was for the best though. As Rio took in just how beautiful Agatha looked, she felt her knees buckle. The dark blue complimented Agatha and brought out her eyes. Her long, dark hair was pulled back by two braids, highlighting her cheekbones. It was unfair, Rio thought, for her to look like that, to be so beautiful that Rio had no choice but to look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t realized how long she stared at Agatha until James began to lean in. Then, Rio shut her eyes and held her breath. Their first kiss was a quick press of the lips, barely anything at all, and Rio tried to keep her sigh of relief subtle as she opened her eyes again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess that’s it,” James whispered to her with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it,” Rio echoed, trying to match his expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If Rio had thought the morning was a blur, most of the reception was a blur too. Most of it consisted of accompanying James to each of the tables, accepting their congratulations and thanking them for coming. It was an easy way to schmooze, and Rio let James do most of the talking. Every so often, one of the wives would talk to Rio, complimenting her on how pretty she looked and asking about their honeymoon plans, but for the most part, Rio was able to space out and pretend she wasn’t at her own wedding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t until the father-daughter dance that Rio dragged herself back into the moment, and despite everything, Rio felt herself tear up as her father took her into his arms. The two of them swayed to a song that they’d always danced to together when she was younger, and hearing it again, after all this time, made Rio grasp him tighter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m proud of you,” Luis told her softly. “You are the best parts of me and your mother, you know that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat closed up. A single tear escaped and rolled down her cheek. “Dad–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are so strong, so giving,” Luis told her earnestly. He leaned back just enough to cup her face. There were tears in his eyes too. “We are lucky to have you as our daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit back a sob as she hugged Luis close. It wasn’t just for her, this marriage. It wasn’t for her at all. It was for her father, the man who raised her and protected her and loved her. Rio ached at how badly she wanted to prove herself worthy of everything he’d done for her, and hearing those words, Rio felt herself break. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the dance was the two of them clinging to each other, and when they parted with a kiss to Rio’s forehead, she felt emotionally wrought. Thankfully, not much was expected of her, besides the first dance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>James tried to talk to her during it, but when she only answered in half-hearted hums, he gave up. Rio felt bad and blamed it on her exhaustion. James gave her a smile and said, “You and me both. I can’t wait for this to be over.” Rio could only give another hum, but James didn’t seem to mind, and the two of them spent their first dance in comfortable silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Rio made her way back to the bridal suite that the venue had, she was ready to collapse at any moment. She shut the door behind her and wasn’t sure what she wanted to do first. As tempting as it was to just sit for a minute, she knew she didn’t have much time before they had to leave for the airport. They’d be flying out to Italy tonight for their honeymoon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had just begun to take out her earrings when the door opened. She glanced up into the mirror, only to freeze as she watched Agatha slip inside and shut the door behind her. She hadn’t seen much of her after the ceremony, only glimpses from the corner of her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned around and met her gaze, blue eyes wide like she hadn’t been expecting her. It was ridiculous to think. Agatha had to have known she’d be in here. Who the hell else would there be?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you excited for your honeymoon?” Agatha cut her off smoothly, as if she hadn’t said anything at all. Her smile was too big, stretching across her face in a way that rang false. She moved closer to her but stopped just a few feet away from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t have to do this,” Rio said. She didn’t dare try to name what ‘this’ was. She wasn’t sure she could. She tugged the veil out of her hair and tossed it aside. Leaning against the vanity, she crossed her arms over her chest. “Why are you even here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth, and it looked as though she might lie. To Rio’s surprise, hesitation crossed her face. She shut her mouth and shrugged. “I don’t know,” Agatha finally said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t know?” Rio scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess I just wanted to see you before you left,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio threw her hands up and said, “Well, you’ve seen me. You can go now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, why couldn’t this woman leave her alone? The wedding had already happened. There was nothing left to do. Why was she still here? Why was she still talking to her? “What, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t stop thinking about you,” Agatha said, only for her eyebrows to furrow, like she hadn’t meant to say that. She shook her head and corrected herself, “About this. This marriage. Don’t you ever do anything for yourself?” Agatha stepped closer. Rio wanted to move away, but she was already trapped against the vanity. Also, a part of her didn’t want to move. She wanted to court this danger and let it lie between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you ever get what you want?” Agatha asked as she reached out and let her fingers trace the curve of her cheek. Rio was caught between leaning into the touch and biting at the offending fingers. She did neither, staying still. Agatha seemed to take this as a sign and cupped her face fully. “Tell me you want this, Rio,” Agatha said. She stepped even closer, all but pinning Rio to the vanity. Their noses brushed against each other. “Let me give you this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I’m–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Married?” Agatha said. The derision in her voice made it clear what she thought of that, and Rio felt a thrill go through her despite herself. “I know. I was there. But for just one fucking second, Rio, forget about your family. Forget about my family. Forget about whatever you’re supposed to do and just think about what you want.” Agatha’s other hand cupped her face as well, cradling Rio close. She almost forgot how to breathe. “What do you want?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio said, but it came out weakly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me to stop,” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That was the thing though. Rio didn’t want to. She didn’t want to tell Agatha to stop. She didn’t want Agatha to stop. She hadn’t wanted to stop Agatha in the bar, and she didn’t want to stop her now. Rio wanted Agatha so badly that she felt like she might die from it because it meant betraying everything she’d done. But Rio still wanted her. Despite every part of her screaming at her that this was a bad idea, that this would only hurt her in the long run, Rio still wanted her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio usually prided herself on being level-headed and logical, but none of that seemed to matter with Agatha within reach, offering her everything she craved. Rio had just given up everything, but here was her last chance to have something. Anything. A moment for herself and no one else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha started to pull away. “I’m sorry–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed Agatha’s wrists and crashed her lips into hers. Agatha gasped, unmoving for just one moment, before she kissed Rio deeply. Her nails dug into Rio’s cheeks as her lips moved against hers, and it wasn’t tender or gentle or loving. It was desperate and hungry. It felt like being devoured, every piece of her up for the taking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Any trace of exhaustion was gone, replaced by lustful adrenaline. Rio’s hands scrambled against Agatha for a moment before they found her back, scratching lines down the soft skin as they pulled her closer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I want to touch you,” Agatha breathed against her lips. Her pupils were blown, and Rio found herself flushing at the look of pure desire on her face. “Can I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasted no time rucking Rio’s dress up around her hips, hands frenzied and rough. She didn’t even bother taking off Rio’s underwear, merely pushing them aside and rubbing her fingers against her. They both groaned at the touch, and Agatha buried her face in Rio’s neck for a moment. She mouthed at the heated skin before she pulled away, meeting Rio’s gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve wanted to do this since I saw you,” Agatha told her in a low voice. She pushed one finger into her, and at Rio’s moan, she added another. “Ever since I saw you sitting at that dinner, I’ve wanted you.” Her thrusts were hard and unforgiving, and they were everything Rio needed. She whined as she rocked against Agatha’s hands, struggling to keep her eyes open. “I imagined taking you to bed and ruining you. Teasing you. Making you beg. Making it impossible for you to want anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio gasped. Her nails dragged down her back again, but it was harsher this time. Rio was sure they’d leave marks. Good, she thought. She wanted Agatha to remember this. To see this for days after, so she couldn’t discard Rio like every other woman she’d slept with. Rio’s breath caught as Agatha’s fingers curled inside, and she arched into the touch with a cry. “Fuck, I’m close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can tell,” Agatha said. She kissed Rio again, but it was messy and distracted, and Rio was useless, just moaning against her. Her whispers came pouring out then, coming so quickly that the words almost blurred together, like Agatha wasn’t in control of them. “You feel so good, baby. I could do this all night. I would. Fuck, they’d have to pull me off you. You’re so beautiful like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t take much more with Agatha talking like that, and her orgasm tore through her. It was only Agatha’s quick reflexes, clamping a hand over her mouth, that Rio’s scream didn’t echo through the entire venue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha worked her through it, dragging it out as long as possible, and when she finally pulled her hand away, it went straight to her mouth. With ragged breaths, Rio watched Agatha suck on her fingers, tongue peeking out as she ran it over them. Rio lasted only a few seconds before she was ripping Agatha’s hand away and replacing it with her mouth, tongue eager to taste herself on Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Rio felt steady on her legs again, she spun them around and pushed Agatha up against the vanity. Then, she dropped to her knees, yanking Agatha’s dress up. Rio had to taste her. What if she never had another chance?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hold this,” Rio demanded, forcing the fabric into Agatha’s hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t, </span>
<em>
<span>couldn’t,</span>
</em>
<span> leave marks on Rio, but Rio had nothing stopping her. Without hesitation, Rio sank her teeth into the soft flesh of Agatha’s thigh, reveling in the gasp she got in response. She sucked on the spot and repeated this several times. What did Rio want? She wanted Agatha to remember this night and want her again and again. To make her feel just as insane as she made Rio feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her underwear down around her ankles and buried her face between her thighs. She moaned at just how wet Agatha was, lapping up her arousal like she was starved. It didn’t take long for Agatha to start trembling, and Rio smirked when Agatha’s hand buried itself in her hair, holding her firmly against her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was so tempting to drag this out. She wanted Agatha to beg. There was no time for that though. Rio was vaguely aware that enough time had passed that someone would come looking for her soon. Taking Agatha’s clit into her mouth, Rio eased three fingers into her. Agatha was so wet that she took them easily, and Rio groaned at how hot she felt around her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha moaned. Her hips bucked into her face, and her fingers tightened on her hair. “Fuck, baby.” There it was again. Baby. Rio squeezed her thighs together as she sucked hard, and it was with a breathless gasp that Agatha came. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kept going until Agatha’s hand forced her off, and somewhat dazed, Rio leaned back and stared up at Agatha. If she was beautiful before, she looked divine now, cheeks flushed and lips red. Rio eased herself back onto her feet and didn’t hesitate to kiss her again. She kissed her deep and slow and let Agatha kiss her arousal off her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When their breathing finally slowed, they found themselves with their foreheads pressed against each other, eyes met in content gaze. Rio wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, but she didn’t move or speak. She was afraid to ruin this moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha said, “Rio, I–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A knock on the door startled them apart. Rio hastily wiped at her face as she heard Paola’s voice call through, “Rio, are you ready? James is already in the car.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her brother’s name made Agatha stiffen, bringing back the reality of their situation. Rio hated the way Agatha’s expression shuttered close, wiping any trace of vulnerability from it. “Agatha,” Rio tried.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should finish changing and packing,” Agatha said, no longer looking at her. “I’ll go out and stall your mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio tried again, frustration bleeding through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha hissed, and Rio took a step back at the biting tone. Agatha didn’t back down. If anything, she seemed to double down on her hostility. “We both got what we wanted, Rio. This doesn't have to be a thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried not to show how much that stung, but it was still clear in her voice as she said, “I know that.” She didn’t know that. She didn’t know what to make of this. Having sex with your sister-in-law on the night of your wedding isn’t exactly something that she’d prepared for. Rio clenched her jaw and shook her head. “Just get out then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked hurt for a moment, and Rio nearly laughed. How dare she look hurt now? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have fun on your honeymoon,” was all Agatha said before she left without looking back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted to scream at her as the door closed behind her, but she didn’t. She packed. She changed. She went out to the car where James was waiting and smiled when he took her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you been to Italy before?” James asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>James tilted his head, looking concerned for a moment. He didn't comment on it though. He pressed a kiss to the back of Rio’s hand and said, “It’s beautiful. You’ll love it.” He launched into everything they planned to do there, and Rio let his voice lull her, giving her something to focus on besides the fact that she could still taste Agatha on her tongue.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was a testament to the futility of her marriage that Rio felt more at home walking into the hospital than the brownstone that she shared with James.</p><p>That wasn’t to say being married to James was awful, if she was being honest. James was easy to be with, and that was if he was even around. His career kept him busy, so it was only at the occasional dinner or event that they actually spent any time together. When they were together, James was friendly and respectful, content to keep things platonic. Even on their honeymoon, the furthest he went was a hand around her waist and a kiss on her cheek for the whole week.</p><p>When Rio hadn’t been able to hide her surprise at his lack of advances, James shrugged and explained, “We can take our time and get to know each other first.” Then, he flashed that boyish grin and said, “My charm will win you over eventually.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t said anything to that, but she was relieved that James wouldn’t be trying anything any time soon.</p><p>Despite this, Rio still couldn’t bring herself to truly relax at new home. It didn’t feel like hers. The hospital though? Rio worked there for years. It was the closest thing to home she had left, even if she didn’t work there anymore. </p><p>Leaving her job had been one of the hardest adjustments for Rio, even more so than having a husband. After lengthy, furious discussions with her parents, it was decided that Rio could no longer work her extensive hours as a doctor the way she did before her marriage. Apparently, it was important that her schedule remain free for political events. </p><p>Rio still wasn’t happy about the outcome. It had been a slap to the face, really, to take her years of hard work and toss them aside so easily, but to make it more tolerable, she still went to the hospital frequently to volunteer. With nothing better to do, she went from duty to duty, helping out wherever she could. Since most of the employees were familiar with her too, Rio was allowed to help out more than other volunteers.</p><p>Today had been no different, and at the end of her last shift, Rio went down to the main cafeteria to find herself a snack. Say what you wanted about hospital food, but there was a brownie here that Rio found herself craving every so often. Maybe it was just because she was used to the taste. Either way, her plan was to buy the food then go, but as she was walking out, she saw something that stopped her in her tracks.</p><p>Sitting at one of the tables was Agatha.</p><p>Rio hadn’t seen Agatha since the wedding, and besides a singular comment from James about Agatha going to Chicago one weekend for work, there’d been no mention of her either. </p><p>That didn’t mean Rio hadn’t thought about her. Rio had thought about her a lot.</p><p>For days after the wedding, Rio replayed her tryst with Agatha over and over in her mind, not only because she longed to relive it but also to figure out what had happened afterwards. Because in the midst of memories of Agatha’s hands and mouth, there was the lingering uneasiness over how Agatha had acted when she said good-bye. It had been startling, not to mention hurtful, to hear Agatha so quickly dismiss what had happened.</p><p>Rio wasn’t under any delusions that either of them were in the right here, but the way Agatha treated it like some tawdry fling with a stranger rather than a moment of weakness between them left her reeling. Even if it’d been wrong, Rio also knew that it hadn’t just been something physical. Not for her at least. Rio wouldn’t have risked her new marriage over a one night stand. No, she caved because on some fucked up level, she trusted Agatha enough to fall into her desires. </p><p>Then, nothing. Not a call or a text. </p><p>It wasn’t like Rio had been eager to reach out either though. What was she supposed to say? <em> I haven’t stopped thinking about you even though I really should? </em>There was no way continuing this would go well for her, but Rio couldn’t bring herself to stop thinking about Agatha anyways.</p><p>And now, here she was. </p><p>There was another reason Rio stopped though. Agatha wasn’t alone.</p><p>Sitting with Agatha was a young boy, maybe sixteen years-old. He was tall and lanky with long, brown hair and brown eyes. Rio wasn’t sure what to make of him until he smiled, and suddenly, all Rio could see was Agatha. It was the exact same, wide grin, the one Agatha wore when she managed a particularly clever joke that Rio couldn’t hide her amusement at. </p><p>Rio moved without thinking, walking up to their table, but when she saw the flash of panic on Agatha’s face at the sight of her, she nearly turned around and left. Before she could though, Agatha was on her feet, saying just a touch too loudly, “Rio, what are you doing here?”</p><p>The boy startled and looked over his shoulder, eyes wide with curiosity. </p><p>With no other choice, Rio joined them and said, “Hi, Agatha. I used to work here, but now I just volunteer during my free time.”</p><p>A flicker of dismay made its way across Agatha’s face before she smoothed her expression once more. “That’s very kind of you,” Agatha said. She waved a hand at the boy and said, “Nicky volunteers here too.”</p><p>The boy, Nicky, smiled shyly up at her and waved, saying, “Hi. Nice to meet you. How do you know Agatha?”</p><p>“Rio is James’s new wife,” Agatha explained.</p><p>Nicky looked surprised, and unlike Agatha, he couldn’t hide it. “Oh,” was all he said. His eyebrows furrowed for a moment before he said, “Um, congrats?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but chuckle. “Thanks, kid,” she said. “How are you liking volunteering?” </p><p>The trepidation left the boy immediately as he explained everything he’d done so far. It sounded like he’d been volunteering for years, and now at sixteen, he was able to have different responsibilities. Nicky was passionate as he spoke, and Rio was reminded of herself at that age. Anything to get close to medicine, Rio had been there. Even just talking to patients, Rio had loved it all. </p><p>After Nicky and she shared volunteering stories for a few minutes, Rio glanced at Agatha, expecting to find her annoyed by the interruption. Instead, she found Agatha listening with a fond expression. It was entirely directed at Nicky, but it was still a bit of a shock, seeing that kind of open affection on her face. Clearing her throat, Rio said, “Well, it was good seeing you, Agatha, but I think I’ve intruded enough.”</p><p>“No, you’re good. Stay,” Nicky said. He stood up and grabbed his backpack off the floor, shouldering it. “I actually have to head home now. Lilia wants me to help with dinner.”</p><p>Rio carefully watched Agatha’s expression, the way she seemed disappointed but trying her hardest to hide it. Nonetheless, Agatha’s smile was genuine as she said, “Of course. It was good seeing you, Nicky.”</p><p>“You too,” Nicky said, and that shy smile was back. The two of them stared for an awkward moment, almost like they were unsure of what to do, before Nicky ducked his head and left. As he walked away, he glanced over his shoulder and gave them one more wave. A sweet kid.</p><p>Once he was out of sight, Rio turned back to Agatha and said, “Should I actually stay?”</p><p>“If you want,” Agatha said, but she fidgeted with the sleeves of her shirt as she spoke. Her eyes darted all over the place. Rio almost took pity on her and left when Agatha said, “I suppose you have questions.”</p><p>“Only if you want to share,” Rio said. As curious as she was, she didn’t want to know anything about Agatha unless she wanted her to know. Agatha gave a jerky nod though, and Rio slowly lowered herself into the chair Nicky had just been sitting in. Giving Agatha a chance to collect her thoughts, Rio unpeeled the plastic wrap from her brownie and broke it in half. She placed one half on a napkin and slid it across to Agatha. “You can tell me whatever you feel like telling me,” Rio said.</p><p>“That’s Nicky,” Agatha said. She started picking at the brownie, not eating it but simply pinching off crumbs and letting them fall onto the napkin. “He’s–” She stopped abruptly and sighed.</p><p>“Agatha, you don’t have to–”</p><p>“He’s my son.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw snapped shut with an audible click. Agatha gave her a wry smile at the reaction and said, “What, didn’t hear about that particular rumor during our youth?” When Rio only gave a small shake of her head, Agatha’s smile faded into a more pensive look. “No, I imagine you wouldn’t have,” Agatha sighed. “My parents made it a point to make this a very well kept secret.”</p><p>“How…” Rio trailed off, unsure of how to ask.</p><p>“A youthful indiscretion,” Agatha answered, taking pity on her. “His father, not Nicky. I was fifteen and testing the boundaries of my rebellions. I was already messing around with girls, but my parents thought they were just friends, and well, I wanted to make a point. I wanted to make them mad, so if they weren’t upset about me going out with girls, I decided I’d start going out with boys.” Agatha wore a sardonic smile as she said, “I didn’t like them, and I couldn’t have cared less about them, but let’s just say my curiosity got the better of me just once, and…” Agatha shrugged. </p><p>“I think our circles would have noticed if you were raising a son though,” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha nodded, jaw clenching. She took a deep breath before she said, “Yes, they would, wouldn’t they?”</p><p>“What did your parents do?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha laughed bitterly, but she didn’t look surprised that Rio knew her parents had something to do with it. “My family has deep pockets, as I’m sure you know,” Agatha said. The brownie in front of her was hardly more than a pile of crumbs at this point. She kept picking at it anyway. “It was easy enough for my parents to find a judge to deem me unfit and take my son away, and it was only within the last few years that I was able to unseal the records and find him.”</p><p>“Why were you meeting at the hospital?” Rio asked.</p><p>“He really does volunteer here,” Agatha explained. At the mere mention of him, Agatha’s entire face brightened, chasing away the lingering traces of derision. “I meet him afterwards to make things easier. It also lessens the chances of someone seeing us together, and if they do, it’s easy enough to make excuses.”</p><p>Not if they bothered to look at the two of them together. Even if Rio hadn’t quite made the leap to son, she’d known they were something to each other. She wondered if she should warn Agatha of that, but the other woman looked so pleased at the arrangement that she didn’t want to ruin it at this moment.</p><p>“My mother doesn’t know though,” Agatha said after a while. “I’d appreciate it if she didn’t hear about it from you.”</p><p>Rio wanted to ask why Agatha told her at all. This was deeply personal, and it was the kind of thing that could ruin her reputation if it got out. Why risk telling Rio this? She could have just as easily lied, just as she said she would if anyone else in their circle had seen them. Why tell Rio of all people? It didn’t make any sense to her, especially considering how Agatha treated her the last time they saw each other.</p><p>Still, Rio understood the importance of what she’d been told, so she nodded and said, “I won’t say a word.” She hesitated then added, “Thank you for telling me.”</p><p>Agatha flushed and looked away. The crumbs of her brownie were immediately squished under her fingers, and Rio tried to hide her amusement at the action. “Yes, well,” Agatha huffed. “If you’re going to be at the hospital all the time, you’re going to see us together quite often. Better get it over with now than later.”</p><p>It was a flimsy excuse, but Rio didn’t press. She was just relieved that Agatha was speaking to her at all. Instead, there was something else bothering Rio. “Can I ask a question?” </p><p>Smartass, that she was, Agatha replied, “You just did.” When Rio rolled her eyes, Agatha smirked and said, “Fine, go ahead.”</p><p>“Why do you still talk to your family?” Rio asked genuinely. It was something that she’d wondered before, but it was even more of a mystery now, knowing what Evanora had done to Agatha in her youth. “You say fuck it to everything else, but you never leave. Why?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look wholly surprised by the question, but she didn’t answer immediately either. The brownie crumbs were now a misshapen lump that Agatha poked and prodded idly. She was silent for so long that Rio thought she wouldn’t answer her at all. Finally though, Agatha looked up and said, “Why did you marry my brother?”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. “Oh.”</p><p>For the first time, Rio realized that perhaps Agatha and she weren’t so different after all. It was strange to imagine though, considering all the hell Agatha brought upon her family, even to this day. Then again, Rio of all people also understood how hard it was to break away from your family, the people whose acceptance and love she craved above all else. Was that what it was like for Agatha too? If it was, why did she do every scandalous thing that she did?</p><p>Rio wasn’t going to get those answers today though. Maybe not ever. So instead of asking, Rio pushed her brownie towards Agatha and said, “Here. Have my half.”</p>

<p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure if she was imagining things, but after meeting Nicky, she swore she saw him around the hospital more often. It could simply be that she recognized his face now where she didn’t before, but regardless of the reason, Rio found herself talking to him between shifts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Although she knew Agatha hadn’t raised him, Rio still found herself searching for glimpses of her in the boy. She quickly discovered that Nicky certainly had Agatha’s wit and charm, but he was overall much softer than she was. There was none of the bite or combativeness to him, even if he did occasionally get sassy with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they spoke, it was usually about their volunteer work, but every so often, Nicky would mention his meetings with Agatha. Rio wasn’t sure what to make of it at first, but then she realized Nicky most likely had very few people in his life that knew Agatha was his birth mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha brought me a gift last week,” Nicky told her one day. His smile was excited and prideful, but there was also a bit of shyness to it, like he couldn’t believe she’d gotten him something. “A book, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What book?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro,” Nicky said. He dug around his backpack for a moment before he found the book and handed it to her. “It’s weird and kind of sad, but I like it so far.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s good,” Rio told him. She thumbed through the pages and handed it back. “But you’re right. It is sad and weird, but I think that’s the point of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what Agatha said too,” Nicky sighed. “Does it get any less sad?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This made Rio crack a smile. “I hate to break it to you, but no, it doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The conversation stayed on Rio’s mind, long after she left the hospital. It’d been years since Rio read it, but it seemed fitting for her current life to read about others whose lives were beholden to others. Maybe she’d check it out from the library or ask Nicky to borrow his copy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was still thinking about the book as she got into the town car with James that evening, headed for the Harkness Estate for dinner. Apparently, every month or so, the family would meet to have a meal together, even Agatha. It would have seemed like a sweet idea if it were any family besides the Harknesses. Rio wasn’t sure what to expect, even with James’s reassurance that it was a perfectly normal meal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as they entered the house, the two of them were ushered into the sitting room where Evanora was waiting. James was greeted first, followed by Evanora scanning Rio and pronouncing, “Rio, it’s so good to see you. Marriage suits you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Rio said. There wasn’t much else to say to something like that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After being handed a glass of wine, Evanora focused on speaking to James about other politicians he’d met with recently. Rio didn’t mind being ignored by Evanora. It was better than whatever backhanded or ignorant comment she’d say. Rio silently sipped at her wine for twenty minutes until a maid announced Agatha had arrived.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Letting out a small sigh of relief, Rio looked to the entrance for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had only seen her once since the day she met Nicky, and while it had still been a tad awkward between them, it seemed as though most of the sudden distance after the wedding was gone now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha strode into the sitting room, dressed in a tailored navy suit, proclaiming, “With five minutes to spare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora rolled her eyes and excused herself to check on dinner, but James chuckled. At Rio’s questioning look, he leaned over and explained, “Five minutes until she would have been late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you usually late?” Rio asked Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sometimes,” Agatha admitted freely. She walked over to the bar cart and poured herself a generous glass of whiskey. “But I always have a good reason.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother would disagree,” James replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged and took a sip of her whiskey. “Yes, well, Mother disagrees with me about everything. Did she tell you about the charity lunch she wants me to sponsor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she listened to James and Agatha talk, Rio realized she’d never really seen them interact before. Besides the wedding, Rio only ever saw one of them at a time. To her surprise, they seemed to get along fairly well. James took Agatha’s brusqueness in stride, and Agatha played off of James’s passiveness with more talking. It was only then that it truly sank in for Rio that they were siblings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling a little off-balanced by the painfully obvious realization, Rio went to use the restroom. She couldn’t splash water on her face without ruining her make-up, but she took a spare towel and ran it under some water. She pressed it to the back of her neck and took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew Agatha and James were siblings. She’d known that from the beginning. If that was so, why was it so difficult for her to remember that fact now? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip. She knew exactly why. Her wedding night with Agatha was still burned into her memory, and Rio still wanted her. The one moment of weakness hadn’t soothed the desire that threatened to consume her. If anything, it seemed to worsen it. Yet, seeing Agatha and James together only proved to her that what she wanted was wrong. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That didn’t magically change her feelings though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sighing, Rio went back out. She headed back to the sitting room, but a large portrait in the hallway made her pause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was an old photograph, one where James looked about twelve and Agatha looked about ten. The late Richard Harkness sat in a chair in the middle, dressed in a dark suit with a solemn expression. His blue eyes were piercing, as were Agatha’s, who stood beside him. She looked darling, if Rio was being honest, in a velvet blue dress with a matching ribbon in her hair. She also looked just like her father. On the other side, Evanora stood with one hand on Richard’s shoulder and the other on James’s. The collar of her white blouse was crisp, and there wasn’t a wrinkle to be seen in her skirt. Then, there was James, trying to appear as serious as his father, but looking all the more like a child in his suit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was the last time they were able to get me to stay still for one of these,” Agatha informed her as she joined her in front of her. Rio tried not to look too startled by her presence. “Plus, Father was always busy. He said he didn’t have time for such frivolous things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father was always away on business,” James added, walking up on Rio’s other side. “It was a rarity to have him home longer than a week, and even then, he was always in his office.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother wasn’t home often either,” Agatha said absently, and as she gazed at the photograph of her family, she almost seemed as though she’d gone back in time. “There was always an event.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thankfully, we didn’t have to attend most of those,” James said. He wore that boyish smile again, still pleased to this day to be free of his mother’s events. “Agatha and I spent most of our childhood at home with the nannies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Staring up at the family portrait, Rio realized she actually didn’t know much about the Harkness family at all, nothing substantial at least. Rio glanced at each of the siblings, wondering if they realized how lonely their childhood sounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was your childhood like, Rio?” James asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her, no doubt recalling what Rio had told her in the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My father worked often,” Rio answered with a small shrug. “My mother was home more often. It was okay. We made it work.” While James nodded thoughtfully, Rio’s eyes found Agatha’s. Although she said nothing, Agatha gave a small nod. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was then a maid found them and informed them dinner was ready and Evanora was waiting for them in the dining room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she took her seat, Rio thought that perhaps this dinner would not be as bad as she initially thought. However, as they began to eat, Evanora had to prove her wrong. Rio understood there was only so much to talk about, but Evanora only spoke to and about James. It was all about how James was doing, what James was doing, what James thought. James, James, James.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not once did Evanora mention Agatha. She hardly even acknowledged her daughter. Every casual dismissal of her only infuriated Rio further, and by the time they finished dessert, she felt dizzy with rage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And how is work for you, Agatha?” Rio finally asked. All three of the Harknesses turned to look at her in surprise, but Rio kept her voice even as she said, “I don’t know much about legal proceedings, but I find it interesting. Can you share much about your current caseload?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora looked confused and just a tad angry. Meanwhile, James was clearly trying to hide his smile, and Agatha looked utterly taken aback. After a long moment, Agatha cleared her throat. “I can’t disclose too much,” she said slowly. “But I can explain some of the difficulties with one couple.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As dessert was cleared away, Rio listened with rapt attention as Agatha explained the absolute shit show that was the divorce proceedings that she was currently handling. It was messy and hilarious, and Rio and James were both laughing by the time Agatha finished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lovely,” Evanora said snidely, clearly meaning anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes narrowed, but before she could react beyond that, James’s phone rang.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Work,” James said with an apologetic smile. He patted her shoulder and suggested, “Agatha, do you want to give Rio a proper tour of our home? This will probably take a while.” It was a random suggestion, but when James pointedly glanced at Evanora, Rio realized that he was making sure that she wouldn’t end up alone with his mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled gratefully and said, “Do you mind, Agatha? I’d love to see the place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was no idiot, so she nodded, saying, “Not at all. Let’s go. I can show you what James’s childhood bedroom looks like. I’m sure he still has one or two posters of half-naked women hung up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse you,” James grinned. “They were fully naked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted and Agatha rolled her eyes, but Evanora said sharply, “James.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>James shrugged and left to take his call while Rio followed Agatha out of the dining room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio half-expected Agatha not to bother with the tour, but Agatha dutifully walked her around the ground floor, explaining the use of each of the rooms. Most of it was said matter-of-factly, and Rio wondered how often she’d been told to give tours like this. It almost seemed like Agatha had a script memorized.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The longer they explored the house though, the harder it was to imagine Agatha growing up here. While James, easy-going and complacent, fit it neatly, Agatha with her biting wit and impatience felt distinctly dissonant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once again, Rio was reminded of just how similar they really were. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Both of them were trapped in families that didn’t seem to truly see them. They only saw what they wanted. Or worse, they only saw what they were lacking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Upstairs?” Rio asked when they finished a loop of the ground floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. “It’s just bedrooms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would like to see them,” Rio said. “You did promise me childhood bedrooms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I promised you James’s,” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled as she followed Agatha up the stairs, saying, “I fully expect to see yours too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s not much to see,” Agatha said. She glanced around before she led Rio down a long hallway filled with paintings that looked like they’d been around since colonial America. She opened the first door, which looked to be a generic guess room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio poked her head in then looked back at Agatha. She asked, “What, no half-naked ladies on your walls like James?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As if my mother would let that happen,” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I fully believe you’d have them hidden somewhere if you wanted them,” Rio said with a grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she was smiling. She also didn’t deny it. Rio made a note to look for a hidden compartment when they got to Agatha’s room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Most of the rooms were like the first, expensive and bland. They spent a little longer in James’s childhood bedroom. No less extravagant but also a little more lived in with a few baseball trophies and the aforementioned posters. Rio laughed when she saw them, and she posed by them, making Agatha laugh too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The resemblance is uncanny,” Agatha joked, eyes going between the curvy blonde in a bikini and Rio in her simple black dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few doors down from James’s room was what Rio was really curious about: Agatha’s room. As soon as they walked in, Agatha looked uncomfortable. It was easy to see why. The room was nothing like Agatha. It was ornate and delicate, gold and pale pink with floral prints embroidered on every surface of available fabric. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked around the room slowly, taking in every detail, while Agatha went to stand by a large window with a bench placed in front of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The strangest part of it all was the fact that there wasn’t a speck of dust in the room. A maid must come through frequently to keep it clean, maintaining a strange stasis of Agatha’s childhood bedroom. If it was unnerving for Rio to see this, she could only imagine what it was like for Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Rio was about to apologize for making her come in, Agatha said, “I used to sneak out through this window.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although she was caught off guard by the sudden remark, Rio still laughed, “No way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s a tree right there,” Agatha said. She tapped the window. “I used to climb onto the branch and crawl down from there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m surprised your parents didn’t just cut down the tree,” Rio said. She came to stand beside her. Sure enough, there was a large tree right by the window with branches thick enough to hold a person. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged a little. “I don’t think they believed I was capable of climbing trees.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It sounded like they underestimated Agatha a lot. Rio turned to look at her. She was still staring out the window, and she had that same look she had when they were in front of the family portrait, like she was a little lost. It didn’t suit her, looking unsure. Not when Rio was so used to seeing her so confident. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never did apologize,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened. She crossed her arms over her chest as she glanced at Rio. “For what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For saying you never struggled,” Rio said, thinking about that night in the bar. “That you’re spoiled and selfish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha said nothing for a moment. When she looked at Rio again, she wore a false smile and said, “Well, I did own up to being selfish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t do that,” Rio said, and Agatha’s jaw clenched. She stepped closer and placed her hand on Agatha’s arm. “Don’t act like it’s okay when it’s not.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze was different when she looked at Rio this time. Open and curious, and if Rio wasn’t imagining things, a little scared. Slowly, Agatha reached out and cupped Rio’s face, and despite herself, Rio leaned into the touch. “Thank you for apologizing,” Agatha said quietly. “I don’t know the last time someone has.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wondered how the people around Agatha so carelessly mistreat her when she was one of the most interesting people she’d ever met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You say you’re selfish,” Rio said. “Maybe I’m selfish too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes darted up to hers as she let out an incredulous laugh. Her hand dropped back to her side, but Rio’s hand only held on tighter. Agatha said, “Rio, you are the least selfish person I know. You literally got married for your parents.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I’m so selfless, why can’t I stop thinking about kissing you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the humor disappeared from Agatha’s face, replaced by a hunted look. “Rio–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I could do this,” Rio said, stepping closer. “I thought I could handle being in a loveless marriage, but you’re here. You’re right here in front of me, and all I can think about is what I could have.” She moved even closer, only stopping when Agatha cupped her face with both hands. It was both a caress and a warning to stay where she was. Rio held Agatha’s wrists as she said, “I see someone who no one else seems to see, and I think that’s a goddamn travesty, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t mean this,” Agatha tried to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio did mean this. All night, Rio couldn’t tear her eyes away from Agatha when all everyone else seemed to want to do was talk about James. Rio could handle being invisible to her family. It was something she’d been forced to get used to since she was old enough for her parents to consider her a bargaining chip instead of their daughter. Seeing it done to Agatha though? It felt wrong. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio whispered. “Let me be selfish with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in and stopped, giving Agatha a chance to pull away. When she didn’t, Rio pressed her lips to hers. As soon as their lips met, Rio couldn’t help but sigh. She’d been thinking about this for weeks, and Agatha’s lips were just as soft as she remembered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Although the kiss started chaste, Rio couldn’t help but deepen it. She pressed herself against Agatha and traced her lips with her tongue until her mouth fell open to her. Rio moaned as their tongues met and finally pulled her hands out of Agatha’s hold to slide her hands down her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked Agatha away from the window. She pushed her onto the bed and climbed on top of her. Straddling her hips, Rio felt drunk on the thrill of seeing Agatha sprawled out beneath her in her childhood bedroom. The feeling was only heightened by the way Agatha stared up at her, blue eyes wide and pink lips parted. Rio bit her lip as she cupped Agatha’s jaw and let her thumb brush over her lower lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want this, Agatha?” Rio asked softly. When Agatha nodded, Rio smiled slightly. “No, I want you to say it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, but after a moment, she swallowed and whispered, “I want you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned down to kiss her again when she thought of something. “Does your door lock?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha said. “Mother and I argued over that a lot when I was younger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And let me guess,” Rio smirked. “You won?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My father got tired of listening to us scream at each other,” Agatha said with a shrug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile flickered ever so slightly. She kissed Agatha lightly on the lips before she went to lock the door. She went back to Agatha and let her hands glide along her legs, settling at the fly of her pants. She glanced back up, and when Agatha nodded, Rio undid it and slid her hand inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel how wet Agatha was already through the damp fabric of her underwear and tried to keep her smile from growing too large. She moved beneath her underwear, swiping her hands through her arousal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A low moan escaped Agatha’s lips, and instinctively, Rio clamped her hand over her mouth. Their eyes met for a tense moment, but Rio kept her hand where it was. “Do you want them to hear you?” Rio hissed. When Agatha only raised a brow, Rio smiled and looked away. Of course. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking a deep breath, Rio met her gaze and pushed a finger inside. Agatha bucked against her, and Rio added another finger, curling them inside her. Agatha’s noises were muffled against her hand, but the way her eyes fluttered made it clear just how much she was enjoying this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio built her up slowly, savoring the way Agatha grew more and more desperate beneath her. Her hips jerked against her hand, her back arched off the mattress, her hands dug into the blanket, and her mouth hadn’t stopped from the moment Rio placed her hand over it. The vibrations would have tickled if not for the way they were coupled by Agatha’s heavy, half-lidded stare. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you close?” Rio asked. Her only answer was another stifled moan. “I wish I could pull my hand away,” Rio told her. She changed the angle of her thrusts and swiped over her clit with her thumb. Agatha’s hand shot up from the bed to clutch at Rio’s back. “I wish I could hear you scream my name until you lose your voice.” Agatha was frantic now, hips chasing after every touch. “Come for me, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s entire body went taut, and even with Rio’s hand over her mouth, her cry was audible. As soon as the sound was done though, Rio finally pulled her hand away and crashed her lips into Agatha’s. She dragged out her orgasm for as long as she could, devouring every lingering whimper that left Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When her body finally calmed, their kisses slowed until Rio pulled away. Her hand followed, but just like last time, Agatha took the soaked fingers into her mouth, sucking them clean. Rio bit down hard on her lip to keep herself from moaning, but when Agatha smiled around her fingers, she couldn’t stop a quiet whine from escaping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio yanked her hand away and kissed Agatha again, suddenly all too aware of the fact that her underwear was ruined. Agatha’s hands just reached the hem of Rio’s dress when they heard James’s voice from down the hall call out, “Agatha! Rio! Mother is insisting on another round of drinks before we go, and I refuse to do that alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Biting back her frustration, Rio broke the kiss and rested her forehead against Agatha’s. The two of them shared a look before breaking into shy smiles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looks like I owe you,” Agatha whispered. She watched as Rio moved away and stood up from the bed. Agatha sat up and ran a hand through her hair. She bit her lip. “Unless–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll text you,” Rio said. She swallowed and tried to ignore the anxiety that welled up inside her. It felt like there was no going back now though, and she didn’t want to either. “Besides, you know where I work.” Rio felt herself scowl slightly as she corrected herself, “Where I volunteer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha eyed her for a moment but ultimately said nothing. She merely stood up and zipped up her pants. She ran a hand through her hair again and did a mocking spin. “Do I look like you just fucked me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blushed. “Agatha,” she said, chastising.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked and brushed past her. “Come on, Rio. My brother is waiting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brother. Rio’s husband.</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, she was in trouble.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio never thought of herself as the kind of woman who would have an affair.</p><p>If it was one thing Rio had prided herself on as she grew up, it was her morals. Her sense of right and wrong. Her need for justice. </p><p>From the moment she started school, Rio had been a bit of a tattle tale. She couldn’t help it. If she saw someone breaking the rules, she couldn’t let it go. It didn’t exactly make her popular with her classmates, but it was better than the uncomfortable, squirmy feeling she got in her stomach when she knew something was wrong. It was even worse when Rio herself did something she knew she shouldn’t.</p><p>There was a reason why Rio was such a well-behaved child. </p><p>Although some of it was undoubtedly how her parents raised her, there was also just something she was born with. A need to follow the rules, no matter what.</p><p>All sense of herself came crashing down when she was twenty-nine and having an affair with Agatha.</p><p>Affair. It sounded so scandalous when it was phrased like that. It made it feel like this was Rio sneaking around because she enjoyed lying to James and didn’t give a damn about the consequences. Or, that Rio didn’t care about the fact that she might hurt James because of this.</p><p>In truth, Rio still felt that awful, roiling feeling in her stomach every time she left Agatha’s apartment, but she couldn’t bring herself to stop yet. </p><p>This was the one thing Rio did for herself. </p><p>Between stiff dinners with James and volunteering at the hospital, her few hours with Agatha felt like the only time Rio could truly let go.</p><p>It had been intoxicating the first time it happened, just a few days after dinner at the Harkness estate. Agatha had texted her, asking if she was free the following afternoon, and when Rio said yes, she sent her address. It had been that simple.</p><p>Stepping into Agatha’s apartment, Rio had felt like she was on the brink of a panic attack, shoulders tense and breath coming a tad too fast. Agatha seemed to know though, and instead of going straight into sex, she led Rio into the kitchen where she made them tea. As she did, she talked calmly to Rio, explaining how long she’d lived here and her thoughts about moving in the next year or so.</p><p>As they drank their tea, Agatha gave her a brief tour. It was a beautiful apartment with an open concept. It was a lot of dark, rich colors, and although Rio doubted Agatha decorated the place herself, it still felt like her. Extravagant and expensive but also tasteful and thoughtful.</p><p>By the time their drinks were gone, Rio was relaxed enough to let Agatha pull her into her bedroom and push her down onto her bed.</p><p>Not that she’d ever admit it, but Rio almost passed out the first time she saw Agatha fully naked. </p><p>She’d been laying there, breathlessly watching as Agatha tugged off her clothes and tossed them aside. When she was down to her underwear, she straddled Rio’s hips, and that was when Rio saw a glint of metal on her stomach.</p><p>“Is that a belly button piercing?” Rio had all but squeaked.</p><p>Agatha had grinned, hovering over her with a glint in her eye. “Why don’t you get closer and check?”</p><p>So Rio had. She checked very thoroughly. </p><p>Now, Rio couldn’t help but admire the piercing every time she saw it. While it’d clearly been a part of Agatha’s rebellious youth, it still suited her. Not to mention, it was incredibly sexy. </p><p>At the moment though, Rio wasn’t thinking about the affair or the apartment or even the piercing. All she could focus on was Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s hands curled around the headboard, breath ragged as she felt Agatha push two fingers inside her. Her eyes fell shut, but it was when Agatha added a third finger that Rio couldn’t help but moan. Her head dropped against the headboard as she tried to keep herself upright. </p><p>Two months together, and Rio still couldn’t believe how insane Agatha’s touch could make her feel. Rio had sex before this. She’d even had what she thought was good sex. It was a laughable thought now because Rio was confident she’d never been touched like this before in her life.</p><p>It was like Agatha always knew exactly how to touch her just so, exactly just how far to push her, exactly how to make Rio surrender. </p><p>“Just like that, baby,” Agatha whispered. Rio whimpered, hands tightening on the headboard. She could feel Agatha smile against her cheek, just before she said, “You feel so good. So wet for me.”</p><p>Rio cried out as Agatha reached around and brushed over her clit. “Fuck,” Rio moaned. “Agatha.” Her fingers started circling, and Rio thought she might black out as Agatha’s tongue flicked against her ear. “Agatha,” Rio repeated, knowing just how much she liked hearing her say her name. </p><p>When Rio came, it was Agatha’s name on her tongue, said over and over again like a chant. </p><p>Rio slumped against the headboard as Agatha pulled out with a gentle kiss to her shoulder. Her eyes were closed as she tried to catch her breath, still reeling from the pleasure that had her body lax and pliant.  </p><p>She was still recovering when she felt Agatha’s tongue lap at her. Her eyes flew open as she gasped. Her hand instinctively reached down and found Agatha’s hair where she now laid between her thighs. Agatha’s eyes twinkled with mischief as she continued to lick at Rio’s sensitive center, gentle but insistent. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said. She almost told her to stop, but then Agatha circled her clit with the tip of her tongue. With a groan, Rio grinded against her face. “Fuck, Agatha. Please, please, please. Don’t tease.”</p><p>As she rocked against her face, she kept one hand on the headboard and the other tangled in Agatha’s hair. Rio smiled breathlessly when she pulled on the strands and Agatha moaned against her. There was always something about the way Agatha used her mouth, ravenous and insatiable, like she would taste Rio forever if she could.</p><p>Her second orgasm tore through Rio, making her arms and legs tremble. She eased off of Agatha and collapsed beside her. Through half-lidded eyes, she could see Agatha smiling smugly up at her, but Rio didn’t have enough energy to scold her for her cockiness. She merely slid down to lie beside her and catch her breath.</p><p>Rio had her eyes closed, so when Agatha’s fingers touched her stomach, she tensed. After a moment though, she relaxed into the touch as Agatha traced idle shapes against her skin. It was something she’d noticed over the last few weeks. Agatha was an incredibly tactile creature, constantly touching her outside of sex, whether it was a hand on her waist before or her fingers brushing against her after. Considering Rio’s only other forms of social interaction were James or others at the hospital, it was both strange yet comforting to be touched by Agatha so casually and frequently. </p><p>“Still with me?” Agatha’s question came in a gravelly, low voice, and Rio opened her eyes to find the other woman lying on her side with her head propped up on her hand. Her smile had softened, and her eyes were alight with a kind of ease that made Rio smile back. Agatha caught that and leaned in, teasing, “Or did I fuck you so well that you can’t speak?”</p><p>“It’ll take more than that to make me speechless,” Rio replied, but they could both hear how hoarse she was.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Is that a challenge?” </p><p>Rio only smiled and shrugged.</p><p>Agatha moved closer, draping herself over Rio and kissing her. It was a slow kiss, lips and tongues moving lazily against each other in a way that Rio had become familiar with. This wasn’t Agatha trying to start something. This was Agatha enjoying the specific kind of intimacy that had been sparked between them.</p><p>It wasn’t just sex, which is what Rio had expected at the beginning. There was no awkward fumbling. Rio wasn’t kicked out as soon as it was over. </p><p>If anything, Agatha seemed to luxuriate in the fact that Rio lingered. She curled up close to her and sighed when Rio ran her fingers through her hair. It made Rio wonder when was the last time that Agatha let someone in. Undoubtedly, Agatha had slept with other women over the years, but did she ever date any of them? Did she ever let them steal snacks from her pantry and make them tea like she did for Rio?</p><p>Rio understood what it was like to be alone, so she never rushed to leave. She enjoyed the strange taste of domesticity she had with Agatha, so unlike her perfunctory life with James.</p><p>“If I had more time, I’d make sure you couldn’t speak or walk for a week,” Agatha whispered against her lips, and Rio couldn’t help the shiver that ran through her at the thought. Agatha felt it and smiled. She nipped at her lower lip. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you? So sore that you’d ache for days after.”</p><p>“Keep talking like that, and I’m going to make you prove it right now,” Rio replied. </p><p>Agatha chuckled and settled down against Rio, resting her head on her shoulder. Her fingers resumed their drawing. “Tell me something,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Her fingers paused for a moment. Rio was vaguely aware of the half-traced star beside her belly button. Agatha’s fingers moved again, but she didn’t finish the shape. “Who was your first kiss?”</p><p>The question startled a laugh out of Rio. She glanced down at Agatha, but she just returned her gaze intently. While they talked often and about several different things, it felt like a random question to ask. Usually, Agatha liked to pick her brain about the recent policies James was working on or her life in New York. It was rarely about their pasts.</p><p>“I was fourteen, I think,” Rio said. Absently, her hand reached up and stroked Agatha’s hair. “It was the summer before high school, and I begged my parents to let me go to a soccer camp that my school was hosting. It was a way to get yourself noticed by the coach before try-outs even happened.”</p><p>“So you’ve always been athletic?” Agatha asked. She’d made it abundantly clear how much she appreciated Rio’s dedication to going to the gym, even though she rarely went herself. “A little too much energy?”</p><p>“No, I just liked sports,” Rio said, laughing. “I liked the discipline and focus it required. Kept me busy too, I guess.”</p><p>Agatha sat up a little and said, “Please tell me you played softball too.” Rio rolled her eyes, to which Agatha said, “I’m not hearing a no.” She grabbed Rio’s chin, forcing her to look down at her. She grinned as she asked, “Have a fling with a teammate?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t call it a fling,” Rio muttered, making Agatha laugh loudly. She pinched Agatha’s side and said, “Do you want to hear about my first kiss or not?”</p><p>“I’m listening,” Agatha said. She batted her eyelashes, but that only made Rio pull her head away with a smile. “Go on.”</p><p>“It was two weeks at the school,” Rio continued. “It was a fancy private school too, so there were dorms that we stayed in. Just thirty of us, crammed together, spending every moment together.” Agatha let out an amused snort, and Rio grinned. “Yeah, uh, it was a disaster waiting to happen.” Her fingers resumed running through Agatha’s hair as she said, “I got close to one of the girls though. Victoria. She was a striker, and she was really good, and I just thought she was really pretty and funny too.”</p><p>“What a cute crush,” Agatha said, but there was no mocking tone. Just an honest thought.</p><p>Rio smiled, “It was the biggest crush I think I ever had. I could barely function around her, but I still went out of my way to make sure I was partnered with her for every drill.” Her hand stilled, curling around the long strands. “We got close, really close, and on the last night, we were hanging out on the bleachers, and she kissed me.” Rio hesitated. She didn’t like remembering this next part. </p><p>As she tried to gather her thoughts, Agatha cupped her face and tilted it back down towards hers. Her smile had turned knowing and solemn. She stroked Rio’s cheek with a tender thumb and murmured, “And you ran, didn’t you?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said quietly. “I did.” She buried her face in the crown of Agatha’s head, not wanting her to see how much she still hated herself for it. She could still see Victoria’s face so clearly, the hurt etched in her expression when Rio blew her off when school started. Rio let out a shaky breath. “What about you?” Rio asked. “Who was your first kiss?”</p><p>It was a clear diversion, but Agatha answered without hesitation, “I was twelve.”</p><p>“Twelve?” Rio huffed in amusement. </p><p>“Hush,” Agatha said, elbowing her. “We were playing truth or dare, and I got dared to kiss Lucy Seymour.” Agatha’s face was nothing but fond nostalgia as she recalled the memory. “Everyone was so scandalized, but I didn’t even hesitate. I kissed her, and I liked it. It was that simple. I liked kissing girls.”</p><p>“And let me guess,” Rio couldn’t help but quip, “you decided to keep kissing girls.”</p><p>“I had no shortage of girls to kiss,” Agatha shrugged. “There’s a lot of repressed and curious girls in our circle, Rio.”</p><p>Rio snorted, “Agatha, look at who you’re talking to.”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>Rio looked down again and felt her breath catch. Agatha’s blue eyes were almost luminescent in the sunlight, and while that was unnerving in its own right, it was the depth of her stare that made Rio want to pull away. She felt horribly naked with her eyes on her, and it had nothing to do with the fact that she wore no clothes. Instead, it had everything to do with the fact that Agatha seemed to see all of Rio, right down to the messy core of her being. Agatha was the only one who saw Rio, the woman who sacrificed her happiness to marry a man, and Rio, the same woman who risked everything to gain back a shred of that happiness with his sister.</p><p><em>Do you ever think we should stop?</em> Rio wanted to ask. <em>Can we really do this forever? Won’t we get caught?</em></p><p>Before Rio could think of what to actually say, her phone let out a trill of notes, signalling the alarm she set. </p><p>“Duty calls,” Agatha said. She got off of Rio and reached for her robe. She slipped it on as she got up from the bed, tying it loosely. Rio couldn’t help but watch her for a moment, imagining a life where she’d be able to wake up every morning to Agatha like this. Oblivious to her thoughts, Agatha walked around the bed and nudged her ankle, saying, “If you keep lying there, you’re not going to be able to shower before he comes home.”</p><p>Rio wrinkled her nose, but she knew she was right. It was a part of her routine now to shower as soon as she got home, whether it was from the hospital or Agatha’s. As far as James was concerned, it was always because of the hospital germs. Rio doubted he’d ever consider that she was washing the smell of sex from her skin.</p><p>After getting dressed, Rio followed Agatha back to her front door. Saying good-bye was always the hardest. It always felt a little awkward. Perhaps, it was because Rio never wanted to leave in the first place.</p><p>Agatha never seemed to feel the tension though. She merely kissed Rio lightly on the lips and said, “I’ll text you.” </p><p>Rio gave her a small smile and nodded. </p><p>When Rio got home, James was already there. She froze in their entryway, trying to process the fact that her husband was lounging on their couch and watching TV. It wasn’t an uncommon sight, but it wasn’t usually one she saw until much later in the evening.</p><p>“Hey,” James said, not looking away from the TV. “How was the hospital?”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio replied. She ran a nervous hand through her hair. She fought the urge to look down and check herself. She wasn’t even sure if Agatha had left any marks. They both knew she shouldn’t, but it was all too easy to get carried away sometimes. Clearing her throat, Rio inched her way further into the apartment and asked, “What are you doing home so early?”</p><p>“My mother,” James said with a sigh. He finally looked at her, but he didn’t look the least bit suspicious. If anything, he looked apologetic. “Every once in a while, she gets it into her head that we, well me really, aren’t being religious enough. She wants us to attend mass tonight and go out for dinner after.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath. He could not be saying what she thought he was saying. “By us, do you mean that I need to go to mass and dinner too?”</p><p>“I’m really sorry,” James said, and it actually sounded sincere. “She just sprung it on me this morning. If it makes you feel any better, this only happens, like, once or twice a year.”</p><p>“Okay, let me go shower and get ready then,” Rio said, already resigned to her evening. “Is Agatha coming too?”</p><p>James snorted, “Definitely not. Mother knows better than to make Agatha sit through mass.”</p><p>“Why couldn’t you have been more troublesome in church growing up?” Rio sighed, keeping her tone playful but meaning every word.</p><p>“Sometimes, I ask myself the same thing,” James said. He caught Rio’s hand as she walked by and gave it a warm squeeze. “I really am sorry though. I’ll make it up to you somehow. Anything you want.” He flashed a grin and joked, “A puppy? A car? I’m serious. You’ve been going to a lot of my bullshit events lately. It’s gotta suck.”</p><p>“It does suck,” Rio agreed, “but I’m your wife. It’s kind of my job.”</p><p>James’s smile softened. He let go of Rio’s hand, saying, “Yeah, but you’re not just my wife, you know that, right? You’re allowed to have a life outside of all of this.”</p><p>Immediately, Rio thought of Agatha, of being with Agatha. Did that count as a life outside of this if it was all done in secrecy? Would James be so kind and encouraging if he knew that was how Rio spent her time away from him?</p><p>“You’re being too nice,” Rio told him. “It’s weird.”</p><p>James just laughed and replied, “I’m telling you. I’m playing the long game with you. It’s all a part of the plan to make you fall madly in love with me over the years. The perfect love story actually.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh. She knew it would never happen, but there was something about the good-natured way he seemed to take her reluctance. He never took it personally or got upset, even when they hadn’t had more than the occasional peck on the lips. Rio knew that other men wouldn’t be so patient. Maybe the bar was low, but it was low for a reason, and Rio knew better than to take James for granted.</p><p>After showering, Rio dressed in a modest blue dress and pulled her hair up into a twist. She didn’t think there was anything to comment on, but she assumed Evanora would find something to nitpick.</p><p>Although Rio attended church every Sunday growing up, by the time she moved out and started attending college, she rarely went. Rio didn’t really ascribe much faith to the idea of a higher being, but she admittedly found comfort in the traditions and practices of Catholicism. It was easy to fall back into mass, kneeling and standing without much thought. It also helped that James didn’t seem particularly devout either, leaning over to whisper to her jokes throughout the priest’s sermon. </p><p>All things considered, mass was the easy part. Dinner with Evanora afterwards was the real challenge.</p><p>It was an expensive restaurant, of course, and while James seemed at ease, Rio shifted uncomfortably. She’d always hated dining at places like these. She was always worried about doing something wrong. </p><p>The wine was barely served when Evanora asked, “So, when can I expect some grandchildren?”</p><p>James rolled his eyes, saying, “Mother.”</p><p>“I’m not getting any younger, James,” Evanora replied.</p><p>“Well, I’m still young, and so is Rio,” James said. He reached out to hold Rio’s hand where it rested on the arm of her chair, but she pulled it into her lap before he could. He glanced at her, but he looked more confused than anything else. Shaking his head slightly, he turned back to Evanora and said, “It’ll happen when it happens.”</p><p>“Well, are you–”</p><p>“Please do not finish that.”</p><p>Evanora’s glare was downright vicious as she said, “It’s rude to interrupt your mother.”</p><p>“And it’s rude to ask about someone’s sex life, Mother,” James retorted. “Now, why don’t we move on to more appropriate topics? For example, I hear you’re planning the next fundraiser for the children’s museum.”</p><p>The conversation began and ended without a single word from Rio, who was expected to carry said children. She wasn’t sure why she was even surprised anymore.</p><p>Rio was silent for all of dinner, letting James and Evanora talk. Every so often, James would glance at her, eyebrows furrowed, but Rio would only smile and shake her head. She wasn’t interested in being included in this conversation, or any conversation with Evanora for that matter. It wasn’t like Evanora wanted to know her thoughts anyways. She treated Rio just as she always intended Rio to be used as, a pretty wife to smile on James’s arm. </p><p>As soon as they got home from dinner, James loosened his tie and grabbed two beers from their fridge. He handed one to Rio and flopped down onto the couch. Rio thought about leaving him alone, but he waved for her to join him. Rio sat on the other end of the couch and tucked her legs up beside her.</p><p>“I love my mother,” James said. It sounded like he was reminding himself of this fact. “But sometimes…” He sighed and gulped down half his beer in one go. “I hope you didn’t take anything she said seriously.”</p><p>“It’s about what I expected,” Rio said.</p><p>James sighed again and held out his hand. After a moment of hesitation, Rio placed her hand in his. James let their hands fall against the couch cushion, loosely clasped. “I was serious about thinking of you as more than my wife, Rio,” James told her earnestly. “I know our marriage was arranged, but I never thought of you as less than anything other than another person when I agreed to it.” He held her hand properly now, fingers curled around hers. “I want you to be happy. I want us to be happy,” James said, emphasizing the word ‘us’. “I don’t want to be some politician family who hates each other.” His eyes gained a faraway look, and his voice softened. “I know what that was like. I don’t want that for myself or for my future children.”</p><p>Rio felt overwhelmed by how vulnerable and honest James was being with her. She licked her lips, trying to figure out what to say. All she could think of was, “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“You have nothing to be sorry for,” James said, and it took everything in Rio not to flinch. “Let’s just promise to try? Let’s try to be happy?” His brown eyes were wide, and for a traitorous moment, Rio imagined blue ones instead. </p><p>Rio thought she could do this. Live a double life, splitting herself into neat halves. One for James. One for Agatha. The person she was supposed to be. The person she wanted to be.</p><p>Seeing James like this, Rio wasn’t sure she could keep it up. </p><p>James wasn’t perfect, but he was kind and he was trying. He didn’t deserve to have his wife cheat on him, least of all with his own sister. Not to mention, what kind of person would it make Rio, to take advantage of his trust and kindness? </p><p>Sitting there on the couch with him, Rio felt like a miserable excuse for a person. This was not the person she wanted to be. Not like this. This was not the person her parents raised. Not for this.</p><p>Maybe Rio didn’t deserve happiness. Not at the cost of who she was.</p><p>When Agatha texted her four days later, asking her to come over, Rio didn’t reply.</p><p> </p>

<p>Ignoring Agatha was one of the hardest things Rio had ever done in her life.</p><p>Second only to, perhaps, being married to Agatha's brother.</p><p>After she ignored the first text, Agatha texted her once more before she stopped. Her last text message taunted Rio every time she opened her phone. It was a simple, pointless text, but it was one that Rio couldn’t get out of her head.</p><p align="center">
<em> Are you okay? </em>
</p><p>Without Agatha to fill her time, the days felt longer and the weeks dragged on. Those two months with Agatha felt like a dream in comparison to the bitter reality she’d forced herself into now. There were no more kisses that made her head spin or touches that made her breathless. There were no more teasing remarks or quiet confessions. </p><p>A part of Rio was locked away now without Agatha to let her out.</p><p>Rio didn’t realize how much being with and without Agatha changed her until Alice told her one afternoon. The two of them were walking in the park, eating ice cream and enjoying some of the milder weather. Rio knew she wasn’t fully present with Alice, but she was trying her best to listen intently to whatever her best friend was telling her. </p><p>Eventually though, Alice looked at her and said, “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said immediately, even as she grimaced at the question. All it did was remind her of Agatha. When she received an unimpressed stare in response though, she sighed and said, “I don’t know.”</p><p>“Is everything okay with James?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Everything is great with James,” Rio answered honestly. </p><p>Over the last two weeks, Rio and James spent more time together in the evenings, getting to know each other. They were now comfortable enough with each other that Rio began to see James more as a friend, rather than the man she was shackled to for the rest of her life. </p><p>“Okay, so if it’s not James, is it the hospital?” Alice asked. When Rio shook her head, Alice sighed, “Then what is it, Rio? You’re being all weird and spacey today, like you’re on another planet. Not to mention, you’ve been kind of a bitch lately too.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything immediately. She wanted to tell Alice everything about her and Agatha, but she wasn’t sure how her best friend would react. Alice might have been willing to drive the getaway car on her wedding day, but that didn’t necessarily mean she’d condone cheating. </p><p>Settling for a half-truth, Rio said, “I was hanging out with Agatha for a while.”</p><p>“The sister-in-law,” Alice said, to which Rio winced.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, “and it was fun, having someone to talk to about all of this.” She saw Alice open her mouth and she hurried to say, “I know I can talk to you, but it’s different with her. She grew up in the same circles as me, and she knows James and Evanora.” Rio sighed and ran a hand through her hair. “But… I just don’t know if it’s such a good idea, being friends with Agatha.”</p><p>“Why not?” Alice said. She finished her ice cream and tossed it into a nearby trash can. She tilted her head thoughtfully and said, “I mean, even I’ve heard about her reputation at this point, but I don’t think that’s any reason not to be friends with her. You’re already married into her family anyways. There’s no distancing yourself from that.” </p><p>Rio hummed in acknowledgement but let the conversation drop. Alice was right. There was no escaping Agatha, but the least Rio could do was try to have an appropriate relationship with her. One that wouldn’t blow up in her face, ruin her marriage, and taint her family’s reputation for the rest of her life. That was what Alice was encouraging anyways, wasn’t she? A friendship.</p><p>The thought almost made her laugh. She couldn’t imagine Agatha so easily agreeing to a measly friendship after two months of… Rio wasn’t even sure what to call it. She still hated the word affair. </p><p>When it was time for them to go, Alice pulled Rio into a tight hug. Then, she cupped her face and looked Rio right in the eye, saying, “Take care of yourself, okay? Whatever the hell is wrong with you, don’t let it take over your life. You’re better than that, Rio.”</p><p><em> You’re better than that. </em>Was she?</p><p>Rio nodded and hugged Alice again, fighting back the urge to cry and confess everything to her best friend. </p><p>When she got back to the apartment, she waved to James and went to check on her plants on the terrace. It was a recent development, but James didn’t mind. He even encouraged her to buy more plants, even if he seemed a little baffled by her enjoyment of them. It was as Rio was watering a few of her plants that James poked his head out and said, “Don’t forget we have family dinner tonight.”</p><p>Rio nearly broke her neck with how quickly she looked up. “Already?”</p><p>“I know, right?” James laughed. “Feels like we just had one.”</p><p>There had been two family dinners since the night Rio fucked Agatha in her childhood bedroom. Unlike that one, the other two were nothing noteworthy. Dinner and drinks, and that was it. Rio and Agatha were perfectly civil around each other. That was how it had to be, if they didn’t want anyone to notice the fact that there was anything else going on. However, this would be the first dinner since Rio started avoiding Agatha. </p><p>Needless to say, Rio wasn’t looking forward to it.</p><p>Still, she got dressed and got into the town car, letting James hold her hand during the drive out to the estate. During the car ride, Rio felt herself grow restless and suddenly remembered going to the estate with her parents all those months ago. The same urge to bolt filled her, just as it had then. In both cases, Rio stayed where she was.</p><p>When they arrived, James let out a quiet noise of surprise and said, “Agatha is here already.” He pointed out her town car. </p><p>After hearing that, Rio stayed in the car for so long that James had to tap the window to break her from her reverie.  Shaking her head, Rio got out of the car and gave James a reassuring smile. She followed him into the house, but she kept herself just out of reach, so he wouldn’t take her hand again. </p><p>Even though Rio knew that Agatha was here already, she still felt herself freeze, if only for the briefest moments, when she saw her. </p><p>For the last few weeks, Rio had done everything she could to keep Agatha out of her mind. Yet, in doing so, it felt all the more devastating to see her in the flesh once more. Rio wasn’t sure if she was imagining things, but Agatha looked even more beautiful tonight. She wore a dark green suit with a black blouse. A gold necklace glinted at her neck, and her hair fell in loose curls around her. Rio had never wanted someone as badly as she did Agatha in that moment.</p><p>Rio would have stood there, staring at her all night, but then James brushed past her, exclaiming, “Is the world ending? That’s the only explanation for you being early for once.”</p><p>“My meeting ended early, and traffic was suspiciously light,” Agatha replied, rolling her eyes. “Trust me when I say I would have hidden in my car until you arrived, but Mother found me and insisted I come inside.”</p><p>“Dragged you in by the ear?” James teased. </p><p>“Nearly.”</p><p>Agatha seemed so normal, except for one thing. She hadn’t looked at Rio once. She smiled and joked with James with an enviable ease, but not once had Rio seen those blue eyes focus on her. She hadn’t realized how often Agatha looked at her until she ignored her so completely. Despite being the one to distance herself first, Rio felt the loss acutely.</p><p>The only time Agatha let herself slip was when James made her drink without asking, handing it to her as he resumed his seat. Her eyes narrowed ever so slightly, staring at the drink in Rio’s hand, before they flicked back to James.</p><p>That was all Rio got. A flash of a glare.</p><p>As James and Agatha spoke, Rio began to feel invisible the same way she did when James and Evanora spoke. It made her ill to feel this way because of Agatha. Mainly, because she never wanted Agatha and Evanora to have any similarities in her mind. Agatha was better than that. And yet, it was impossible to deny the sensation of feeling very small, of feeling very insignificant.  </p><p>It was almost a relief when Evanora came out to inform them dinner was ready, and Rio couldn’t even begin to process how fucked up that was.</p><p>Naturally, that feeling couldn’t last. They were halfway through their entrées when Evanora asked, “So, Rio, have you given any more thought to having children?”</p><p>“Mother,” James said warningly. </p><p>Across from Rio, Agatha went completely still, hands clenched around her silverware. To everyone’s surprise, she looked at Evanora and asked, “Eager to be a grandmother?” </p><p>There was an unspoken <em> again </em> that Rio heard, even if she wasn’t supposed to know. She held her breath as Evanora and Agatha stared at each other in a silent battle of wills. Rio already knew how this would end and had to hide her smile when Evanora looked away first.</p><p>“Yes, I am,” Evanora said primly. “You’ll understand one day.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet, disbelieving laugh, but she said nothing else. The rest of dinner was eaten in a tense silence. </p><p>When it was over, Evanora asked to speak with James in the office, and Agatha disappeared as soon as they left. Rio sat there for as long as she could, but soon enough, the maids were inching out from the kitchen, ready to begin cleaning.</p><p>Rio thought about wandering the house, but all it reminded her of was the tour Agatha had given her. She wandered outside instead, only to find that this was where Agatha had gone. She stood among the flowers, bathed in moonlight, and Rio felt her breath catch. Although she knew it would be better to turn around and go back inside, Rio kept walking. She stopped a few feet away from Agatha, purposefully looking out at the rest of the garden instead of her. From the corner of her eye, Rio could see that Agatha was smoking a cigarette. The smell made Rio itch for one, but she knew better than to ask.</p><p>It was Agatha who broke the silence first, saying, “The least you could have done was end things properly.” She glanced at Rio with half-lidded eyes. “I guess I expected too much to think you wouldn’t take the coward’s way out.”</p><p>The remark hit her just as Agatha intended, and Rio stumbled back as if it physically struck her. “What did you want me to say?” Rio asked. As hurt as she was, she could still feel guilt and rage churning inside her too. “Agatha, I can’t do this anymore? Agatha, this is wrong? Agatha, what the fuck were we thinking?” Rio’s voice rose with every question, vitriol fueling every word. “Are you upset that I didn’t say it, or are you upset that I ended things at all?” Rio asked. When Agatha said nothing, Rio glared at her. Trying for a reaction now, she said, “Did you really think it was going to last? What if someone found out?”</p><p>Again, Agatha said nothing, and Rio wanted to scream for her to at least look at her. To treat her like she actually <em> saw </em>her, to remind Rio that someone knew the real her fucking existed. </p><p>When Agatha spoke, it was quiet and measured. “I never made myself hide,” Agatha said. “All my life, I never let myself be in the closet, not even when my parents tried to shove me in there and lock the door.” Agatha finally looked at her, and Rio felt like she’d been swallowed whole. She couldn’t remember Agatha ever looking at her with such disgust and loathing. “How do you think it felt being your dirty little secret? Do you think I enjoyed that?”</p><p>“It is not just because you’re another woman, Agatha,” Rio hissed. “You were sleeping with your brother’s wife."</p><p>“And you were fucking your husband’s sister.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure when they got so close, but suddenly, she realized that she was standing just inches from Agatha, breathing hard, with her hands clenched in fists at her sides. This close, Rio could see that her blue eyes were a tumultuous storm, and even then, Rio wanted to drown herself in them.</p><p>Agatha looked away first, walking away. “Good-bye, Rio.”</p><p>It sounded too final. Rio spun to stop her, only to find James standing in the doorway. He looked worried, eyebrows furrowed, as he looked between Rio and Agatha. How much had he heard?</p><p>“Everything okay?” James asked, and Rio nearly collapsed in relief. Nothing. He heard nothing. </p><p>“Doing great!” Agatha said brightly.</p><p>James gave his sister a look, but he said nothing. He only shook his head. He looked back at Rio and asked, “Ready to go home?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched for a brief moment. She didn’t look at Rio again.</p><p>James offered a smile and tucked his hands into his pockets. He hadn’t looked away from Rio once.</p><p>Rio sighed. “Yeah, let’s go home.”</p><p>The car ride home was quiet except for a brief exchange where James asked tentatively, “What did Agatha say to you? You seem upset.”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said immediately.</p><p>“I can talk to her–”</p><p>“No,” Rio said sharply. She pinched her nose when she saw James’s hurt expression. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap. It’s just stupid.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” James asked as the car arrived at their apartment. </p><p>“I’m sure,” Rio said firmly. They stood in front of their building, and Rio wrapped her arms around herself. “Go up without me. I’ll be in later.”</p><p>“Where are you going?” James asked.</p><p>“I just need to clear my head,” Rio said, being honest this time. After tonight, she needed to just get away from anyone with the last name Harkness. “I won’t be out too late.”</p><p>James looked like he wanted to protest, but after a moment, he sighed and said, “Just be careful. Call if you need someone to pick you up.” Rio offered him a faint smile and allowed James to press a kiss to her cheek. She watched him go up the steps and waited until he was inside before she called a car.</p><p>It’d been months since she’d been out, but there was always one bar Rio could rely on. </p><p><em> Pancho’s </em> looked exactly as Rio remembered it, like a time capsule from another era with all of its wood and vintage decor. Rio slid onto a bar stool off to the side and ordered a whiskey. She made her way through two more rounds, admittedly wallowing about what a disaster her life had become. It sounded like the beginning of a really bad joke. A lesbian marries a man and has an affair with her sister-in-law. Rio wondered what the punch line would be. </p><p>The bartender came around again, a pretty blonde with a playful smirk. Carol, Rio remembered from past visits. She owned the place with her wife. Waving her empty glass, Rio informed her, “I’m a mess.”</p><p>“Aren’t we all?” Carol replied. She plucked the glass from Rio’s grasp and poured her some more whiskey.</p><p>Rio gave her a wide, drunken grin in thanks and said, “I’m, like, really a mess.”</p><p>“Well, go on then,” Carol said, chuckling. She leaned against the back counter and folded her arms across her chest. “Tell me all about your woes. You don’t come in as often as you used to, so I could use the update anyways.”</p><p>“I’m married,” Rio said, holding up her left hand.</p><p>Carol’s eyes widened. “Oh, shit.”</p><p>“To a man.”</p><p>Carol let out a low whistle and grabbed the bottle of whiskey again. “Something tells me we’re going to need a lot more than this,” Carol sighed.</p><p>Several drinks later, Rio stumbled her way through a retelling of her failure of a marriage, cheating and all. She was vaguely aware of the fact that she shouldn’t be telling a stranger this in a public bar, but Rio was too far gone to care. Besides, no one in a bar like this would know or care about the Harknesses. </p><p>By the time the bar was closing, Carol had Rio’s arm slung around her shoulders as she helped her out to her car. Rio tried to tell her that she could get herself home, but Carol wouldn’t listen. After the fifth try, Rio just sighed and slumped in the passenger seat, mumbling her address to Carol.</p><p>Rio dozed off on the way, only waking up when Carol dragged her out of the car to help her up to her apartment. She felt bad. It was nearly three in the morning, and Carol had a wife waiting for her at home. Rio made a promise to herself to go back and leave a good tip. </p><p>After a few minutes of knocking, James opened the door with his hair sticking up. He squinted at them for a moment before he sighed and murmured, “Oh, Rio. What happened?”</p><p>“She’s fine,” Carol said. “Just drunk. I think she was a little stressed.”</p><p>A wild understatement, and Rio tried to say so. Before she could though, Carol passed her off to James. The two of them were talking about her, Rio was pretty sure. James was thanking Carol for bringing her home safely, and Rio wanted to roll her eyes. She wasn’t a child.</p><p>Once Carol was gone, Rio leaned against James and said, “I need to tell you something.”</p><p>Rio ignored the tiny part in the back of her mind that was screaming. She was just so tired. She didn’t want to do this anymore. She wanted James to know. She told Carol, and the world hadn’t ended. That meant she could tell James too, right?</p><p>“Tomorrow, Rio,” James said as he guided her to her bedroom. “You are in no state to be telling me anything.”</p><p>“It’s important, James,” Rio tried.</p><p>“I’m sure it is, but it can wait until tomorrow.”</p><p>“But what if–” Rio stopped herself, a brief moment of clarity jolting through her. It came to her as she saw a framed photo of James and Agatha together. It was the two of them at James’s college graduation. They looked young. They looked happy. </p><p>Rio bit her lip. She was tired. She was so fucking tired, but she was also scared. She was terrified. What the hell was she doing? There was no guarantee James’s kindness would continue after finding out what she’d done and who she really was.</p><p>James frowned. “Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s voice was small as she asked, “What if I’m too afraid to tell you tomorrow?” </p><p>James’s smile was gentle as he ran a hand over Rio’s hair. The touch felt weird. She didn’t dislike it. At least, she didn’t think she did. It just felt unnatural. It was different from how Agatha would touch her hair. It felt wrong.</p><p>“That’s okay,” James told her. “You can tell me another day.”</p><p>Even through her drunken haze, Rio didn’t think she would. As it processed further for her that she wasn’t in the safe anonymity of <em> Pancho’s </em> anymore <em> , </em> that if she told she’d be ruining Agatha’s relationship with James, Rio knew she couldn’t tell the truth. </p><p>The confession that had been on the tip of her tongue was swallowed once more, sinking deep inside Rio.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Rio woke up, it was to a pounding headache that was bad enough to rival the hangover she had on her wedding day. She tried to sit up, only for the whole room to spin and nausea to wash over her. Rio practically fell out of bed trying to get the bathroom, and as it was, she barely made it to the toilet.</p><p>After throwing up, Rio slumped against the wall and cursed herself for drinking so much. She was getting too old for this shit. </p><p>Rio dozed off again, and when she woke up again, she forced herself to stand up and shower. The hot water helped, making her a little more alert and washing off the grime from the previous night. The headache stayed though, as did the exhaustion. </p><p>Since it was Saturday, Rio didn’t have anything planned, so she changed into sweatpants and an oversized t-shirt before she padded out to the kitchen. To her surprise, James was there, dressed similarly to her, reading something on his phone. When he noticed her, he set down his phone and asked, “How are you feeling?”</p><p> “Like shit.”</p><p>James laughed and stood up. “Here, sit. I’ll get you some coffee.”</p><p>Rio didn’t argue and sank into one of the chairs. She rested her head on her folded arms on the table, eyes lazily following James around the kitchen as he poured coffee into a mug. He placed it in front of her and resumed his seat. “Thanks,” Rio mumbled. She sat up just enough to drink the coffee. </p><p>The two of them sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes while Rio sipped at her coffee. When she was done, James asked, “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>Rio peered down at her mug and gave a small shake of her head. “I’m sorry you had to see that,” she said.</p><p>“You’re allowed to drink,” James told her. “I guess I’m just more worried that I’m the thing that drove you to drink that much.”</p><p>“No, it’s not you,” Rio said. Not entirely at least. She bit her lip, trying to decide how to phrase this. “I guess I’m just not adjusting to all the changes in my life as well as I thought I was.”</p><p>James nodded thoughtfully then asked, “When’s the last time you talked to your parents? You’re close, right?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, but she hesitated. When was the last time they spoke? The sudden realization made her queasy all over again. It used to be that Rio couldn’t go a day without getting a text or call from her parents.</p><p>“Give them a call,” James said. He stood up and stopped by her chair. He placed a hand on her shoulder, squeezing gently. “While you do that, I’m going to go out and buy some food, so we can just relax on the couch today. How’s that sound?”</p><p>“Don’t you have things to do?” Rio asked. He always had things to do.</p><p>“I rearranged things,” James shrugged, as if it wasn’t a big deal. Rio knew better though. She knew from her father exactly how difficult it could be to move meetings around last minute. “This is more important. I should be a better husband to you, and that includes helping you get over the worst hangover I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, “You just want an excuse to lay around all day,” It was sweet of him, and Rio couldn’t help but imagine how lucky another woman would be to have a doting husband like him.</p><p>“Well, that’s definitely a bonus,” James winked. He patted her shoulder and pulled away. “Call your parents. I’ll be back in about two hours.”</p><p>Rio didn’t appreciate the way James advised her like he knew better than her, but she had to admit that it also wasn’t a bad idea. With the whirlwind of the new marriage and everything with Agatha, Rio had lost track of how long it’d been. Then again, her parents hadn’t reached out either, and that stung in a way that felt like a knife between her ribs.</p><p>Migrating to the couch, Rio found her phone and called her mother.</p><p>The phone rang a few times before Paola picked up and said, <em>“Hello? Rio? How are you doing?”</em> Rio must have said something because then Paola started going on and on in a way she used to find so annoying but now found comforting. At some point, Paola slipped into Spanish as she spoke, and Rio let the language wash over her, shutting her eyes. </p><p>It didn’t matter that Paola was telling her gossip about distant aunt. For Rio, hearing her mother’s voice in a language that hadn’t been spoken to her in weeks was the balm Rio needed right now. She let Paola go on and on, almost lulling herself to sleep, until Paola said,<em> “But really, Rio. How are you? How are things going with James and Evanora?”</em></p><p>And Agatha, Rio wanted to add. She bit her lip instead. “It’s okay,” Rio said. “I miss you.”</p><p>There was a pause, and Rio wondered if she hung up when Paola sniffled. <em>“I miss you too,”</em> Paola whispered.<em> “You can come home and visit any time, you know that, don’t you? I know you’re married now, but you’re still our little girl.”</em></p><p>Rio wanted to ask why she hadn’t told her any of this sooner, but she also wasn’t sure if she would have gone. The last few weeks had lessened some of the resentment that blistered beneath the surface. Rio could focus less on the fact that her parents married her off and more on the fact that she missed them despite that. </p><p>“Soon,” Rio said, feeling her throat close up as she fought back tears of her own. “I’ll come soon.” She heard the apartment door open and hastily wiped at her eyes. “I have to go, but I’ll call again soon, okay?” <em>Or, maybe, you can call me?</em></p><p><em>“I love you,”</em> Paola said. </p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath. “I love you too.” She hung up the phone just as James walked into the living room, arms laden with take-out and junk food. Rio knew she probably looked like even more of a wreck after that phone call, but James merely asked, “What do you want to watch?”</p><p>For the rest of the day, the two of them sat on the couch, watching nature documentaries and snacking on all of the food James got for them. Sometimes, they talked, commenting on things that were happening, but they also just sat in silence for a lot of it. Every so often, James would excuse himself to take a call, but he’d always come back with a smile and a joke.</p><p>A few hours later, on screen, a line of ducklings followed their mother. James pointed and said, “Did you know Agatha used to follow me around like that when we were younger?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t imagine Agatha following James around the way younger siblings usually did, all wide-eyed and admiring and trying to be just like them. The skepticism must’ve been abundantly clear on her face because James laughed and said, “I mean, she used to follow me and try to do everything I did. Just to prove she could.”</p><p>That sounded more like her. Rio smiled and asked, “Like what?”</p><p>“All sorts of things,” James said. He laughed softly and said, “Once, I climbed a tree, and I told her she couldn’t. She was too small.”</p><p>“And let me guess,” Rio said knowingly. “She climbed the tree.”</p><p>“To this day, I have no idea how she managed it,” James said, shaking his head. “She was always stubborn. Braver than I ever was too.” His smile turned shy, and his cheeks turned pink. Rio wondered what could make him so embarrassed when James admitted, “Agatha actually used to defend me a lot when we were kids.”</p><p>“She did?” Rio said. She couldn’t help but smile, charmed by the image. She imagined the primly dressed girl she saw in their family portrait with Agatha’s fire, yelling at others. “Did kids pick on you?”</p><p>“I’ve always been a pretty easy-going guy,” James explained. “And when I was a kid, well, I’d have picked on me too. Well-dressed, from a well-to-do family, but incapable of standing up for himself. I’d just let the taunts come and go. Agatha though?” James’s grin was fond as he chuckled. “It didn’t matter that she was younger and smaller than everyone else. She’d yell at them all the same. She’d bite too.”</p><p>Rio let out a startled laugh at that, but she could see it so easily. If they had known each other as children, would Agatha have defended her like that too? Would they have gotten along? It was hard to imagine a child as headstrong and exuberant as Agatha would have liked a child as quiet and reserved as Rio. </p><p>“I’m sure everyone was relieved when she grew out of the biting and stuck to fighting with words,” Rio said, thinking about Agatha’s career as a lawyer.</p><p>James’s easy smile flickered though, and he said, “No, uh, she used to fight every so often in middle and high school, physically at least, but fighting with words sometimes landed her in more trouble than the fist fights.”</p><p>“The two of you must have been at the same school often,” Rio remarked, watching him carefully. “Even when…” She stopped herself. She wasn’t supposed to know about Nicky. She licked her lips and continued, “Even when she gained a reputation as a teenager.”</p><p>“I love my sister,” James said, and Rio was reminded of the way James had said this about his mother. Like a reminder. “And I did my best to stop people when I heard them talking shit about her at school, but…” James let out a heavy sigh, and for the first time, Rio saw the kind of exhaustion she saw reflected on her own face when she looked in a mirror.</p><p>“I used to really resent Agatha,” James told her quietly. “By the time we were both in high school, every time she fucked up, it felt like it was up to me to fix it. Or, I guess not fix it, but to do something to distract everyone from it.” James’s jaw clenched, and Rio could see it in his eyes that he was lost in another time. “Agatha would get caught fucking someone’s daughter in the school restroom, so I had to get the highest test score in Calculus. Agatha would get caught getting high at the park, so I had to win class president.” James sank fully into the couch and ran a hand over his face. His voice was small and vulnerable as he said, “I just felt like I had to be perfect all the time to make up for the fact that she wasn’t.”</p><p>It was so easy for Rio to compare James to Agatha, and every other time, Rio always favored Agatha, but in this moment, Rio couldn’t help but wholeheartedly sympathize with James.</p><p>Although Rio had no siblings of her own, she understood the need to be as good as possible, to fight for your family’s reputation. Just like that, it became clear to Rio the kind of man James was. He was a good guy, yes, but he also really wanted to be the perfect guy. He was kind and patient and caring, and while Rio had no doubt that was his personality, she could also tell that he pushed himself to fully inhabit those traits because that was what would help him and his family. That was the kind of man, the kind of husband he was supposed to be. </p><p>He was so different from Agatha. </p><p>Agatha reminded Rio of a finely honed knife, beautiful but dangerous with sharp edges. One wrong move and you’d cut yourself. Meanwhile, James was smooth metal, polished and shiny and something to admire. No serious harm to others but constantly in need of buffing. A constant maintenance required to appear unobtrusive and likeable. </p><p>James wanted a perfect life after years of struggling to maintain the facade of one. He expected everything to fall into place if he just did as he was supposed to do. </p><p>He wasn’t perfect though and neither was Rio. Things would be so much easier if all Rio wanted was to be perfect. If only she cared about that, then maybe she’d be able to ignore all of her other desires.</p><p>Rio felt a headache coming on. Even as she sympathized with James on the pressure to be perfect, she also couldn’t help but respect Agatha for her choice to be unabashedly who she was. </p><p>Unaware of how long she’d been silent, Rio startled when James forced a laugh and said, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to dump all of that on you.”</p><p>“No, it’s fine,” Rio hurried to say. She reached out and squeezed his hand. “I’m glad you felt like you could tell me that.” She offered a hesitant smile. “And I get it. Having to do well in, well, everything. My parents were always telling me I had to be the best.”</p><p>“Yeah,” James sighed. “Nothing less.” His smile was tired but genuine as he said, “Thanks, Rio.” </p><p>Maybe Rio would never love James the way she was supposed to, but maybe she would love him in another way. The way you do a comrade in arms, someone you love because no one else will understand what you’re going through except them. After all, who better to understand this marriage than the one she was married to?</p><p>The two of them fell into another comfortable silence when their doorbell rang. They shared a look. However, they both looked just as surprised as the other.</p><p>“Expecting someone?” James asked, standing up.</p><p>“No,” Rio said. She got up to follow. “Are you?”</p><p>When they opened the door, the last person Rio expected stood on the other side. Agatha wore a false smile that only partially distracted from the fact that her eyes were watery and red. She looked like she just came from work in a rumpled suit. </p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said lightly. “Mind if I come in?”</p><p>Rio and James shared a look, but they both stepped back to let her in. Agatha brushed past them as soon as the path was cleared. James walked after his sister, asking why she was here, and Rio just stood there for a moment, trying to remember to breathe.</p>

<p>As she made a pot of tea, Rio was relieved to find that she wasn’t the only one confused by Agatha’s sudden appearance. She could hear the soft murmur and James and Agatha speaking in the living room, but she doubted it was about why Agatha was here. Rio sighed and stared down at the kettle. </p><p>Her last conversation with Agatha echoed in her mind, and Rio gripped the edge of the counter. She’d never forget the disgust Agatha had directed at her. Not that it had been unwarranted, but that made it all the more shameful. A dirty little secret, she’d said. Was that really how she’d felt? Was that how Rio had felt? </p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair, thinking. There were layers of shame and guilt and fear when it came to being with Agatha, but at the same time, there was also a sense of pride and joy that Agatha had chosen her of all people. There was something heady and intoxicating about that. There was something that kept Rio coming back against all common sense. But then, the shame and guilt and fear had won in the end. Rio had let them win.</p><p>Would Agatha even bother to look at her now?</p><p>When the tea was ready, Rio had no other reason to keep hiding. She sighed and loaded up the tray, carrying it out to the living room. The conversation abruptly ended when she entered the room, and Rio tried not to read too much into it. </p><p>It was only once the tea was served and Rio was sitting that James asked, “So, Agatha, what brings you here tonight?”</p><p>“What, I can’t visit my darling brother and sister-in-law?” Agatha replied with a dazzling smile that might have distracted Rio, if not for the fact that her hand shook ever so slightly as she lifted her mug to drink from. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said softly. She didn’t expect Agatha to look at her, but when she did, Rio’s breath caught. There wasn’t the harshness there from last time. If Rio didn’t know any better, she would have said there was fear. Rio swallowed. “Agatha, what’s going on?”</p><p>Agatha held out for thirty more seconds before her shoulders slumped. “It’s Nicky,” she said. At the mention of her son, James looked sharply at Rio, but Agatha waved a hand and said, “She knows, James.”</p><p>“She knows?” James repeated, looking between them.</p><p>“Rio saw us at the hospital together,” Agatha explained. “I figured I could trust your wife with my secret.”</p><p>James nodded, accepting this easily. Meanwhile, Rio couldn’t help but recall the day Agatha told her this. It certainly hadn’t been because of her marriage to James. She said nothing though. If anything, she was surprised James knew. She would have thought Agatha would keep this from him, considering that he seemed closer to Evanora, more craven to her whims. Evanora clearly knew nothing though, so maybe Rio should give him more credit. </p><p>“What’s wrong with Nicky?” James asked. “Is he okay?” </p><p>“He’s fine,” Agatha assured him, “but his adopted mother is moving back to Italy in a few months.” She paused, letting that sink in for them. “He’s only sixteen, so he should go with her, but he wants to stay.” She opened her mouth and closed it, pressing her lips together. She took a deep breath. “I want him to stay,” Agatha said quietly. </p><p>“Then he’ll stay,” James said, like it was just that easy. Immediately, Rio caught a glimpse of James and Agatha as children, just as James described them. James, desperate, eager, obligated, to be Agatha’s protector and savior. “We’ll figure something out.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, but there was something saddened about the expression. “I’m glad you said that,” Agatha said. “I need your help.” She fiddled with her mug for a moment before she said, “I want guardianship of Nicky, so he can stay here. His adopted mother is okay with it, but you know that our mother is going to try and stop this as soon as she finds out that I’m doing this. I need your connections so that this goes through quickly and quietly.”</p><p>“Done,” James said immediately, and even Agatha looked surprised by his easy agreement. He sighed and reached out, placing a hand on Agatha’s wrist. “I never liked that they did that,” James told her. “You didn’t deserve that, and neither did Nicholas. I’ll do whatever I can to make sure you don’t get separated again.”</p><p>Agatha looked away. She looked like she was holding back tears, but her voice was steady as she whispered, “Thank you, James.”</p><p>“Let me make some calls right now,” Jame said, standing up. “Better to get this started now rather than later.” He held out a hand with a raised brow. “I assume you brought all of the necessary paperwork?” Agatha bit the inside of her cheek, but she reached into her bag and procured a manila folder for him. “Presumptuous,” James teased.</p><p>“Prepared,” Agatha corrected. She gave James a playful smile and said, “I knew you couldn’t say no to me.”</p><p>“No,” James said, a heaviness crossing his face for the briefest moment. “I can’t.” He took the folder and excused himself to the office, explaining this would take a while. </p><p>After he left, Rio and Agatha sat in silence, not even looking at each other. It only took five minutes before Agatha stood up and began to pace. Rio watched her go, back and forth, back and forth, for while until she finally called out, “Agatha.”</p><p>Her voice made Agatha stop immediately. Her back was to her, but Rio could see the tension that ran through her entire body. Rio slowly stood up and walked up behind her. Before she could talk herself out of her, Rio ran her fingers through the ends of Agatha’s hair. Agatha relaxed minutely, but what was even more telling was the quiet sigh that left her lips.</p><p>“It’s going to be okay,” Rio told her. </p><p>Agatha turned slowly, half-angled towards Rio with an unreadable expression on her face. “You don’t know that,” she said.</p><p>“I don’t,” Rio agreed, “but I can hope.” She let another silence fall between them for a minute before she tentatively said, “I’m also sorry.” Just like that, the tension snapped back into Agatha’s frame. Rio hurried to add, lowering her voice, “I was wrong to just stop texting you. I should have at least sent you a message or done it face-to-face.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said after a moment. “For apologizing.”</p><p>“The least I could do,” Rio shrugged.</p><p>Agatha faced her fully now. She lifted a hand to Rio’s face, and when Rio didn’t stop her, she cupped her cheek. Rio let out a shaky breath and leaned into the touch. Agatha’s palm was warm against her cheek, and Rio found herself craving more of Agatha’s hands on her body. She held still though, scared to move and make Agatha pull away.</p><p>“Do you miss me?” Agatha asked. Although her voice was low, almost emotionless, there was a hunger to her gaze that made Rio feel as though she’d been stripped bare. </p><p>“Don’t make me say it,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha’s other hand came up to cradle Rio’s face, and Rio gasped as Agatha brought their faces closer together. “Say it,” Agatha whispered. “You owe me this.”</p><p>Rio’s heartbeat felt thunderous in her chest as Agatha stared at her, almost as if she might be able to force the words from her lips with her eyes. It wasn’t necessary though. The words spilled from her lips so easily. </p><p>“I missed you.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s eyes flicked down to her lips. When Agatha leaned in then hesitated, Rio didn’t stop her. It was only when Agatha leaned in that a second time that Rio regained enough sense to stop her, throwing her hands up between them. It would be so easy to let Agatha kiss her right now, but she couldn’t. Not here. Not like this. Not with James just in the other room.</p><p>“Your brother doesn’t deserve this,” Rio said, but she didn’t push Agatha away. Instead, her hands curled around the smooth fabric of her blouse. “It’s cruel.”</p><p>“And what do I deserve?” Agatha replied. She was so close now that Rio could feel the warmth of her breath against her lips and see the traces of green in her eyes. </p><p>“Better than this.” <em>Better than me.</em></p><p>“Rio–”</p><p>“You aren’t my dirty little secret,” Rio told her. She forced herself to take a step back, and when Agatha’s hands fell away from her, she felt cold all over. “I don’t want you to be one.”</p><p>“What am I then?” Agatha asked. She looked just as thrown off by this as Rio felt. Her chest rose and fell faster than normal, and Rio wanted so badly to press her hand over her heart and feel its rapid beat. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said. “I don’t know what we can be without…” Rio bit her lip. She tried again, “It’s not about the–” Her cheeks flushed, and Rio’s gaze dropped. “I miss <em>you</em>, Agatha,” Rio said, hoping her emphasis will help her understand what she meant. “I miss talking to you.”</p><p>When Rio looked up again, Agatha’s expression was unreadable once more. “If you want something, say it, Rio.”</p><p><em>You.</em> Rio sighed and said, “Is it stupid if I say I want to be friends?”</p><p>“Extremely,” Agatha said without missing a beat. She stared at Rio for a moment before she continued, “But lucky for you, I enjoy a bit of stupidity in my life. Keeps me entertained.”</p><p>Despite herself, Rio laughed. Deadpan, she said, “I’m glad I can amuse you.” Her smile faded a little as she looked at Agatha more closely. “Do you mean it though? We can be friends?”</p><p>“Well, we’re already family,” Agatha said with a shrug. Her eyes hadn’t met Rio’s again though. “We might as well be friends too.” Finally, she looked at Rio. She wore a half-smile as she did. “There are worse friends to have than you, I suppose.”</p><p>“Are you this nice to all of your friends, or am I getting special treatment?” Rio drawled sarcastically.</p><p>Agatha’s smile grew into a full grin. “Oh, don’t worry. All of my friends find me insufferable.”</p><p>“It’s true.”</p><p>At James’s voice, Rio stiffened, and Agatha’s smile grew strained. James joined them again in the living room, glancing between them curiously. “It’s nice to see the two of you getting along,” James said. Rio bit her lip while Agatha rolled her eyes. James handed Agatha the folder back and said, “I have some friends who’ve started the process already. They’ll get back to you by tomorrow with a date.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said. She reached out and squeezed James’s arm. “I mean it.”</p><p>“Anything for my favorite sister,” James teased. </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and grabbed her bag. “Good night, James.” She shouldered her bag and glanced at Rio. “Good night, Rio.”</p><p>Rio stayed where she was while James walked Agatha to the door. When he came back, he wrapped a loose arm around her shoulders. “Everything good between the two of you now?” James asked, eyes still fixed on the door. </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio nodded. She wondered how much James knew. He had to suspect something, but was it that he suspected? “We have different views on things,” she said, a vast understatement to their situation. “I think we’ve come to an agreement though.”</p><p>“Good,” James said. “Family has to stick together.”</p><p>Rio almost laughed. She was well aware of the fact. </p><p>After that night, Rio found herself staring at her phone, waiting for a text message from Agatha. They agreed to be friends, but Rio wasn’t sure what that actually looked like. Not with Agatha, at least. With Alice, they texted and called every so often, meeting up whenever they had time. Rio couldn’t imagine doing the same with Agatha, texting her random thoughts or moments in her life. </p><p>A week passed with nothing from Agatha, and Rio tried not to sulk. She knew she could text her first, but if she was being honest, she was afraid to. She wasn’t even sure what to say. Still, as the days went by, Rio resolved to text her if she didn’t hear from her by the end of the week.</p><p>It was Friday afternoon, and Rio was volunteering at the hospital when she saw Nicky. She’d seen him here and there, but they hadn’t done much more than wave the last few weeks. Today though, Nicky joined her on the gurney she was perched on, helping organize some papers for the nurses. </p><p>“How’ve you been?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky shrugged. “School’s been tough lately, but it’s fine.”</p><p>Rio hummed and flipped through a few more files. “And everything else?”</p><p>Nicky didn’t answer immediately, eyeing Rio from the corner of his eyes. He fidgeted with his hands, but Rio let him stew in his silence. A few minutes passed before Nicky said, “I’m nervous.”</p><p>“You have a lot to be nervous about,” Rio said. She paused and looked at him, tilting her head. “Is there anything you’re really nervous about?”</p><p>“I’m not really worried about the guardianship,” Nicky admitted. “Agatha knows a lot of people.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched into a smile. “She does.”</p><p>Nicky gave a faint smile, but his hands hadn’t stopped fiddling with the volunteer badge he held. He fell silent once more, and Rio waited once more. He ducked his head, covering his face with his long strands. Nicky asked, “Is it bad that I’m nervous about living with her?”</p><p>“No,” Rio answered honestly. “You grew up without her for a long time, and even if you’ve known each other for years now, living with someone is a lot different than just spending time with them.” Rio nudged Nicky with her elbow and offered him a smile. “For what it’s worth though, I think the two of you will be just fine.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Nicky said. “Will I see you more once I move in with Agatha?”</p><p>Rio wasn’t expecting that. She blinked a few times before she said, “Um, I guess so? Why?”</p><p>“Agatha talks a lot about you, so I figured you must be over a lot,” Nicky explained innocently. </p><p>“Agatha talks about me?” Rio asked dumbly. What did she say? It had to have been favorable for Nicky to expect her to be over often. What was there to say though? Did she still talk about her when Rio ignored her?</p><p>Nicky gave her a strange look and said, “Yeah. Why are you acting like that’s weird? Don’t you talk about your friends?”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio said, blushing. “I was–” She fumbled for an excuse for her surprise. Thankfully, before she had to come up with something, she spotted Agatha walking down the hall. “Agatha!” Rio called out, relieved. The other woman spotted them and gave a small wave.</p><p>“There you are,” Agatha said as she walked up to them. She ran a hand over Nicky’s head, brushing his hair out of his face. “I was looking all over for you.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Nicky said. “I was just talking to Rio.”</p><p>“I see that,” Agatha said. She glanced at Rio and offered her a quick smile. “Ready to go? Lilia’s expecting both of us for dinner.”</p><p>Nicky looked at Rio then he looked at Agatha. “Can Rio come?”</p><p>It was hard to tell who was more startled, Agatha or Rio. While Rio just gaped at the boy, Agatha said, “Nicky, I don’t think Lilia would like it if you just invited a stranger to your home.”</p><p>“Rio isn’t a stranger,” Nicky replied. “She’s your sister-in-law. It’s not like she’s some serial killer I found on the sheet.” He looked at Rio with a cheeky smile. “Are you a serial killer, Rio?”</p><p>Rio chuckled while Agatha gently cuffed him upside the head. “It’s also rude to invite another person without asking,” Agatha added.</p><p>“Lilia always cooks enough to feed an army,” Nicky continued to argue. “A big one too. What’s one more person?” </p><p>Agatha shook her head, but she obligingly looked at Rio and wore a smile full of fond exasperation. “Well, it looks like there’s no changing his mind,” Agatha said. “Would you like to join us for dinner, Rio?” She hesitated before her smile softened. “It would be nice to catch up.”</p><p>When Agatha smiled at her like that, Rio knew she had no choice. “I’d love to,” Rio said. She hopped off the gurney and handed the papers off to the nurse. She thanked the nurse when she handed Rio’s purse to her from where she stored it in one of their cabinets. “Shall we?” Rio asked, turning back to the others.</p><p>The three of them walked out with Nicky in the middle, and as Rio listened to Nicky tell Agatha about his day, she couldn’t help but think that maybe she could get used to this. </p><p>Just maybe, this friendship would work out after all. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Over the course of the next month, Rio experienced what marriage might’ve been like in another life. Not to James, but to Agatha. </p><p>That first dinner with Agatha, Nicky, and Lilia had felt like something out of a dream.</p><p>Rio was ushered into an apartment overflowing with trinkets and plants, and despite it being so vastly different from anything Rio had ever known, it felt like home. At the sound of the front door closing, Lilia came out of the kitchen. She stopped short when she noticed Rio, and Agatha was quick to introduce her.</p><p>Rio braced herself for annoyance at the unexpected guest, but Lilia merely hugged and said, “It’s lovely to meet you, Rio. These two talk about you all the time. Like mother, like son.”</p><p>Both Agatha and Nicky protested at this, wearing matching blushes. </p><p>It should have felt strange, sitting at a table barely large enough to fit the four of them, but it felt cozy and easy. They ate homemade pasta and shared stories, mainly about Nicky growing up. Every so often, Rio or Agatha would share their own stories, and Rio had to hide a smile when Agatha so clearly redacted portions from her rebellious youth.</p><p>“You should come more often,” Lilia told her at the end of the night, shoving a container of leftovers into her hands. “You make them happy.”</p><p>Rio had stuttered a reply before she went out to her car. Agatha was waiting for her, leaning against her own car and doing something on her phone. When she noticed her, she pocketed it and stood up straight. “So, did they scare you off?” Agatha asked, mostly playful but Rio could hear the hint of trepidation in her voice as well.</p><p>“They’re great,” Rio said honestly. She looked over her shoulder and smiled softly. “They’re really great. They’re good people. They’re…” She sighed and shook her head. “They remind me of what it was like when I was younger. Before my father got into politics.” Agatha stepped closer and laid a hand on her arm, but Rio just kept talking, “I’m glad though. I’m happy for him, for both of you, that he got to grow up with someone like that.”</p><p>When Rio looked up, Agatha stared at her like she wanted to say something. The two of them stared at each other for a long moment before Agatha squeezed her arm and simply said, “I’m glad too.”</p><p>After that, Rio was invited to dinner two more times. For the first one, she lied to James and said she was going to meet Alice, but for the second one, she admitted she was going to see Agatha and Nicky. </p><p>James looked hurt for a moment, but then he forced a smile and said, “I’m glad she feels like she can bring you around him.”</p><p>“Do you get to see him at all?” Rio asked hesitantly. </p><p>“No,” was all James said. Rio left it at that. </p><p>At these dinners, Rio let herself forget a little. She forgot that she was in a loveless marriage with one Harkness and halfway in love with the other. She was simply Rio, enjoying the company of an all-too-perceptive older woman, a sweet and curious boy, and Agatha, a woman who was becoming all the more interesting the longer Rio spent time around her. </p><p>Rio had seen all kinds of sides of Agatha since meeting her, but she was completely different in the safety of Lilia’s apartment with Nicky. It was like all of her walls came down, leaving a doting, earnest mother. Agatha smiled easily and frequently at these dinners, laughing freely and teasing lovingly. It was all the more devastating when Agatha extended such affection from Nicky to Rio.</p><p>It wasn’t just Agatha, who already made things hard enough. It was Nicky and Lilia too, who made Rio’s head spin with possibilities just out of reach.</p><p>The dinners went like this: Agatha would tease her about being such a goody two-shoes, but Nicky would defend her, saying that both Agatha and Lilia told him he should follow the rules. It would inevitably lead to playful bickering between the two of them, and then either Rio or Lilia would cut in with a harmless anecdote about the kind of mischief Agatha got up to when she was younger. Agatha would complain they were working against her, but she always wore that delighted smile as she said this.</p><p>It was a family dinner, when it came down to it, and it was hard for Rio to remember that this wasn’t her family. Not really. </p><p>The line was blurring for her, and it only worsened when she received a text from Agatha.</p><p>
<em>Agatha Harkness: Nicky and I are going to breakfast and the aquarium tomorrow. He’d like to know if you want to join us.</em>
</p><p>Rio stared at the text for a long time, unsure of what to do. Although she’d agreed to be friends with Agatha, finding some kind of solace in not losing her completely, she was beginning to feel a bit out of her depth. With every meeting, her feelings for Agatha grew, becoming something much more than the hopeless crush and need to escape that it’d been before.</p><p>There wasn’t any harm though if Rio didn’t act on it, right? James had hopes that Rio would fall in love with him one day, but he was under no delusions that she loved him now. The only person it would hurt if she continued this was Rio, who would be constantly reminded of what she could never have.</p><p>
<em>Rio Vidal: Sounds fun. When and where?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha Harkness: We’ll pick you up at ten. </em>
</p><p>Rio let out a sigh of relief when she read the time. James would be out of the apartment by then. It wasn’t that Rio wanted to hide her friendship with Agatha, but all she could remember was how James had looked when he realized that Agatha wanted Rio around Nicky but not him. It was something she should ask him about, but Rio was afraid of what he might say. </p><p>In the end, Rio told James nothing. He didn’t expect her to tell her every detail of her day, letting her have her own life, just as he had his own life with work. </p><p>As she got ready for the day, Rio put on jeans and a sweater to fend off the chill that was beginning to settle in. She twisted her hair up and put it in a clip, grabbing her purse just in time to see Agatha’s text to let her know she arrived. </p><p>Rio half-expected to sit in the back, but the passenger seat was free. She slid into it with ease and turned halfway to tell Nicky, “Good morning.”</p><p>“Morning,” Nicky replied with a yawn. It was already late morning, but Rio supposed that for a teenager, ten in the morning was about the same as six in the morning. He offered a sleepy smile and said, “Ready to see some fish?”</p><p>“Can’t wait,” Rio said.</p><p>On the way to breakfast, Rio and Agatha talked about their respective weeks with Nicky piping in every so often. It felt so right, the three of them together, that Rio felt her heart give a traitorous skip when Agatha smiled at her. </p><p>Rio expected breakfast to be at some posh restaurant, but to her surprise, they pulled up to a modest looking cafe that clearly wasn’t a chain. As she followed the other two inside, it occurred to her that it was probably more comfortable for Nicky to go to places like this, not to mention safer where it was less likely for someone to recognize Agatha.</p><p>As they sat down at the table, Rio and Agatha on one side and Nicky on the other, Nicky folded his hands in front of him and looked right at Rio. Solemnly, as if it were a matter of life or death, Nicky asked her, “Pancakes or waffles?”</p><p>A startled laugh escaped Rio’s lips. She hadn’t expected that. She glanced at Agatha and said, “Is he serious?”</p><p>Agatha smirked and shrugged, “It’s a very important question, Rio.”</p><p>“It’s a dumb question,” Rio said, and for a moment, Nicky looked hurt and Agatha murderous. However, Rio continued, saying, “But only because the answer is obviously waffles.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders relaxed while Nicky laughed, saying, “I knew you’d be on my side! Agatha prefers pancakes.”</p><p>“You do?” Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“They’re better,” Agatha insisted, and to Rio’s utter amusement, she was earnest in her defense. “They’re fluffier and easier to eat too.”</p><p>“Waffles have that nice crisp to them though,” Rio argued. “They can still be fluffy too. Plus, they have the perfect wells to hold your syrup.”</p><p>“Agatha doesn’t eat her pancakes with syrup,” Nicky informed her.</p><p>Rio turned her body to Agatha fully now, staring at her in shock. “What the hell do you eat them with then?” </p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said with a petulant sniff. “I’m not a heathen.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled into a grin as she shook her head. She leaned across the table and whispered conspiratorially, just loud enough for Agatha to hear, “Don’t worry, Nicky. We’ll convert her to our side eventually.” Although she expected it, Rio still winced when Agatha elbowed her side. She rubbed the spot, glancing at Agatha who sipped her water innocently. </p><p>“If it makes you feel any better, my preference may be a remnant from my childhood,” Rio offered. Nicky tilted his head curiously while Agatha paused. She glanced at Rio and slowly lowered her glass. Rio smiled and explained, “I ate a lot of frozen waffles growing up. It was quick and easy. Something to eat while I walked to school.”</p><p>“Maybe that’s it,” Nicky said thoughtfully. “I ate a lot of frozen waffles too. It was the weekends that Lilia would have time to cook a real breakfast.”</p><p>“Yeah, my mom too,” Rio smiled. </p><p>While Rio and Nicky discussed the other kinds of foods they had growing up, Agatha watched them silently. She didn’t try to offer her own childhood memories, but Rio didn’t push and neither did Nicky. They both just let her listen to them, sharing stories about bread and beans and pasta and rice. </p><p>When their food was finally served, their waitress gave them a sunny smile and asked, “Family day?”</p><p>While Rio flinched and Agatha stiffened, it was Nicky who smiled back and said, “Yeah. We’re going to the aquarium after this.”</p><p>“That sounds like a lot of fun,” the waitress said. She winked at Nicky and said, “You’re lucky that you don’t mind third-wheeling your sister and her girlfriend. I hate going to things with my brother and his wife.” Nicky’s eyes grew wide at this while Agatha choked on her coffee. The waitress startled and handed her a handful of napkins from her apron. “You okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha muttered, dabbing at her mouth.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio cut in before anything else could happen. Her face felt warm at the assumption between her and Agatha, and she hoped it wasn’t obvious. “We’ll let you know if we need anything else.”</p><p>The waitress looked a little confused, but she nodded and left them alone. </p><p>“People think Agatha’s my sister all the time,” Nicky told Rio.</p><p>“I’m not surprised,” Rio replied, and after that, she changed the topic.</p><p>As they had breakfast, Rio couldn’t help but feel grateful for the fact that Agatha agreed to be her friend. Her growing feelings aside, she really did enjoy the company. Although she saw Alice every so often, she was still busy. Agatha was busy too, but she was a better texter than Alice honestly, replying swiftly with snark to whatever Rio happened to send her that day. Since getting married, Rio had felt a kind of loneliness that pervaded her entire being, but spending time with Agatha kept it at bay.</p><p>When they got to the aquarium, Nicky ended up walking a few feet ahead of them, doing his own thing. Neither Agatha nor Rio minded, walking side-by-side and talking quietly as they walked through the various exhibits and tanks. </p><p>Rio was embarrassed to admit that she only paid attention to the animals for half the time. The other half of the time, Rio couldn’t look away from Agatha. She was always beautiful, but she was especially stunning in the bluish glow from the tanks and the streaks of warmth from the sunlight that came through from the ceiling. Not only that, but as she always was with Nicky, Agatha was calm. She was at peace in a way she never was around the rest of her family, and Rio always savored the chance to see her like this.</p><p>As they observed one of the bigger habitats with various fish and sharks swimming around, Rio asked, “Do you mind spending your day like this? I mean, I know you’d do anything for Nicky, but do you mind doing stuff like this?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said with a small shake of her head. She turned to look at her and asked, “Do you?”</p><p>Rio knew what she was asking. Did she mind doing this, having the time to do this, instead of having her old job? Rio missed being able to help patients so much some days that it made it hard to breathe, but she wasn’t ready to say that. Not here. Not like this. She merely said, “No, I love animals.”</p><p>Disappointment flickered through Agatha’s face before she managed a faint smile. She said, “Right, the squirrels.”</p><p>“You remembered,” Rio said in surprise.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks pinkened as she turned back to the tank. She folded her arms over her chest and rocked back on her heels, saying, “It’s not every day someone tells you they want to catch and dissect a squirrel.” </p><p>Rio felt warm all over at the thought of Agatha remembering such details about her. Then again, Rio remembered everything Agatha told her about herself too. </p><p>Clearing her throat, Rio ducked her head and took a deep breath. She could feel the embarrassment emanating from Agatha and decided to take pity on her. Rio pointed to a shark swimming past them and said, “Did you know sharks can only swim forwards?”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha said. She glanced at Rio from the corner of her eyes. “Why?”</p><p>“Big heads,” Rio said. Agatha snorted, and Rio grinned, “No, really. It makes it hard for them to keep stable if they try to move backwards. Also, their pectoral fins just aren’t built for it.” Her smile widened at the way Agatha tilted her head, actually listening to her. Rio continued, “Some shark species also have to keep swimming or they die.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, “Okay, now you’re just making up bullshit.”</p><p>“I’m not!” Rio exclaimed, laughing. “When they swim, water is pushed through their gills which gives them oxygen. No swimming, no water. No water, no oxygen. No oxygen, no shark.”</p><p>“How tiresome,” Agatha said. “Always moving forward, never stopping for a moment.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened as she said, “Reminds me of someone.”</p><p>“Trying to say something?” Agatha replied, facing her fully and raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Rio shrugged innocently and said, “Well, people do compare lawyers and sharks a lot.”</p><p>“Mm, and the other stuff?”</p><p>Rio was about to deflect, but then she caught Agatha’s eyes. As blank as the rest of her face could be, Rio always found Agatha’s eyes painfully expressive, and the more time they spent together, the easier she found it was to read them. There was something insatiably curious in those bright eyes of hers, bluer than even that of the water that surrounded them and infinitely clearer. Almost icy by comparison, but there was also an undeniably warmth to them.</p><p>“I guess,” Rio began, shoving her hands into the pockets of her jeans. A part of her knew it was reckless to say this, but another part of her couldn’t help but want to give Agatha the same kind of comfort she so easily gave to Rio. Not to mention, there was something incredibly sad about the idea of Agatha never taking a break, of Agatha feeling like she could never take a break. Rio took a deep breath and let a shy smile spread across her face. She said, “I guess I just want you to know you can stop and rest. Just for a little while. At least, you can when you’re with me.”</p><p>When Agatha said nothing, Rio snuck a glance at her, only to find Agatha already looking at her. The curiosity was replaced by something much more tender, and Rio felt herself stop breathing for a moment. It was the kind of look Rio remembered seeing during those quiet moments in bed, in the lull before they were forced back into reality. </p><p>Rio held her gaze for as long as she could, but it felt a little bit like drowning.</p><p>“We should keep going,” Rio said abruptly, forcing her eyes back to the aquarium. She licked her lips and internally cursed herself for ending the moment. “There’s still a lot to see. Like penguins. Love a penguin.”</p><p>Rio almost reached out to grab Agatha’s hand, but she stopped herself at the last moment. Her fingers brushed against Agatha’s wrist instead, and she swore she heard Agatha’s sharp intake of breath. Rio didn’t dare look at her though. She grasped the sleeve of Agatha’s jacket instead, pulling her in the direction Nicky was.</p><p>Not even for a moment did Rio allow herself to think about what all of this meant. For her, for Agatha, and especially not for the tenuous stasis that their lives seemed to be held in.</p>

<p>
<span>As the weeks went on, Rio settled into a routine with the Harknesses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Most days, Rio still went to the hospital to volunteer. There, she’d occasionally see Nicky, and the two of them would have lunch together if their schedules lined up. It was here that Rio got to see more of who Nicky was as a person, which turned out to be quiet, thoughtful, and kind. In a lot of ways, he was different from Agatha, but both of them had this unwavering loyalty about them that Rio couldn’t help but admire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On Thursdays, Rio would have dinners at Lilia’s, a standing invitation that she took up most times. It remained an escape for Rio in many ways, this small, cozy apartment where all that seemed to matter was whether she could finish the monstrous serving Lilia gave her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On every other Friday, Rio would have dinner with James. It was called a “date” between the two of them, but Rio made it abundantly clear that she still only saw James as a friend. She waited for the day he’d tire of her insistence on friendship, but James only shook his head and said he was okay with being friends. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope we’ll fall in love one day,” James told her. He smiled and brushed some hair from his face. “I think you’re very easy to fall in love with, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t known what to say to that, so she had merely smiled and changed the subject. James let her. She wasn’t sure how to respond to that either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Undoubtedly though, Rio’s favorite part of her weeks were the days she got to see Agatha alone. It wasn’t that she disliked Nicky or Lilia. There was actually something very special about being included in their time together. It was just different when it was just the two of them though. As gentle and soft Agatha was around Nicky, Rio also recognized her need to always be at her best around him. Not too sharp, not too rough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Around just Rio, Agatha allowed some of her bite to show, throwing out caustic remarks and eye rolls that she would never allow herself to do around Nicky. It made Rio feel all warm, knowing Agatha felt comfortable enough to be herself around Rio. It felt like something. What? Rio wasn’t sure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although there’d been no more kisses, there had been lingering touches. Ones where neither of them seemed to be able to stop themselves from granting themselves a moment of hope. Rio’s favorite were when Agatha would brush Rio’s hair from her face, fingertips lingering against her cheek like she wanted to cup it. It made Rio want to lean in and press against her palm solidly, to let Agatha cradle her face gently like she used to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On a morning where Agatha had no meetings and Rio had no plans, the two of them met at Agatha’s apartment to have breakfast together. Rio expected Agatha to just pick up some pastries or order food, but to her surprise, Agatha wore an apron to cook for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After pouring herself a cup of coffee, Rio perched herself on the counter and watched as Agatha moved around the kitchen. Apparently, Agatha had been craving a traditional American breakfast, so they were going to have bacon, eggs, and pancakes. The eggs were already cooked, and the bacon was in the oven. All that was left were the pancakes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to make them into shapes?” Rio asked playfully. “Can you make one into a heart or a rabbit?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you five?” Agatha retorted. She ladled the batter into the pan, letting it spread into a circle. When Rio made a noise of disappointment, Agatha sighed and said, “What if I flipped it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow. “Like they do on TV?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not that hard,” Agatha said. She lifted the pan, and without hesitation, she launched the pancake into the air. Rio was impressed for approximately three seconds before the pancake missed the pan, clipping the edge and landing on the stove. “Shit,” Agatha said. She set the pan down and hurried to clean up the pancake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very impressive,” Rio deadpanned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m much better without an audience,” Agatha huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, should I close my eyes?” Rio teased. She did that, only to cover them with her hands as well. “Or like this. No peeking possible.” However, Rio did exactly that, spreading her fingers to watch Agatha ladle another spoonful of batter onto the pan. When Agatha only gave her an unimpressed look, Rio dropped her hands. She quietly watched as Agatha attempted another flip, and this one landed neatly back in the pan. As Agatha made another pancake, Rio asked, “How do you know how to cook so well?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her. “Impressed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That you can fend for yourself?” Rio smirked. “A little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled but didn’t answer. She made a few more pancakes, and Rio could see the way her mind seemed to be mulling over her answer. As she finished making the last of the pancakes, she handed Rio a plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only once they sat down that Agatha said, “I moved out when I was eighteen, so I had to learn then. I wasn’t…” Her face grew pinched. “My parents still paid for everything, but as soon as I went to college, I was gone, and I refused to live in a dorm, so I was in an apartment, all by myself. It was everything I wanted.” Despite her last sentence, Agatha didn’t sound like it’d been a very happy time for her at all. Rio remained silent, giving her the time to think. After a few bites of food, Agatha said, “It’s funny. I didn’t realize that my reputation would follow me all the way to college, but it did. Everyone knew exactly who I was, and no one wanted to talk to me because of it.” A wry smile came across her face. She lifted her mug and stared at Rio over the edge of it. “Well, unless they wanted to get into trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thought about what Agatha told her, imagining a younger Agatha thinking she was finally free, only to be stuck in the same box their circle had always put her in. To say it sounded unfair was to put it lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard less about you when you went to college,” Rio said. Admittedly, Rio only heard about Agatha here and there growing up, but there’d still been a distinct decline when Rio was in high school.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because it wasn’t just me,” Agatha said with a shrug. “I was dragging down all the good boys and girls of the upper echelon with me. It’s harder to single me out in the gossip without letting it slip who else was involved, especially if it was their own children.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made a lot of sense. Trying to lighten the mood, Rio joked, “It sounds like you had a lot of fun in college.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not really,” Agatha said. Her expression had gone pensive. She looked down at her food, saying, “People might have sought me out to have fun, but I wasn’t their friend. I was still the girl everyone’s parents warned them against.” There was a tense beat before Agatha looked up with a wan smile. “It’s lonely being a pariah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed at the present tense of her words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could say anything though, Agatha cleared her throat and said, “Sorry, you just asked about cooking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t mind,” Rio said softly, but she could sense Agatha’s retreat as if she’d physically closed a door between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you?” Agatha asked. “What were your college years like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Boring,” was all Rio could think to say. When Agatha gave her a thumbs down, even going as far as booing her, Rio laughed and insisted, “I’m serious. I didn’t really do much. I studied and I studied, and oh? You know? I studied.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, staring at Rio intently. “Really? That’s it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated. She didn’t like to talk about it, but she felt like she owed Agatha this after what she shared earlier. “I had a girlfriend in college,” Rio admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up from her coffee to find a peculiar look on Agatha’s face. If she didn’t know any better, she would have thought she looked jealous. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio said. She poked at her eggs, remembering all of the stolen kisses and panic attacks over being discovered. “We met in my second year, and we dated for almost two years. Eventually, she broke it off, but it was for the best.” It was painful to think about, even now. Rio pressed a hand to her chest, as if that might stave off the burning shame that lingered. “I loved her, but I was just too afraid to actually tell anyone about it, especially my parents. It would have never worked out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could only laugh bitterly. “I’m sorry too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of breakfast was finished in a stilted silence. Rio couldn’t help but think about her ex-girlfriend as she ate, where she was now and whether she was happy with another woman. She hoped so. She also wondered if Agatha was reliving her time in college too. It couldn’t be pleasant for her to think about. Still though, neither of them said anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After the dishes were cleared, Agatha announced, “Let’s go shopping. I still need a few things for Nicky’s room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When’s he supposed to move in?” Rio asked, but she still walked over to the door and grabbed her coat. “The paperwork is pretty much done, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Two weeks,” Agatha said with a small but happy smile. “I’m nervous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure you’re ready to handle all those teenage hormones?” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed and said, “Hopefully.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a weekday, so the store wasn’t too crowded as Agatha grabbed a few smaller items for Nicky’s room. Rio had seen the steady progress of the room whenever she came over. It was simple but nice, and she imagined Nicky would have his own personal things to help make it feel a little more cozy. As they shopped around, Agatha talked about a break-up she caused while she was in college. Unlike earlier, she seemed happy to talk about this, but that probably had to do with the fact that it involved Agatha getting revenge on a girl who cheated off her test.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was so much fun when we were all at the next event together,” Agatha said. Her eyes were bright with glee. She was all but preening over her past victory, and it made Rio feel a ridiculous rush of fondness. “He was there with the girl he cheated with too. She was furious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish I could’ve seen that,” Rio chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thought about it for a moment and said, “Maybe you did, but you didn’t know it.” She bumped her shoulder against Rio’s. “I’ve wondered, you know. Did we ever see each other growing up and just not realize it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure whether to admit this or not, but after a moment, she said, “I saw you once when we were younger.” She bit her lip when Agatha whipped her head to look at her. She looked away, blushing, as she continued, “It was one of those awful garden parties, where it was hot but everyone acted like they weren’t melting. Some poor worker was fanning an old lady.” At this description, Agatha laughed and nodded. Rio smiled faintly. She said, “I was in some ugly pastel yellow dress my mom made me wear. I must have been thirteen or fourteen.” She could see Agatha do the math; she would have been about sixteen or seventeen, most likely just after having Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was I causing a scene?” Agatha asked lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not at all,” Rio said. She closed her eyes briefly, imagining the scene. “You were sitting at one of the tables, wearing black. I thought you were so cool for that.” Agatha snorted, and Rio opened her eyes with a grin. She noticed Agatha was blushing, but she decided to be nice and not point that out. “What I really remember though was that you looked bored, like you wanted to be anywhere else but that party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was probably exactly how I was feeling,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “I remember being jealous too. I never let myself show how bored I was at those things.” She saw Agatha glance at her from the corner of her eye, but she stubbornly kept her eyes forward. “I used to smile so much it would make my cheeks hurt so much afterwards.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth then closed it. Her eyebrows scrunched together for a moment. When she finally spoke, she said, “I used to try and goad James into doing something uncouth at those things. I would offer him candy when we were younger, or my allowance when we got older. Whatever I could think of, really.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did he ever take you up on such a great offer?” Rio laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, “Believe it or not, no.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to imagine it. She pictured Agatha and James at the ages she saw them in the portrait at the estate. It was easy to imagine a younger Agatha trying to get James to do something he shouldn’t. It didn’t sound too dissimilar to them now, to be honest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re closer than I would’ve thought,” Rio said. She blinked a few times right after she said that. She hadn’t meant to say that out loud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t seem to notice her surprise, saying, “Don’t get it twisted. We hated each other a lot, especially when we were younger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it was us versus them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The them were clearly their parents. Rio mulled over the idea of Agatha and James teaming up together. How long did it take for them to get to that point? What was the last straw before they realized they were better off together rather than against one another?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could only imagine the amount of resentment Agatha felt towards James, and she already had an idea of some of the resentment James felt towards Agatha. Those feelings didn’t just disappear overnight, if they even went away at all. It would take something huge for someone to move past that. Rio wondered if it was Nicky that brought them together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Glancing at Agatha, Rio waited to see if she would say anything, but she didn’t. Rio thought about asking, but Agatha had already shared so much with her today. She didn’t want to push her too far. Today was a good day so far. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After paying for everything, the two of them decided to head back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio followed Agatha back into her apartment, her phone buzzed with a phone call. She fished it out of her pocket, only to stare at it in surprise. It was James. He never called her. Shutting the door behind her, she kicked off her shoes and answered the call. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vaguely, Rio was aware of Agatha saying something about ordering dinner in the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, James. Is everything–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you cheating on me?”</span>

<p>There was a strange ringing in Rio’s ears. She opened her mouth, but she couldn’t form any words. Shock flooded her senses, rendering her dumb. Her wedding ring suddenly felt cold against her skin.</p><p>He couldn’t know. There was no way. It’d been over for months now. What was there to even discover? There was no proof, no evidence, no possible way for James to know that Rio had been with Agatha. </p><p>Rio wracked her brain, trying to think if she left anything at Agatha’s, but that didn’t make any sense. James never came over to Agatha’s. When would he have had the opportunity to notice anything was amiss? There shouldn’t be any reason to suspect anything either. They had dates every other week, for god’s sake. </p><p>Finally, Rio had the sense to choke out, “What the hell are you talking about?” When James didn’t answer immediately, Rio felt her face grow hot. She’d gotten her act together. She’d stopped. She’d given up the one thing that made her feel better to respect their marriage. How dare he accuse her of this now. “Why the hell would you ask that, James?” Rio snapped.</p><p>Agatha appeared in the doorway so quickly, you would have thought Rio called her name. Her eyebrows were drawn together. She took a step forward then stopped herself.</p><p><em>“I was anonymously sent photos of you,”</em> James explained tersely. <em>“You’re coming and going from the same apartment for weeks, Rio.”</em> He sighed so heavily that it was loud even over the phone.<em> “It’s not anywhere near convincing or damning, but it’s enough to make others question us. It could be a rumor that spirals quickly if there’s even a shred of truth to it.”</em></p><p>“Well, there isn’t!” Rio exclaimed. “I don’t know what apartment you’re looking at, but I am not cheating on you.”</p><p>Across from her, Agatha tensed, arms wrapped around herself. A distinct hunted look crossed her face as she only heard half of the conversation.</p><p>“Send me the photos,” Rio demanded. “Show me where I’m supposedly cheating on you, and I’ll tell you whose apartment it is.” </p><p>James sighed again. His voice was low and condescending as he said, <em>“This only works if we’re honest with each other, Rio.”</em></p><p>“I know that,” Rio said. She barely held back a snarl. “Send the photo.” This was the rudest she’d ever spoken to him. This was the closest they’d ever been to a fight, actually. They never talked about anything serious enough to argue over something. </p><p>Rio’s head was spinning at the accusation, so when she received the photo, only to see Agatha’s apartment, the very apartment she was in at the moment, staring back at her, Rio laughed hysterically. </p><p>This only made Agatha more concerned, who finally walked closer and laid a hand on Rio’s arm.</p><p>“Are you kidding me?” Rio said, pressing the phone back to her ear. “James, do you seriously not know whose apartment that is?” She felt Agatha’s hand squeeze, but she didn’t pay attention. She said, “It’s Agatha’s.”</p><p>Rio didn’t realize what she’d done until she heard nothing but silence from the other end of the phone, coupled with Agatha’s nails digging into her arm. Her eyes snapped up to Agatha’s who had her lips pressed together. Her blue eyes were wide with distress and panic, and Rio opened her mouth, unsure of whether to take it back.</p><p><em>“Agatha lives in a brownstone,”</em> James finally said. <em>“Just like we do.”</em></p><p>Rio couldn’t help but glance around the apartment, one that was definitely not a brownstone. </p><p>“I don’t know what to say,” was all Rio could blurt out. She didn’t know how to explain to James that Agatha didn’t live in a brownstone. She never had, as far as Rio was aware. She looked back at Agatha, eyebrows furrowed. What the hell was going on?</p><p>Wordlessly, Agatha held out her hand. After a moment of hesitation, Rio gave her the phone.</p><p>“Hello, James,” Agatha said. Her voice was remarkably even. Rio watched as the stress melted from her face, replaced by an eerie kind of focus. This must be what Agatha was like at work. “Yes, that is my apartment.” There was a pause before Agatha rolled her eyes. “Yes, I have two places, James. Is that really so hard to believe? Does it matter?” Then, James must have said something that made Agatha hesitate. Her eyes flickered over to Rio for a moment. “You’re paranoid.”</p><p>The call ended after that, and Agatha handed her the phone. The two of them stared at each other for a long moment before Agatha said, “You should go. James wants you home to talk about this.”</p><p>It felt wrong to just leave like this. Rio tried, “Agatha–”</p><p>“You need to talk to James.”</p><p>“But Agatha–”</p><p>“We did nothing wrong,” Agatha said, firm with an edge of warning. </p><p>Nothing wrong recently, Rio wanted to say. A few months ago, they’d done plenty. Rio didn’t say this though. She could tell by the way Agatha held herself that she was not going to stand here and argue with her. </p><p>Rio took a deep breath and said, “Fine. Good-bye, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio shoved her shoes back on and left without looking back. She knew she should have called a car, but she was still trembling from the panic and anger flooding her system. Rio just started walking. All she could do was focus on putting one foot in front of the other, so she could try to work off the excess emotions threatening to spill out. </p><p>After about half an hour, Rio felt calm enough that she knew she wouldn’t snap the moment she tried to speak. She glanced around, assessing where she was, before she went to take the train the rest of the way home.</p><p>It was eerily quiet when Rio let herself in, but she expected that. She found James right where she expected him, sitting on the couch with a glass of whiskey in his hand. Rio stood at the end of the couch and stared. </p><p>James took a long sip of his drink before he finally looked at her. “Why didn’t you tell me that you were spending so much time with Agatha?”</p><p>It came off as an accusation, and Rio tried to temper the flare of indignance that rose up in her. She took a deep breath and said, “I didn’t want to hurt you.” That was the truth. Maybe not the whole truth, but it wasn’t a lie. Rio’s hands clenched into tight fists. Rio continued, “You’re always trying so hard to get to know me, and I just can’t–”</p><p>“Rio, I get it,” James cut her off with a shake of his head. “You’re both women. It’s different.” He dragged a hand over his face and stood up, facing her. His shoulders were slumped, and his face was pale. He looked like hell. “It just hurts that you hid this from me. That you both hid this from me.” James stepped closer, allowing Rio to see the genuine hurt on his face. “Did you really think I’d disapprove of the two of you being friends?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said immediately. She hesitated and furrowed her brows. “I don’t know. I already saw how much it hurt you when you found out that I see Nicky. I didn’t want to make things worse.” Too late for that. “What if you and Agatha fought?”</p><p>James sighed and said, “It does hurt that you see Nicholas, but things aren’t exactly easy or simple between Agatha and me. I know that. I just–” He let out another sigh. He paced back and forth for a moment. When he stopped, he looked at her beseechingly. “I want you to tell me things, Rio. I’m your husband.”</p><p>“I know that,” Rio said.</p><p>James moved closer, frustration seeping into his voice. “I’m trying.”</p><p>“I know!” Rio exclaimed.</p><p>“Are you?” It would have been easier if James yelled at her, but instead, the question was asked in a broken voice, weak and confused.</p><p>Tears sprung to Rio’s eyes as she struggled to answer. Was she trying? She was, wasn’t she? Rio ended her affair with Agatha. She went on dates with James. She went to all of his events, family and work alike. Rio’s entire world revolved around the Harknesses now. Wasn’t that enough?</p><p>“I want this to work so much, Rio, but I can’t help but feel like you don’t,” James said. He finally reached out and touched her, a heavy hand on her shoulder. His brown eyes met hers, desperate. “I always feel like you’re just humoring me.”</p><p>Rio wrenched away from his touch and said, “What do you want me to say, James? You know I don’t love you. I never promised you I would either.”</p><p>“Can’t you try?” James all but begged.</p><p>“It doesn’t work like that!” Rio cried. She felt a few tears fall from her eyes and hastily wiped them away. She didn’t want him to see her cry. Rio took a shaky breath. She looked at him with teary eyes and said quietly, “Don’t you think I know how much easier things would be if I could just love you?”</p><p>Silence echoed in the moments following her words. The two of them could only stare at each other as the reality of their situation settled over them. James wanted things to be easy, to work. He wanted things to work like they were supposed to. A happily ever after. Meanwhile, Rio just wanted to survive. To tolerate her circumstances and find ways to make it easier. It was only a matter of time before James’s idealism shattered.</p><p>After several long moments, James sighed and dug the heels of his hands into his eyes. He rubbed at them tiredly before letting his hands fall back to his sides. “I’m sorry,” James said finally. “You’re right. It’s not fair of me to act like this when you didn’t promise me anything like that.”</p><p>Rio relaxed minutely. She didn’t expect him to apologize. Letting out a heavy sigh, Rio said, “For what it’s worth, I am sorry that I don’t love you.”</p><p>“Yet,” James said. It was a half-hearted attempt at humor, and the two of them shared small, exhausted smiles. “Come here.” He wrapped his arms around her into a hug, and while it was a kind, conciliatory gesture, Rio felt suffocated as she hugged him back. Thankfully, he kept the hug brief and pulled away after a few moments. He brushed a strand of hair from Rio’s face then said, “We still have to fix this thing with Agatha.”</p><p>“The photos?” Rio asked bitterly.</p><p>“Yes, we need to publicize our relationship with Agatha,” James said. Rio could see the way he shifted into politician mode, analyzing the right angle to play this. “We need to be seen together, coming from her apartment and spending time together. The last thing we need is some stupid tabloid trying to pit Agatha and myself against each other over you.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “Do you really think they’ll do that?”</p><p>“Harkness’s wife spends more time with his sister than himself. Is that marriage already on the rocks?” James replied, voice mocking the possible headlines. He shook his head, jaw clenched. He forced himself to take a deep breath. “Yes, I think that’s exactly what they’ll say.”</p><p>“Then we’ll fix it,” Rio said, because she hadn’t suffered this much to let this marriage fail like this. </p><p>It was easy enough for James to call Agatha and explain the plan to her. A few outings together, beginning with a dinner tomorrow night. James already had the reservations. They would meet her there and put on an amicable show. Easy enough.</p><p>When James and Rio arrived at the restaurant the following night, Agatha was already there, and despite the reason they were there, Rio couldn’t help the way her breath caught at the sight of her.</p><p>Agatha looked ethereal in a light blue dress. It had a high neckline where the fabric layered on top of itself at the top before flowing all the way down to Agatha’s ankles. It was simple yet gorgeous. Agatha’s hair was also tied back for once in a low ponytail with a few strands framing her face. She looked soft like this. Harmless, Rio realized. A definitive non-threat.</p><p>“Agatha,” James greeted her first. “Lovely to see you.” The two of them hugged briefly, followed by Agatha kissing him lightly on the cheek. It was the first Rio had ever seen them do something like this, and she tried not to look too surprised when Agatha did the same to her. </p><p>It was the first time Rio had felt her lips in months.</p><p>Agatha looked painfully unaware of how that simple kiss affected Rio, saying, “Shall we go in?”</p><p>The restaurant was upscale and bustling, full of plenty of other affluent and influential patrons. That was the point, Rio supposed. Make sure everyone who mattered saw them together. </p><p>Once they were seated and food was ordered, Agatha asked, “How is work?”</p><p>“Work is work,” James replied lightly. “I would like your advice on something though.”</p><p>Rio tried to look interested as Agatha and James spoke about some congressman that needed to be swayed to James’s side for something. Although, from the sounds of it, it seemed more like blackmail than any kind of ethical persuasion. Rio didn’t say anything, merely watching Agatha light up at the idea of digging up dirt on this man.</p><p>Once the two of them figured out a way to presumably ruin this man’s life, James asked, “How is Nicholas?”</p><p>There was a moment of hesitation before Agatha recovered and said, “He’s doing well. We’re both nervous about the move, but we’re both looking forward to it as well.”</p><p>“It will be a big adjustment, I’m sure,” James nodded.</p><p>“We’ll figure things out,” Agatha said.</p><p>It was clear they never spoke about Nicky much. It also became much more clear why James was never invited to meet him. The exchange came off as so cold and perfunctory. It didn’t seem as though he actually cared. It felt as though he was just asking because he had to. </p><p>Before the awkwardness could become too much, Rio asked, “Did he ask you about the record player?”</p><p>“What?” It was both Agatha and James who spoke, turning to her with twin looks of surprise.</p><p>Rio tried not to blush at both of their bewildered stares. She fidgeted with her fork. “Lilia is giving him the record player,” Rio explained. “He mentioned he was going to ask you if he can keep it in the living room or if he should keep it in his room.”</p><p>“It depends,” Agatha said.</p><p>“On?”</p><p>“What kind of music he has,” Agatha said, as if this was obvious.</p><p>Rio laughed and said, “Oh, and what music gets your stamp approval? Bach? Mozart?” Rio’s eyes lit up at another thought. “Oh, please tell me you’ll let him play Beyonce on his record player.”</p><p>“Is that how you see my music tastes?” Agatha snorted. “Classical music and Beyonce?”</p><p>Rio grinned and nodded, but as she did, she became aware of the fact that James was watching them. She tried to tamp down her nervousness as she looked at him. He didn’t look upset or angry. He just looked confused, most likely wondering where this camaraderie came from. Rio wasn’t sure she had an answer for him.</p><p>As the dinner continued, it was difficult. Rio wasn’t sure who to look at, who to speak to. She did her best to engage with them both equally, but she wasn’t sure she succeeded. It was just so much more comfortable with Agatha. That fact didn’t help the mounting tension between the three of them. For herself, Rio still felt awkward with James after their fight and with Agatha, feeling like she could act like she normally would with James there.</p><p>By the time they were finishing and heading back outside, Rio felt deeply unsettled.</p><p>Was this how it was going to be from now on? Putting on a show to make this loveless marriage seem flourishing? Rio wasn’t a stranger to wearing a mask and acting like everything was fine. All her life, she’d acted a certain way because that was how she was supposed to be. It just felt so cheap doing it for a marriage. Maybe Rio hated it so much because it kept her from Agatha.</p><p>Because that’s what it seemed to come to for Rio. Agatha. All she wanted was Agatha, her eyes, her laugh, her smile, her son. Rio wanted everything about her, but it was beginning to feel like she couldn’t have her even in that way, not even as friends, with the way things were going.</p><p>Could Rio handle losing Agatha altogether though, the one bright spot to all of this?</p><p>No, it was better to play along. </p><p>So when the night was over and Agatha hugged her good-bye, Rio pressed her lips to Agatha’s cheek, just as she had done to her. This time, when Agatha pulled away, she had a look in her eye. Rio wasn’t quite sure what to call it. It was almost like she was hurt. </p><p>That didn’t make any sense though, so Rio just smiled and said, “Good seeing, Agatha. We should do this again sometime.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile looked as fake as Rio’s felt as she said, “Of course, Rio. Just let me know when.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After the photographs of Rio at Agatha’s apartment, there was a shift in Rio’s life.</p><p>Instead of dinners at Lilia’s and afternoons with Agatha, Rio found herself attending event after event with James. There were no more moments where Rio felt like she could breathe. There were only more dinners, more dates, more obligations. With every time that Rio forced herself into another dress to go to another occasion, she felt her misery and resentment grow. </p><p>There had only been one other outing with Agatha and James, over a week ago, that was a lunch that was less than an hour.</p><p>Rio tried not to blame it on James, but it was hard not to. She knew what this marriage would consist of when she agreed to it, but after having months of freedom with Agatha, it felt confining and stifling to suddenly be forced back into this performative role.</p><p>Her only reprieve these days were when she went to volunteer at the hospital. Although she didn’t see Agatha there, Rio got to see Nicky at least. The boy was similar to his mother in the fact that he was someone who brightened her days.</p><p>“How’s living with Agatha?” Rio asked him one day over lunch.</p><p>“Good,” Nicky said. Before Rio could say anything, he hesitated then added, “Weird. I don’t know. It’s not bad.”</p><p>Rio chuckled and pushed her basket of fries towards him. “Go on,” Rio encouraged him. She had no idea if Nicky told his friends everything about Agatha, and it wasn’t like Nicky could talk to Agatha about this. </p><p>Nicky lasted ten whole seconds before he blurted out, “It’s just so weird.”</p><p>“What’s weird about it?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Everything,” Nicky sighed. He picked up a fry and started ripping it apart. The action reminded Rio of when Agatha tore her brownie apart. That felt like years ago. “It’s hard because I don’t think either of us know how to act. Like, she’s my mom, but is she supposed to act like my mom now? Is she supposed to make me do chores or yell at me for staying up too late on a school night?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t think Agatha would ever yell at you,” Rio said absently. When Nicky gave her a look, Rio raised her hands in acquiesce and said, “Okay, sorry. Not helpful.” She thought about it for a moment and wondered who Agatha was talking to about this. She was sure Agatha probably felt as lost as Nicky did, but Rio hadn’t gotten more than a few texts from her recently. Rio shook her head. Focus on Nicky for now. </p><p>“Why isn’t this easier?” Nicky huffed.</p><p>Rio reached out and squeezed his hand. She said, “The two of you have an unconventional relationship, so it’s going to be tough at first, but I know the two of you will figure it out. You’ll find something that works for you, and that’s all that matters.”</p><p>“But what if,” Nicky hesitated. “What if we fight?”</p><p>“Then you’ll really be mother and son,” Rio teased. She squeezed his hand again. “It’ll take some trial and error, but as long as you guys talk, it’ll work out.”</p><p>“I guess,” Nicky said reluctantly. He slumped back in his chair and pushed his pile of mushed potato away. He fiddled with his napkin before he looked at Rio and asked, “Will you come over soon? We haven’t had dinner in a while.”</p><p>Rio had gone to one last dinner with Lilia before she moved away, but she hadn’t been to a dinner with Nicky since.</p><p>“I’ll try,” Rio said, not wanting to disappoint him if she couldn’t. “I’ve been busy lately.”</p><p>“With James.” It wasn’t a question.</p><p>Rio shifted uneasily. “Yeah, with James.”</p><p>Nicky looked out at the crowd in the cafeteria. After a moment, he said, “She doesn’t talk about him a lot. I don’t think she likes him.”</p><p>Rio let out a heavy sigh. “It’s complicated,” Rio said, which in all honestly was putting it lightly. </p><p>“Actually complicated or you just don’t want to talk about it complicated?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“Both.”</p><p>The two of them shared wry smiles. As Rio cleaned up their trays, Nicky leaned forward and said, “Well, just so you know, I miss you. Both of us do.”</p><p>Rio’s hands froze where they were picking up a few napkins. She swallowed as she slowly lowered the napkins onto her tray. She wished those words didn’t affect her so much, but they did because Rio missed them too. If only she could hear Agatha say that too.</p><p>Forcing a smile, Rio said, “Thanks, Nicky. I’ll try and visit soon.”</p><p>Nicky’s words weighed heavily on Rio for the rest of the day, reminding her of the exhaustion that seemed to be a permanent fixture in her life lately. That was why when James told her the following afternoon that there was an auction they needed to attend that night, Rio said, “No.”</p><p>James looked up from his phone and stared at her. “No?” James repeated, not quite angry. More baffled. “What do you mean no?”</p><p>“I mean, no,” Rio said slowly. She stood up from the couch and wrapped her arms around herself. “I know I’m your wife, James, and I know those pictures looked bad, but it’s been weeks. I’m exhausted. I don’t want to go tonight.”</p><p>“Rio,” James began. He stopped himself and sighed. He walked closer and stopped just a few feet away from her. “I know I’ve been asking a lot of you lately, but it’s necessary.”</p><p>Wasn’t it always?</p><p>“I know, but I’m telling you right now,” Rio said. “My going with you tonight is not necessary.”</p><p>James stared at her for a long moment before saying, “Fine.” Judging by his tone though, it clearly wasn’t fine. James shoved his hands into his pockets and said, “This isn’t me asking you to love me.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“This was the agreement.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio repeated, annoyed. “But I’m tired, James. One night isn’t going to end our marriage.”</p><p>James sighed and shook his head. He said nothing else, which was fine with Rio. She silently watched him get ready and leave without another word. As soon as the door shut behind him, Rio let herself breathe. She rubbed her eyes and tried not to feel too overwhelmed. She hadn’t realized just how much she relied on Agatha to keep her sane.</p><p>With nothing to do, Rio lazed about on the couch before she made herself a cup of instant ramen for dinner. It was as she was eating that she scrolled through her phone, apprising herself of the news.</p><p>The last thing Rio expected to see was an article on Agatha.</p><p>The headline read, <em>“Senator Harkness’s Sister Flaunting Secret Lovechild and Lesbian Lover.”</em> Accompanying the article was a photograph of Agatha walking out of her apartment, not her brownstone, with Nicky and another woman. Nicky was wearing his backpack, most likely going to school, but it was the woman that had all of Rio’s attention. She was gorgeous with long red hair. She was wearing a suit like Agatha, and Rio couldn’t help but think they’d make an attractive couple.</p><p>As soon as the thought entered her brain, Rio leapt off the couch and shoved her shoes on. She barely remembered to grab her wallet before she left the apartment. She didn’t even bother with a car, heading straight for the train.</p><p>The entire ride there, Rio felt herself brimming with fury and betrayal. Weeks. Weeks, Rio hadn’t heard from Agatha. It wasn’t for lack of trying either. Rio texted Agatha every so often, but her attempts were always met with curt messages that made it clear that she wasn’t wanted. Now, there was this. Rio had to find out from a tabloid that Nicky was revealed to the world and Agatha was dating someone. </p><p>Had Agatha really moved on that quickly?</p><p>Not that there was anything to move on from, Rio told herself. Not technically. Not officially. But actually…</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw so tightly it ached, but it was either that or let out a scream that would definitely get her institutionalized. By the time Rio got off the train, she was shaking with restrained rage. </p><p>It was proof of how furious she was that Rio didn’t even stop to consider that Nicky would be home until he opened the door. The two of them stared at each other in silent surprise until Nicky finally said, “Hey. I didn’t know you were coming over.”</p><p>“Unplanned,” Rio managed to say, but even she could hear how strained her voice was. “I need to talk to Agatha.”</p><p>Nicky eyed her for a moment before he nodded. “Mom, I’m going for a walk!” Nicky called out.</p><p>Mom. That was new. Just another thing Rio didn’t know about. </p><p>There was a shuffle of footsteps before Agatha came into view, reading something on her phone, saying, “A walk? Why are you–” Her words came to an abrupt end when she looked up and saw Rio standing there. </p><p>“I’ll be back in an hour,” Nicky said. He glanced between the two of them. “Maybe two.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped back to him. “Nicky–”</p><p>“I have my phone,” Nicky said. “I’ll stay in the area. I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha twisted her lips into a frown. She walked over to her purse and fished out a twenty dollar bill. She held it out and said, “Sit in a cafe instead. Do your reading for school.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Nicky said. He grabbed the money and his backpack from the floor. He gave Rio a playful salute before he brushed past her, whispering, “Good luck.”</p><p>Rio’s odds seemed dismally poor if a teenager was wishing her luck. She watched him walk down the hall, and it wasn’t until he turned the corner that she looked back at Agatha. If Nicky had looked surprised yet happy to see Rio, Agatha only looked displeased. </p><p>“Since you’re already here, you might as well come in,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath and stepped instead, closing and locking the door behind her. She followed Agatha into the living room. She tried to ignore the way that an apartment that once felt like a second home now felt like such an unwelcome space. </p><p>Agatha didn’t even offer Rio a drink. She merely spun on her heel and demanded, “What do you want?”</p><p>Too much to say. Rio settled for, “I saw the article about Nicky.”</p><p>“And that requires a house call?” Agatha said snidely. </p><p>Rio bit her lip and tried not to lash out. “Agatha,” she said, “I just wanted to check on you. We haven’t spoken in weeks.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her for a moment before she shrugged, tossing her hair over her shoulder. “I thought I was doing you a favor,” Agatha said simply. “I mean, you were clearly busy with James. Why bother you?”</p><p>“You aren’t a bother,” Rio snapped. She felt tears prick her eyes and forced herself to take a deep breath. When she calmed herself, she found Agatha staring at her with sharp eyes. Rio didn’t flinch. Instead, she said, “Is that why you didn’t tell me about her?” It was only then that Rio hesitated. “That woman in the photo–”</p><p>Agatha cut her off swiftly and firmly, “What about her?”</p><p>Rio licked her lips and tried to read Agatha’s expression. All she could tell was that she seemed annoyed. That wasn’t exactly helpful. Rio asked as evenly as she could, “Who is she?”</p><p>“I don’t see how it’s any of your business,” Agatha said, and it was the way she said, like Rio was nobody, that made her break.</p><p>“Was it all just a lie?” Rio asked. It came out more as a cry, but she couldn’t help it now. “Us? Nicky?” A family, one that Rio tricked herself into believing was real. Rio’s nails dug into her palm as she stared at Agatha. Her voice cracked as she said, “Why would you let me in if you were just going to cast me aside the moment you found someone else?”</p><p>Agatha held no sympathy for her though. She scoffed, “Oh, so you’re the only one to have a life? Don’t forget your the one who goes home to a husband every night.” The blow struck Rio ruthlessly. A slap to the face would have hurt less. She barely pulled herself together in time to see the victorious smirk flicker across Agatha’s face. “What does it matter, Rio? Why do you care?” Agatha asked, walking closer. “Shouldn’t you be happy for me as a friend?”</p><p>“Stop it,” Rio said.</p><p>“No, tell me,” Agatha insisted. She was close now, just inches from Rio. She leaned into her space, crowding her, making her look at her. “Tell me why it’s so hard for you to know that there actually might be someone else in my life.”</p><p>“Agatha, stop it,” Rio pleaded.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t stop though. “Does it drive you crazy? Thinking about how I could leave you and go home to another woman who I–”</p><p>The words that threatened to pour out of her were too frightening for Rio to even conceive, and instead, she grabbed Agatha by the shirt and crashed her lips into hers. It was a messy, harsh kiss, one born of desperation and fear, but Rio meant it nonetheless. Craved it, even. As painful as the kiss was, it was the first time Rio had kissed Agatha in months, and the touch made a part of her crumble.</p><p>Agatha kissed her back for the briefest of moments before she roughly shoved Rio away.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said. Her blue eyes were alight with rage. “You don’t get to do this.” She pressed a finger hard against Rio’s chest, right over her heart. “You either want me, or you don’t. You don’t get to pick and choose when you want to fuck.”</p><p>Rio wanted to tell her it was more than that. Agatha had to know that, didn’t she? It was never about the sex. It was only ever about Agatha. All Rio needed was Agatha. </p><p>“Agatha, please,” Rio tried. The tears that had been threatening to spill this entire time finally fell, streaming down Rio’s cheeks.</p><p>“Please what?” Agatha said. She gripped Rio’s shirt tight for a moment before she pushed her away. “I’m fucking sick of this, Rio. I’ve let you treat me like your little play thing for too long. First, you want me. Then, you don’t. Then, you do but only as a friend. Then, you fucking look at me sometimes like–” Agatha stopped herself, and Rio desperately wished she’d kept going. Agatha shook her head and continued, “I can’t do this anymore. I won’t.”</p><p>Rio knew what she had to say. She just had to open her mouth and say it. But when she tried, nothing came out. The tears kept coming. Rio couldn’t do it. She was paralyzed by fear, but she couldn’t even say fear of what. Rejection? Betrayal? Change?</p><p>
<em>Say it. Just say it. Tell her you love her. </em>
</p><p>The word love made Rio choke, the sheer terror of loving a woman who could make her entire world shatter. Would that be so bad though? She’d already turned it on its head. </p><p><em>I love you.</em> That was all Rio had to say. </p><p>When was the last time Rio had ever told someone that? </p><p>Rio couldn’t remember. </p><p>Finally, Agatha sighed and looked away. “Just go,” Agatha said quietly. </p><p>And all Rio could do was go. </p><p>Go, go, go. She kept going until she found herself back in her apartment, and as soon as she was, Rio collapsed to her knees. The tears flowed freely now as ragged sobs were finally let loose. Rio wrapped her arms around herself as the crushing realization of what she lost hit her full force. </p><p>What had she done? What had her cowardice cost her? </p><p>Agatha was never going to forgive her for this. She was gone, for good this time. </p><p>Rio cried harder, clawing at her chest like she might be able to rip her heart out and stop the pain that threatened to swallow her whole. She couldn’t though. All she could do was cry, and that was what she did until a pair of arms guided her to bed. </p><p>For a moment, she let herself actually believe it might be Agatha, but as she laid down, all she saw were James’s brown eyes.</p>

<p>
<span>The first few days after Rio’s confrontation with Agatha found her a shell of a person. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely left the bed, barely ate any food, barely slept despite her best efforts. Her chest just felt so hollow, like someone had carved out her heart and left her to bleed. No matter her attempts to staunch the loss, Rio still felt empty and astray, missing something she can’t recover.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was mourning, for all intents and purposes. She was grieving the loss of the woman she loved. Rio couldn’t tell James that though. She actually didn’t tell him anything. All he knew was that she was devastated for reasons that she refused to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, when Rio finally collected the shattered pieces of herself and forced them back together into some crude semblance of a functioning human being, it was right back to how things were before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was James’s wife, always on his arm at every event.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was all she was now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When did that happen? When had Rio’s very being become so inextricably tied to the Harknesses, both of them?</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time since they got married, Rio didn’t go to the monthly family dinner. She couldn’t stomach the thought of seeing Agatha, let alone sitting through an entire dinner with her. Rio made up some weak excuse about not feeling well, and even though she knew James didn’t believe it for a moment, he let her stay home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you ever going to trust me enough to talk to me?” James asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not about trust.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>James huffed a laugh and looked at her. “Then what is it, Rio? I keep doing everything I’m supposed to and yet…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet,” Rio said, to which James could only sigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe she would tell him when the thought of Agatha no longer made her want to cry or when she was brave enough to admit what, who, she wanted. Or maybe, she’d keep it locked inside herself for the rest of her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Life went on though, and it took almost three weeks for Rio to work up the nerve to go back to the hospital for volunteer work. It felt ridiculous, helping others when she couldn’t even help herself, but it gave herself something to do instead of staring at a wall and replaying her last conversation with Agatha again and again in her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she returned, it didn’t take long for Nicky to find her. If Rio didn’t know any better, she would have thought he was staking out her usual spots. When he did run into her, right as she was about to leave, Nicky latched onto her sleeve with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” Nicky exclaimed. He threw his arms around her in a clumsy hug. They’d never hugged before. Rio hugged him back though, trying to ignore the way it made her heart thud a little harder. It hurt. “What happened? Where have you been?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I–” Rio couldn’t think of an excuse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyebrows scrunched together as he stared at her. His arms dropped back to his sides. Nicky’s lips curved into a frown, so much like Agatha’s, before he asked, “What happened between you and Mom? She was crying when I came home, and she refuses to talk about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It should have made her feel better, knowing Agatha was hurt too, but it only made Rio feel worse. Rio shook her head slowly and said, “It’s between us, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it’s not fair,” Nicky said. His wide brown eyes looked at her in betrayal. “You were there, and suddenly, you’re not. Everything’s changed, but you were supposed to stick with us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure if it was something genetic or learned, but Agatha and Nicky both had the uncanny ability to say things that made Rio feel as though she’d been stabbed. Repeatedly. She had no idea Nicky felt that way about her. She knew Nicky didn’t have a lot of adults in his life he could talk to, but she didn’t expect her absence to affect him so deeply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” was all Rio could say. She reached out and laid her hand on Nicky’s shoulder, relieved when he didn’t move away. She squeezed it and tried to sound as sincere as possible. “I am really sorry I made you feel that, Nicky. I didn’t mean to just disappear on you.” She let go and gave a wobbly smile. “Things just have been really rough lately, and I don’t think Agatha wants me around anyways.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky stared at her for a long time before he whispered, “What happened between you two?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too much and not enough. “I’m going to leave it up to Agatha to decide what you know,” Rio said. “She’s your mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Nicky sighed. His shoulders curled in on himself as he shuffled his feet. He peered at her and asked, “But you’re back at the hospital now? You were gone for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’m back,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky gave a sharp nod. He bit his lip. Rio waited. Finally, he said, “Maybe you can help me with my math and biology homework sometime. Mom’s really bad at it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ignoring the way the mention of Agatha made her ache, Rio smiled and said, “I’d love to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them talked about what Nicky was learning in school for a moment before Rio finally excused herself to leave. Instead of heading straight home like she planned, she made the detour to go to </span>
<em>
<span>Pancho’s. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she walked in, Carol said, “I am not taking you home again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blushed and took a seat at the bar, saying, “I promise I’m just here for one drink.” She fidgeted with her fingers for a moment before she added, “Thanks, by the way. For that night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No problem,” Carol shrugged. She poured Rio some whiskey and slid it over. “Things any better now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Worse,” Rio sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Carol winced. She playfully pretended to try to take the whiskey away, but Rio laughed and held it out of reach. Carol chuckled and leaned against the back counter. She asked, “Want to talk about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not this time,” Rio said with a shake of her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carol eyed her for a moment then nodded. “Alright, well, let me know if you need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Left alone, Rio held glass between her hands and stared at the amber liquid. As she always did lately, when left alone with her thoughts, Rio thought about Agatha. She couldn’t get her words out of her head. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’ve let you treat me like your little play thing for too long… I can’t do this anymore.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew she messed up. It was just hard to figure out exactly when this mess really began. Was it her wedding night, when she was with Agatha for the first time? Or, was it even before that, when Rio agreed to this marriage at all? </span>
</p><p>
<span>The when didn’t really matter though. It just mattered that Rio had, in fact, messed up. She messed up with James, but more importantly to her, she messed up with Agatha. It had never been her intention to play with Agatha’s feelings, but looking back on the last few months, Rio knew that’s exactly what she’d done with her back-and-forth, her desire to have it all instead of just choosing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was impossible to deny this when Rio thought of Agatha’s expression that night. Angry, yes, but also undeniably hurt. Did it hurt because Agatha felt the same way? Rio tried not to dwell on the possibility, but she couldn’t help but wonder. It was stupid of her though. What did it matter if she felt the same way if Rio was still stuck in the same place, unable to do anything about it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio needed something to change, but she wasn’t sure what she could actually change. Or rather, what she was willing to change. Was she really ready to give up on this marriage, to come out of the closest, and to lose her family forever? The first two didn’t sound so bad, but the last made her chest feel so tight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even after all of this, Rio couldn’t let go of her family. They were her family. What was a family without sacrifice?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rubbing her temple, Rio could feel herself already beginning to spiral at the thought of her family. She needed someone to talk to, and there was only one person she knew who would understand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’d been months since she last saw Alice due to their schedules, but maybe it was time to finally catch up. All it took was a text, one that Alice responded to promptly and excitedly, and they were set to have a last-minute dinner at Alice’s tonight. The ease with which it happened made Rio feel guilty all over again. With everything that had been going on with Agatha and James, she hadn’t been a very good friend to Alice recently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just one mistake after another, it seemed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Although she stayed true to her word and only had one drink, Rio lingered at the bar until it was time for her to go to Alice’s. It was easier to sulk there than it was in the apartment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio made it to Alice’s place, her best friend threw open the door and exclaimed, “Rio!” Alice hugged Rio tightly, and it took everything in Rio not to burst into tears right then in there. Even though she managed not to, Alice could still tell something was wrong when she pulled back. She didn’t say anything though. She just smiled and said, “I got us pizza and wine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them made themselves comfortable on the couch, and Rio let Alice tell her all about what she’d been up to lately. It sounded like her friend was doing well. Work was okay, maybe even a promotion soon. She’d picked up the piano again; she was even thinking about buying one. There was even a woman she was seeing, someone sharp yet kind, that made Alice smile dopily. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you?” Alice asked with a knowing look. She poured Rio another glass of wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer at first, trying to find the words. “I, uh,” Rio tried, and to her embarrassment, she felt her throat close up. “Alice, I,” she tried again, and this time, her voice cracked. She shook her head and accepted the fact that there was no being brave or strong when talking about this. “Alice, I really fucked up this time,” Rio told her tearfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice reached out and held her hand. Her face was nothing but quiet understanding as she said, “Hey, whatever happened, you can talk to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, Rio finally talked to her about it. All of it. From the first dinner where she initially thought she hated Agatha, even as she was simultaneously attracted to her, to the affair, to their friendship, to its devastating end. Rio told her everything, even as she cried through all of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What hurt the most, she realized, was talking about the last month of it or so. It was then that Rio had felt the most at peace, the most at home, the most loved. She felt like she’d finally found a family after being used by her own, but by her own selfishness, she’d lost them. The irony wasn’t lost on her either. Rio was selfless enough to put herself into this mess for her family, but she was too selfish to go through the pain of getting herself out. Instead, she hurt Agatha and Nicky, and that was what hurt most of all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry you’ve been struggling with this alone,” Alice said. She had her arms around Rio now, hugging her close. “I’m not mad, I swear, but why didn’t you tell me about this sooner? You and Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was scared,” Rio said. She sniffled and accepted the tissue Alice handed her. “Even if I don’t love him, I still cheated, Alice, and that’s–” Rio sighed. “That doesn’t make it okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, if this friendship hinged on the fact that we never did anything wrong, this friendship would have ended back in college,” Alice replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but crack a smile. “The great cheating crisis of 2007,” she said solemnly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were so mad,” Alice recalled with a laugh. “I really thought you were never going to talk to me again after I told you about that test.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad I didn’t do that,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice gave her a gentle smile and hugged her tight again. She stayed like that until her arms were tired. When she pulled back, Alice asked, “So, what next? What do you want, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liar,” Alice said without missing a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled slowly and fought the urge to snap. Her voice was still angry, but it wasn’t rude as she said, “Fine. I want Agatha. And Nicky. I want things to go back to the way they were before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you don’t,” Alice said, shaking her head. “We all know that was never going to work out. Not the way you wanted it to.” She poked Rio’s forehead and said, “You’re not happy, and don’t give me that bullshit about how no one is happy. You’re miserable, Rio, and I don’t want you to lose yourself over this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too late for that,” Rio mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Alice sighed. “You are still the brilliant and kind and thoughtful person you were a year ago. You’ve just… hit a few bumps in the road.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio said dryly, “More like I drove full speed over them and careened out of control.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was trying to be gentle,” Alice said, but she was smiling gently. “This doesn't have to be the end, if you don’t want it to be. This life with James, this doesn’t have to be yours for the rest of your days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You make it sound so easy,” Rio groaned. She slumped back against the couch and dragged her hands over her face. “Imagine my parents’ reaction if I told them I was divorcing him. No, wait, I’m not just divorcing him, but I’m divorcing him because I’m gay.” Rio let her hands fall back into her lap and sighed. She grasped her wedding ring between her fingers, twisting it back and forth, as she said, voice small, “They’d be so disappointed in me.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice held her hand, but she didn’t say anything. Not at first. She seemed just as deep in thought as Rio. Eventually though, Alice said, “I think a lot about what my mom would’ve wanted for me. It’s hard to really know though. I don’t think I really knew her when I was younger, not the real her.” Alice took a deep breath and shook her head. “I try to think about what I do remember though. I know she loved music and dancing. I know she loved eating cold leftovers and hot coffee. Maybe I only want to remember the good stuff because she died, but I also like to think she loved seeing me happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not fair,” Rio argued quietly. “Your mom died in some freak accident at work because she was trying to save money for your college, Alice. Of course she wanted you to be happy. My parents chose to go into politics and marry me off to someone who’d help my dad’s connections. One is clearly more about the child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The jab was unfair, but Alice merely replied, “For all we know, my mom wanted me to go to college to become an accountant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, “Right, your hippie mom would have loved that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, my point is that I get it,” Alice said. She squeezed Rio’s hand and turned to face her. “Only daughter wants to do right by her parents because of everything they did for her and all the cultural implications that go along with that for us. Trust me when I say my therapist has had to beat that mentality out of me with a thousand hammers.” Rio smiled slightly, and Alice smiled back, earnest and sympathetic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And don’t get me wrong,” Alice continued. “I still think about doing my best to honor my mom every goddamn day, but I’ve realized I’m not going to do that by doing some bullshit that would make me miserable. I do right by my mom by living my life as best as I can by helping others and being happy. Because that’s all a parent should want at the end of the day. For their child to be happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The petulant part of Rio wanted to say it was different. Her parents were not like Lorna Wu. She held herself back though, mulling over Alice’s words. It sounded so obvious when she put it like that, but Rio also couldn’t help but feel like that wasn’t true for herself. If her parents really wanted her to be happy, wouldn’t they have let her marry someone else? Did they just not think she’d care if she married James? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed, throat feeling tight once more. Or, was it that they knew she wouldn’t be happy but convinced her to do it anyway? And if that was true, if her parents were not like Lorna Wu, did that mean they truly loved her at all? If Rio divorced James and ruined their plans, would they forgive her? And if they didn’t, did that mean they were in the wrong, not Rio?</span>
</p><p>
<span>A thousand questions swam through Rio’s mind, and Rio couldn’t even begin to fathom answering a fraction of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice seemed to sense this though. She squeezed her hand again. “Just think about it,” Alice told her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, but she knew that this was not something so easily considered. She needed space to figure all of this out for herself. This wasn’t something she could think about around James or even in their shared apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The perfect excuse to get away came in the form of an invitation two days later. Her Aunt Carla was turning sixty. She was having a big party to celebrate, and she wanted everyone in the family to come for the following weekend. Conveniently, Aunt Carla lived all the way in Texas. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Surrounded by the family she hadn’t seen in years wasn’t the ideal situation to think about possibly divorcing her husband, but it would have to do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio called her aunt to let her know she was coming and booked her flight to Texas that same night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end, something had to give.</span>

<p>
<span>Despite Rio’s insistence it was unnecessary, James drove her to the airport. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The car ride was silent. James didn’t even bother turning on the radio. Rio stared out the window, watching the scenery pass by, pretending that things weren’t so bad between them. They were though. Things had only gotten worse between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was hard to believe just a month or two ago that Rio and James lived happily together. They would eat meals together, and they would talk to each other. They would watch a movie every so often, and they would joke under their breaths at the events they attended. Whatever semblance of comfort and ease between them had been washed away with the photographs of Rio and the ensuing fallout. </span>
</p><p>
<span>These days, the two of them rarely spoke. When they did, it was usually when they were out together, putting on a show that hid away that fractured nature of their relationship. If they happened to try to talk to each other at home, it was awkward and stilted. The tension only ever seemed to grow, even when they tried their best to try to make things better. All they could feel was the mounting frustration at their relationship, one that couldn’t seem to work. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no going back for them, it seemed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio missed James more than she thought she would. He was her friend, despite it all, but now, she wondered if she was more like his enemy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As he parked at the passenger drop-off, James stared straight ahead as he said, “Have a safe flight. Text me when you land.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated with her hand on the door handle. She glanced at James and sighed. “I know this isn’t the best time, but we need to talk,” she said. She needed to get this off her chest before she left. “We’re both clearly unhappy, but we’ve never really had a real conversation about why or how to fix that. So we should do that. Talk. Instead of brooding like a couple of angsty teenagers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>James huffed quietly, a small laugh. Slowly, he turned to look at her. He studied her face for a moment before he managed a small smile. “You’re right,” James said. He reached out and laid his hand on her shoulder. He squeezed it and suggested tentatively, “We can talk when you get back?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds good,” Rio said, smiling back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Since her parents flew the day before, on Friday, Rio was alone for her flight. She didn’t mind though. Traveling with her parents was stressful, and being alone gave her the chance to do some reading. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she was settled in her seat on the plane, Rio ended up dozing off for the first half, but after she woke up, she grabbed her book from her backpack. It had been a while since she got to read for pleasure, but Rio was excited. The book she picked up, </span>
<em>
<span>Cantoras</span>
</em>
<span>, was set during the Uruguayan dictatorship and focused on a group of queer women finding each other during such a tumultuous time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flipped open to the first page, and in an instant, she was pulled into the world of the book, following the characters as they found their safe haven together. It made the rest of her flight go by quickly, almost too quickly, and Rio had to blink hard to reorient herself when the announcement came out that they would be landing soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After tucking her book away, Rio took a deep breath and mentally braced herself for the coming weekend. It was really only this evening and half of tomorrow, but she already knew it would be more than enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t remember the last time the whole family on her dad’s side came together. It must have been when Rio graduated medical school, almost four years ago. So much had happened since then, including one of her cousins having a child, and while the family was fairly good about texting about the big moments, it still wasn’t the same as seeing everyone in person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because her aunt, along with her grandparents, lived on a large plot of land far from the city, it took Rio over an hour to get there. When she finally arrived, the last thing she wanted was to be bombarded by family, but that was just how things went. Plus, Rio had missed them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Using her spare key, Rio let herself into the house. She barely shut the door behind her before a tiny body launched itself at her. Rio dropped her duffel bag in order to catch Sofia, eight years-old and so tall already, in her arms. She hugged the little girl tightly and exclaimed, “Look at you! You didn’t look this big over FaceTime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna be taller than you, Tía Rio,” Sofia told her with a wide, toothy grin. “Next time you see me, I’m gonna be eight feet tall.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eight feet?” Rio laughed. “What are your parents feeding you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lots of vegetables.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up as her oldest cousin joined them. Victor looked as he always did, broad shoulders with a carefully trimmed beard and cropped curls. Despite it just being a family get together, he still wore slacks and a button-up, something their other cousins undoubtedly already teased him for. Rio set Sofia down to hug him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“¿Estás bien?” Victor asked her. “We don’t hear much from you these days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Rio said. “Just busy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sofia tugged on Rio’s arm and said, “You’re supposed to say, ‘estoy bien’, Tía Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed while Victor explained, “We’ve been trying to teach Sofia more Spanish. Don’t want her to be like you or Gabriel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can speak Spanish,” Rio said defensively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet I never hear you speaking it unless it’s to our abuela,” Victor replied with a raised brow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit the inside of her cheek but said nothing else. She left her bag by the door and let Sofia pull her to the living room, where the rest of the family was. Victor’s wife sat on the couch with Gabriel and Miguel, brothers and Rio’s other cousins, while Rio’s grandmother sat on the other couch. In the kitchen, Rio could hear her parents with her aunts and uncles, probably finishing up with dinner. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look who’s finally here!” Miguel cheered, standing up. The same age as Rio, he was always her closest confidante at these things. It helped that he was so outgoing too, the perfect balance to Rio’s more quiet demeanor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio accepted Miguel’s hug with ease and said, “It’s good to see you.” She looked around and teased, “Still no girlfriend, I see. I bet your parents love that.” Miguel was blessed with his mother’s dark curls and his father’s green eyes, and from the moment he became aware of the fact that girls did in fact exist, he’d been wreaking havoc in the world of love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gabriel joined them, hugging Rio too. He was Miguel’s older brother, and when Victor wasn’t around, he took it upon himself to watch over them. His wife wasn’t here, but that wasn’t strange. His wife had no strong fondness for their family. “I was just talking to him about that,” Gabriel said. “Don’t you think it’s time for him to settle down?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Already?” Miguel gasped. He slung an arm around Rio and said, “We’re just hitting our prime, aren’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio’s married,” Gabriel reminded him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Miguel exaggeratedly looked around. “I don’t see a husband. Do you?” He grinned down at Rio and teased, “Where’s that gringo? Maybe if he came, Sarah would have come too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sarah had work,” Gabriel sighed, excusing his wife’s absence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, work,” Miguel drawled. “Just like she’s had work during every other family gathering. Nothing to do with the fact that she still can’t eat our food.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bennett is sick too, so either way, she wouldn’t have been able to come,” Gabriel added with a glare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Miguel pouted and pressed a hand to his chest. “Our poor Benito. How will he ever get better without mamá’s special soup?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gabriel’s face reddened, but Rio cut in before they could get into a fight already. “James is working,” Rio said. “So I guess I’ll be right there with Gabriel from now on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw, but it’s not nearly as fun giving you shit,” Miguel grinned. He ruffled her hair and said, “Come on. You look like you could use a drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me say hi to my parents first,” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Miguel gave her a salute and said, “And that’s why they always brag about you. Always with the manners and respect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He meant it teasingly, but Rio felt her smile grow strained anyway. She patted his back and slipped away to the kitchen. She greeted her aunts and uncles, pressing kisses to their cheeks as she went, until she found her parents by the pantry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luis noticed her first, shouting joyfully, “Rio!” He swept her into a tight hug and pressed a kiss to her forehead. “It’s been too long.” He pinched her cheek and said, “Tell your husband to give me less work, so I can see you more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed uncomfortably, but Luis didn’t notice. He passed her off to Paola, who hugged her just as tight, tutting, “Have you lost weight? You’re so skinny.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although she heard such comments all her life, Paola was actually right this time. Rio had lost several pounds thanks to the stress of the last few months. Rio just smiled though and said, “I’ve just missed your cooking. I’ll make sure to load up while I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can give you the recipes,” Paola told her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You always tell me it’s from YouTube,” Rio reminded her. “Or, you just make it up as you go, so you can’t actually tell me what’s in it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Trust your tongue,” Paola said, wagging her finger at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, “My tongue isn’t as well trained as yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then train it!” Paola said. “How else will you cook for James?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. With her filial greeting done, she slipped back out to the living room. “And there’s my favorite person!” Rio exclaimed dramatically. “Saved the best for last.” Her smile was wide as she sat down next to her grandmother, Claudia, looping her arm through hers. “Cómo estás?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<span>Mejor ahora que estás aquí,” Claudia said. </span>
<em>
<span>Better now that you’re here. </span>
</em>
<span>She patted Rio’s cheek and asked, “</span>
<span>Dónde estás tu esposo?” </span>
<em>
<span>Where’s your husband?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio refrained from making a face at the immediate question about James. “Esta trabajando,” Rio said. </span>
<em>
<span>He’s working.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Él debería estar aquí,” Claudia said in clear disapproval. </span>

<span>He should be here. </span>
</em>
<span>“Qué es más importante que tu familia?” </span>
<em>
<span>What’s more important than your family?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And wasn’t that the question? Rio leaned into her grandmother and said placatingly, “La proxima vez.” </span>
<em>
<span>Next time.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Claudia eyed Rio before she pinched the skin between her thumb and forefinger. Rio yelped and yanked her hand away. She rubbed it with a glare, but her grandmother stared at her, unrepentant. “¿Y tu familia? ¿Cuando me vas a dar otro bisnieto?” </span>
<em>
<span>And what about your family? When are you going to give me another great-grandchild?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“No sé,” Rio shrugged. </span>
<em>
<span>I don’t know. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“No sé,” Claudia scoffed. “¡Deberías estar diciendo pronto! ¡Lo más rápido posible!”  </span>
<em>
<span>You should be saying soon! As soon as possible!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded obligingly, but she was relieved when it was announced that dinner was finally ready. She helped Claudia to the table before she took her seat towards the other end of the table. She ended up between Sofia and Paola, with Miguel across from her. Initially, Rio was worried her mother would spend the entire dinner asking her about James, but to her relief, Sofia took up most of her attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the moment she was born, Rio adored Sofia, finally another girl in their family. Rio spoiled her as best as she could, FaceTiming her more often than she did any other family member. Talking to her now, Sofia reminded her of Nicky in a lot of ways, shy and thoughtful. It made her wonder what Nicky was like when he was younger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was he just as shy? Was he even shyer than he was now? What would it have been like watching him grow up, the way she had with Sofia?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wondered how often Agatha had these same kinds of thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The reminder of Agatha struck Rio suddenly. She felt her grip tighten around her fork as she forced herself to keep her breathing even. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even hundreds of miles away, Agatha seemed to invade Rio’s thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once again, Rio became aware of the dull ache that had never faded. It would always be there, as far as Rio was concerned, for as long as Rio didn’t have Agatha in her life. The melodramatics of the thought made her want to laugh, but deep down, Rio knew it was true. It just became more and more apparent to her the longer Rio thought about everything that had happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was her one true taste of freedom, her one safe space where Rio didn’t have to be anyone but herself. Not the perfect daughter. Not the perfect wife. Just Rio, imperfections and all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio didn’t want to lose that. She didn’t want to lose Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What an insane revelation to have at her family dinner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tía Rio, are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio startled so badly that she dropped her fork, sending it clattering to the floor. She blushed as everyone’s eyes went to her. She cleared her throat and said, “Sorry, I spaced out for a second.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Always with your head in the clouds,” Carla tutted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t breathe again until everyone went back to their conversations. She smiled down at Sofia, who still stared at her with concern. “I’m okay,” Rio assured her. “I was just thinking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About what?” Sofia asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, “Everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a lot to think about,” Sofia said. She cocked her head to the side then asked, “Do you think aliens are real?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of dinner went by without any issues, followed by cake and singing and celebrations. Carla blew out her candles, stating loudly that she wished for more children in the family, and both Rio and Miguel, the two cousins left without children, pointedly avoided her stare. It was nearly midnight when everyone went to bed, but as she laid down to sleep, Rio found herself wide awake. Her earlier realization still buzzed within her mind, making her think of scenario after scenario where she might be able to tell Agatha her feelings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After almost two hours of laying awake, Rio finally got up. She shrugged on a sweatshirt and padded down stairs to grab a glass of water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t expect to find anyone else awake at this hour, but to her surprise, the back door was open. Walking closer, she found her father sitting outside on the porch swing, whiskey in one hand and cigarette in the other. Rio wrapped her arms around herself and joined him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luis kept the whiskey to himself, but he handed Rio the cigarette as soon as she sat down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio still remembered the first time her father caught her smoking. She was already twenty-one and in college, visiting home over winter break. The stress of being back around family was too much for her though, so she’d slipped out into the backyard for a smoke. When Luis found her, he merely sighed and smiled begrudgingly, asking if she had another for him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a while, Luis held his hand out. Rio handed the cigarette back and watched him take another drag. With smoke curling from his mouth, Luis said, “We haven’t spoken in months. We used to talk more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re busy,” Rio said, but it was clear that even she didn’t think much of the excuse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, but that’s no excuse,” Luis said with a knowing look. He reached out and squeezed her knee. “I’ve missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her smile waver as she said, “I’ve missed you too, papi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luis smiled at that. In an effort to make Rio proficient in English, they stopped speaking Spanish to her when she was very young. She also wasn’t allowed to speak Spanish, but every so often, the habit would come back in small ways. Despite being the one to suggest the rule, Luis was also the one who indulged Rio more when she messed up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look tired,” Luis commented.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, “I am tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look unhappy,” Luis added, making Rio tense. He smiled knowingly and nudged her. “You can say it,” he said. “I don’t expect things to be perfect with you and James immediately.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned and stared out at the backyard. She wished she could go back in time to when she was ten, when her biggest concern was making the boys let her play soccer with them. Rio sighed again and rubbed her hands over her thighs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if it’s never perfect?” Rio asked softly. “What if we’re never happy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It hasn’t even been a year yet,” Luis replied. “Give it time.” He wrapped an arm around Rio now, hugging her to him. He kissed the side of her head and said, “I hope you can find happiness, no matter what happens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if I never love James?” Rio hadn’t meant to say that, but it was too late. She felt her father tense against her. She held her breath, waiting for his response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them sat in silence for several long moments before Luis finally said, a pained finality to his words, “I want you to be happy. Just… within reason, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio inhaled deeply, trying to will away the tears that gathered in her eyes. It was what she expected, so why did it still hurt so much to hear?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stumbled to her feet, ignoring her father calling after her. She ran up to her room and locked the door, feeling like a little kid again. She leaned against the door, sucking in shuddering breaths. Rio blinked hard as the tears finally fell. She slid down the door until she sat curled against it. She buried her face in her arms, trying to muffle her cries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A part of Rio, some naive, stupid part of herself, had hoped that her parents would be okay with the decision that had been brewing inside her mind over the last few weeks, but she knew now that they wouldn’t ever accept her after this. If Rio did this, she’d lose them, but wasn’t it already like she’d lost them? Rio rarely ever saw them anymore, and when she did, it was only ever about her marriage to James, never Rio herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wiping her tears away, Rio grabbed her duffel off the floor and started packing up her stuff. She couldn’t stay here, not after that. Not after realizing that she still wanted Agatha, even knowing her father wouldn’t love her anymore for it. The back-to-back realizations made it impossible for Rio to just stay here and act like everything was okay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The string that kept Rio tethered to her family had finally snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hoped the rest of her family would understand. Maybe not Victor, but maybe Miguel and Gabriel. God, she hoped Sofia would still be allowed to talk to her after this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Swallowing roughly, Rio slung her bag over her shoulder and headed straight out the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car she ordered came within minutes, and as soon as she was inside, Rio changed her plans to a red-eye flight. Undoubtedly, when she landed, Rio would be flooded by calls and texts from her family, but she couldn’t bring herself to care anymore. She was done caring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Rio got on the flight, she was exhausted from the emotional toll the last day had been. She fell asleep quickly and deeply, and she didn’t wake up until a flight attendant shook her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rubbing her eyes, Rio squinted at the rising sun and checked the time. It was already eight in the morning. She ignored the thirty missed calls and eighty text messages. She turned off her phone and walked to the nearest subway that would take her home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Trudging up the stairs, Rio couldn’t wait to be alone in the apartment. She’d shower then sleep for a few more hours before she figured out what she was going to say to James. She had no idea how she was even going to broach the subject, but they’d already agreed to talk when she got back. She was finally going to tell him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was Rio’s plan when she went to unlock her door, only for it to swing open and reveal Agatha on the other side. </span>

<p>Rio blinked a few more times. Was she dreaming? She rubbed her eyes, but no, Agatha was still there, staring at her with just as much shock. </p><p>“What,” Rio said, unsure of what she wanted to ask. She licked her lips.  Easiest question first. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Paperwork for Nicky. What are you doing here?” Agatha asked back. She held the door in a vice grip. “Aren’t you supposed to be in Texas?”</p><p>“Took an early flight back,” Rio said. She took a step forward then hesitated. “Agatha, what are you doing here?” She took another step closer, bringing her close enough that she could touch Agatha if she wanted. “Are you– Can we–” Rio took a deep breath, trying to gather her thoughts. “I need to talk to you.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her with wide eyes, trying to puzzle her out.</p><p>“Please,” Rio said. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry about everything, but I’m ready now.” She reached out and grabbed Agatha’s hand, nearly crying when she didn’t pull away. Maybe she hadn’t ruined things completely. She took a shaky breath and said, “I’m ready. I want to talk to James and–”</p><p>“Talk to me about what?”</p><p>Rio snapped her mouth shut, body stiffening so suddenly that she felt her heart lurch into her throat. She let go of Agatha’s hand and watched as James stepped out from around the corner, looking at her curiously. He was dressed for work with an undone tie hanging around his neck. Agatha must have caught him right before he left.</p><p>“Ready for what?” James asked. He glanced between the two of them and continued, “Wait, what are you doing home already? Your flight wasn’t supposed to land until tonight.” He stepped up beside Agatha. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“I took an earlier flight,” Rio repeated, looking between James and Agatha. Her mouth felt dry. Her head began to spin. This was not how she intended to do this at all. “I got into a fight with my dad.”</p><p>Realization dawned on Agatha’s face while James furrowed his brows, asking, “About what?” He shook his head and stepped back. “What are we doing, talking about this in the hall? Come on.” He took a few steps then looked at Agatha. “Are you staying?”</p><p>“Should I?” Agatha asked, but she wasn’t looking at James. She was looking at Rio. </p><p>Rio nodded and said quietly, “Please.”</p><p>James looked at them, and Rio could see his mind trying to understand what was happening. After a moment, he just turned and kept going to the living room. When he was far enough away, Rio stepped closer and said, “I’m going to tell him everything.”</p><p>“Everything?” Agatha repeated with a raised brow. “Are you sure about that?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said without hesitation. “If that’s okay with you.”</p><p>Agatha’s face softened, something like hope in her eyes. She nodded and brushed her hand against Rio’s. “Okay,” she said softly. “If you’re sure.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio murmured. “And I swear we can talk about everything later, starting with a thousand apologies from me.”</p><p>“I’ll hold you to that,” Agatha said, and the smile wasn’t quite the same as the one from before, but it was closer than anything Rio could have hoped for. “Come on.”</p><p>When they walked into the living room, they found James already sitting in one of the arm chairs. Rio swallowed and took a seat on the couch, relieved when Agatha sat down next to her. It certainly didn’t help the increasingly irritated, confused look on James’s face, but Rio felt better with Agatha’s support so tangible.</p><p>Rio folded her hands in her lap and took a deep breath. She began, speaking carefully, “James, you know I said I wasn’t in love with you, that I wasn’t sure if I’d ever be in love with you.”</p><p>“Yes, I know, Rio,” James said with a wave of his hand, “but I’m patient. I can–”</p><p>“I’m a lesbian,” Rio blurted out. She couldn’t sit back and listen to James give the same speech he always did when Rio said this. There was never going to be a someday for them, and he needed to understand that. Rio chanced a look at James’s face, finding it frozen in shock. Her heart thumped hard in her chest as she continued, “I never told my parents, so they set me up with you and–”</p><p>“And you married me anyways?” James cut her off. His tone was expectedly upset, but Rio still felt awful at how distraught he sounded.  “Knowing you’d never be able to love me?”</p><p>“There was no guarantee I’d ever love you, even if I was straight,” Rio tried to reason.</p><p>James just shook his head and said, “That’s different.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure it was, but she just took another deep breath and said, “There’s more.”</p><p>“More?” James said.</p><p>Rio hesitated and glanced at Agatha. </p><p>James saw this and laughed bitterly, “What, Agatha knew you were into women before me?”</p><p>Rio bit her lip. She cleared her throat and said, “In a way, yes.”</p><p>“What do you mean, ‘in a way’?” James said.</p><p>“Well,” Rio began, but the rest never came. She thought she’d have more time. She thought she’d have an opportunity to word this as nicely as possibly, so it wouldn’t hurt so much. All the ways to say this rang in Rio’s head, but she couldn’t bring herself to actually say them out loud. Rio looked to Agatha again, brown eyes wide with desperation. Agatha sighed.</p><p>“We slept together, James,” Agatha finally said, losing patience. “Several times, at the beginning of your marriage. Rio ended things after a few months because she couldn’t handle the guilt. Nothing’s happened since then.”</p><p>James looked like he’d been struck. He blinked dazedly before he stood up. “Months?” James said under his breath. He began to pace wildly, dragging his hands over his face </p><p>Agatha bit her lip and said, “James–”</p><p>James held up a hand, and to Rio’s surprise, Agatha stopped. “This can’t be happening,” James said, a hint of hysteria entering his voice. “I’m not an idiot. I would have known if Rio was cheating. I would have known if it was with you!”</p><p>Rio could see the way Agatha seemed to be physically restraining herself from pointing out that he didn't know though.</p><p>“I thought this was about losing a friend!” James exclaimed. “Not, not–” He looked at Agatha, his face full of poison. “I can’t believe you.” He looked at Rio now, and where there’d been a kind of resignation with Agatha, there was nothing but betrayal for Rio. “And you. Was it all a lie then? Every time you were nice? Every time you listened to me complain about work or family? Was it just you keeping me happy so you could fuck my sister?”</p><p>Rio deserved it, but she still shut her eyes at the accusation. When she opened them again, both James and Agatha were on their feet.</p><p>“Watch your mouth,” Agatha hissed. </p><p>“Stay out of this,” James snapped. “Thanks to you my marriage is over.” He tried to walk away.</p><p>“You don’t even love her!” Agatha shouted. She stepped in front of him before he could leave the living room. “What right do you have to be upset?”</p><p>“What right?” James laughed, but it was strangled and furious and cruel. “I think I have every right to be upset that my wife and my sister were fucking behind my back!” He ran a hand through his hair, and Rio felt her heart stutter at how much like Agatha he looked with just one simple move. “You’re not supposed to fuck your brother’s wife,” James said before lowering his voice and adding, “I thought you had at least that much decency.”</p><p>“Don’t do that,” Agatha said, voice trembling. She pointed an accusing finger at James. “Don’t act like this is all my fault.”</p><p>“Isn’t it?” James snapped. He stepped into her space so that her finger was pressed hard against his chest. “You always ruin everything!”</p><p>“You always get everything!” Agatha screamed. </p><p>A deafening silence followed, and although Rio was acutely aware of the way Agatha shook with barely contained rage, she also couldn’t look away from James’s expression, anger and confusion melding together. Did he never realize how deep Agatha’s own resentment ran?</p><p>“You always get everything,” Agatha repeated, her voice cracking on the last word. Her hand curled into a fist that rested against his chest. “The oldest, the boy, the perfect child that our parents always wanted.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask for any of that,” James argued.</p><p>Agatha laughed hollowly, “But you got it all anyways, didn’t you?” To this, James had no response. “How do you think it felt growing up? I was the spare, and to make matters worse, I was a girl.”</p><p>“You didn’t make things any easier for yourself by acting out,” James said.</p><p>“And where would that have gotten me?” Agatha said. “Married off to the highest bidder?” As soon as the words left her mouth, Rio flinched. Agatha wasn’t even looking at her, but she still spun around, eyes wide. “Wait, Rio. I didn’t mean–”</p><p>“We’ll talk about it later,” Rio said quietly. She stood up and met James’s gaze evenly. She said, “Don’t blame her for everything, James. She didn’t make me do anything I didn’t want to.”</p><p>“This is what she does, Rio,” James insisted. “I told you that. She always has to break the rules. It doesn’t matter who gets hurt as a result.”</p><p>The way James spoke so callously about Agatha sent a wave of fury through Rio. “Don’t talk about other people getting hurt when you’ve never given a damn when your parents hurt Agatha,” Rio snapped.</p><p>“What the hell are you talking about?” James said, shaking his head a little as if to wave the notion off.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio in surprise too.</p><p>Rio hadn’t intended on bringing this up, but there was no going back now. She took a slow step closer and said, “Did you even try to reason with your parents when they signed Agatha’s rights to Nicky away?” Both James and Agatha startled, but Rio kept going. “Or, even now, when you’re at dinner with Evanora, do you ever say anything to stop her from treating Agatha like she’s nothing but a failure? Or, do you just let Evanora treat her like she’s a piece of shit because it’s easier than fighting? Than actually doing something about it?”</p><p>“Agatha’s a big girl,” James said, condescension and defensiveness all wrapped up in one. “She can defend herself.”</p><p>“You’re her brother!” Rio shouted. She finally moved close enough to shove James hard. He only stumbled a little, and before Rio could do more, Agatha’s hand caught her arm, holding her back. Rio’s face felt hot as she finally got to say what had been bothering her for months. Again, Rio was reminded that she never could quite handle it when Agatha was the one being hurt. Shaking her head, Rio spat, “You talk about protecting Agatha growing up, but what’s the point if you aren’t going to defend her now?”</p><p>James stared at her in bewilderment before he let out a loud, incredulous laugh. “Are you kidding me?” James said. “Agatha’s the one who fucking ruined a marriage, our marriage, but I’m the bad guy here?”</p><p>“Our marriage wasn’t real,” Rio said harshly. “Stop acting like we said those vows for anything more than political gain. I know that. You know that. Everyone fucking knows that.”</p><p>James regarded her for a moment. His lips twisted into a humorless smile. “Yeah, well, real or not, it was a marriage, Rio,” James said. “One that you agreed to. One that you said vows for. Maybe your word doesn’t count for shit, but mine does. I married you, and I meant it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say to that, feeling his sharp words like knives to her chest. Her throat felt tight as if he held his hand around it. When she said nothing, James scoffed and grabbed his keys, leaving without another word. </p><p>When the door shut behind him, Rio felt the adrenaline drain out of her. She swayed for a moment before she stumbled back to the couch and sat down. She stared blankly ahead of her, and only when Agatha came into her view that Rio felt tears well up in her eyes. She ducked her head as she choked out a sob. She went to bury her face in her hands, but suddenly, Agatha was there. She cradled the back of Rio’s head and held her against her, letting Rio bury her face in her stomach.</p><p>Rio’s cries were painful and loud. There were too many emotions that seemed to spill out of her. She felt awful to see her marriage end like this, but she was also relieved and vindicated to finally be free of it. Rio never though she’d be brave enough to fight for herself.</p><p>Her hands curled around Agatha’s shirt as Rio pressed her face against the soft muscle of her stomach, feeling safe to cry as much as she needed to. Agatha gently ran her fingers through her hair, and when Rio’s tears began to subside, she became faintly aware of the face that Agatha was humming.</p><p>When her breathing finally evened out, Rio pulled back enough to look up at her. Agatha was already looking at her, and it was with a tender stare that she cupped Rio’s face and stroked her cheeks with her thumbs.</p><p>“That was really stupid,” Agatha told her.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said. The words slipped out so naturally. Why had she waited so long for this? Agatha’s expression didn’t change, but Rio could feel the way her hands twitched against her face. “I love you,” Rio repeated. Her voice was hoarse. She sounded terrible. It didn’t matter though. “I just need you to know that. I love you so much, and I’m so sorry for everything I did to hurt you.”</p><p>“You weren’t joking about those thousand apologies, were you?” Agatha replied with a gentle smile. Her fingers were gentle against her blotchy, hot skin. She said nothing for a moment.</p><p>Rio felt herself grow vulnerable at the realization that Agatha might not say it back, but before she could panic too badly, Agatha leaned down and kissed her lightly on the lips. “I love you too,” Agatha whispered. One of her hands reached out to brush over Rio’s forehead before she kissed her there too. </p><p>“Will you still have me?” Rio asked. She rubbed at the tears on her face, wishing she looked like less of a wreck for this. “I know I messed up, and I ran, and I hurt you, but Agatha, if you just give me one more chance, I swear I’ll–”</p><p>Agatha cut her off with another soft kiss on her lips. “Of course,” Agatha murmured. She rested her forehead against hers and sighed. “Of course I still want you.”</p><p>The two of them stayed like that for a few moments, drinking in their new reality. When Agatha pulled away, she met Rio’s gaze. Her blue eyes were bright, as always, but they seemed to be shining now, like an ocean bathed in sunlight. It was all love.</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said. She grabbed a tissue box from nearby and let Rio clean herself up. When she was done, Agatha kissed Rio’s forehead. </p><p>Rio tilted her head up, silently asking for more. She nearly sighed in relief when Agatha kissed her on the lips. </p><p>“I know we have a lot to talk about,” Agatha said. They both laughed at the vast understatement that was. Agatha smiled and let her nose bump against Rio’s. “I know that, but can we save that for later? Can we just enjoy this moment first?”</p><p>Rio thought about it. They did need to talk, but Agatha was right. It could wait. Besides, the thought of another emotional conversation so soon made Rio want to curl up and pass out. Not to mention, Agatha was right here, within reach in a way she hadn’t been in months.</p><p>“Kiss me,” Rio said.</p><p>When Agatha kissed her, Rio could feel the difference in this kiss. It wasn’t that Agatha wasn’t passionate or gentle previously, but Rio could tell that she wasn’t holding back anymore. She kissed Rio with everything she had, but she also kissed her slowly, knowing for the first time that there was no rush.</p><p>They kissed like that for a while, drinking in the fact that they could just do this now, and Rio only pulled away when she felt Agatha begin to shift uncomfortably from having to bend down. </p><p>“Bedroom?” Rio asked. She watched Agatha’s eyebrows draw together before she realized why she might be hesitating. “There’s a spare bedroom.” At this, Agatha nodded immediately. She stood up and held out her hand. Rio took it and guided her down the hall.</p><p>Rio had only been in the spare bedroom once or twice during the entirety of her marriage, so all she knew was that there was a bed. That was all that really mattered to her at the moment though. </p><p>As soon as they were inside the bedroom, Rio pushed Agatha onto the bed and climbed on top of her. She tangled her fingers in her long hair as she kissed her again, eagerly swallowing every moan and whine that left Agatha’s lips. It’d been so long since Rio had heard anything like it, and although she’d done her best to memorize the sounds, they were nothing in comparison to the real thing. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio sighed as the other woman began to press kisses down her jaw and neck. She gasped when she felt Agatha nip gently at her neck before biting down harder. Her eyes fluttered shut, and her fingers tightened around her hair. She’d never done that before. She hadn’t been able to. “Again,” Rio told her. Agatha pulled back, swollen lips and wide eyes, and Rio had to resist the urge to kiss her. “Do it again,” Rio said. “Mark me. Make me yours.”</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, looking emotional for a moment, before she leaned forward and kissed Rio’s neck again. She moved a little lower, hovering at the base of her neck, before she sucked another bruise into the skin. Rio let out a low moan at this one, grinding down against her.</p><p>When Agatha moved away this time, she wrapped her hands around Rio’s wrists. She carefully pulled them from her hair. With an aching gentleness, she brushed light kisses along Rio’s fingertips. She gazed at Rio from under her eyelashes. “Can I?” Agatha asked, running her thumb over the rings.</p><p>Rio had never taken her wedding or engagement rings off, not even when she was with Agatha previously. She’d always been afraid she’d forget to put them back on. Agatha had never said anything about it, but sometimes, Rio would catch her staring at the rings. The best Rio could do at the time was twist it so the diamond faced inward, making it less glaringly an engagement ring with a wedding band.</p><p>There was no need for that anymore though.</p><p>“Please,” Rio whispered. </p><p>Agatha took her time sliding off the rings. Once they were off, she inspected them for a moment before carelessly tossing them across the room. Rio didn’t even care, hearing the clatter of the rings hitting the floor. All she could think about was Agatha’s lips meeting hers again as Agatha’s hands pulled at her shirt.</p><p>The two of them switched between frenzied and leisured in their touches. It was exciting and maddening to finally touch each other after all this time, but it was also special this time. This was their first time with no secrets. This was their first time where Rio was no longer hiding.</p><p>Agatha finally laid beneath her, naked and beautiful, staring up at Rio like she was something precious. She ran her fingers over Rio’s face and down her body, reverent and careful. Rio wished she could hear her thoughts.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha smiled, “I love you too.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but feel a little greedy as she touched Agatha, teasing her with one finger before she used two and stretched her with three. She watched, mesmerized, as Agatha writhed beneath her with an increasing sense of urgency and desire. Her belly button piercing, a dark emerald, glinted with every move. Her blue eyes glazed over, and her mouth fell open, unable to stop the desperate moans that escaped her. Her nails scratched down Rio’s back, and it was almost the best feeling in the entire world, second only to fucking Agatha with her tongue. </p><p>“I’ve missed you,” Agatha said as she pulled Rio back up to kiss her. Their kisses were messier now, the dam between them finally broken. They’d done slow for long enough, and now they wanted more. As Agatha rolled Rio onto her back, she knew that Agatha wanted to devour her. It reminded Rio of her wedding night. “I’ve missed you so much.”</p><p>As Agatha fucked her hard and fast with two fingers and her thumb on her clit, her mouth ravaged Rio’s body. Every inch of skin that Agatha could get her mouth on was kissed, bitten, and sucked until Rio’s body was a constellation of Agatha’s love. With every mark, Rio felt like she was floating just a little higher. She was Agatha’s and no one else’s.</p><p>Eventually, when they were deliriously sated, limbs heavy, they curled into each other’s arms. Rio tucked her head under Agatha’s chin and sank into her warm hold. She’d almost forgotten how perfect this felt. How safe. How right. </p><p>Rio’s eyes fell shut as Agatha traced shapes against her back. She could feel Agatha humming more than she could hear it, faint vibrations against where she laid. She liked it. Rio clung closer and wished she could stay like this forever.</p><p>“Sleep,” Agatha told her gently. Her voice was low and soothing. “We can talk when you wake up.”</p><p>“Sleep with me,” Rio said. Her words were slurred. She was already half-asleep. “Stay.”</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Agatha replied.</p><p>And it was perhaps those words that allowed Rio to finally drift to sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>When Rio woke up, she had no idea what time it was. All she knew was that there was sunlight and Agatha. The latter made Rio smile. She could feel Agatha pressed up behind her, arms holding her close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha said, voice hushed. “You’re awake.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a sleepy hum. Her eyes shut once more, only to snap back open when she felt Agatha’s fingers trailing along her thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh,” Agatha murmured. “Just let me touch you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A quiet moan left Rio’s lips at that. Still only half-awake, Rio felt drunk on the realization that this was real. They were really together now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She parted her legs to Agatha’s hand and tilted her head back as Agatha dragged her tongue along her neck. A rush of heat spread through Rio’s body as Agatha’s hand slid into her panties. Despite just having Agatha’s fingers in her a few hours ago, Rio was desperate to feel them again. Agatha teased her though, only circling her clit with lazy strokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio whined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked against her skin. With her other hand, she guided Rio’s face towards hers, kissing her slow yet deep, tongue wicked against Rio’s like she wanted to claim every inch of her mouth. Rio whined again, shifting her hips to get Agatha to do something else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha teased her for another minute before she finally slid a finger inside her. Rio panted against her lips, eyes falling shut at the sensation. “More,” Rio breathed. To her relief, Agatha did just that, adding another finger and ducking her head to kiss her neck. “Agatha,” Rio moaned. Her hips moved of their own accord, desperate to take Agatha’s fingers deeper and deeper until Rio felt like she might snap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re so beautiful like this,” Agatha whispered against her skin. She gave a sharp nip. “Mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bold claim made Rio come, body going taut as pleasure hit her in waves. Trembling whimpers left her lips as Agatha dragged out the orgasm as long as she could, mouth hot against Rio’s neck. When Agatha finally pulled her hand away, Rio opened her eyes just in time to see Agatha suck her fingers into her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come here,” Rio murmured. She turned and kissed Agatha, open-mouthed and filthy, moaning at the taste of herself on her tongue. “Let me return the favor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Rio’s hand slipped into Agatha’s shorts, they both moaned at just how wet she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Rio groaned. “I need to taste you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded fervently and shifted onto her back. She propped herself up on her elbows to watch as Rio sank between her legs and yanked her underwear off. Rio met her eyes and offered a crooked grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gorgeous,” Rio told her. She pressed a kiss to her calf. “Beautiful.” She pressed another kiss to the side of her knee. “Stunning.” She kissed her thigh. “Mine.” She kissed Agatha right on her clit, a light one that made Agatha twitch. Rio grinned up at her, affectionate yet lustful all at once. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Think we’ll ever get tired of it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tired of what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head and smiled. “Calling each other ‘mine’.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t even hesitate. “Never.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a flash of Agatha’s pleased, little grin, right before Rio ran her tongue over her and turned it into a lip bite. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even though Rio had eaten her out earlier, it still hadn’t been enough. Rio buried her face between Agatha’s thigh like she was starving, laving her with her tongue over and over until her jaw was sore and her face was slick. It didn’t matter. Every time Agatha came, her legs would tighten around Rio’s head and give her a rush. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio began working Agatha up to her third orgasm when fingers tangled in her hair, pulling her away. Rio blinked a few times to reorient herself. Her eyes wandered back up to Agatha’s face, finding it flushed and slack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Smiling fondly, Rio got up and went to the bathroom. She cleaned herself off and brought a towel to Agatha, who accepted it with a grateful smile. When she was done, she tossed the towel aside and held her arms out to Rio. It was nice to settle back into Agatha’s arms, and Rio relished in the feeling of their bodies pressed together, of Agatha’s heartbeat against her ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After laying like that for a while, Rio lifted her head just enough to meet Agatha’s eyes. She brushed her fingers over Agatha’s cheek and pushed her hair away from her face. “Is it time to talk now?” Rio asked, barely above a whisper. She didn’t want to ruin the fragility of the moment with a loud voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess we should,” Agatha agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me go first then,” Rio said. She sat up, hugging the sheet to her chest. With her other hand, she found Agatha’s and held it tight, intertwining their fingers. She took a deep breath. “I already said it, but I’ll say it as many times as I can,” Rio said. “I’m sorry for all the hurt and pain I caused you, Agatha. I let my fears and shame control me, and I hurt you in the process.” Rio sighed and squeezed her hand. “You didn’t deserve that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her for a moment before she murmured, “Thank you.” She squeezed her hand back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for giving me another chance,” Rio replied. “I know you didn’t have to do that, but I promise I will do everything to deserve this second chance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful,” Agatha said with a faint smile. “I could almost believe you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to,” Rio said. It was a quick response, and she smiled at the way Agatha startled. She lifted their hands and pressed a kiss to the back of Agatha’s. “I wouldn’t blame you, if you didn’t, but I’ll prove it to you either way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up and shifted closer. She kissed Rio's shoulder before she rested her chin on it. “I’m sorry too,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what?” Rio said. She leaned back, trying to meet her gaze, but Agatha only pressed closer. Her face was hidden against Rio’s neck with her hair creating a curtain between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What I said to James,” Agatha mumbled. “About being sold to the highest bidder.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay, Agatha,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not,” Agatha said forcefully. She moved away now, glaring at her. “I don’t want you to think that’s how I see you.” She hesitated, several emotions flitting across her face. She sighed and shook her head. Her eyes closed for a moment, and when she opened them, they were full of remorse. “I have always understood why you married James, even if I didn’t agree, and what I said was done so in the heat of the moment. I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that. You didn’t deserve to get dragged into my fight with James at all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have issues that go beyond me,” Rio said, smiling when Agatha muttered, “Understatement.”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t fault you for that,” Rio continued. “God knows I have my own. I think I just exacerbated them for both of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in agreement. She kissed Rio’s cheek and rested her head on her shoulder, stroking Rio’s arm. The two of them stayed like that for a moment before Agatha asked, “Is it wrong that I’m glad that we still met though? Despite all of it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad too,” Rio said. She pulled away to cup Agatha’s face and tilt it up towards her own. She kissed her lightly and rested her forehead against hers. “I’m in, Agatha,” Rio told her softly. “I’m all in. You, Nicky, everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have us,” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew there was still more to talk about, but this was enough for now. There would be time for that later. She leaned forward and kissed Agatha again, sliding her hand into her hair to cradle her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This kiss was different from those before it, slow yet passionate. Heated yet tender. A promise. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held Agatha close and sighed against her lips, still relishing in the feel of their bare skin touching. As they kissed, Rio’s mind wandered back to their last fight, and it was then that she remembered something they hadn’t talked about yet. Something important.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” Rio said, pulling away. There was no way they were cheating again, was there? “What about that woman?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was only somewhat paying attention, eyes still trained on her lips. “What woman?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The redhead!” Rio exclaimed. “The one in the article.” The one they fought over, the one that replaced her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At this, Agatha blinked a few times, as if remembering she even existed. “That’s Wanda,” Agatha said slowly. Her eyes darted away. She shifted uneasily. Agatha bit her lip, looking every bit as guilty as a child did when they’re caught. “She’s just a friend. My best friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took a moment for Rio to recognize the name, but the moment she did, she felt like a complete and utter idiot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>During the affair, Agatha would often speak of the past, but she rarely divulged her current life. Rio hadn’t thought much of it at the time, assuming that Agatha liked to reminisce with someone from their circle who wasn’t so tightly connected to her worser memories. Now, it seemed, the absence of anything current was more intentional than she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Occasionally though, Agatha would mention a friend or coworker here and there. Rio was sure Agatha had mentioned Wanda before, along with a woman named Jen. They’d been such offhand comments though that Rio hadn’t thought much of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re not…” Rio trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said gently. She pulled Rio back to her. “We’re just friends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you let me think that you were more,” Rio said, a touch petulant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled slightly. “Can you blame me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As much as Rio wanted to, she could admit that she probably deserved it. “No,” she sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re cute when you’re jealous,” Agatha teased. She kissed the corner of Rio’s lips. “There’s nothing to be jealous of though. Wanda is a good friend, but that’s all she is. She’s actually been helping with Nicky, you know.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help the stab of jealousy she felt, hot and sharp, like a knife slid right between her ribs. It wasn’t just jealousy over Agatha, but now it was Nicky too. Although they had seen each other at the hospital, it wasn’t the same anymore. She thought of their talks in the hospitals, the fun exchanges over books and stories about Agatha. He’d accused her of abandoning them, abandoning </span>
<em>
<span>him</span>
</em>
<span>. Would he welcome her back if he had Wanda now?</span>
</p><p>
<span>There must have been something in her expression because Agatha said, “Why don’t we go back to mine and see him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You left him alone?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced, “No, Wanda is with him.” Rio’s expression must have changed because she hurried to explain, “I asked her to stay with him. He actually wanted to come with me here, but I didn’t want him to hear about all the details on how we got the guardianship paperwork done so quickly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forced herself to take a deep breath. There was no reason to take her own petty jealousy out on Agatha. She should be glad both Agatha and Nicky had support during the last few weeks. Rio took another breath. “Okay,” Rio said, voice even. “Let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In mutual agreement, they showered before leaving, and although they showered together, they were well-behaved besides a few stolen kisses. Rio covered up all of her obvious marks with some make-up before she changed into sweatpants and a t-shirt, lending a similar set of clothes to Agatha. Rio couldn’t help but smile at the sight of her in her clothes and kissed her tenderly before they left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was that for?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and shrugged, “No reason.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held Agatha’s hand firmly in hers as they left, and although it occurred to her that someone may be watching and taking photos, she couldn’t bring herself to care. It only made her hold Agatha’s hand tighter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them slid into the backseat of Agatha’s town car, and it was there that Rio allowed herself to relax a little. She rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder, humming contently when Agatha stroked the back of her hand with her thumb. During the car ride, Agatha explained to her quietly what she’d been up to with work the last few weeks, and although Rio tried to listen, she was more focused on the low melody of Agatha’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio must have fallen asleep again because the next thing she knew was Agatha waking her up to go up to her apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio mumbled, rubbing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed her forehead and said, “It’s okay. You’ve had a tough couple of days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hand-in-hand still, the two of them let themselves into the apartment. No one rushed to greet them at the door, but then again, Nicky wasn’t a little kid, and he wouldn’t know Rio came back with Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they walked into the living room, they saw Nicky and Wanda sitting on the couch, watching something. Rio couldn’t help but laugh when Nicky did a double take at the sight of her. He leapt off the couch with an excited, “Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just like at the hospital, he threw his arms around her in an awkward hug, but Rio didn’t hesitate this time. She hugged him back tightly, feeling the full weight of just how much she’d missed this boy. When he pulled away, Rio wondered if he’d grown taller in the short time since she last saw him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Nicky,” Rio said softly. She reached up and ruffled his hair, smiling when he batted her hand away with a roll of his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky glanced between her and Agatha and asked, “Are things good between you now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio said, looking at Agatha. She met her gaze with a small smile. She turned back to Nicky and said, “We’re still working on some things, but I’ll definitely be around more now.” She took an unsteady breath and added, “I’m divorcing James.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes went wide as he whispered, “Holy shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Language,” Agatha scolded, and Rio couldn’t help but grin at how much like a mom she sounded like.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think this warrants a curse word or two,” Nicky replied. He looked at Rio with a wide grin and said, “But really, you’re divorcing him? Like, for real?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio laughed. “For real.” She squeezed Agatha’s hand and stepped closer to her until their shoulders brushed. “It was time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to marry Mom then?” Nicky asked. “Is this like a two-for-one mom deal with the guardianship?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A deep scarlet bloomed across Rio’s face at the thought of marrying Agatha. Still, images flickered through her mind of Agatha in a white dress, sliding a finger onto Rio’s hand. She imagined feeding each other cake and dancing together, surrounded by warm lights. She imagined going home with Agatha, knowing that they were each other’s forever. Rio’s chest ached at the idea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio glanced at the other woman, she found Agatha with a similar blush on her face as she exclaimed, “Nicky!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky was his mother’s son though, so he just grinned and said, “What? Too soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although they hadn’t let go of each other’s hand, Rio and Agatha were pointedly not looking at each other as Wanda joined them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was just as pretty as she was in the article, probably even prettier, with silky hair and green eyes. She was dressed more casually in jeans and a t-shirt, but even in that, Wanda was still pretty. It was hard to believe that Agatha would never try something with her, but then again, Agatha hadn’t said that. She just said they currently wouldn’t. Rio made a mental note to ask about that at a later date.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, this is Rio,” Wanda said. Her tone was wildly unimpressed, and Rio tried not to feel too offended. She could only imagine what Wanda had heard about her from Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wore a polite smile as she said, “And you’re Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve heard a lot about you,” Wanda said, confirming Rio’s previous thought. She didn’t return Rio’s smile, instead eyeing her as if Rio were a rabid animal that might bite if provoked. Rio was going to have a hell of a time getting on her good side after all of this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish I could say the same,” Rio said, her smile growing strained. She felt a petty triumph when Wanda frowned at that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As if sensing the tension, Nicky nudged Rio and said, “Rio, want to see the bookshelf Mom got me? It’s all old and fancy. I can show you some of my new books too. Have you read</span>
<em>
<span> The Hunger Games</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped at the chance to separate them. She said, “I’ll walk Wanda out while you do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted to be annoyed, but she found it weirdly endearing that Agatha and Nicky were able to work together so seamlessly now, even if it was against her. Or was it for her? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Following Nicky to his bedroom, she realized this was her first time seeing it since he properly moved in. Although Agatha had been very careful to make sure it wasn’t too clinical or cold with the decor, there was just something about seeing all of Nicky’s personal things strewn across the desk and shelves that made it feel so much more alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky led her to a wooden bookcase in the corner, and just as he said, it was old and fancy. It looked like a solid mahogany, filled to the brim with different books. Rio ran her hand over the side and nodded along as Nicky explained his organization. Apparently, there was a hierarchy with his favorite books at the top and his least favorite at the bottom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your mom’s going to have to buy you another one soon at this rate,” Rio commented. She picked up a book titled </span>
<em>
<span>A Tale for the Time Being </span>
</em>
<span>and flipped through it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She already ordered one,” Nicky replied, making Rio laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them stood in silence for a moment as Rio looked through his books and Nicky watched her, but eventually, Nicky said, “I’m glad you’re back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up from the book she was holding and smiled faintly. “Me too,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to move in with us?” Nicky asked. “Since you’re divorcing James.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was a good question, one that Rio hadn’t considered yet. Then again, it hadn’t even been twenty-four hours since their talk. Hell, it hadn’t even been twelve hours yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Rio said. “Maybe. I’ll have to talk to Agatha about it and see if she’d be okay with me crashing here until I figure things out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky snorted, “If she’d be okay with it? Rio, I think Mom would keep you here forever if she could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted to ask just what Agatha had told him, but it felt like an underhanded way to know what Agatha had gone through when they were apart. She’d ask her about it later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them were still looking through the books when Agatha appeared in the doorway, looking a little flustered. Rio raised a brow, but Agatha just shook her head. “How’s a movie and take-out for dinner sound?” Agatha asked, directing the question more to Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Nicky shrugged. He looked at Rio. “Want to watch a scary movie? Mom hates them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas,” Agatha huffed, making the other two laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky smirked and slipped past her to set up the movie while Rio joined her in the doorway and wrapped an arm around her waist. She stood close and smiled as Agatha’s eyes dropped down to her lips. It felt strange to just be able to do this now, but it also just felt so incredibly right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry,” Rio teased. “You can hold my hand the whole time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Watch it,” Agatha murmured. “Or else you’ll spend your first night here on the couch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and kissed her lightly on the lips. She took her hand and tugged her out towards the living room. “That’s a risk I’m willing to take,” Rio said, and when she glanced back at her, she found Agatha looking at her with such tender affection that she felt her cheeks go pink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she sat down on the couch with Nicky on one side and Agatha on the other, Rio felt like she was finally home. </span>

<p>As Agatha let out a quiet shriek, face half-hidden in Rio’s shoulder, Rio couldn’t help but marvel at how content she felt.</p><p>The afternoon was spent with just the three of them: Rio, Agatha, and Nicky. With Nicky huddled up on one end of the couch and Rio and Agatha curled up on the other end, they watched movie after movie, only moving for restroom breaks or food. It was easy with them, and Rio forgot how nice it was when things were easy. There was no posturing, no second-guessing. It was just Agatha’s sarcastic commentary and Nicky’s periodic fun facts. </p><p>The fact that Agatha really did hate scary movies just made everything even better.</p><p>Rio didn’t particularly like scary movies either, but she certainly didn’t jump and tense the way Agatha did. By the second scary movie, Agatha was more or less in Rio’s lap, glaring at Nicky every time he laughed at her. </p><p>“Are you going to have nightmares tonight?” Rio asked under her breath. She chuckled when Agatha pinched her thigh in response. Rio pressed a kiss to the side of Agatha’s head and said, “Don’t worry, baby. I’ll protect you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even realize what she’d said until Agatha pulled back, cheeks pink and eyes wide. They’d never called each other that outside of bed before. </p><p>“Sorry,” Rio said quickly. “If you don’t like that–”</p><p>“No,” Agatha cut her off quietly. She bit her lip and peered at Rio with a kind of earnest vulnerability that made Rio’s stomach flip. “I like it.”</p><p>Rio smiled and filed that reaction away for later. She leaned in to kiss Agatha properly when a piece of popcorn hit the side of her face. Rolling her eyes, Rio pulled away and turned to playfully glare at Nicky, who held the bowl of popcorn with comically wide eyes.</p><p>“You’re supposed to be watching the movie,” Nicky told them. “Not making eyes at each other.”</p><p>“Give us a break,” Rio sighed dramatically. “We’re finally, officially together. We should be allowed to be sappy and gross for a while.”</p><p>“Sure,” Nicky agreed without hesitation. “Just not in front of me.”</p><p>Rio sighed again but said, “Fair enough.” She stood up and stretched her arms over her head. She grinned when she caught Agatha staring at where her shirt had ridden up. She flicked Agatha’s forehead lightly before she held out her hand to Nicky. “Here, I need to use the restroom. I’ll refill the bowl while I’m up.”</p><p>“Want me to pause?” Nicky asked.</p><p>Rio waved him off and left them on the couch. After using the restroom, she went to the restroom and dug out another bag of popcorn to heat up. While it was popping, Rio poured herself another glass of water and dug out a can of soda for Agatha. Just as she set the drinks on the counter, the doorbell rang.</p><p>Thinking it was the takeout they ordered, Rio went to answer the door. She barely opened it before Evanora was pushing her aside and sweeping into the apartment, yelling, “Agatha Harkness!”</p><p>Rio stared after her in shock for a moment. Evanora’s mere presence was like ice water dumped over her, reminding Rio of the reality that existed outside of these apartment walls. “Fuck,” she whispered, hurrying back to the living room. When she walked in, Agatha and Evanora were standing, face-to-face, in the middle of the room. Nicky was standing too, but he was off to the side, looking unsure of whether to stay back or intervene.</p><p>“Wicked child,” Evanora hissed as Rio placed herself at Agatha’s side. Evanora’s eyes honed in on Rio’s hand on Agatha’s back before she spat, “James told me he’s getting a divorce and why. Disgusting. Sinful. You should be ashamed of yourself.”</p><p>Rio did her best not to flinch at the hateful vitriol Evanora spewed. She knew her parents would probably think the same of her, especially after they found out the whole truth, but it would be tempered by disappointment and love. There was no lingering affection here though. There was only callous hatred. </p><p>“Tell me how you really feel, mom,” Agatha said, a hollow taunt.</p><p>Evanora jutted her chin and sneered at them, saying, “How I feel is irrelevant, Agatha. This is about James and what you’ve done to him. How I managed to raise such an ungrateful, impudent child, I’ll never know.”</p><p>Rio gritted her teeth at the mention of James. Although she saw it coming, it was still maddening to see all the blame laid on Agatha, as if it wasn’t Rio who cheated within the marriage itself. She wanted to leap in front of Agatha and protect her from Evanora, but she wasn’t sure how Agatha would take that. For now, Rio sidled closer and kept her hand firm against her back, letting her know she was here.</p><p>Agatha stared at Evanora for a long moment, and Rio felt her breath catch at the tears in her eyes. When Agatha finally spoke, her voice was quiet and hurt, “Why do you hate me so much? After everything, why?” </p><p>There was no hesitation as Evanora responded, “You were born evil.” It was such a simple yet painful remark, and Rio felt the way Agatha’s entire body went tense. Evanora pressed on, a depraved triumph in her eyes as she said, “I knew it. Your father knew it.”</p><p>“Stop,” Agatha said. Her voice shook. It was the first time Rio could ever remember them talking about Agatha’s father, and the fact that he was being used against her now made Rio feel sick.</p><p>“He was right, you know,” Evanora said. She stepped closer, voice softening to a deadly croon. “On his deathbed. We would have been better off not having you at all.” She tutted and sighed, saying, “And imagine, you might not have forced poor Nicholas to–”</p><p>“Enough!” Rio snapped. She didn’t dare look at Nicky at this moment. If she did, if she saw his expression that was undoubtedly full of hurt or fear, she’d strangle Evanora right here with her bare hands. </p><p>Rio stepped in front of Agatha, savoring the way Evanora took a step back from her. “Enough,” Rio repeated, but it was quieter now. It was no less dangerous though. It was spoken as a warning. “I will not let you and your twisted sense of morals hurt Agatha or Nicky like this. You don’t deserve them. Either of them.” Rio hesitated when Evanora stared at her with familiar brown eyes. Rio swallowed and said, “I don’t even know if you deserve James.”</p><p>“Whore–”</p><p>Rio didn’t even let Evanora finish. She kept talking as if she hadn’t spoken at all. Rio’s voice never went above that soft, threatening murmur as she said, “What I do know though is that if I see you anywhere near Agatha and Nicky again, I’ll show you real shame. I’ll find every filthy skeleton in your closet and drag every last one of them out until I show the world a real scandal.” She took another step closer and saw the genuine fear lurking in Evanora’s eyes. Good. “Am I clear, Evanora?” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Ungrateful child,” Evanora said, but it was weaker than before. There was a nervous lilt to the letters. “I would have thought you’d realize your mistake when I sent James those photos.” A chill went down Rio’s spine. That’s where those photos came from. Evanora. She’d most likely hired someone to follow her, and for what? Did she suspect something, or was she just waiting for Rio to fuck up? “Both of you,” Evanora continued. She nodded at Nicky. “You’ve condemned his soul to hell, thanks to your sins.”</p><p>Rio’s hand was moving before she could stop it. Her open palm cracked across Evanora’s face, and Rio felt a rush of satisfaction at the way Evanora’s entire body wrenched itself with the hit. When she looked up, eyes burning with rage, Rio almost smiled when she saw her nose was bleeding. </p><p>“Get out before I call the police,” Rio said.</p><p>“You hit me,” Evanora snapped.</p><p>Rio blinked at her and said slowly, “And I’ll say it was self-defense. Now, get out.”</p><p>Evanora glared at Rio, but she didn’t flinch. She stared back, willing Evanora to leave them alone. Rio wasn’t sure how long the two of them kept their eyes locked, but eventually, Evanora huffed and took a step back.</p><p>“I hope you know how disappointed your parents are,” Evanora said.</p><p>It was only then that Rio’s bravado cracked. She pressed her lips together as she took a shaky breath. Still, she said in an uneven voice, “I said get out.”</p><p>Evanora listened this time, but not without one last hateful look over her shoulder. Rio watched her go, not even realizing that she was holding her breath until the door shut behind her. As soon as it did though, Rio stumbled, as if the strings holding her up had snapped.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio mumbled, turning to Agatha. “I didn’t mean to butt in, but I just–” Whatever rambling she was going to say was cut off by Agatha’s arms thrown around her. Agatha held her tight, face buried in her shoulder, and all Rio could do was hug her back, steadying them. “Agatha,” Rio tried, but Agatha only shook her head and hugged her tighter.</p><p>From across the room, Rio locked eyes with Nicky, who was teary-eyed and shaking. Wordlessly, Rio held her arm out to him. That was all he needed too. Nicky launched himself at them, joining the hug with a muffled cry. Rio felt tears pricking at the corners of her eyes too, but she held them in. There would be time for that later. For now, they needed her.</p><p>The three of them remained wrapped up in each other’s arms until Agatha finally pulled away, eyes red and nose running. She cupped both Rio and Nicky’s faces, a kind of longing on her own face that made Rio’s chest ache. </p><p>“I will never let her touch you,” Agatha said, voice low and reverent. These weren't just mere words. This was a promise. “Either of you. I will never let her hurt either of you again.”</p><p>“Mom, she–” Nicky’s voice cracked, and Rio was struck by just how young Nicky was. He looked no more than a boy, terrified by a monster found under his bed. Even though it kept him from Agatha, Rio couldn’t help but feel relieved that Nicky grew up far away from Evanora. “Why does she hate you?” Nicky asked. He sounded so young, untouched by the cruel reality of the world. “Why would she say all that?”</p><p>“Because she’s an awful person,” Agatha told her firmly. “Because she was raised to believe that hate gives you power, that if you make someone feel small enough, they will never fight back.”</p><p>There was an awful experience behind those words, probably multiple, and Rio looked at Agatha from the corner of her eye. She said nothing though and let Agatha pull them back into another hug.</p><p>“I love you both, so much,” Agatha said. </p><p>“I know,” Nicky murmured. “I love you too.”</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through his hair after they parted, smiling. “Now, how about we save the takeout for tomorrow and eat some spaghetti-os for dinner? And change the movie?”</p><p>“Sounds good,” Nicky nodded.</p><p>Agatha and Rio left Nicky in the living room to heat up dinner, but as soon as they were in the kitchen, Agatha pulled Rio to a stop. When Rio looked back at her in askance, Agatha’s face crumpled. Rio opened her mouth to speak, but then Agatha crashed back into her with a broken sob. The fragile strength she scrounged up for Nicky was gone the instant she was gone from his sight, and Rio could only hold her tight, whispering her assurances. </p><p>“I’ve got you,” Rio told her. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulder grew wet with Agatha’s tears, and she could feel the way Agatha’s entire body trembled with tears. It made Rio want to hunt Evanora down and rip her apart, limb by limb, but she couldn’t do that. Not yet at least. Rio just stroked Agatha’s hair and pressed kisses to her head.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said after a few minutes, voice hoarse from her tears. </p><p>“Don’t,” Rio said softly. “You’re allowed to be upset, Agatha. What your mother said…” Rio shook her head. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>“And James, he,” Agatha broke off, shaking her head. “I know why he would tell her. She’d find out soon enough anyways. But this,” Agatha sighed, “it just proves she’s always been his mother more than she ever was mine.” </p><p>Agatha turned her head and rested it on Rio’s shoulder. Like this, Rio could feel the puffs of warm air from her mouth. Something about it felt so vulnerable that Rio could only hold her tighter. </p><p>“No one has ever stood up for me like that.”</p><p>Rio said nothing, but she let out a shaky breath. She pressed another kiss to Agatha’s forehead and held her even closer than before. </p><p>“Sometimes, my father would stop her,” Agatha told her quietly. “Not because he thought she was wrong. Or maybe he did. Usually, he would just say my crying distracted him from his work.”</p><p>“Bastard,” Rio muttered.</p><p>Agatha gave a tired hum as she continued, “The only time she ever hit me was when she found out I was pregnant, but by then, the physical blow was nothing to the things she’d said to me.”</p><p>Evanora, Rio vowed, was going to burn in hell, and Rio was going to personally deliver her soul herself. </p><p>“I never wanted Nicky to see that. He never needed to know that a parent like that exists.”</p><p>“It’s important he knows how you came to be who you are,” Rio told her. She felt Agatha shift in her arms. “Not everything. Not now. He deserves to know the truth though.”</p><p>“I want him to keep believing in the good,” Agatha sighed.</p><p>“And he will,” Rio said. “But he needs to know why it’s so important to keep believing in the good.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing but she nuzzled Rio’s neck. She let herself stay there for a few more moments before she pulled away. She kissed Rio lightly on the lips and said, “Thank you for standing up to her.”</p><p>“Anytime,” Rio replied. She kissed Agatha again then smiled. “So, where do you keep the spaghetti-os?”</p><p>Once the takeout arrived and was put away, dinner ended up being a quiet affair with everyone exhausted from the events of the day. It was hard for Rio to believe that it was just that morning that Rio confessed to James and ended her marriage. It felt like a lifetime ago. </p><p>Everything happened so quickly after months of being trapped in the same place, and Rio felt dizzy with the realization that this was her life now. There weren't going to be any more events or dinners with James where Rio would have to put on her best dress and wear her brightest smile. From now on, there was only going to be Agatha and Nicky, curled up at home in pajamas with those matching, crooked grins.</p><p>It was strange, just how different Rio’s life was going to be now, even though she was still with someone so closely tied to James. His own sister. Rio couldn’t help but wonder how it came to this for them. She still remembered feeling surprised by how Agatha and James seemed to get along, them against Evanora, but in reality, that was only when things were easy. When things got complicated or messy or real, when Evanora’s demands grew harsh, James would cower while Agatha would refuse.</p><p>Rio wondered if this was always going to be an inevitable end. Not her marriage, but Agatha and James’s relationship. Was it always doomed with Evanora forcing them against each other? Would the same have happened if Rio had a sibling of her own? Would Rio have been like James, leaving her younger sibling to the slaughter to save her own standing with her parents?</p><p>The odds seemed more likely than she’d like.</p><p>Shaking her head, Rio swore to herself that she would never hurt Agatha or anyone else again, just to please her parents’ wants and expectations.</p><p>After they finished the movie, one that Rio couldn’t have said one thing about, they both hugged Nicky good night, promising to see him in the morning. Nicky held onto Agatha longer than usual, and Rio looked away before she cried too. It’d been a long day, and she was grateful to be able to crawl into bed with Agatha, wrapped up in each other’s arms.</p><p>Although they talked about it before, Rio knew there must be more on Agatha’s mind after her confrontation with her mother. What Evanora said wouldn’t be so easily forgotten.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it some more?” Rio asked. </p><p>The room was dimly lit by a small lamp, casting out an orange glow. In this lighting, Agatha looked simultaneously divine but also human. Always beautiful but still fragile, still trying to piece togethers the fractured pieces her mother left behind. Rio kissed her gently, wishing she could heal everything that Evanora had ruined, but she knew it wasn’t that simple. </p><p>Agatha said nothing for a moment, but when she finally did speak, her voice was small and vulnerable, “Do you think I’m evil?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, voice strained as she tried to reign in her own hurt. Because it did hurt. It killed Rio to know that Agatha could even consider the fact that her mother was right. This wasn’t about Rio though. This was about Agatha. “No,” Rio told her emphatically. She cupped Agatha’s face and tilted it up to meet her gaze. “You are one of the strongest people I know. And you are so giving and so loving. Just look at Nicky. That boy wouldn’t love you if you weren’t. You are not evil. The only person that could be considered evil is your mother.”</p><p>When Agatha just stared, tears falling onto her cheeks, Rio kissed her and whispered fiercely, “I love you, Agatha Harkness, and I’ll spend the rest of my life telling you that and proving to you that you deserve the world and more.”</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha whispered, and Rio could only hug her close once more.</p><p>Rio let one hand rub soothing circles on Agatha’s  back while the other combed through her hair. She did it even after she felt Agatha relax, wanting to soothe her for as long as she needed. Eventually though, Agatha shifted in her arms and pressed a kiss right above her heart. Rio smiled faintly and pressed a kiss to the top of Agatha’s head. She was content to sleep after that, but then, Agatha pulled back and kissed her desperately, tangling her fingers in her hair.</p><p>“Wait,” Rio tried. The last thing she wanted to do was take advantage of Agatha when she was so emotionally vulnerable. </p><p>“Please,” Agatha breathed against her lips. “I need you.” She took Rio’s hand and pressed it between her thighs, kissing her hard. Rio flexed her fingers against her, and Agatha let out a shaky breath. “Please, baby. Just let me forget for a little while.”</p><p>Rio felt her resolve crumble. She kissed Agatha deeply, sliding her tongue against hers, as she pushed her onto her back. She pressed light kisses against her neck, but when Agatha pulled on her hair, Rio kissed harder, scraping her teeth along the sensitive skin. She listened carefully to every sigh and whine Agatha let out, prepared to stop the moment Agatha showed any kind of sign that she wasn’t okay for this.</p><p>Pushing up her shirt, Rio shoved her bra aside to kiss her breasts. She flicked her tongue against her nipple before taking it into her mouth, humming what Agatha pressed her chest against her face. Rio did the same for the other side before she moved up to kiss Agatha on the lips again.</p><p>As their lips and tongues met again in a messy clash, Rio slid her hand back between Agatha’s legs, moaning at the damp fabric she found. She pushed her underwear aside and eased two fingers inside her. Rio thrusted slowly at first, but soon enough, Agatha was rolling her hips against her hand, urging her to go faster.</p><p>“Just like that, baby,” Agatha whispered in between kisses. Her eyes fluttered shut as her chest heaved. “I’m so close. I’m so fucking close, Rio.”</p><p>“I love you,” Rio told her, breathless and earnest and real. </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, eyes slamming shut. “Say it again.”</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Agatha gasped against her lips as she came, and Rio wished so desperately that she could engrave the sound into her soul, to keep them bound in this moment forever.</p><p>Rio made the orgasm last as long as she could, and when Agatha finally relaxed, she pulled her hand away. She went to get up to wash her hand, but Agatha wrapped her arm around her and held her close. Rio settled against her and wiped her hand on the sheet. They could wash that later. </p><p>“I love you,” Rio said one more time, just because she could. She kissed the tip of Agatha’s nose before she pulled her close once more. </p><p>Agatha smiled against her neck and said, “I love you too.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>When Rio woke up, she was disappointed to find the bed empty of Agatha’s warmth. She stretched onto the other side, pouting when her hand met nothing but air. She rolled onto her stomach and buried her face into the pillow for a moment. It was tempting to laze about in bed for a little longer, but Rio found herself missing Agatha already. Not to mention, she was starving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a quick shower and borrowed some clothes from Agatha’s closet. After some rifling, she picked out a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt with Yale’s faded logo printed across the chest. Rio braided her hair back as she padded out to the kitchen, smiling at the sight that greeted her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was still early enough that Nicky hadn’t left for school yet, so he sat at the table. He absently shoveled cereal into his mouth while looking at something on his phone. When he noticed, he gave her a wave before going right back to his phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and joined Agatha by the coffee machine where she looked just like Nicky, scrolling on her phone while drinking her coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” Rio murmured. She kissed Agatha’s cheek before she poured herself a cup of coffee. She leaned against the counter and took a deep breath, inhaling the smell of coffee. She’d always loved the blend Agatha bought, something rich and spiced. “Do you work today?” Rio asked after a few sips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I moved my meetings around,” Agatha said. She didn’t have to explain why. She looked as tired as Rio felt, the toll of the emotional confrontation yesterday leaving her weary. “I figured we’d take it easy today. Maybe pick up some of your stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right, because Rio wouldn’t be living with James anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds good,” Rio said. “Do you mind if I stay here for a while?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally looked up from her phone at that, staring at Rio with furrowed brows. “Where else would you stay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the kitchen table, Nicky snorted. He caught Rio’s eye and grinned knowingly at her. Rio rolled her eyes in response before she said to Agatha, “I don’t know. I didn’t want to assume.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, close your eyes,” Agatha said. Nicky pretended to vomit, but he still obligingly closed his eyes. Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio’s waist and kissed her firmly on the lips. When she pulled away, she stayed close enough that Rio had no choice but to stare into her eyes. “I’m never letting you go,” Agatha whispered. “Not again. Got it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Got it,” Rio murmured, blushing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and let her go. She took a step back and said, “Thanks, Nicky. You can open your eyes now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for not traumatizing me,” Nicky quipped. He ate the last of his cereal and stood up. “Are you still driving me to school?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Agatha said. She looked at Rio and said, “We’ll go to pick up your stuff after we drop him off?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded and followed the two of them to get ready to leave. As she maneuvered around them, grabbing her shoes and phone, Rio couldn’t help but smile at how domestic it felt. She imagined many more mornings, just like this. Nicky off to school, Agatha off to work… Rio’s heart skipped a beat when she realized she could go back to work now too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A grin pulled at her lips before she could help it, and Agatha noticed as she slipped on her jacket. “What’s got you smiling like that?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just really happy,” Rio said, not wanting to talk about it just yet. She didn’t want to get her hopes up before talking to the hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow, but she didn’t push. She merely turned to Nicky and ushered him out the door. The drive to Nicky’s school was filled with absent chatter between Agatha and Nicky, discussing his schoolwork. Apparently Nicky had a test today along with an essay due tonight. Nicky seemed stressed about the test but fairly unbothered about the essay. Rio listened to them, smiling at the way Agatha lightly scolded him for putting off the essay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll see you after school?” Nicky asked, just before he got out of the car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was startled when she realized he was asking her, but then she remembered the way he’d been so hurt when she disappeared the first time. She smiled and assured him, “I’ll see you then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they drove away from the school, Agatha glanced at Rio and asked, “How are you doing, really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Rio answered honestly. The feigned normalcy between them faded to their genuine exhaustion, and Rio could see the way Agatha’s shoulder slumped just a little more without Nicky there. “I’m relieved, but I’m also…” Rio sighed and shook her head. “I’m not looking forward to seeing my parents.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without looking, Agatha took one hand off the wheel and held it out to her. Rio took it immediately, squeezing her hand. “I know,” Agatha said gently. “I know how much they mean to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re going to hate me,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand tightened around hers. “You don’t know–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do,” Rio cut her off with a wan smile. “Before I left, I talked to my dad. He could tell I was unhappy and told me to just wait, that it’d work out. When I asked him what if I was never happy, what if I never loved James, do you know what he told me?” Agatha’s grip was painful now, holding on so tightly that her knuckles turned white. Rio let her though. The pain kept her grounded, keeping her from losing herself in the memory. “He said he wanted me to be happy, within reason.” Agatha swore under her breath as Rio laughed bitterly and said, “And I think we both know this isn’t within reason.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to ruin him,” Agatha growled. “Both of them, for treating you like this. They don’t get to just use you like that then throw you away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flinched at her phrasing. She subconsciously tried to pull away, but Agatha held her close. She lifted their hands and kissed Rio’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Agatha said. “That was harsh. True, but harsh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio murmured. She sighed. “I just wish this could be over, you know? I want to skip all of this stuff and just focus on being with you and Nicky. Happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wore a faint smile and kissed Rio’s hand again. “We will be,” she promised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the drive was spent in silence. Agatha drove while Rio stared out the window, idly toying with Agatha’s fingers as she watched the scenery go by. When they pulled up to the brownstone, Rio took a deep breath. It was strange how foreign it felt already, as if she’d lived another lifetime here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked. “I can go in and grab your stuff for you, if you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s okay,” Rio said. She finally tore her gaze from the building. “Just… Come with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes softened. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt like letting herself into a stranger’s home when Rio opened the door, and although Rio was just there, she couldn’t help but feel unsure of herself as she stepped inside. Everything was as they left it, no sign of James coming by. That was a relief. Rio wasn’t ready to see him again so soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have much,” Rio said. She spoke quietly, unnerved by the silence that pervaded. “Mostly just my clothes. Some plants.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a sharp nod. “I’ll grab the plants,” she said. She stepped closer and kissed Rio lightly on the lips. She brushed some hair from her face and said, “Come get me if you need me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio managed a weak smile and nodded. She watched Agatha head for the balcony, and it wasn’t until the door shut behind her that Rio moved to the bedroom. Pushing open the door, Rio stared at the bedroom she lived in for almost a year. There was the bed she slept in, always beside James but not quite touching. There was the dresser for her clothes, half hers and half James’s. There was the rug she’d bought herself, smiling proudly at James as she explained it’d add some warmth to the place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It hurt more to be back here than she imagined. It wasn’t just the suffocating pressure to be the perfect wife that lived here. It was also the quiet understanding of two people doing their best to please their parents. It was the tentative friendship of a husband and wife, only in name. It was Rio, or at least a piece of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a sigh and went to find her duffel bag and suitcase. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She tried to pack her clothes as neatly as she could, but her hands shook and her heartbeat a little too fast to make things easy. Rio could feel herself growing more and more careless, the longer she packed, but she couldn’t bring herself to care. She’d figure it out at Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was finishing up the last of her shirts when Agatha appeared in the doorway, a smudge of dirt on her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha greeted her, a tad breathless. “How’s it going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio only shrugged, Agatha sat down beside her on the floor, stepping over the stray shirts surrounding her. Agatha leaned against her, warm and solid. She didn’t do more than that, and Rio appreciated some breathing room while they were still here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t all bad,” Rio whispered. She swallowed, gaze focused on the bag of clothes in front of her. “James wasn’t all bad. He was patient and kind, and so often, I thought to myself, he’d make a great husband.” Rio let out a weak laugh as tears gathered in her eyes. “Just not for me.” She reached out and grabbed Agatha’s hand, squeezing it. “It wasn’t all bad, but it wasn’t right either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat there in silence for a few moments before Agatha said, “I was always jealous of him.” Rio looked at her, but much like she had done, Agatha refused to meet her eyes. “Ever since we were kids, I was always jealous of him, but I don’t think any of it ever compared to knowing he got to marry you when I couldn’t.” It was only then that Agatha looked up, and Rio felt her breath knocked from her lungs at just how much regret shone from Agatha’s eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe jealous isn’t the right word,” Agatha continued. Her smile was small but self-deprecating, and Rio swallowed as she watched the loathing creep in. “I just remember thinking how he would never love you the way I could. He didn’t see you, the same way he didn’t see me, but from the moment I saw you, I knew I’d know every part of you, if I could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally touched her now, cupping her face tenderly. “I’d know the way you relaxed after a long day at work and the way you spent your time on the weekends and the way you loved, whether it be me or someone else.” Her gaze was heavy now, full of hard-earned love, tested and tried but still there after it all. “I’d know it all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do,” Rio told her. “You know it all.” She licked her lips. “You know me. You see me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see you,” Agatha agreed. She rested her forehead against Rio’s. “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, relaxing into Agatha’s touch and words. How strange it was to finally be seen and still loved after. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she opened her eyes again, Rio whispered, “Let’s go home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and kissed her forehead. “Let’s go home,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without even discussing it, they both knew Rio wasn’t going to unpack her things as soon as they got back. Instead, Agatha asked Rio to make them some tea while she took care of something. Assuming it had to do with work, Rio agreed easily. With a bit of honey in each, Rio made them mugs of chamomile tea and walked back to the bedroom to find Agatha. When she got there, she found Agatha kneeling by the bathtub. It was full of steaming water and bubbles, surrounded by several lit candles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What…” Rio trailed, staring with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly rose to her feet and wiped her hands on her pants. “Hey, I thought you might like a bath,” she said with an awkward wave behind her. “To relax.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For me?” Rio said as she walked closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, for the other woman divorcing my brother,” Agatha replied, rolling her eyes. She winced when Rio elbowed her in the stomach. “Sorry, couldn’t help it.” She took the mugs from Rio and set them aside. She placed her hands on Rio’s hips, stroking the skin right above her waistband. “But really, Rio, I thought you deserved to just lay back and take it easy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed and leaned forward to kiss her. It really was sweet of her. She couldn’t remember a time where someone had been so kind and thoughtful to her. Rio tucked a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear and asked, “Join me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d love to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them shed their clothes and eased themselves into the bathtub. Thankfully, it was big enough to fit both of them comfortably with Rio sitting between Agatha’s legs and leaning back against her. Closing her eyes, Rio found her head fit perfectly against the crook of Agatha’s neck. She relaxed against her fully as Agatha’s hand traced absent paths along her arms and legs. There wasn’t anything sexual about it though. It just reminded Rio of how tactile Agatha could be, finding comfort in the simple touches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a while, Rio said, “Thank you for this. I did need it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Agatha replied. “I just wanted to help.” She kissed the side of Rio’s head and found her hands, intertwining their fingers. “I want to do this right. I’ve never done it before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt Agatha grow tense beneath her. She lazily opened her eyes and glanced up at her, saying, “Hm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve never dated,” Agatha explained.  “You know the rumors. I’ve only ever messed around.” She sighed and curled around Rio. She kissed her shoulder before resting her chin on it. “It wasn’t worth the pain to try to be something more. But you… You’re worth it. I’d go through it all again to be with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her throat grow tight at the confession. She couldn’t look at Agatha properly like this, so she settled for squeezing her hands as tightly as she could. “I would too,” Rio said softly. “As long as I got to be with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them stayed in the bath until the water grew cold. When they finally got out, Agatha grabbed her comfiest pajamas for them to change into, and Rio took it without comment, even though she had her own clothes now. She liked wearing Agatha’s things. It made her feel safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lunch ended up being some frozen dumplings that Agatha had in her freezer, eaten on the couch with a movie playing in the background. Much like the movie from the night before, Rio didn’t pay much attention to it. She was more preoccupied with Agatha’s head on her shoulder and her hand on her thigh. As far as she was concerned, that was much more interesting. Rio studied her hand, slim yet strong fingers with soft skin, unmarred by physical work. She noticed a few white hairs scattered among her brown strands, and Rio wondered if those were a recent development.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For almost an hour, Rio memorized every little detail she could from Agatha, but eventually, Agatha noticed her stare and turned to her with a curious smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I help you?” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just looking,” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed and said, “I know. I can feel it.” She sat up and straddled Rio’s lap, placing her hand on either side of Rio’s head on the back of the couch. “What are you thinking about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed this time and said, “I’m serious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you are,” Agatha said. “That’s the annoying part.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned and slid her hands over the back of her thighs before she rested them on Agatha’s hips. “I can’t help that you’re beautiful,” Rio said. To her amusement, Agatha’s cheeks went pink at the compliment. “How much time do we have until we have to pick up Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed her phone, checking the time. “Maybe an hour,” she said. She tossed her phone aside and met Rio’s gaze with a raised brow. “What are you planning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Rio said. She moved her hands down to cup her ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip, leaning back into her touch. “Rio,” she said warningly. Her tone was belied by the way she slightly rocked her hips. “If we’re late–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We won’t be late,” Rio assured her, kissing her before she could protest further. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They ended up being late. It was only fifteen minutes late, but it still earned Rio a glare the entire car ride to pick up Nicky. It was unfair though, in Rio’s opinion. She just intended for them to make out a little. Agatha had been the one to shove her hand down Rio’s pants. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky didn’t even seem to notice they were late though, merely climbing into the car and launching immediately into a rant about the test he had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“By the way, can I have twenty bucks?” Nicky asked as they walked into the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stifled a laugh while Agatha rolled her eyes and said, “Because why, Nicholas?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, that was not bad enough for a ‘Nicholas’,” Nicky protested. When Agatha just glanced at him through narrowed eyes, Nicky said, “My friends want to go to the mall this Friday. I just wanted some money in case I found something I want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You skipped a step,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Nicky just furrowed his brows, Rio nudged him and whispered loudly, “You didn’t ask if you could go hang out with your friends on Friday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Nicky who rolled his eyes now, but he still said, “Mom, can I go to the mall with my friends this Friday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for asking so nicely,” Agatha said, voice full of mock surprise. “Yes, of course you can go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I can have twenty dollars?” Nicky asked, wearing a wheedling smile. Agatha shook her head, but she still went to her purse and grabbed a twenty dollar bill. As she handed it to him, Nicky remarked, “Besides, I thought you’d be happy to have me out of the house now that Rio is living with us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, we love having you around,” Rio said earnestly. “It’s not like you’re a bother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that,” Nicky said, but his face turned the exact same shade of pink that Agatha’s did when she was all shy and embarrassed. “I just meant, you know, so you can have alone time or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted while Agatha gently cuffed Nicky upside the head, saying, “Don’t worry about that. Worry about your essay that’s due tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My essay!” Nicky exclaimed. “Thanks for the reminder, mom. Call me when dinner’s ready.” He gave her a quick kiss to her cheek and flashed Rio a grin before he slipped past them to go to his room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Average exchange these days?” Rio asked, staring at the room Nicky just disappeared into. It was adorable, seeing Agatha and Nicky interacting like mother and son. She remembered how worried they’d both been about the move. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s a good kid,” Agatha said, “but still a kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wrapped an arm around her waist and said, “And you’re a good mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed but she leaned into Rio’s hold. “Maybe,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely,” Rio replied. She wrapped her other arm around Agatha and kissed the tip of her nose. “I could get used to this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes softened as she rested her hands on Rio’s shoulders. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm, even if it does feel a little bit like the calm before the storm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It probably is,” Agatha agreed. “But whatever comes for us, we can handle it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I said,” Agatha said. She grasped Rio’s shirt in her hands and leaned in just close enough that Rio could feel her breath on her lips. “I’m not letting you go.” When she finally kissed her, Rio felt the promise behind her words and smiled.</span>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The fragile happiness Rio found came crashing down three days later.</p><p>That was all Rio got. Three days before reality decided to bludgeon her.</p><p>Before it happened though, Rio got to experience true domestic bliss, and despite what would happen after, she wouldn’t have traded it for anything in the world. For those two days, Rio got to wake up in bed with Agatha, curled up together. She got to make coffee and kiss Agatha good-bye. She got to remind Nicky about his homework and tell him to have a good day. She got to have dinner with the both of them and hear about their days. It was the kind of life that reminded Rio of when she was younger, watching her mother straighten her father’s tie and kiss him good-bye before she urged Rio to finish breakfast and head to school. It filled Rio with a wondrous kind of happiness that also ached deep in her chest.</p><p>On the morning of the fourth day though, Rio checked her phone to see several texts and phone calls from family and friends alike. She skipped over most of them to see Alice’s texts first, one of which included a link to an article.</p><p align="center">
<em>
<strong>WIFE SWAP: </strong>
</em><br/>
<em>
<strong>Senator Vidal’s Daughter Trades Senator Harkness For His Own Sister</strong>
</em>
</p><p>Accompanying the article was a photo of Rio and Agatha kissing in the car in front of her old apartment, the one she shared with James. </p><p>Rio felt her stomach clinch at the headline. Her thumb hovered over the link, but she couldn’t bring herself to actually click it and read what was said. This was everywhere. Everyone would see it, including her parents, who she hadn’t worked up the nerve to speak to yet. Rio was going to throw up.</p><p>She clutched her phone in her hand and rolled out of bed, heading straight for the kitchen where she knew Agatha and Nicky would still be.</p><p>Agatha and Nicky looked up, mid-conversation, but they both stopped when they saw Rio’s expression. Agatha set her coffee aside and met Rio halfway, placing her hands on her hips. “Rio, what’s wrong?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Wordlessly, Rio handed over her phone. With a worried glance, Agatha took it, and Rio watched as she read it. It was easy to see it was nothing good, given the way Agatha’s face grew more and more enraged. When she looked up, there was murder in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>Curiosity finally getting the better of her, Rio took the phone from Agatha and read the article. It was about what she expected, positing her as some faithless, promiscuous woman who couldn’t make up her mind. To make matters worse, they blamed Agatha for seducing her, listing out her wild childhood while they were at it. There was even a timeline of photographed moments where Rio was seen with Agatha but without James. Just how long had they been waiting for this? Was Evanora responsible for the other photos too?</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>“Why are you apologizing?” Agatha said, split between fury and confusion. “You’re not the one who wrote this article.”</p><p>“What article?” Nicky said, standing up.</p><p>“Get your backpack,” Agatha said instead of answering. “You’re going to be late.”</p><p>“No,” Nicky snapped. His face flushed with indignance. “You can’t just not tell me. What article?”</p><p>“Nothing you need to see,” Agatha replied, just as sharp as Nicky had been. “Get your backpack.” When she saw Nicky open his mouth, Agatha glared at him and said, “Now, Nicholas.”</p><p>Nicky scowled but did as he was told, muttering under his breath, “I’m going to see it at school anyways.”</p><p>Agatha wore an expression identical to Nicky’s as she watched him go. She shook her head and took a deep breath before she turned back to Rio. Her anger softened into concern as she placed a hand on Rio’s hip. “How are you feeling?” Agatha asked. </p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say. She didn’t know how to describe the roiling emotions that rocked through her body like a brewing storm. When she spoke, her voice was quiet and strained. “They don’t even mention me by name,” Rio said, eyes downcast. She reached out and gripped Agatha’s shirt in her hand, trying to ground herself. “I’m just someone’s daughter or someone’s wife. I’m not even my own person.”</p><p>“Don’t say that,” Agatha said. She cupped Rio’s face, tilting it up to meet hers. Her other hand stroked Rio’s forehead tenderly, just above her eyebrow. Agatha pressed a kiss to that same spot before she said, “You are your own person, and you are more than your father, and you are more than James. These people don’t care that you’re kind or caring or an amazing doctor, and that’s their loss. All they care about is gossip. They’re spineless vultures who care about nothing but how many clicks something will get them.” </p><p>“I love you,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha sighed and rested her forehead against Rio’s. “I love you too.” She kissed her and said, “Don’t let them get to you. You’re too good for them.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away with a faint smile. “Besides, I’m going to make them regret ever mentioning you.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at that. She was still smiling when Nicky rejoined them in the kitchen, backpack slung over his shoulder. He glanced between them, but his shoulders relaxed slightly when he saw Rio’s expression.</p><p>“All good?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“For now,” Agatha replied. “We’ll discuss it all later.”</p><p>“I’ll hold you to that,” Nicky said, heading to the door.</p><p>Rio followed Agatha after him, whispering to her, “He really is your son.” Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t deny it. Rio laughed quietly. </p><p>Rio had no plans to leave the house today, but she liked seeing the other two off at the door. However, when they opened the door to leave this time, the three of them flinched at the bright flashes of several cameras. Rio squeezed her eyes shut before she realized what was happening. She grabbed a hold of Agatha’s and Nicky’s shirts, yanking them back into the house and shutting the door close once more.</p><p>The three of them stood there, blinking dazedly. </p><p>When she recovered from the sudden onslaught of flashing lights, Agatha pulled out her phone and said grimly, “I’m going to ruin their lives.” She stalked off without another word, leaving Rio and Nicky standing there, still reeling.</p><p>“What about school?” Nicky asked after a moment.</p><p>Rio glanced in the direction Agatha had walked off in. After a moment of deliberation, she wrapped an arm around Nicky’s shoulders and guided him away from the door. “I think you can miss a day,” Rio said. “How about we watch a movie instead?”</p><p>Nicky set down his bag and took off his shoes before he followed Rio into the living room. Once they were sitting on the couch together though, he asked her hesitantly, “What happened? Why were all those people outside the door?”</p><p>“The article was about me and your mom,” Rio explained. “How we’re together.”</p><p>“What, because you’re gay?” Nicky asked, baffled.</p><p>Rio snorted, “Well, I’m sure that’s part of it, but I think people are a little more scandalized by the fact that I left your uncle for your mom.”</p><p>“Don’t call him that,” Nicky said, wrinkling his nose. “He’s just James.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio agreed. She tilted her head and considered the boy in front of her. He’d been through a lot the last few months with Agatha, and Rio wondered how much, if at all, he’d seen of James. She had to assume not very much if he still couldn’t accept the idea that he was his uncle. “Regardless, I left James for your mom, and people love to hear about that kind of drama, especially when it involves prominent politicians like James and my father.”</p><p>“So, now what?” Nicky asked.</p><p>At this, Rio sank into the couch. “I don’t know,” Rio admitted. Nicky followed suit, slumping against the couch until they sat by side. Rio glanced at him and said, “I’m sorry that you have to deal with this. I could move out until this dies down, if you want.”</p><p>Nicky gave her the same look he’d given her when she said she wasn’t sure if Agatha would be okay with her staying with them. “Rio,” Nicky said, exasperated in a way that Rio couldn’t help but feel both amused yet offended by. “Do you really think Mom would let you go anywhere without her right now?” When Rio could only shrug, Nicky said, “You don’t have to go unless you actually want to go. I like having you around. You make Mom happy, and you’re cool to hang around too. It’s not your fault some weirdos have nothing better to do than stand outside our place.”</p><p>Rio smiled and bumped her shoulders against his. “You’re a good kid, Nicky.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Nicky said. He rolled his eyes, but the effect was cancelled out by the very evident blush on his cheeks. “Can you remind Mom of that when I ask for a bigger allowance?”</p><p>Rio laughed and told him to put on a movie. She grabbed the throw blanket and wrapped it around herself while Nicky chose <em>Anastasia</em> to watch. Rio had never seen it before, but she found herself getting invested in Anya’s journey. </p><p>During random scenes, Nicky would tell her about Agatha’s reactions to them the last time they watched it together, which apparently had only been a few weeks ago. Nicky shyly explained they were going through all the movies they would have watched when he was growing up. It was an adorable thing to do, but Rio saved her teasing for Agatha. With Nicky, she listened to his commentary, laughing at the parallels he drew between Dmitri and Agatha.</p><p>Every so often, as they watched the movie, they could hear Agatha yelling at someone, even through the closed door. They’d exchange a look, but they would keep watching like nothing was wrong. It was only after Nicky put on the next movie, <em>Hercules</em>, that Agatha finally walked out of her office, face flushed and eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>Rio and Nicky watched as Agatha wordlessly crossed the room and sat down on the other side of Rio. After a moment of hesitation, Rio reached out and pulled Agatha’s hand into her lap. She held her hand while she rubbed Agatha’s arm with the other. “Is there anything left of them, or did you destroy them completely?” Rio asked, trying to keep her voice light with humor.</p><p>“They’ll be lucky if they have jobs by tomorrow morning,” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>Rio bit her lip, unsure of what to do. She’d seen Agatha like this before, but to be honest, Agatha had usually been upset with her. This was her first time dealing with Agatha when it wasn’t something she could fix. </p><p>Squeezing her hand, Rio asked softly, “How can I help?”</p><p>Agatha tensed for a moment, glancing at her. She searched her face for a moment before she sighed and shook her head. Her hand tightened around hers. “Just talk to me?” Agatha said. </p><p>Rio nodded, telling Agatha about <em>Anastasia</em> and teasing her about everything Nicky told her. Nicky chimed in every so often, even joking about feeling like Anastasia himself, finding his rich and famous family. As the two of them talked, Rio felt Agatha slowly relax against her.</p><p>Just as Agatha seemed to fully relax, the doorbell rang. Agatha stiffened immediately as she snarled, “Ringing the doorbell? What, stalking the place isn’t enough?”</p><p>Rio stood up first and pressed a hand to Agatha’s shoulder, keeping her seated. “I’ll go,” Rio said. When Agatha opened her mouth to protest, Rio said sternly, “Agatha, if you answer that door, you’re going to hit someone, and we really don’t need that right now.”</p><p>“I think Mom should be allowed to punch at least one of them,” Nicky said.</p><p>Rio laughed, “I agree, but unfortunately, I don’t think others would.” She leaned down and kissed Agatha lightly on the lips. “Just let me take care of this, okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha sighed.</p><p>“Whipped,” Nicky coughed into his hand. “Ow!” He dramatically clutched the spot where Agatha had just hit arm, but Rio could tell Agatha had barely touched him. Nicky fell to the side and exclaimed, “Rio, did you see that?”</p><p>“I think you’ll live,” Rio said dryly. She tousled Nicky’s hair as she walked back, grinning at his responding pout. </p><p>Rio walked up to the door and took a deep breath before opening it. This would be easy. All she had to do was politely tell the paparazzi to go away. Rio opened the door, ready to say the words rehearsed in her mind, but it wasn’t some stranger holding a camera. It was her parents. Despite being the ones on her doorstep, Luis and Paola looked just as surprised to see her.</p><p>Vaguely, in the back of her mind, Rio couldn’t help but think that none of these people have heard of phoning ahead in their lives. Or maybe, they wanted to be dramatic. Most likely, they just didn’t want to give them an opportunity to escape before they could corner them. Maybe Rio deserved that for not telling them about her divorce herself.</p><p>“Hello,” Rio said evenly, as if she wasn’t internally screaming and fighting the urge to slam the door shut in her parents’ faces. </p><p>“Hello, Rio,” Luis replied, just as calm. “May we come in?”</p><p>Rio could say no. She could just say no and shut the door. Rio knew she wouldn’t though. She might not owe them anything, but she did owe this to herself. She deserved to have some closure with her parents about the train wreck they made of her life.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio finally said. She stepped back. “We have a lot to talk about.”</p><p>After closing the door much more gently than she wanted to, Rio led her parents to the living room. Agatha shot to her feet as soon as she saw them, and although Nicky surely didn’t recognize them, he followed Agatha’s lead and scrambled to stand too. </p><p>“I need to talk to my parents,” Rio said, quiet but firm. She avoided Agatha’s piercing gaze to look at Nicky instead. “Nicky, do you mind giving us a chance to talk alone?”</p><p>Nicky didn’t answer at first, and Rio could see the desire to know what was happening. However, she also saw the moment Nicky remembered what it was like when Evanora came. Equal parts fear and protectiveness battled across his face before he finally said, “Okay. I’ll go read in my room.” As he walked away, Nicky glared at her parents, and Rio couldn’t help but smile fondly as she watched him go. </p><p>Rio knew there was no use in asking Agatha to leave, and she didn’t want her to go anyways. She walked over to her and took her hand, feeling her parents’ stare burning into the simple touch. Rio cleared her throat and said, “Please, sit.”</p><p>Rio sat down with Agatha, close enough that their sides were pressed together. It helped Rio breathe a little easier, feeling her there with her. She held Agatha’s hand and smiled tightly at the look of concern Agatha gave her.</p><p>Leaning in, Agatha whispered in her ear, “Say the word and I’ll kick them out. I’ll even drag them out myself if I have to.”</p><p>Despite herself, Rio let out a quiet huff of a laugh. “Hopefully it doesn’t come to that, but thank you.”</p><p>Rio turned back to her parents and found them staring at her like they had never seen before her. Then again, they hadn’t. Not like this. It almost made Rio want to shrink back and hide, but the part that had clawed her way out was determined to keep her head held high.</p><p>“I’m sorry you had to find out from someone else,” Rio began. It occurred to her that Evanora might have told them before the article came out, but ultimately, what mattered was that it hadn’t come from her. “But whatever you were told or read is true. I’m divorcing James, and I’m with Agatha now.” She licked her lips and added pointedly, “I’m happy with Agatha now.”</p><p>Paola pursed her lips while Luis leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees and clasping his hands in front of him. “Rio,” Luis said, voice affectionate yet condescending. “I know I upset you at your aunt’s house, but there is no need to be rash.”</p><p>“Rash?” Rio repeated. “There was nothing rash about this decision.”</p><p>“Your marriage was hardly a year,” Paola spoke up. She sighed and gave Rio a beseeching look. Was that how long Paola gave it, her marriage? Rio always assumed it’d been a marriage of love, but now she had to wonder. “Did you even try?”</p><p>“Of course I tried,” Rio hissed. “All I have ever done for you is try.” She realized she was digging her nails into Agatha’s hand and forced herself to relax. She took a deep breath and said, “I know this must be a surprise for you, but I have always liked women. It was never going to work out with James.”</p><p>Luis and Paola looked at each other. After a moment, Paola gave a small nod. Luis wrung his hands as he looked back at Rio. “It wasn’t a surprise,” Luis told her softly. </p><p>Rio jerked back, spine stiffening. Her mouth fell open as she stared at her parents. They couldn’t possibly mean that. Yet, the longer she stared at them, the harder it was to deny the sinking feeling in her stomach that told her it was true.</p><p>“We always knew,” Luis continued. His voice was a croon, as if he believed that if he spoke kindly enough, Rio wouldn’t realize the full cruelty of his words. “Of course, we knew. We just always hoped–”</p><p>“You hoped what?” Rio snapped. “I’d grow out of it? That it was just some phase?” When her parents’ expressions only grew grimmer, Rio let out a harsh laugh. “I can’t believe you.”</p><p>“You are the one disobeying her parents,” Paola replied.</p><p>Rio smiled bitterly and said, “Yeah, well you’re the ones who set your daughter up for a marriage you knew she’d never be happy in.” When her parents flinched, she couldn’t help but keep going, “You’re the ones who never once reached out to me once I was married, and you’re the ones who claimed to love me and used me instead.” Rio’s voice grew louder and louder until she felt tears in her eyes and a tightness in her chest. She sucked in a shaky breath as she whispered, “How could you do that to me?”</p><p>Agatha wrapped an arm around her, holding her as Rio tried to keep her tears under control.</p><p>“We were doing what was best,” Luis said.</p><p>“Best for who?”</p><p>Rio’s gaze was steel when she looked at her parents again. Her eyes stung, and her breathing quivered, but Rio did not look away from Luis and Paola. She let them see the full ruin that they’d done to her, hoping that they’d come to some kind of realization or guilt. </p><p>“Everything I did,” Rio said, “I did for you.” She spoke softly, but it wasn’t like Luis’s patronizing tone. It held an edge of fury that made it dangerous. It made it seem as though something might shatter if she spoke any louder. “I gave you everything, and it still wasn’t enough for you, so I’m done.”</p><p>“Done?” Luis scoffed.</p><p>“Done,” Rio repeated without hesitation. “I’m going to do things for myself now. I’m going to go back to work, and I’m going to be with the woman I love, and I’m going to be everything I wasn’t when I was trying to make you happy instead of myself.” Rio smiled faintly, both proud and pained. Tears filled her eyes once more as she said, “And I know you won’t stick around for that, but I hope you’ll be happy for me anyways.”</p><p>Rio waited a moment then asked bitterly, “Nothing else to say about knowing better than me?”</p><p>Paola made a noise of disgust and stood up, walking away without another word. Luis lingered though, staring at Rio solemnly. After a moment, he slowly stood as well. He walked the few steps closer and placed a hand on Rio’s shoulder. It was almost like Agatha wasn’t there at all for him. </p><p>“You disappoint me, Rio,” Luis said quietly. “How did I raise such a selfish daughter?”</p><p>Rio let out a gasp like she’d been hit. Her face crumbled as Luis walked away. The fragile bravery she’d managed for the confrontation gave way to heartbreak. The door had barely closed behind her parents before Rio let out a broken sob, collapsing into Agatha’s arms. The tears that she’d tried to hold back came pouring out as she buried her face into Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha whispered, hugging her tight. “I’m sorry, Rio. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Rio was reminded of when Agatha comforted her after her confrontation with James. She did the same things now, stroking her hair and humming some indistinct song. Rio curled closer to her, trying to focus on the sound of her voice instead of her father’s words echoing in her mind. </p><p>It could have been hours or mere minutes until Rio’s tears finally stopped. She felt wrung out and exhausted in Agatha’s arms, the two of them half-laying on the couch. Rio always knew her parents wouldn’t accept her, but it still hurt. It still hurt so much to know they saw her as a failure. It was just months ago that her father told her that she was the best of them. In reality, was she the worst?</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha whispered to her, as if sensing her spiral. “I love you so much, and I’m so proud of you for standing up for yourself to your parents. I know how much you love them, and I know how hard that must have been for you, but you did it, and you did it for yourself.”</p><p>“They hate me,” Rio mumbled.</p><p>“They don’t,” Agatha said, with an uncanny level of knowing in her voice. “And that’s why they’re so upset.”</p><p>Rio mentally filed that away for later. For now, she buried her face against Agatha and mumbled, “I’m sad. And tired.” It was the oversimplified version of her feelings, childish in a way, but Agatha merely hugged her closer.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said. She rested her chin on the top of Rio’s head. “And that’s okay. Let us take care of you.”</p><p>The ‘us’ made Rio stir, peeking up to find Nicky standing awkwardly by the couch. He gave her a small smile and said, “I ordered us dinner, that Thai place you like, Rio.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said. She rubbed at her face before she realized there was no fixing how she looked right now. She let her hand fall back to her lap. She wondered if Nicky thought it was strange or uncomfortable seeing them like this. She hoped not. She really didn’t want to move. “How much did you hear?”</p><p>“Not a lot,” Nicky said. He walked closer and sat on the other end of the couch. He pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around them. It made him look even younger. “It doesn’t matter anyways. If they made you cry like that, I know it was a bunch of bullshit anyways.” It was a true testament to the circumstances that Agatha didn’t even scold him for cursing. “But Mom’s right. We’re here for you, Rio.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said, feeling her chest grow tight. This feeling wasn’t so bad though. It was just the overwhelming realization that she had people now. A real family. “Want to put on another movie?”</p><p>Nicky smiled and nodded, “Sure. How about <em>Matilda</em>?”</p><p>“That sounds perfect.”</p><p>The three of them stayed curled up on that couch all night, eating dinner on it and eventually all falling asleep on it too. It was the safest Rio had felt in a really long time. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The following days, even weeks, after the article were rough for Rio, but having Agatha and Nicky made things easier.</p><p>There were days where Rio was fine, like her life hadn’t been upended. It helped that she’d gone back to work at the hospital again, part-time for now. It was just her luck that another anesthesiologist had relocated last minute. Her only recent luck, it felt like at times. Still, the work got her out of the house and something to focus on. It also felt good to be returning to work and shifting away from a picturesque housewife. </p><p>What made those days even better though was always ending them with Agatha and Nicky. As life went on, there were nights where Rio only saw Agatha or Nicky for dinner, instead of both; Agatha would have a late meeting or Nicky was out with friends, but it still felt special to share any meal with them. If Agatha was gone, Rio and Nicky would watch a horror film she’d hate. If Nicky was gone, Rio and Agatha would take full advantage of having an empty house.</p><p>On days like those, Rio felt like nothing could ever go wrong.</p><p>However, there were days where Rio felt herself crumple under the realization that she’d lost her family. It happened around Mother’s Day and again when it was Luis’s birthday. Although she sent texts and made calls on both days, all went unanswered. She’d expected it, but it still felt like a gaping hole inside of her. Rio mourned the loss by withdrawing and falling silent. When it had happened, Agatha had panicked, not that she would have admitted that. </p><p>“Do you want me to stay home?” Agatha asked. She sat on the edge of the bed, running her finger through Rio’s hair. She was dressed for the day while Rio was still in her pajamas under the covers. “Say the word, and I’ll cancel my meetings.”</p><p>“No,” Rio mumbled. The ache in her chest felt like it would swallow her whole at any moment, and even speaking took tremendous effort. “Go to work.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed. “Rio,” she said softly. “I don’t mind.” When Rio said nothing, pulling the covers up to her nose, Agatha sighed and said, “I’m taking the day off.” </p><p>Rio fought back a scowl. She’d told Agatha to go, hadn’t she? It reminded Rio of when she was still with James. She wouldn’t want to go to an event, but he’d insist she go anyway. She would tell him to do one thing, but he’d end up doing something else. She told herself Agatha wasn’t James, but she felt the deja vu nonetheless. Unease wrapped itself around her, and Rio remained silent. </p><p>It was like that all day. Agatha seemed torn between letting Rio sulk and urging her to do something else to distract herself. She’d ask Rio what she wanted, but then Agatha would continue to ask her again and again, as if she’d given Agatha the wrong answer.</p><p>Rio finally broke when Agatha tried to pour a glass of water for her after Rio said she didn’t want one. “I’m not a child,” Rio snapped. “I can get myself water if I want.”</p><p>Agatha froze, as did Rio. The hurt flickered across her face, but in an instant, it was gone. “Of course, you aren’t,” Agatha said lightly. She handed Rio the glass then continued to make dinner as if nothing had happened.</p><p>The hurt on Agatha’s face kept Rio awake all night, even as Agatha slept with her arm slung over Rio’s stomach.</p><p>The next day, Rio knew they couldn’t go on like this. She made them breakfast and apologized quietly, “I’m sorry. I know you were trying to help.” Agatha accepted the apology with a kiss to her forehead. “Sometimes, when you do that though, it feels…” Rio sighed. She hated to say the comparison out loud, knowing how much it would hurt Agatha. “It feels almost like I’m trapped again, like I can’t decide anything for myself.” When Agatha opened her mouth, Rio quickly added, “And I know that’s not what you were doing. I guess I’m still trying to remember that if you do something for me, you aren't just doing it because you think you’re supposed to or that I have to pay you back for it.”</p><p>It was humiliating to admit this all out loud, but Agatha hugged her tenderly and murmured, “Just remember you can talk to me.” She pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek and added venomously, “I could kill my brother for what he did to you.”</p><p>“It wasn’t just your brother,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha hugged her tighter and sighed. “I know.”</p><p>It wasn’t perfect, but Rio could feel herself healing slowly but surely, with every laugh and smile she shared with Agatha and Nicky. She’d felt so alone for so long that she forgot what it was like to have people she loved and cared for, who loved her back just as much.</p><p>It was even better when Rio finally got to invite Alice over to meet them officially.</p><p>Of course, Agatha and Alice had met before, but it didn’t feel like that counted. It was different now, having Alice meet Agatha as her girlfriend.</p><p>It happened about three weeks after the article was published. Although they talked over the phone, Alice had been out of the country for work, unable to come see Rio immediately. When she finally did though, Alice threw her arms around Rio and hugged her for a few minutes. Rio accepted the hug with a breathless laugh. She had missed her best friend.</p><p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t be here sooner,” Alice said as she pulled away. “Stupid meetings.”</p><p>“Stupid meetings that are revolutionizing the tech and music industries?” Rio replied dryly. </p><p>“Yeah, they’re so stupid,” Alice said with a grin. </p><p>Rio laughed and kept an arm around Alice’s shoulders to guide her to the living room. “Well, thanks for the great sacrifice,” Rio said. She lowered her voice and added, “Be nice. Agatha has been stressed about this.”</p><p>“We’ve met before,” Alice said.</p><p>“Yeah, and that was before we cheated and ended my marriage,” Rio said.</p><p>“Okay, got it. Don’t joke about the affair,” Alice said before winking and continuing, “Yet.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but she was still smiling as she led Alice into the living room. Nicky was sitting comfortably, tucked in the corner of the couch, but Agatha was sitting with her back straight and hands folded in her lap. It was the most demure Rio had ever seen her, and it took everything in her not to laugh. </p><p>“Hey, Agatha,” Alice said casually, waving. “And you must be Nicky. Nice to meet you. Rio literally never shuts up about you.”</p><p>Both Rio and Nicky blushed at this, but Nicky grinned and said, “Really?”</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Alice said. She walked over and sat down in the armchair across from the couch and said, “I would’ve thought she birthed you herself except for the fact that she also can’t shut up about your actual mom.” She smiled at Agatha and said, “By the way, I always thought you were the hotter sibling.”</p><p>“Alice!” Rio exclaimed. Nicky laughed though, and Agatha smiled slightly, cheeks pinkening. Her shoulders relaxed, and she held her hand out to Rio. Rio sighed and took the hand, sitting next to her. “She’s right though,” Rio said. “You are the hotter sibling.”</p><p>This finally got a laugh out of Agatha, and Nicky just rolled his eyes, the way he always did when the two of them did anything even remotely close to flirting.</p><p>It was easy for them to talk after that. Agatha mainly talked about her work and the books she’d read recently. Nicky talked about school and his plans for the summer. Alice talked a little bit about work, but she was mostly preoccupied with telling every embarrassing story she had about Rio.</p><p>Rio tried to stop her at first, but she knew it was futile. Not to mention, the strong urge to change her name and leave to another country was overshadowed by the delighted laughs and exclamations the stories got out of Agatha and Nicky. She knew she’d let Alice tell a thousand embarrassing stories if it meant making those two happy. </p><p>It was hours before Rio finally managed to kick Alice out of the apartment, and when she finally left after dinner, it wasn’t long before they separated to their own rooms.</p><p>Rio flopped down on the bed with a groan, listening absently as Agatha got ready for bed. She was exhausted, but it was the good kind. It was the kind of tired where she had laughed too hard and smiled too wide. It was the kind where she’d do it all over again if she had the chance. A happy kind of tired, simply put. She was staring blankly at the ceiling when Agatha suddenly climbed on top of her. Out of reflex, Rio placed her hands on Agatha’s hips, a smile on her lips. Agatha smiled back, perched comfortably on her lap, fingers toying with the hem of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?” Agatha asked. </p><p>It took Rio a moment to answer, distracted by Agatha’s fingers slipping beneath her shirt. “Um,” Rio said. Any actual thoughts flew from her mind at the gentle scrape of Agatha’s nails. “Nothing?”</p><p>“Nothing?” Agatha laughed. She pulled her hands away, ignoring Rio’s noise of protest, and put them on either side of Rio’s head. “Try again, baby.” </p><p>“I was just thinking it was nice,” Rio said. She slid her hands from Agatha’s hips to her back. She pressed gently until Agatha’s body was against hers. “Seeing you and Alice together.” She hesitated before she said quietly, “My family.” </p><p>Agatha’s expression softened. She stroked Rio’s cheeks before she kissed her. “It was nice getting to know her,” Agatha said. “And it makes me happy to hear you think of us that way.” She cupped Rio’s face with both hands and said, quiet yet strong, “I love you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“I love you too, Agatha Harkness,” Rio said. She leaned up and kissed Agatha soundly. She moved a hand to entangle in her hair, pulling her even closer as she deepened the kiss. Rio whined when Agatha moved away, only to moan softly as Agatha nipped at her neck and slid her hand into her pants.</p><p>Agatha was slow and tender as she made Rio come, first with her fingers and then with her mouth, and when she was done, she shrugged off Rio’s attempts to return the favor. “Later,” Agatha murmured. She wrapped her arms around Rio and tangled their legs together. “Let me just hold you for now.”</p><p>Rio smiled and relaxed, snuggling even closer. It was easier to breathe when she knew that Agatha did everything she could to make Rio feel like this. Loved.</p><p>She was reminded of this again a week later when she overheard Agatha and Nicky talking. Rio had just gotten from work, but before she could announce herself, her curiosity was piqued by the sound of hushed voices. Rio walked slowly, listening to Agatha and Nicky speak.</p><p>“Tomorrow would have been her wedding anniversary,” Rio heard Agatha say to Nicky. “I don’t even know if she realizes. You know how bad she is with dates. Either way, we’re going to go out and do something fun to help distract her, okay?”</p><p>“Okay, Mom.”</p><p>Rio stood just out of sight, surprised. Agatha was right. She hadn’t even realized tomorrow would have marked one year of marriage with James, if they were still together. What a strange thought, celebrating an entire year with someone she didn’t love. Rio was relieved that she got to spend the day with someone, two someones, she loved instead.</p><p>Smoothing her expression into something neutral, Rio called out, “I’m starving! Please tell me dinner is ready.” When she strode into the kitchen, Agatha and Nicky looked perfectly innocent. Agatha stood at the stove cooking, and Nicky sat at the table with some homework. Rio wanted to laugh, but she would let them have their secret. </p><p>Despite knowing they had something planned, Rio didn’t have to fake her surprise when Agatha announced that they would be going to the New York Botanical Garden the following morning. It used to be one of Rio’s favorite places to wander when she was younger, especially when she needed some space from her parents, but she hadn’t been back in years. She told this to Agatha, who beamed.</p><p>It was a beautiful day as they stepped into the botanical garden, and Rio felt as though a weight had been lifted off of her as she held Agatha’s hand and followed Nicky along the pathways. Rio wondered if she would ever get used to this, the easy simplicity of just being with Agatha and Nicky. A part of her hoped she would stop finding it so novel, but another part of her never wanted to lose the awe they inspired in her.</p><p>As they walked, they would slip in and out of conversations, enjoying both the peace of the garden but also each other’s company. About halfway through, Agatha and Rio took a seat on a bench to rest while Nicky stood in front of them.</p><p>“Can we go somewhere this summer?” Nicky asked as he pulled a water bottle out of his backpack and handed it to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha raised a brow and replied, “Where?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Nicky said. “Anywhere.”</p><p>“How specific,” Agatha drawled before she took a sip of water.</p><p>Nicky rolled his eyes, but then he brightened and exclaimed, “Italy! To visit Lilia.”</p><p>“I think it’s a little late to be planning an international trip but maybe next year,” Agatha told him, albeit apologetically. She handed the water bottle to Rio then said, “How about we stay in the country?”</p><p>Nicky pouted for a moment, but he agreed, “Fine. Can we go to a theme park?” Nicky gasped as an idea came to him. “We can go to Star Wars land!”</p><p>“Galaxy’s Edge,” Rio corrected absently. She drank some water, only to notice the twin, curious stares directed at her. “What?”</p><p>“You like Star Wars?” Nicky demanded while Agatha said fondly, “You’re such a nerd.”</p><p>“They’re classics,” Rio said. “Are you telling me you’ve never watched them?”</p><p>“Not a single one,” Agatha said, almost like she was gloating.</p><p>Nicky and Rio looked at her, both aghast. Then, they shared a look and a nod. “We’re having a movie marathon when we get home,” Nicky proclaimed. “We can get through the first trilogy tonight if we leave now.”</p><p>“Nicky, we aren’t even done with the gardens yet,” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>“No, he’s right,” Rio said, laughing at the incredulous look Agatha gave her. “We can always come back. Your Star Wars education takes precedent.” </p><p>“I’ve created monsters,” Agatha sighed, but she still stood up and held her hand out to Rio. </p><p>It was as they were walking towards the exit that Rio’s phone buzzed with a phone call. She checked it, just to make sure it wasn’t work, only to freeze when she saw the name lighting up her screen. </p><p align="center">
<em> James Harkness </em>
</p><p>They hadn’t spoken since that day. The only form of communication, if you could call it that, was through their lawyers as they sorted out the divorce.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up to meet Agatha’s concerned stare. The sun shone from behind her, casting a golden halo against her dark waves. She looked beautiful, even as she looked worried, and Rio felt her chest tighten at the thought of ruining this moment.</p><p>She had to though. Much like with her parents, Rio needed this closure. Maintaining eye contact with Agatha, Rio answered the call with a breathless, “James?” </p><p>Agatha’s hand clenched around hers, mouth falling open. Rio swallowed, wondering if she’d storm away, but as soon as she thought it, she dismissed it. Agatha wouldn’t do that. With Agatha’s hand still in hers, Rio focused on the call.</p><p><em> “Hey, Rio.” </em> James’s voice was quiet and subdued. <em> “Sorry to call so suddenly, but I was hoping we could talk. If you’re not busy.” </em></p><p>“Sure,” Rio said after a moment. She was technically busy, but she knew she had to do this now. If she waited, it would drive her mad until they spoke. She took a deep breath. “Where are you right now?” When James said the name of a nearby restaurant, she said, “I’m at the botanical garden. Can you meet me at the entrance?” James agreed and hung up soon after. It took Rio a moment to lower the phone, knowing that would signal Agatha that she could talk now.</p><p>“James is coming?” Agatha asked. Her voice was quiet and even, and Rio wondered how much effort it took from her to keep it that way.</p><p>“We need to talk,” Rio said. </p><p>Agatha frowned, but after a moment, she gave a sharp nod. “We’ll wait with you then.” It was only then that she let go of Rio’s hand, walking ahead to let Nicky know what was happening.</p><p>Rio wanted to reach out and stop her, but she also didn’t want to get into things when there was no time or space to actually talk about them. She let Agatha walk ahead with Nicky, stuffing her hands into her pockets. She didn’t want this talk to ruin the day they were having, and yet, she could already feel the distance growing between them.</p><p>Before Rio could fully settle into her melancholy though, she caught up to Agatha and Nicky. Agatha wrapped an arm around her waist while Nicky simply said, “I was arguing with mom about what order we have to watch the Star Wars movies in.”</p><p>“If they’re numbered one through six, why on earth would we start with four?” Agatha reasoned, but Rio could tell by the way the corner of her lips twitched up that she was purposefully being difficult. Rio relaxed into Agatha’s hold, realizing how dramatic she was being, thinking they would abandon her so easily. Agatha gave her a warm smile, eyes gentle, and asked, “What do you think, Rio?”</p><p>That was how they passed the time until James arrived, arguing over movies. It was funny to watch Nicky get so heated, especially as he tried to hold back the biggest plot twist of the original trilogy. Rio would be surprised if Agatha hadn’t at least heard the Darth Vader reveal referenced, but she wasn’t going to ruin that for Nicky, who seemed to be set on letting that be a proper moment of shock. </p><p>When James finally showed up, Rio wished she could just send him away. Talking about movies was much more preferable to the conversation she was about to have. Then, she got a proper look at him.</p><p>He looked like shit. It wasn’t the kindest thought, but it was an honest one. He wore his usual slacks and button-down, but the shirt was wrinkled with the sleeves messily rolled up. His hair was unkempt, and there was a hint of stubble along his jaw. He also looked like he hadn’t slept properly in days.</p><p>The way James looked reminded Rio of how she must have looked in the days right after their fight. Despite herself, Rio felt sorry for him. She knew she had recovered far better than him, how could she not with Agatha and Nicky, but it was another thing to actually see it. </p><p>Rio knew the exact moment Agatha saw James because her grip on Rio tightened. Nothing painful. If anything, Rio had to guess it was more subconscious than anything else. She placed her hand over Agatha’s, trying to wordlessly reassure her.</p><p>“Hello,” James said when he walked up to them. His eyes darted over Agatha and Nicky before they landed on Rio. He didn’t look surprised to see them, but Rio could see the traces of hurt. James offered a feeble smile. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”</p><p>“We needed to talk,” Rio shrugged. She turned to Agatha and told her, “Why don’t you and Nicky walk around some more?” When Agatha pursed her lips, looking uneasy, Rio squeezed her hand and said, “Please. I’ll text you when I’m done.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, but it was clear to everyone how reluctant she was. She gave James a hard look and said, “If I come back and she’s crying, there’ll be hell to pay.”</p><p>Rio thought James might laugh at that, but he only nodded solemnly and said, “I know.”</p><p>Rio watched Agatha go and realized James was doing the same. She wondered if they had spoken since that day. Agatha hadn’t mentioned anything, but Rio knew they also had a lot to talk about. Maybe they weren’t ready yet though. Rio wasn’t sure if they would ever be ready.</p><p>“Let’s sit,” Rio said. She walked them over to a nearby bench. She sat on one end while James sat a foot or so away. She cleared her throat and turned to James and said, “So, you wanted to talk.”</p><p>James nodded then hesitated. He stared at his hands for a long moment before he looked up and said, “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio was surprised to hear the words, but she still managed to say back, “I’m sorry too.”</p><p>They shared a weary smile. </p><p>“I didn’t want to leave things where we did,” James told her. “I said some awful things to you, and I’m sorry. I knew, I <em> know </em> that you weren’t just nice to me to get to Agatha.” He shook his head, lips pressing into a thin line. “Maybe I didn’t see all of you, Rio, but I like to think I saw enough of you to know you were genuine in your attempts to befriend me.”</p><p>“They were genuine,” Rio said softly. She flattened her hands against her thighs, so she wouldn’t clench them into fists. “I thought of you as a friend, James. It’s just…” She sighed and closed her eyes, remembering that brief period where things seemed to be okay for them, where they would eat together and hang out with no other expectations. “That was all I was ever going to think of you as.”</p><p>James didn’t look furious over the fact, the way he did when they last had this conversation. He looked out at the garden, passively watching the people walk by. After a moment, he said, “I thought I had it all figured out, you know? Go into politics like my father said I should. Marry the girl my mother said I should.” He let out a bitter laugh. “That was what everyone else I knew did, and it all worked for them.” James looked at her then, a combination of anguish and understanding on his face. He said, “I kept waiting for things to fall into place, like it seemed to for everyone else.”</p><p>“That doesn’t make it okay,” Rio told him, “or right.” She understood where he was coming from, she did. There were so many times throughout her life that Rio would look at her peers and wonder what she was doing wrong, not to find the same kind of satisfaction from the lives they lived. Rio was done with feeling like she was the problem though. “I’m not wrong for not wanting that, and it’s not my fault that it didn’t work out.”</p><p>“I know,” James said. “I was so used to doing what I was told, I never stopped to think if it was right.” He ran a hand through his hair before he dropped it back into his lap, looking lost. “I guess I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that it’s not my fault either. It’s not either of our faults. That–” James let out a self-deprecating laugh. “That something didn’t go my way for once.”</p><p>Rio refrained from commenting on the privilege of his problems, but she did point out, “You did push though. You kept telling me to try.”</p><p>“Was that wrong? Wanting to try?” James asked. It was said with genuine curiosity, rather than any accusation. “I didn’t know you were a lesbian.”</p><p>“Would that have stopped you?”</p><p>To James’s credit, he actually considered his answer before he spoke instead of saying what they both knew to be the right answer. When he did speak, he said, “I like to think so. To be frank, Agatha is about my only point of reference for anyone who isn’t straight, and well.” He stopped, a wry smile on his lips. He shook his head and continued, “We both know it’d be stupid to try and tell her that she just has to try liking men.” James thought about it some more before he added, “I think I would have still tried to make the marriage work though. You know, as friends. We were already married, so I would’ve felt that we had to make it work.”</p><p>“And when we had to have kids?” Rio pressed gently.</p><p>James hesitated. He shook his head and said, “Didn’t think about it that far, but I guess that’s a good point.”</p><p>The two of them sat in silence together until James spoke up again, “I’m not going to say I’m completely okay with you and Agatha because I’m not. It’s still a lot to deal with, but I’m working on it, and I hope one day that we can be friends again.” He let out a huff of a laugh and said, “Or maybe even amicable in-laws.”</p><p>Rio felt her eyebrows raise, but she still said, “That’d be nice. One day.” She reached out and touched his arm, saying, “You’ll have to talk to Agatha though.”</p><p>“I know,” James said, but it was with a grimace. He hesitated before he asked, “Your parents–”</p><p>“No,” Rio said softly but firmly.</p><p>James frowned, but he nodded slowly. “I’ve cut off Evanora,” James said, almost like an offering. When Rio looked at him, he continued, “You were right about how she treated Agatha, but it didn’t really hit me until–” He abruptly cut himself off and gave her a wary look. “Until I saw it.”</p><p>Rio wanted to ask specifically what he meant by that, but she had the feeling he wouldn’t say. She merely nodded and wished him luck with his own family, and he did the same to her.</p><p>They spoke about lighter topics after that, including James moving into a new apartment and Rio returning to work. They both relaxed the longer they spoke, and Rio was reminded of how they were able to become friends in the first place. </p><p>After another twenty minutes or so, they both stood to leave. Thankfully, James didn’t try to hug her and held out his hand. Rio shook it with a small smile.</p><p>“The final divorce papers should be done this week,” James said. </p><p>Rio let her hand fall away as she said with as much sincerity as she could, “Thank you.” Their divorce could have been a lot messier, but they were both being reasonable with it.</p><p>“Thank you for not having Agatha draw up the papers,” James replied, making Rio laugh. A small one but genuine. </p><p>“I wouldn’t ask her to do that,” Rio said.</p><p>James nodded, a half-smile on his lips. “I know. Good-bye, Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiled, feeling a strange mixture of relief and sadness. “Good-bye, James.”</p><p>Rio watched him walk away. She didn’t call or text Agatha as soon as he was gone from her sight, instead opting to sit back down on the bench and take a moment for herself. There was a sort of finality to the moment that Rio needed to process.</p><p>Things were over between her and James. They’d been over, but now, they were properly over with an actual conversation between them. Rio was also glad that James hadn’t stewed in his anger, seeming to recognize the unfairness in the situation. It made her feel better, not only for herself but Agatha as well. As tense as things were with James, Rio knew that Agatha didn’t necessarily want to lose her brother forever.</p><p>Rio shut her eyes and took a deep breath. With that done, she was finally able to focus on her new life.</p><p>Rio texted Agatha, and just a short while later, she was on her way home.</p><p>When they got back to the apartment, Nicky immediately went to the living room to pull up <em> Star Wars: A New Hope </em>. He said he wanted to get started on their marathon as soon as possible, but the glance over his shoulder told Rio that he had also noticed the worried looks Agatha had given her the whole way back.</p><p>Rio lingered in the entryway with Agatha, grabbing her hand to keep her from following Nicky.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Rio told her. She tugged her closer and smiled at the way Agatha came to her so easily. She slid a hand around to cup the back of Agatha’s neck and kissed her gently. “It was a good talk. We’re…” She trailed off, trying to find the best words for it. “We’re better now. He’s coming around to us. He just needs time.”</p><p>“I was worried that he said something to upset you,” Agatha murmured. She rested her forehead against Rio’s, eyes shut.</p><p>“No,” Rio assured her. “He actually apologized.” She pulled back slightly and bit her lip. “James mentioned something though,” she said. She waited until Agatha opened her eyes to continue, “He said he didn’t understand how Evanora treated you until he saw it, but the way he said it made it sound recent.”</p><p>Agatha winced. She made to pull away, but Rio kept her close. Agatha sighed and admitted, “We had dinner. Our monthly dinner.”</p><p>“You went?” Rio asked incredulously. She knew it would have happened about a week ago, but Agatha said she had a late meeting that day. Rio hadn’t thought anything of it, assuming Agatha would have rather slit her throat than go. “Agatha–”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about it right now,” Agatha said quickly. She squeezed her eyes shut and sighed. Her gaze was apologetic when she looked at Rio again. “I know I should have told you. It was just– It was really bad, and I’m still trying to process it, but I promise I will talk to you about it when I’m ready.”</p><p>Rio sighed, torn between worry and anger. “You can talk to me too, you know.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said When Rio only stared, she repeated more emphatically, “I know. It’s not easy though. Not because of you, but because of, well,” Agatha waved around them. She smiled weakly. “I’m working on it.”</p><p>“I am too,” Rio said. She wanted to push a little more, but she also knew they had time. They had all the time they wanted now. “We’re okay though. I’m okay. I promise. This was good. I needed it.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said again, much more softly than before. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too,” Rio said. She kissed her again. “Now, we can talk more later. Come on. You aren’t getting out of the movie marathon that easily.” She took Agatha’s hand and dragged her into the living room where Nicky was already sitting on the couch. He looked at Rio uneasily, shoulders tense. Rio rolled her eyes. “Stop looking like I’m about to leave. I’m not going anywhere, okay?” She sat down next to him on the couch and pulled Agatha down too. “Now, let’s educate Agatha on Star Wars.”</p><p>It was a nice mental break, these movies. Rio had watched them obsessively when she was younger, so it was easy to just fall back into them while also not having to give them her full attention. Besides, it was much more fun watching Agatha’s reactions. Rio could have watched Agatha do anything at all, honestly. Some part of her still couldn’t believe they were together now.</p><p>“It’s fun,” was all Agatha said after they finished <em> A New Hope </em>, much to Nicky’s chagrin, but she was entirely engrossed as the next movie began. </p><p>“You know, Alice always throws a party for Halloween,” Rio said. On screen, the characters were scrambling around on their ship, trying to escape their rebel base before they were caught. “I think I’ve found our costumes for this year.”</p><p>“Mom should be Han,” Nicky said. </p><p>“What makes you say that?” Agatha asked, crossing her arms over her chest. “You don’t think I’m princess material?”</p><p>Nicky just rolled his eyes, saying, “Come on, Mom. Charming scoundrel who likes to act like they don’t care, but in reality, they care a lot? Who does that sound like?”</p><p>“Oh, he’s got you there,” Rio laughed.</p><p>“Scoundrel?” Agatha scoffed, only to sound just as Han did when he said, <em> Who’s scruffy-looking? </em></p><p>Rio and Nicky barely made eye contact with each other before they both burst into laughter. It was the effortless kind of joy that warmed Rio to the core, making it impossible to dim the smile that overtook her face.</p><p>As she sat back on the couch, Rio listened to Agatha and Nicky argue over their supposed costumes. Nicky was saying something about pants while Agatha pretended to be annoyed. Rio could tell she was just pretending because when Agatha was actually annoyed, her left eyebrow twitched. As it was, Agatha looked as though she were fighting back a smile, hand resting on Rio’s thigh. </p><p>Rio leaned more heavily against Agatha, and Agatha did not react beyond moving her arm to let her rest more comfortably. </p><p>Not for the first time, Rio found herself surprised but content at the family she’d found. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt pretty damn close, and while Rio knew there was still plenty they had to deal with, they had each other. She didn’t have to bear the weight on her shoulders, and everything that encompassed, alone anymore. </p><p>Without stress or worry, Rio allowed herself to imagine the future. She imagined a future where she got to marry Agatha and watch Nicky graduate high school and college and whatever else he might pursue. She imagined a future where she spent every day being herself, no longer bending every time someone asked something of her. She imagined a future where she was happy and realized that was something she’d almost given up on.</p><p>“I think I’ll be Luke,” Nicky proclaimed. “Then we can have the original trio.”</p><p>“Are you sure you aren’t more like that uptight gold robot?” Agatha teased.</p><p>Nicky gaped at her, “Hey! I am not that annoying!”</p><p>Rio smiled as Agatha started listing off Nicky’s annoying habits, like leaving cabinet doors open. In return, Nicky started naming Agatha’s worser habits, like leaving the stove on. Eventually, the two of them turned to Rio as their tie breaker, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh, full of an indescribable love.</p><p>No, Rio wasn’t afraid of the future at all anymore. In fact, she couldn’t wait to live it.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>It was nearly six in the evening when Rio bit back a yawn, shrugging a hoodie over her scrubs. As her shift came to a close, she checked her phone and found two texts from Agatha, six texts from Alice, and a single text from Nicky that was a photo of him waiting for her in the hospital lobby. Rio smiled and sent the photo to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stretched her arms over her head as she headed to the elevator, grunting softly as she let her arms fall back down. It’d been a long day, but even though it’d been nearly seven months since Rio returned to the hospital full time, she still couldn’t help but cherish the fact that she was working at all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Walking into the lobby, Rio easily spotted Nicky in one of the chairs with a book in his lap. He looked so mature, Rio thought wistfully. Over the last year, he’d grown an extra inch and lost the last of his baby fat around his cheeks. Now, he had the same sharp, handsome features as Agatha. As if sensing her stare, Nicky looked up and grinned. He still had the same smile too, and Rio fondly returned it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You took forever,” Nicky said as they left the hospital. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Surgery went a little long,” Rio explained. She waited for him to get into the town car before she followed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio still didn’t love being driven around, much more used to public transit, but that was one of the things Agatha insisted on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have the money,” Agatha argued. “Why waste your time waiting on unreliable trains and buses when you can be safe in a car at your disposal at any time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had no logical counters to that, so she’d conceded. Whenever she worked or went out with Nicky or Agatha, she rode in the town car. Sometimes though, on her days off when she went out alone, Rio would take the train just for the hell of it. It always brought her a nostalgic feeling. Not to mention, she liked to people watch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The town car did have its benefits though, such as stretching out on comfy, leather seats after a shift and having the privacy to talk to Nicky freely about their days. More and more often, their conversations revolved around college, and Rio wasn’t sure how Agatha was handling it when it was already making Rio feel a little weepy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky was a good sport about it though, indulging them in spending more and more time together as a family. It certainly helped that they were still trying to get through all of the different movies and shows that the Star Wars universe had. Nicky was always happy to watch those. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you know what’s for dinner?” Nicky asked as the car pulled up to their apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not a clue,” Rio said. “Agatha was home early today though, so I think she mentioned cooking something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope it’s lamb chops.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know she only makes that for special occasions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I leave for college in thirty-eight days,” Nicky said. “Every day is a special occasion.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head and thought about it for a moment. “That excuse might actually work,” she said. “Try it on your mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As per their usual routine when they came home from the hospital together, they dumped their stuff by the door, much to Agatha’s persistent exasperation, and went their separate ways. Nicky went to his bedroom while Rio stopped to see Agatha before she took a shower. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight, Rio found Agatha in the kitchen. She stood at the stove, still in slacks and a blouse, but her hair was pulled back into a ponytail, and she wore an old apron. Rio smiled and walked up to her, wrapping her arms around her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, baby,” Rio murmured. She kissed Agatha’s cheek and rested her chin on her shoulder. “What are you making?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Risotto,” Agatha said. She turned just enough to kiss Rio properly before she refocused on the food. “How was work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We had an emergency at the end of my shift, but nothing too crazy,” Rio said. “What about you? Why’d your day end so early?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A couple suddenly decided to give it another shot,” Agatha said dryly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted and buried her face in Agatha’s neck. She nuzzled the soft skin there for a moment then pulled away. “I’m going to hop in the shower,” Rio told her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got time before dinner’s ready,” Agatha nodded. “Bring me a t-shirt when you come back out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a lazy salute and slipped away to their bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What had once been solely Agatha’s apartment, then Agatha and Nicky’s, was now truly Agatha, Rio, and Nicky’s. It wasn’t any kind of big, overt change aside from a plush green couch in the living room. It was all of Rio’s little things that made it feel like home. One of her books here, one of her hair clips there. There was the throw blanket she’d had since college sitting on the couch, and there was a framed photo of a younger Rio at her white coat ceremony on a shelf. Rio was everywhere in the apartment, and Agatha and Nicky only ever encouraged her to allow more of herself in the place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio wandered back into the kitchen after her shower, Nicky was sitting at the dining table with his phone while Agatha was plating the food. Agatha traded the plates for the shirt Rio was holding, leaving Rio to bring the plates to the table and Nicky to grab the silverware. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dinners together were routine now, no longer the elusive event that Rio craved. Almost every week night, and most weekends too, the three of them sat together. Some nights were quieter than others. They got tired and overwhelmed, merely shoveling food into their mouths before they slept. Other nights were loud with laughter and banter. Between the three of them, there was usually at least one story to tell, and Rio always loved hearing about their days, even if it included hearing the same story twice sometimes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia called earlier,” Agatha said. “She said she has everything prepared for us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t wait,” Nicky grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them were finally going to visit Lilia in Italy this summer. It seemed like a fitting last trip together before Nicky left for college, and ever since they told him, Nicky had been talking about it non-stop. He’d even made a loose itinerary of everything he wanted to see. When she saw it, Agatha had snorted and remarked that he definitely didn’t get that kind of planning from her. Rio thought it was sweet though, obligingly helping Nicky with the logistics of some of the places he wanted to visit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure I can’t go by myself for a few days?” Nicky asked, probably for the tenth time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure,” Agatha said without missing a beat. “Why do you need to go by yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m an adult now,” Nicky replied. “I want to stay in a hostel and spread my wings or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or whatever,” Agatha repeated with a smirk. “How convincing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Nicky said. “Are you really going to turn down a few nights alone with Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t drag me into this,” Rio said, cheeks reddening at his implication.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, much less embarrassed by this angle of coercion, bluntly said, “Who says I won’t still have sex with Rio while we’re all in the same suite?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Rio exclaimed while Nicky gagged and wailed, “Mom! Gross!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You brought it up,” Agatha said, far too smug as she pointed her fork at Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened to when you used to let me close my eyes and cover my ears when you would just kiss Rio?” Nicky lamented.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I stopped caring when you started using our sex life against us,” Agatha replied pointedly. “Now, eat your asparagus.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky rolled his eyes, but he still ate his asparagus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Although movie nights were common in their house, Nicky and Rio agreed to skip tonight. Nicky wanted to read his new book, and Rio wanted to go to sleep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t forget your mom and me have that thing tomorrow,” Rio told Nicky. The two of them were cleaning up the kitchen while Agatha showered and got ready for bed. “You’re still going to the movies with your friends, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Nicky nodded. He put the last of the dishes in the dishwasher and turned it on. “Movie’s at like four. We’ll probably eat dinner and hang out after.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled a twenty dollar bill from her wallet and handed it to him, saying, “Curfew’s still midnight, even if we’re not home by then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Actually, can I sleep over at Matt’s?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That should be fine, but double check with your mom in the morning,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky took the money and grinned, “Thanks. This is why you’re my favorite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t let your mom hear you say that,” Rio laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She won’t mind,” Nicky grinned. “You’re her favorite too.” He ducked just in time to dodge the dish towel Rio chucked at his head. He picked it up and tossed it back to her. “Night, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Night, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio walked into the bedroom, Agatha was still in their bathroom. She crawled into bed and laid down on her back. She shut her eyes for what she swore was only a minute, but then the next thing she knew, Agatha was crawling on top of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, sleepyhead,” Agatha smiled. The only light on was the lamp, casting her in a warm glow. Agatha pressed a light kiss to her lips before she curled against her, head on Rio’s shoulder. “Did you remember to set your alarm?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, making Agatha smirk. She rolled off Rio for a moment. “Thanks, baby,” Rio said. “I go in at six, so can you make it four-thirty?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Done,” Agatha said. She moved back on top of Rio. “Where would you be without me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed a kiss to the top of Agatha’s head. “Jobless,” Rio said dryly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed and wrapped an arm around Rio’s waist, and it was like that they fell asleep.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . .</span>
</p><p>
<span>Forcing a smile, Rio desperately wished she was at the movies with Nicky instead of this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This being a work function of Agatha’s where the food was small, the alcohol was plentiful, and the people were a little too similar to Rio and Agatha’s families to provide any kind of ease. </span>
</p><p>
<span>An hour had already passed, and Rio knew she only had to make it one more before it was acceptable for them to leave. It was going to be an interminably long hour though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you deal with this every day?” Rio asked under her breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her hand and squeezed it with a sympathetic grimace. “I don’t,” Agatha said. “I’m usually locked in my office, so none of these people actually talk to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What I wouldn’t give to be locked in an office right now,” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can arrange that,” Agatha said with a devilish grin. “With me in there too, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, “Oh, and what would be doing in this office?” She slid a hand beneath Agatha’s blazer, letting it rest against the small of her back. She brushed her lips against Agatha’s ear as she teased, “Paperwork?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve done the impossible,” Agatha muttered. “You’ve made paperwork sound sexy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and let her hand fall back to her side. If she left her hand there, she knew she’d most likely move it somewhere less appropriate than her back. Agatha would likely encourage that, but Rio, even after growing more comfortable with their relationship and her sexuality, was still fairly reserved when it came to any public displays of affection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, there you are!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to see Jen, perhaps the only coworker Agatha could tolerate, walking up to them. The two of them had met a handful of times before when Rio would come visit Agatha for lunch, and for the most part, they got along well. That wasn’t a surprise though. Although they’d both kill her for pointing it out, Agatha and Jen were pretty similar with their sass, intelligence, and hot-headedness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where else would I be?” Agatha replied. She rolled her eyes, but she still accepted the glass of champagne Jen gave her. “How much have you had to drink?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve only had one, mother,” Jen said. She rolled her eyes too, and Rio just barely refrained from laughing.  “I’m going to need at least three more to make it through the night though.” She plucked a glass off a passing tray and took a lengthy sip. Agatha snorted. Jen ignored her, addressing Rio, “How are you? I see Agatha convinced you to let her show you off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Show me off?” Rio repeated curiously. She glanced at Agatha, who suddenly looked very busy trying to track down another glass of champagne. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Jen said. She waved her glass as she spoke. “I mean, we already all knew about you because of the papers, but Agatha also just never shuts up about you. It’s always something about you or her son, but it’s usually you since she’s really private about Nicky.” Jen leaned in closer to say, “We’ve started calling you Saint Rio around the office. Partially, it’s because Agatha makes you sound like one, but mainly, it’s because you’ve made Agatha less of a nightmare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face felt hot when Agatha finally cut in, saying, “You’re exaggerating, Jennifer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not even a little bit,” Jen shot back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m definitely not a saint,” Rio said. “Not even close, really.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen snorted, “If you have the patience to date Agatha, you’re closer than you think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second hour passed quickly with Jen to keep them company, and by the time Agatha was doing her rounds to say goodbye to everyone of importance, Rio was ready to kick off her heels and land face first into their bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a parting hug to Jen, Rio excused herself to the restroom, hoping to avoid any more conversation before they left. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The restroom was thankfully empty, so after going, Rio lingered in there. She wished she could splash some water on her face to wake herself a bit more, but she didn’t think leaving with running mascara would be a good look for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stifling a yawn, Rio turned to leave when Agatha walked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said. “Ready to go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Almost,” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha walked to her instead of the stalls, Rio raised a brow. She let Agatha crowd her against the sink counter, resting her hands on the edge. “What are you up to?” Rio asked, even though she already had a pretty good idea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been waiting all night for this,” Agatha said. She dragged her hands up Rio’s side and bit her lip. “Have I told you how good you look tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only about thirty times,” Rio laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was wearing a satin green dress, a soft sage color. Although it was a modest length that went to the middle of her calves, the thin straps left her shoulders bare and the slit in the skirt teased at quite a bit of leg, held only together with string tied into a bow. When Rio first walked out in the dress, she thought Agatha was about to tackle her to the bed right then and there. Now that she thought about it, it was a miracle Agatha waited this long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll tell you thirty more times,” Agatha murmured. She breezed past Rio’s lips to press open-mouthed kisses along her jaw and down her neck. “You look fucking divine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio breathed, caught between begging and admonishing. However, most of the fight left her when her head fell back as Agatha nipped at her neck. “Let’s go home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha said. “Now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha” Rio tried again, only to moan as Agatha sucked on her pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you like this,” Agatha said. She found the tie holding Rio’s dress together at her thigh and got it one, definitive tug. The fabric parted easily, and Agatha slid her hand beneath it, palming Rio’s ass. Rio gasped, and Agatha grinned, purring, “Falling apart in my hands.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha’s hand finally brushed against her center, Rio bit down hard on her lower lip to keep from moaning. Agatha pressed a light kiss against Rio’s bobbing throat before she pulled back. Her eyes were slight with mischief as she pushed Rio’s underwear aside. “You’re always so proper and polite,” Agatha sighed. She pushed a finger into Rio, making her let out a strangled cry. “That’s what makes it even hotter when I make you snap.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand flew from the counter, fisting in Agatha’s sheer blouse instead. She yanked her closer and kissed her hard as Agatha eased another finger into her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It shouldn’t have been so hot, but Rio felt like she could explode as Agatha fucked her against the sink. Even as they slowly but methodically experimented with each other, they had never done anything quite so public. Rio surprised herself by how excited she was by the idea of someone possibly walking in and seeing them like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to notice this too because she broke away from their kiss to whisper in Rio’s ear, breath hot against it, “You want someone to walk in, don’t you? To see you lose all your decorum just for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio whimpered. Her hips rolled against her hand, only to jerk when Agatha’s thumb brushed over her clit. “Please. I’m getting close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you are, baby,” Agatha hummed. “You’re so wet at the thought of someone seeing you like this. You love the idea of someone seeing that you’re mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a choked whine. “Yes,” she breathed. “I’m yours. I want them to see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Agatha who moaned this time, burying her face against Rio’s neck. “They’ll see,” Agatha said, so quietly that Rio almost didn’t hear her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t know what she was talking about at first, but then, Agatha’s teeth sank into her neck. The sudden, sharp pain mixed with the pleasure made Rio come with a yell that was definitely loud enough to be heard through the door. She didn’t care though, head spinning, as Agatha worked her through her orgasm, hand slowing until Rio was slumped against the sink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With hooded eyes, Rio watched as Agatha pulled her hand away and sucked on her fingers with a self-satisfied grin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope whoever was waiting for the restroom heard you,” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, but she pulled Agatha back to her and kissed her. She sighed at the taste of herself on Agatha’s tongue and maneuvered them so Agatha was the one against the sink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just couldn’t wait until we got home, could you?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you blame me?” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit on her lower lip gently, smirking when Agatha tried to chase her lips as she pulled away. “Yes,” Rio said. Her hands were quick and rough, undoing Agatha’s belt and pulling her pants down. She left the black lace underwear where it was though as she knelt down and pressed her mouth against Agatha.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand went to Rio’s head immediately, pressing her closer. Her mouth fell open as she tipped her head back and widened her legs as much as she could. “Fuck, just like that,” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio licked and sucked at the already damp fabric until it was soaked with her own spit and Agatha’s arousal. She kept going without moving it aside, feeling Agatha grow more and more impatient at the lack of direct contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Agatha went to pull her underwear down herself, Rio pulled away. Her face was flushed, but it was nothing in comparison to the bright pink of Agatha’s face. She was exactly where Rio wanted her. Rio wiped her mouth and stood up, pulling Agatha’s pants up as she went. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flew open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Going home,” Rio said, smiling sweetly. She zipped up Agatha’s pants and redid her belt for her. “Unlike you, I can wait.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gaped at her, and Rio could see the way she fought between frustration and admiration. There was also an undeniable undercurrent of desire beneath it all too. Rio continued to smile. She stepped forward and kissed Agatha lightly on the lips. “Home?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to say something then closed it. She shook her head and wrapped a possessive arm around Rio’s waist. “And people think you’re the innocent one,” Agatha sighed. She pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek then whispered in her ear, “You owe me for this little stunt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio replied. She smoothed a hand over Agatha’s blouse. “And I promise by the time I’m done, you won’t have any complaints.”</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . .</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio’s birthday came around the following week, she didn’t think much of it. The previous year, amidst the fallout of the divorce, Rio had a small celebration that consisted of dinner at home with Agatha and Nicky. That had been more than enough for her then, and she expected something similar this year too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, her birthday was different from the moment she woke up to Nicky crawling into bed with them. It wasn’t the first time he’d done it, but he usually did it to be annoying when they were still awake. Maybe it was a bad dream. Rio wasn’t awake enough to know if this was normal. Still, she blinked blearily at him as she scooted over to accommodate him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky?” Rio mumbled. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m okay,” Nicky assured her. He laid on his side, staring at her with wide, brown eyes. Even in a king-sized bed, he was getting a little too big for this. Rio didn’t complain though. She merely reached out and patted his arm. She was almost back asleep when Nicky whispered, “Happy birthday, mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whipped her head to stare at him, mouth falling open. She was awake now. She felt her throat close up as tears filled her eyes. Although she’d grown close with Nicky over the last year, she’d never once pushed the idea because she hadn’t wanted him to feel like he had to see her as his mom, just because she was dating Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite this, Rio had felt like his mom. She hugged him after a long day and curled up with him during a movie. She stayed up with him to study for a test and cooked dinner for him when Agatha was busy. She helped him apply for college and screamed when he got into his first pick. She gave him advice and sat with him when he got overwhelmed. She worried about him and cared for him. She loved him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio never thought she’d hear him call her ‘mom’ though. Hearing it now, Rio couldn’t help but burst into tears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom!” Nicky whispered, panicked, clearly talking to Agatha. He threw a hand back, hitting her. “You said it’d make her happy!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am,” Rio choked out. She messily wiped at her face and laughed at how snotty she was. She didn’t care though. “I’m so happy.” She opened her arms. “Come here.” She hugged Nicky close and felt more tears stream down her face. “I love you so much, Nicky. Like you were my own.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky hugged her tighter and said, “I love you too, mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We get it,” Agatha groaned from the other side of the bed. “She’s your mom. Can we go back to sleep now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Nicky laughed quietly. Nicky rolled over and threw his arms around Agatha, who protested and tried to push him off. After a few moments of wrestling, Agatha let out an aggrieved sigh and finally relaxed, leaving Nicky’s arms around her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Happy birthday, Rio,” Agatha said, voice lazy with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio curled on her side to watch her two favorite people, wondering how she got so lucky to have them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she woke up again a few hours later, the bed was empty except for her, but Rio could hear the clatter of pans and plates from the kitchen. She got ready for the day, changing into a pair of shorts and a button-up, before she headed out to find an omelet and thick slices of bacon waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All for me?” Rio grinned. She kissed Agatha as she took her plate, murmuring her thanks. She sat down next to Nicky, who looked adorably shy after his stunt this morning. “Morning, Nicky,” Rio said lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky blushed and mumbled, “Morning, mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin grew, but she decided to give him a break. She ate a bite of her omelet then asked Agatha, “What’s the plan for today?” When Agatha just stared at her with wide eyes, Rio rolled her eyes. “Come on. I know you.” She reached out and poked Nicky. “And you. What did you plan for my birthday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A picnic,” Agatha said with an annoyed sniff. “At the park. I made sandwiches and cut fruit and everything already. Afterwards, we’ll eat your favorite Thai food for dinner and finish Andor. Then, Nicky is going to Matt’s to sleepover and won’t be back until tomorrow afternoon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome,” Nicky said pointedly, only to wince when Agatha cuffed him upside the head. He rubbed the spot and said, “Don’t worry. I got you an actual gift too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, you sure did raise a good one,” Rio said dryly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia had him the first twelve years,” Agatha said. “Blame her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Blame her for what?” Nicky huffed. “I’m great!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Agatha shared a look before Rio smiled and finished her breakfast. She went to wash her dishes when she was done, but Nicky whisked them away and shooed her to the living room. Rio tried to steal them back, but Nicky started loudly singing some awful pop song until she gave up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally left the apartment a couple of hours later, it was a beautiful day out. Rio walked hand-in-hand with Agatha through the park while Nicky was ahead of them. Other families were out as well, which is why Rio didn’t think much of the fact that Nicky was leading them to an area where a small group was already sitting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, as they drew closer, Rio realized she recognized them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miguel?” Rio gasped. “Sofia?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let go of Agatha’s hand to catch Sofa, who launched herself into Rio’s arms. She could hardly believe it. Sofia, so much taller now, was really here. Rio hadn’t spoken to her since the day she left her family in Texas. Although Miguel had called a few times over the last year, Victor had refused to answer any of her messages, obviously unhappy with her decision to divorce James. Gabriel had merely texted her something supportive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What–” Rio tried again, only to find herself still at a loss. She looked around at the grinning faces around her. “How?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miguel reached out to me,” Agatha explained. “He’s been wanting to see you, and what better time than your birthday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But Sofia,” Rio said. She looked at Miguel now. “I know Victor wouldn’t allow this. Where does he think she is right now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With family,” Sofia said innocently. “Which isn’t a lie. Technically.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Miguel came to Rio’s side, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. “It was easy,” Miguel told her. “Easier than I thought, honestly. I flew from LA to Boston to visit Victor, and while I was there, I suggested a day trip to New York for some bonding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He agreed to that?” Rio found that hard to believe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It took a lot of arguing,” Miguel said. He ruffled Sofia’s hair and added, “Plus, this one has some pretty damn convincing puppy dog eyes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Sofia beamed. She looked back up at Rio and smiled shyly at her. “Are you happy? Was it a good surprise? I’ve missed you, tía.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forced herself not to cry as she ran a hand over Sofia’s hair. “I’ve missed you too, Sofia. This is a very good surprise.” She kissed her cheek as well as Miguel’s. “I’m so happy you’re here. Both of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thirty-one is a big deal,” Miguel said with a wink. “We’re solidly in our thirties now, Rio. We have to accept we’re old now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, who was thirty-four, let out a pointed cough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Old but still beautiful and thriving,” Miguel hastily tacked on, making Rio laugh. “Now, let’s eat! Sofia and I stopped by a bakery on our way here and picked up some flan.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t stop smiling during the entirety of lunch. Although she’d spoken with Miguel over the phone, nothing could compare to spending time with him in person. He was so charismatic and charming, effusive with a contagious energy that made it impossible not to indulge him. Even Agatha, who was never fond of strangers, let alone strangers who were men, seemed to enjoy his company. It probably helped that Miguel had no shortage of embarrassing stories from when he and Rio were growing up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sofia was also an amazing addition to her birthday. Rio had been heartbroken when Victor hadn’t allowed any contact between them. She’d resigned herself to the fact that she’d only ever hear about her secondhand from Miguel, so seeing her today was an indescribable relief. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For the most part, Agatha and Nicky seemed content to sit back and let Rio have this time with her family, even taking several photos of the three of them and promising to develop them later for her. It made Rio feel like she might explode from happiness, feeling as though she was being spoiled with so many of her loved ones around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When a few hours had passed and it was almost time for Miguel and Sofia to leave, they presented her with a neatly wrapped gift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t have to get me anything,” Rio said. “Having you here is more than enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Miguel rolled his eyes and replied, “Just open the gift.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure what she expected, but when pulled away the wrapping paper to reveal a framed photo of herself with her parents, she felt her heart give a traitorous leap. It was an old photograph, one from when Rio was only a year old or so. She was squished between Luis and Paola, giving the camera a wide, gummy smile. They looked so happy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran a finger over the silver frame and asked quietly. “How did you get this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I couldn’t just take Sofia to New York and not visit your parents,” Miguel said. His smile had softened into something bittersweet. “Your dad gave it to me. Said I should have it.” When Rio’s head snapped up, Miguel shrugged and said, “I didn’t say we were going to see you, but I think he knew anyway. It is your birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would he do that?” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Miguel sighed, “Best case scenario? His first step towards amends. Worst case scenario? He doesn’t want to see it anymore, and I’m going to have to go back and trash his place on the way home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miguel,” Rio scolded, but a startled, pleased laugh was laced in it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get into the small places to help,” Sofia said. When Rio gave her a look, she said earnestly, “I think Miguel is right though. Maybe he wants to say sorry. He looked really sad when Miguel brought you up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Miguel sharply, who avoided her gaze. Sighing, Rio said to him, “Thank you.” It was for more than just the gift. It was for still talking to her, for coming, for bringing Sofia, for talking to her with her dad. It was for all of it. Miguel seemed to understand that and pulled her into a hug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With another round of hugs and kisses, Rio said good-bye to Miguel and Sofia. Miguel promised to visit again soon, and Sofia promised to email her. Apparently, Victor didn’t monitor her inbox, assuming she really only used it for school. Rio felt uneasy going around him, but her desire to keep contact with Sofia outweighed that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they were gone, Rio all but collapsed into Agatha’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for helping them be here,” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anytime,” Agatha said. She kissed Rio’s forehead and ran a hand through her hair. “It’s nice that you have them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miguel is cool,” Nicky said. “Maybe he can come to the apartment some time. I need to kick his ass in Mario Kart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Language,” Agatha and Rio said in unison, making Nicky roll his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” he said. “Can we go home now and finish Andor? I need to know what happens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you think, birthday girl?” Agatha said, pulling Rio to her feet. “Ready to see what happens to our rebels?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our rebels?” Rio grinned. “Are you finally admitting you like this stuff?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Don’t push it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the afternoon was spent on their couch, the three of them sprawled out and invested in watching the ending of their show. By the end of it, Rio and Nicky were openly crying while Agatha’s jaw was set in a way that Rio knew she was holding back tears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After cleaning themselves up, they had a simple dinner from Rio’s favorite Thai restaurant, and once that was done, Nicky was kissing their cheeks and heading out to Matt’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be home at three,” Nicky reminded them. “Three,” he stressed the timing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We heard you the first time,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky gave her a look. “Listen, I just don’t want to be scarred right before leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you should be,” Agatha retorted. “Rite of passage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a terrible mother,” Nicky sighed, but there was no truth behind his words. He grinned when Agatha went to swat him, ducking out the door before she could get to him. “Bye, moms!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Moms,” Rio repeated, smiling. She shut the door and leaned against it. “I could get used to that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha said. She walked closer and pressed Rio further against the door. “Because you’re stuck with us now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t before?” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He called you ‘mom’,” Agatha replied. She wore a small, delighted smile that made Rio’s heart quicken. “That means something, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do know,” Rio agreed quietly. She wove her fingers through Agatha’s hair and kissed her slowly. Then, she remembered something. “James texted me earlier.” It’d been around the time they got home from the park. Rio hadn’t mentioned it then, not wanting to ruin the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did he?” Agatha’s hands tightened on her hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just wishing me a happy birthday,” Rio said. “Nothing more.” She kissed Agatha’s jaw and reminded her, “I did the same for his birthday, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, and you made me do it too,” Agatha said. She turned her head to capture Rio’s lips, sighing against them. “Do you think he’s going to try and reach out soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Rio shrugged. “I think it’ll be with you first. A dinner or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it’ll be you first,” Agatha replied. “He likes you better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re his sister.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which is exactly why he likes you better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. There was no point in arguing over this again. Not when there were so many other, much more fun things they could be doing. She pulled Agatha back against her, kissing her deeply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time for your next gift?” Agatha asked, dragging her teeth along Rio’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, “I get another gift?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Agatha hummed. “Birthday sex is a given.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it now?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mhm, especially after what you did for me on my birthday,” Agatha said. She unbuttoned Rio’s shirt, lips trailing along the edge of her bra.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Months ago, for Agatha’s birthday, Rio took Agatha to a hotel and spa for the weekend. It seemed right to let Agatha have a few days where she didn’t have to worry about Nicky or work, so with Wanda’s help, Rio made it happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them spent a lot of time in the spa or by the pool, but what was the most memorable was what happened in their hotel room’s kitchen. It was there that Rio had laid Agatha out on the table and tasted various sweet sauces and syrups off her body, teasing her with her teeth and tongue until Agatha was begging. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Arguably, it’d been a gift for them both, but if Agatha wanted to return the favor, Rio certainly wasn’t going to complain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled off Rio’s shirt before she grabbed her by the waist and started walking them back to the bedroom. Agatha kissed Rio again, much more heated and impatient than before. Her voice was husky as she said, “I’m afraid I haven’t been as creative though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m happy with whatever,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sucked a mark at the base of her throat, nails digging into Rio’s sides. “Good, because I was thinking of an orgasm for every year you’ve been alive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thirty-one orgasms?” Rio laughed. “Agatha, come on. Like Miguel said, we’re not in our twenties anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m willing to try,” Agatha said. She pulled back and raised a brow. “Aren’t you, birthday girl?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio loved when Agatha got like this. Confident and hungry and determined to make Rio forget her own name. She ran her thumb along Agatha’s lower lip. She leaned forward and sucked it into her mouth, smiling at the low growl Agatha let out in response. Breaking away just enough to speak, Rio whispered, “If you want to try, who am I to stop you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha purred. She pushed Rio down onto the bed, making quick work of the rest of her clothes. When Rio tried to return the favor, Agatha batted her hands away and distracted her with her light bites along her thighs. “God, I love you,” Agatha said, just before sucking a mark on Rio’s inner thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you too,” Rio managed to say, just before she let out a gasp as Agatha’s tongue dragged against her center. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had Rio every way she could that night, using her mouth and fingers first then using her favorite strap and vibrator next. By the time Rio finally tapped out, exhausted and delirious from pleasure, she’d lost track of how many times she’d come. All she knew was that she felt like she could sleep for the next twenty-four hours and that she was definitely going to be sore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still with me?” Agatha said, stretching out beside her with an unbearably smug smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave an inarticulate moan. A sheen of sweat covered her body, and damp hair stuck to her neck. She wanted to shower, but she didn’t think she’d be able to move any time soon. The best she could do was roll closer to Agatha, resting her head on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed a kiss to the top of her head and stroked her hair gently. Rio relaxed further against her, lulled by the warmth of her body and the steady beat of her heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good birthday?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a lazy hum and curled closer to Agatha. She twirled a strand of Agatha’s hair around her finger, again and again, watching it with half-lidded eyes. She was content to lay like that forever, but eventually, Agatha helped her to the bathroom where she managed to convince her to go one more round, surrounded by the heady steam from the shower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for the best birthday,” Rio told Agatha once they were back in bed, dressed just in case they slept past the time when Nicky would come home. She kissed Agatha lightly and hoped Agatha could feel the love that felt as though it was pouring off of her. She kissed her once more before settling in to sleep, already imagining what future birthdays together could look like.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>. . .</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few days later found them at the airport very early in the morning. While Agatha checked their bags, Rio and Nicky were half-asleep in the chairs nearby. Rio had gotten off her shift late the previous night while Nicky had simply stayed up playing video games. They were both exhausted, dressed in matching Star Wars hoodies for the flight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finished and came to get them, she pulled Nicky up by his hood then much more gently helped Rio onto her feet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t you treat me a little nicer?” Nicky whined. “I’m your son.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re the one who decided to stay up until one,” Agatha replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I figured I’d sleep on the plane,” Nicky said. He adjusted his hood and gave her a half-hearted glare. “You know, beat jet lag.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you’re not on the plane yet,” Agatha said. Despite her curt words, she brushed a hand through Nicky’s hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked between the two of them, grabbing each of their arms to pull them along. “Enough arguing. Let’s go to the lounge. I’m starving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you eat dinner last night?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does a granola bar count?” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha made a disapproving click with her tongue, Nicky let out a low whistle and teased, “You’re in trouble now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can be in trouble together,” Rio said, slinging her arm around Nicky’s shoulders and pulling him down to her height. “Remember, Nicky, it’s us against her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head with an amused smile. She bumped her shoulder against Rio’s and said, “I’m right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I see you, and you look so beautiful for four in the morning,” Rio replied without missing a beat. She grinned when Agatha blushed, making Nicky snicker. It was astonishingly easy to fluster Agatha sometimes. Probably because Rio flirted less frequently than her, especially in front of others, so when she did, it always threw her off. That was part of the reason Rio kept doing it though. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they reached their lounge, Rio and Nicky made a beeline for the buffet. As she got her food, Rio made sure to grab extra of the things she knew Agatha also liked and grabbed two forks. She sat down at the table Agatha got for them and wordlessly handed her the other fork. Agatha smiled and took it, immediately going for the breakfast potatoes that filled nearly half of the plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There wasn’t too much time before their flight, and before Rio knew it, they were in line to board their plane.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t traveled much. When she was younger, it was an issue with money. When she was older, it was an issue with time. Now, Rio found herself lucky enough to have both, as well as people to spend them with. It was hard to believe how much her life had changed in the last year, even more so in the last two years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In front of her in line, Nicky already had his headphones on, absently bobbing his head. When he noticed her stare, he stuck his tongue out at her before he broke out into a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and stuck her tongue out back at him. She only stopped when Agatha gently elbowed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He started it,” Rio said immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not a very good excuse,” Agatha replied. She slipped her hand into Rio’s, intertwining their fingers. Rio could tell their early morning was starting to get to Agatha by the way she leaned against her. “What kind of example are you setting?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were the one dragging him by his hood an hour ago,” Rio reminded her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha merely shrugged, a smile on her lips. They both looked up as the line began to shuffle forward. “Ready?” Agatha asked, squeezing her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This wouldn’t be Rio’s first time to Italy, but it would be her first time there with Agatha, and it would be their first time traveling together too. Like every other first they’d experienced together, Rio found herself more than willing to dive in head first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, “Ready.”</span>
