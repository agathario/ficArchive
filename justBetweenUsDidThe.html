      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>More than once does Agatha put her hand on Rio’s right thigh, trying to catch up to where the song is, and it makes her skin prickle. She can’t remember ever being this physically close to her, arm against arm, legs touching, crouched over a book like teenage school girls.<br />On a scale of 1 to 10 - how hideous is it to fall in love with a married woman?</p><p>----------OR----------<br /><b>Rio takes a job as Agatha's nanny and house keeper for the winter. What she doesn't anticipate, is how hard she will fall for her.</b></p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I've been brooding over something for the past weeks - at first some of this was going to be part of a sugar baby au - but Agatha would have been SO deep in the closet that it was more like she was looking for a companion. Somehow this then evolved into this.</p><p>The one thing that really keeps me writing are your lovely comments, they really make my day and I already look forward to reading them 💜💚</p><p>Find me on tiktok as @daysofkit</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p> </p><p>Long, wavy, chestnut hair is all she dreams of lately.<br />Glimpses of it, as the golden autumn light hits it. Its lavender and rosemary smell - freshly washed and combed. She would die to brush that hair just once, feel it smoothly gliding through her fingers, listening to how it stretches through the brush only to jump back into its original waves instantaneously.</p><p>The mere thought of it creates a longing in her chest, one that makes her feel dizzy, almost incapable of breathing. She didn’t think one could want something – <em>someone</em> – so badly. She feels herself reduced to it – to this, to this want, this <em>need</em>.</p><p>The cold crisp air always helps, she finds. Like a cold shower. When she leaves, it’s what grounds her, tears her back to reality, to the real world where it doesn’t matter how much she wants Agatha, she’ll never have her, not today, not ever.</p><p>She glances back through the window one last time as she adjusts here shawl, her breath dancing in the air. She can see them in their kitchen, Nicky sitting on the cupboard next to the sink and Agatha filling a pot with water, listening to his musings.</p><p>
  <em>Look up. Just once, so I can see you. So, you can see me and how much I want you.</em>
</p><p>But Agatha doesn’t look up.<br />At least not until she walks away, back to her car, and leaves for the night.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Help wanted – September through January.<br />Looking for support in my (F 45) household with one child (M 5) and pet rabbit.<br />Must be flexible to work 3-5 days a week, possibly on short notice, car recommended.<br />No smokers please. Competitive rate.</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em>------------------------------------</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The advert stares at her from her grandmother’s church community center as she waits for her abuela to come out of the Friday service. It’s handwritten in a swirly, girl school font, while all the other adverts are printed, offering couches and play stations for sale.</p><p>She hesitates for a moment, but as she sees her grandmother exiting the prayer room, she quickly takes a picture of the Craftsbury phone number.<br />She only remembers it about a day later, when she is scrolling through her pictures, looking for the snapshot of a QR code she needs to post a return. She hesitates for a moment, unsure if being a household help is really her thing, but autumn and winter are always a slow season for her anyway, and she doesn’t want to waste it all on her grandmother’s living room couch again. So, she creates a contact with three question marks and starts writing a text.</p><p>
  <em>Hi, I saw your advert at Greensboro United Church – my name is Rio, I’m 29. Are you still looking for help with your kid?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She almost forgets about it immediately as she goes into Morristown and then Stowe to run her errands and only sees the reply later, when she is back in her car, about to open Google Maps to type in the address of her grandmother’s dry cleaner.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Hi Rio, yes, we’re still looking. Do you have time today to drop by to meet us? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She checks the time. The text is not even 45 minutes old.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I’m free now if that works, I’m in my car, I could stop right by?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She gets a reply immediately. It’s an address in Orleans County, just as expected. Not even 25 minutes from her.  As she looks down on herself, she hopes the black leggings and red sweater will do.</p><p> </p><p>The large, white house sits at the end of a long road, neighbors only to its right and separated by a long patch of grass covered in yellow leaves. It dons a star sprangled banner, as the season paints the landscape with vibrant hues of crimson, amber, and gold, the house's white clapboard siding contrasting beautifully with the rich colors of the surrounding oak trees. She’s not been to this neighborhood although she knows the area well. It all looks like it comes straight from a Vermont Indian Summer postcard.</p><p>She parks on the road and walks the last few steps on foot, entering through the white garden gate and walking up to the house, sunglasses shielding her from the afternoon setting sun. As she rings the doorbell, she tries to recall the rehearsed answers to any questions she might be asked, but the door is opened so fast she can’t even get to the first one.</p><p>The little boy standing in the door frame has shoulder length, brown hair, and big brown eyes. He is just tall enough to reach the door handle and eyes her curiously without saying a word. She can barely lift her hand to greet him before a woman appears from behind him, running through the hallway to get to them.</p><p>“Thank you so much for being so flexible with us,” she greets her, “you must be Rio?”, she extends a hand to her over the boy.</p><p>She’s dressed in all white, wearing golden jewelry, with long, brown hair that almost reaches her waist.</p><p>“Yes, and you are?”, Rio asks, taking it.</p><p>“Agatha. Agatha Harkness. And this is Nickolas,” she points to the boy.</p><p>“Nice to meet you both,” Rio puts her hands into the pockets of her trousers and looks at the boy who quickly waves his hand at her before running up the staircase to her right.</p><p>For a moment the woman seems to forget what they are here for and just looks at her, but then quickly steps aside, ushering her in.</p><p>“Please excuse the chaos, I honestly didn’t think you could come this quickly,” the woman apologizes as she leads Rio into a large living room and clears an armchair for her.</p><p>“No worries, please,” Rio waves it off and sits down as she takes off her sunglasses.</p><p>“Can I get you anything?”</p><p>“No, no I’m good. You have a lovely home, Miss Harkness.”</p><p>The woman smiles, “It’s Mrs Harkness, but please call me Agatha, I feel stupid enough already, hiring someone to help me in my own home,” she nervously tries to put a strand of chestnut hair behind her ear.</p><p>“No need to feel stupid, we all need help sometimes,” Rio tries to reassure her.</p><p>“Thank you, that’s very kind. So, my husband is on a longer assignment away from home for the next months, so he’ll just be around when he’s off, dropping in and out, and I really need help with Nicky and the house. I mostly work from upstairs, but I have to go into Montpellier to meet clients now and then, so it would be great to have you around on these days and maybe even when I’m here”, there is something hopeful in her face, her fingers entwining themselves with each other nervously. For a moment, Rio’s glance settles on them. They are long and slender with pointy nails painted in bright red.</p><p>“Sounds great to me. I used to babysit my nieces all the time when I was still in Philly. I live with my grandmother now, so I’m used to taking care of the household,” she tries.</p><p>“Brilliant,” her opposite let’s out a sigh of relief, “honestly, if you want the job, you have it, it’s been really hard to find someone sensible,” she offers and bites her lower lip.</p><p>“Yeah”, Rio scratches her head, “I’d love to,” she nods.</p><p>“Thank you so much,” her opposite sighs in relief, “do I need to speak to your current employer, or how long is you notice period?” Her eyes are almost sparkling.</p><p>“No worries there, I’m a contractor for a landscaping and gardening company, I don’t have anything really coming up for the colder season,” she simply waves it off and Agatha nods.</p><p>“So, does that mean you could start on Monday?”, she asks hesitantly.</p><p>Rio considers it for a moment.</p><p>“When do you want me to be here? Nine?”</p><p>“That would be perfect, I’ll set up a contract any everything tomorrow and send it to you. My husband is going to be here as well, so you can meet him before he leaves”, her smile is wide as she gets up and shakes Rio’s hand. It’s warm and tender, and Rio can feel the red nails softly scraping over her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>When she is back in her car with the New England sky slowly ushering in a pastel blue hour, her phone vibrates once more.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Thank you so much Rio, we’re really looking forward to Monday!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The corners of her lips form a careful smile as she opens up the contact in her phone again, replacing the three question marks with “<em>Agatha”</em>.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>She parks her car at exactly 8:55 AM and about a hundred yards away from the house. It’s rained overnight, the trees and grass are still awash with the remnants of it, carrying the earthy scent of wet leaves and damp soil. On her way up to the house, puddles reflect the kaleidoscope of autumn colors, while the ground is carpeted with fallen leaves, creating a satisfying crunch under her feet. In the distance she can still see the mist hanging over the hills, but slowly and surely, the sun is finally breaking through the clouds.</p><p>At the door she rings the bell just like she had two days ago, yet this time there is no speedy opening. Instead, she waits a good minute until the door swings open. A blush creeps onto her face as she realizes it’s Agatha herself this time, dressed in knee-high socks and a tight-fitting grey wool dress with a plush turtleneck, that hugs her hips in all the right ways.</p><p>“Good morning!”, she exclaims and immediately steps to the side, letting Rio in, “did you have a good rest of your weekend?”</p><p>“Yeah”, Rio exhales, “yeah it was good!”, she tries, watching Agatha close the door behind them.</p><p>She gives her a pair of slippers and hangs her coat before they walk into the dining room, where Nicky is sitting in front of an iPad, chewing on a banana, next to a middle-aged man, dressed in a suit and reading a magazine.</p><p>“Rio, this is Andrew, Nicky’s father,” Agatha introduces her, and Rio shakes his hand.</p><p>“Please to meet you, Agatha has been speaking very highly of you all Sunday.”</p><p>“Oh, I haven’t even done anything yet,” Rio puts down her bag, trying to hide another blush. She’s not good with compliments.</p><p>“Anyway, I was just waiting to meet you, I’m on my way out, might see you during the weekend, if you’re here then?”</p><p>Rio nods, “sure”, and steps aside as he gets up and wheels a small suitcase from the corner of the room back to the table.</p><p>“Bye buddy,” he puts a kiss on top of his son’s head and then walks over to Agatha and Rio tries to give them privacy as they move towards to the door together.</p><p>Instead, she sits down next to Nicky, observing what he is watching on his iPad. It’s a cartoon of some sorts and he barely notices her at first. Only when she silently waves a hand in front of his face does he look up.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio tries and lifts her eyebrows.</p><p>“Hi,” he says and stares at her.</p><p>“I mean this looks like a lot of fun, but if you want, we could play a game later, or paint something maybe?”</p><p>All of a sudden, his eyes light up and he pauses the cartoon.</p><p>“I could show you my new jigsaw puzzle set!”, he exclaims and sprints to what Rio assumes is his own room upstairs as she encourages him.</p><p>Just as she can hear his steps ascending the stairs, Agatha reappears in the dining room.</p><p>“Thank you for tearing him away from that thing, it’s getting harder every day,” she gestures towards the iPad and Rio chuckles, taking it away from the table and switching it off.</p><p>“I was thinking if you two want to play for a bit I could go over my emails real fast and then I could show you around the house and tell you what it is I’ll need help with?”, Agatha suggests as she starts cleaning off the breakfast plates and Rio gets up to help her, fingers lightly brushing as she hands Agatha a staple of saucers.</p><p>“Sounds very good to me indeed”, she offers.</p><p>The house seems larger on the inside than from the street, but then, in some way all the New England houses do. Rio tries not to audibly admire the cozy furniture and impeccable decorations too much, but it certainly leaves an impression as Agatha walks her around later, shows her the guest rooms, her office that looks like a cozy library with big windows overlooking their garden, and Nicky’s bedroom. They play with the pet bunny, Peanut Butter, for a while and Rio learns he’s really Agatha’s and not Nicky’s like she had assumed. He roams freely in Agatha’s study and let’s Rio pet him as Agatha holds him to her chest, those beautiful long fingers stroking his soft fur and ears.</p><p>Agatha points out storage closets and cupboards where Rio might find towels, tablecloths, and other tools. It turns out she actually has a cleaner that comes once a week, so at first Rio isn’t quite sure what else she is supposed to do except babysitting Nickolas, but it quickly seems that alone will take up most of her time. She doesn’t mind but suggest she can take care of washing and folding clothes as well, and judging by the face Agatha makes at it, she’s hit the nail on the head.</p><p>She also takes a look at their back yard, the way it gorgeously spreads out makes her heart beat a little faster. She suggests she can look after it as well, maybe together with Nicky, raking leaves and getting everything ready for winter.</p><p>“Go wild, please, we’ve never really had a green thumb,” Agatha laughs at it as they are both in wellies, taking a small walk on Rio’s fourth day with them, Nicky running ahead in his little yellow raincoat.</p><p>“Why did you move into a house with so much ground then?”, her hands are deep in her pockets hiding from the icy and damp morning air against her skin.</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms in front of herself, she is wearing a dark green hunting jacket, but it doesn’t seem well enough insulated, “we wanted to get away from Boston, give Nicky a nicer home to grow up in, I guess…”, she takes a break and then quietly adds: “I guess I had hoped I would take more time to be a better gardener and mother… instead I just work away like before and Andrew is gone most of the time.”</p><p>Something small breaks inside Rio.</p><p>“Why would you think you’re not a good mother?”, she stops them, gently putting her hand on Agatha’s arm, but retrieving it quickly, unsure about whether it is too intimate. Rio hasn’t spent a lot of time with them yet, but it’s been enough to see how much love Agatha carries in herself for her son. How she hugs him tightly when she comes back from Montpellier or when she helps him dress in the morning.</p><p>“I don’t come from a very happy home myself,” Agatha huffs, rolling her shoulders and absentmindedly watching Nicky as he tries to climb up into one of the old oak trees on the property finally waving at Rio from a branch.</p><p>“Careful there, buddy!”, she yells for him and Agatha chuckles, the heaviness of their conversation quickly vanishing. Rio makes a mental note of it still.</p><p>“Rio, can we go to the playground before lunch?”, he shouts.</p><p>“We sure can”, she replies and walks over to him to hold on to one of his hands as he jumps down again.</p><p>“Actually, would you mind going by the store to get some things as well, just some frozen pizzas, I don’t actually think we have anything for lunch,” Agatha asks and checks her phone, “I’ll give you my credit card, just get whatever he is excited for.”</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t tell Agatha, but she can do better than frozen pizza.</p><p>So instead, she quizzes Nicky on his favorite foods as he sits on the swing set of his favorite playground as she carefully pushes him back every time he comes swinging her way.</p><p>“Everything with pasta!”, he exclaims, high up in the air, “and meatballs!”</p><p>“You’re a big fan of Italian food then?”</p><p>“Yesssssss,” he hisses and adds, “in Boston, we ate Italian every day of the week!”</p><p>“Wow that’s a lot of Italian food,” she laughs, making sure she doesn’t push him to hard, so he doesn’t fall off.</p><p>“Mama really likes pumpkin soup though, with dumplings and bacon!”</p><p>Rio bites her lower lip.</p><p>Pumpkin soup it is then.</p><p>Even though it is not Italian, Nicky obediently helps her chop the vegetables when they are at the house again. Standing on his little stool, he is just tall enough to cut carrots into chunks that are way too big still as he tells Rio more about his friends back in Boston, his old school, and little league baseball team. She gets the idea he misses it.</p><p>When the soup is gently simmers on the stove, she shows him how to make German flour dumplings and lets him dig his fingers into the dough as he’s squealing with joy, pushing the mixture through his fingers and threatening Rio to wipe his hands on her sweater as she carefully scoops small mounts of dough into boiling water while watching bits of bacon fry up in a pan. It keeps him busy for a while and Rio is suddenly proud they haven’t even switched his iPad on all day.</p><p>“Go wash your hands now,” she gently asks him as she drains the dumplings and gathers three soup bowls to serve lunch. She can still hear him in the downstairs bathroom when she climbs the stairs up to the second floor where Agatha’s office is. Hesitating when she moves closer, she sees the door is slightly ajar and Agatha is pacing in her office, wearing a headset, but with her back turned to Rio. Her chestnut hair is open and she’s in that grey woolen dress again, the one that had almost taken Rio’s breath away on her first day and that clings to her hips and breasts just right. Rio’s mouth quickly dries up as she watches her swaying from one leg to the other, holding Peanut Butter to her chest, quietly speaking into her microphone. She feels like a pervert watching her like this, perfectly unguarded and undisturbed, all in her element.</p><p>Rio has learned she specializes in corporate law – in Boston she had supervised a large team of associates negotiating mergers and acquisitions until Andrew had asked her to take a step back as his work was taking him away from home more and more often. It seemed like Agatha had actually made the changes they had thought about when moving to upstate Vermont when he had not. It sent something spinning inside Rio every time she thought about it. Maybe she was partial though.</p><p>As Agatha spots her standing in the door her face lights up a little. She points to her headphones and lifts two of her long fingers, index and middle, to signal Rio she will be down again in two minutes.</p><p>It ends up taking her five, but it doesn’t matter, because the shape her mouth makes as she discovers a hot bowl of Hokkaido pumpkin soup with dumplings and bacon waiting for her, artfully garnished with sage and pumpkin seed oil, makes Rio’s chest cramp up tightly.</p><p>“How did you-”</p><p>“Nicky told me,” she reveals, “and he helped prepare it”.</p><p>Nicky proudly nods, a spoon full of soup in his mouth already and chewing on a piece of bacon as Agatha gathers her hair in a high bun.</p><p>She sits down, closes her eyes and breathes in deeply through her nose, humming, almost moaning at the smell and Rio feels her hand tighten around her spoon. As Agatha puts the first heap of soup into her mouth, she continues with the small noises she makes at it and Rio can see her little pink tongue darting out for just a moment.</p><p>
  <em>What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>“Rio this is so good, honestly!”, Agatha coos and puts another spoonful in her mouth.</p><p>“Oh- it’s nothing”, she replies quietly, trying to focus on her own bowl again and failing, wet drops of orange soup collecting on the table below.</p><p>“No, this is amazing, I don’t think I’ve had this in years, it’s delicious!”, Agatha shakes her head and bites into one of the dumplings, inadvertently squirting out some of its liquid.</p><p>
  <em>What the actual fuck.</em>
</p><p>“Please, I need the recipe”, she begs and Rio just nods, suddenly not hungry anymore.</p><p> </p><p>She clears the table in solitude later, thankful that Agatha is making Nicky take a shower upstairs. What the fuck is she doing here? It’s one thing for her to notice the beauty of other women, maybe even dwelling on it, enjoying it – but practically ogling a straight, married woman sixteen years older than her while she eats – what on earth has gotten into her? She wonders if it’s because she doesn’t get laid often now that she dwells in upstate Vermont, or if after all these years she’s developing a mommy kink, or a <em>milf</em> kink or whatever. It sends her head spinning again and not in a good way. And yet – she feels a velvety tingling in the tips of her fingers as she rubs her eyes, feels how there is something lovely about it all, about the connection she is making, the small bits of happiness she brings to them, and they bring to her.</p><p>She can work with that. She can keep this little crush or whatever it is to herself, she can enjoy all of this while staying professional. She swears she can, as she boxes and labels the leftovers and puts them into the fridge, staring at family photo magnets of the three of them.</p><p>She can do this.</p><p> </p><p>Later, when Nicky is done showering and Agatha puts him down for a quick afternoon nap, she is folding towels on the couch watching a true crime documentary to take her mind elsewhere for a while. At least until Agatha joins her downstairs, on her headset again, this time yelling at the person on the other end. Rio can’t see her as she walks straight into the kitchen, probably to get herself a cup of coffee, but it makes her pray she’ll stay on Agatha’s good graces, because hell hath no fury like that woman. It makes her smile. And her smile grows even wider when Agatha does walk in after all, muting herself, coffee in hand and mouthing <em>‘thank you’ </em>at Rio before she heads back upstairs.<br />She doesn’t see her for the next few hours and a part of her is thankful for it.</p><p> </p><p>It's already dark when she comes back downstairs, hair all loose and wavy again, one of her socks pulled almost all the way down.</p><p>“Rio do you like horses per chance?”, she asks as Rio looks up from the jigsaw puzzle Nicky is trying to finish on the living room table.</p><p>“Are we going to the stables again?”, Nicky asks excitedly before Rio can answer.</p><p>“I’m going to the stables on Sunday, you’re going to your baseball game with Daddy after church,” Agatha reminds him, focusing back on Rio, waiting for an answer.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever been around horses much, to be honest,” she shrugs.</p><p>“Well would you like to be?”, Agatha demands with a smile, “It’ll count towards your hours of course”, she quickly adds.</p><p>Rio has to think about it for a second but reminds herself of her resolutions from earlier in the day, the ones where she told herself she could handle this. “Sure. I didn’t know you had a horse?”</p><p>“We don’t, one of my friends does, she’s on vacation this week and asked me to look after Ephaba once or twice, I could really need some help, so I get it all done faster.”</p><p>Rio nods once more, showing a small smile.</p><p>“Perfect,” Agatha chimes, “I can take it from here today, I’ll walk you out. Don’t want to keep you till the cows come home.”</p><p> </p><p>“When do you want me to meet you?”, Rio asks as she puts her shoes and coat back on.</p><p>“Does 10:30 work for you?”, Agatha looks at her phone, probably updating her calendar.</p><p>“You sure you’ll be done with church by then? My grandmother’s service doesn’t usually finish until 11?”, she struggles as she tries to slip her boot back on.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t go to church, I just tolerate Andrew taking Nicky”, the face Agatha pulls is hilarious, the way her mouth twitches as if she’s disgusted by the thought of it. It makes Rio chuckle.</p><p>“Same”, she mumbles, and Agatha laughs at it, gently putting her hand on Rio’s upper arm.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t put a coat on as she walks her out to the garden gate, arms crossed in front of her chest.  As they reach the fence, Rio isn’t sure what to say, or why Agatha has even come out of the house at all. She’s almost ready to turn around and walk out with a quick goodbye, when Agatha’s hand is on her arm once again.</p><p>“Thank you so much again for cooking today, Rio, and the rest of it as well.”</p><p>“Just doing my job,” she knows it’s a weak attempt at faking indifference, “I put the leftovers into the fridge, should last you at least until tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha’s face lights up at that just before she squeezes Rio’s arm over her jacket one more time and starts turning around, to walk back to the house, giving her one last happy glance.</p><p>Rio closes her eyes and inhales deeply, the cold air filling her lungs and focusing on how the soles of her shoes feel on the ground.</p><p>She is almost back home when her phone lights up with a text from Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>You forgot your scarf! I’ll keep it save until Sunday.<br />A.</em>

  <p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>They forget about the scarf, of course. But it doesn’t matter. Not when Rio sits down in the front of Agatha’s G-Wagon and certainly not when she ends up sitting on top of a horse for the first time in her entire life.</p><p>The morning is colder than the last once more when Rio gets out of her tiny Subaru parked a little further up the road this time. When she walks over to the house Agatha is already waiting for her by the gate. She is back in her green hunting jacket and a black turtleneck with formfitting leggings peaking out from her shiny, black horsemen’s boots, checking her phone before looking up to greet her. Her hair is sleek for once, straightened, and soft over her right shoulder. The smile on her face is not as radiant as it has been all week.</p><p>Agatha carefully drives them along the narrow, tree-lined roads, as the mist is slowly lifting off the hills. The gentle morning light lazily breaks through canopy of autumn leaves above them, and Rio suddenly appreciates once more the change of the seasons, autumn resetting nature, getting it ready for new life to sprout, when others see only decay. Feeling herself drifting off, she tries to steal a glance at Agatha. She’s holding on tightly to the wheel, lips slightly parted as she is focusing on the windy road ahead. Rio wonders what else is going on in her head and shifts in her seat almost uncomfortably. They don’t speak for the entire drive.</p><p>When they park outside the horse ranch, Agatha pulls out her phone again before even looking at Rio, checks text messages or emails and finally sighs.</p><p>“I’ll be with you in just a minute, will you wait for me?”, there is something hopeful in her voice as she places her hand on the middle console next to Rios without noticing. Rio simply nods and watches as she closes the car door behind her, taking a call on her phone.</p><p>Through the window, she watches Agatha’s expression shift from annoyed to upset, her brow furrowing and her free hand moving in agitated gestures. The muffled sound of her raised voice reaches Rio inside, causing a tight knot to form in her stomach. She wants to reach out, to offer comfort, but something ties her down into her seat, she doesn’t want to invade Agatha’s privacy any more than she already is. The phone call carries on for another while, Agatha protectively propping up her left arm in front of herself, hiding her hand under her right elbow, the phone pressed to her ear. She turns around at last, looking towards Rio and the car before she hangs up and seems to take in a deep breath.</p><p>“Everything alright?”, Rio almost doesn’t dare asking when Agatha opens the door on her side of the car.</p><p>“Everything alright. I just need a break from my phone I think,” she mumbles, switches it off and puts it in the glove compartment before offering Rio a spare pair of equestrian boots that look more expensive than any other pair of shoes Rio has ever owned. When she has put them on Agatha smiles approvingly and extends a hand to her to help her out of the jeep. Rio takes it hesitantly and finally looks around to take in the scenery.</p><p>Settled in the lush pastures of upstate Vermont, the ranch extends over at least several acres. A grand, whitewashed barn stands as the centerpiece, its cupola topped with a weathervane shaped like a galloping horse. The manicured paddocks are enclosed by pristine, white fences, where several horses graze contentedly next to what Rio can only guess are outdoor horse-riding patches.</p><p>Agatha takes a large box out of her trunk before locking the car and walking towards the stables.</p><p>“So, you said you’ve never sat on a horse then?”, she asks as Rio follows her.</p><p>“No, way too posh a hobby for a family like mine,” she shrugs and looks over at Agatha.</p><p>“Well, if you want to you can try today?”, Agatha offers and it’s her first real smile of the day. Rio doesn’t have the heart to deny her.</p><p>“Let’s see later?”, she offers and Agatha nods, accepting the challenge.</p><p>Agatha leads her up an open path before they enter the stables from what seems to be the rear entrance. She walks ahead with Rio following carefully eying the horses that have lifted their heads out of their boxes, curiously observing their human guests. When Rio sees Agatha stopping in front of a box that seems to be empty from where she is standing, she quietly steps behind her employer as she carefully opens the gate. It takes her breath away. Elphaba is nothing short of beautiful – pitch black with shiny fur and a long mane that extends beyond her neck. Rio listens to Agatha’s soft voice mumbling greetings and careful praise at the mare, lovingly stroking her forehead and neck. She doesn’t dare to move as she sees how Agatha’s shoulders are slowly easing up and the shine returns to her eyes. She can’t help the warm feeling that surges in her chest.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha eventually whispers and beckons her to come in. Her warm palm wraps around Rio’s right hand and places it on Elphaba, showing her the motion in which she is to pet her, and it sends shivers down Rio’s spine, both because she’s never imagined she would enjoy being around a horse so much and because Agatha is so close she can smell her perfume over the odor of the stables.</p><p>“She likes you,” Agatha says and looks directly into Rio’s eyes. All she can do it nod and continue her small ministrations as Elphaba snorts softly.</p><p>“I’ll show you how to groom her while I clear out the box.”</p><p>“Are you sure? I really don’t think I should be doing that on my own,” Rio wavers.</p><p>“It’s not that hard, I promise,” Agatha winks at her and suddenly her hand is on Rio’s upper arm again, squeezing it gently.</p><p>
  <em>If you keep doing that, I swear my knees will give out.</em>
</p><p>They securely tie Elphaba up just a few steps away from her box and Agatha takes great care showing Rio how to properly groom her, taking all kinds of combs and brushes out of the big box she has brought from her car and guiding Rio’s hands over the mare’s body and mane with them. While Rio struggles to keep it all in mind, Agatha carries a large pitchfork into the box and begins lifting damp straw and litter into a wheelbarrow.</p><p>Elphaba’s soft, black coat feels beautiful under her fingers and distracts her from the way Agatha’s body bends over as it is laboring.</p><p>It takes them the better part of an hour, but Agatha thanks her several times for cutting the time in half as she finally lifts Elphaba’s saddle on to her back, fastening the girth under her belly. When she is done adjusting the headstall, she expectantly glances over to Rio.</p><p>“It’s now or never,” she chimes mischievously and feeds Elphaba a few treats.</p><p>Rio keeps chewing her lower lip as she steadily approaches the mare once more and Agatha adjusts the left stirrup for her. She gently places Rio’s hand on the top of the saddle while she holds on to the reins, then explains to her how to put her left foot in the stirrup and lift herself of the ground. Rio leaps for it, but the movement is foreign, and she suddenly regrets skipping too many leg days recently. She thinks about using it as an easy out before Agatha reassures her.</p><p>“Try one more time, you almost got there!”</p><p>She does get all the way up on her second try, but it’s not because she suddenly develops lower body strength, but because Agatha eagerly reaches for her buttocks just has Rio begins to pull herself up and keeps her hands there, almost squeezes them, pushing Rio up and into the saddle. She is sure her face is bright red when she finally sits down, absentmindedly reaching for the right stirrup with her foot.</p><p>“Well done!”, Agatha exclaims and there is no more tension in her face.</p><p>She leads Elphaba out of the stables and into the warm midday sun while Rio tries to hold on to the front of the saddle. The movements of the large body beneath her feel stunning, humbling almost and send jolts of excitement to her heart even though she hasn’t quite started to trust the animal won’t just bolt and make a run for it.</p><p>“How do you like it so far?”, Agatha asks and turns around to her.</p><p>“It’s amazing,” Rio admits and smiles down on her.</p><p>Agatha takes them up a path into and the fields, never too far away from the ranch, but with generous views of the surrounding hills.</p><p>“I’m glad you like it,” she says and adds, “I’m sorry I was in such a mood this morning.”</p><p>“No, no don’t feel bad, I- I wasn’t sure if you wanted to talk about it?”, Rio tries to offer.</p><p>“Oh, it’s nothing. It just gets on my nerves that Andrew takes Nicky to the same church my mother sometimes goes to with some of her congregation. I don’t like for her to be around him, and I disapprove of their general…”, she gestures with her free hand, “…gospel? I guess? It’s all so very… backwards.” She doesn’t look up again.</p><p>“I have a brother that goes to one of these churches… one with a more… fundamental doctrine. Thanksgiving’s gonna be fun again this year,” Rio huffs.</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear.”</p><p>“Nicky is a smart kid, he’s not gonna let this have an impression on himself, I’m sure.”</p><p>“I guess that’s what I’m hoping for,” Agatha lets out a sigh and stops them where they are, “thank you for coming out here with me today.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re paying me for this, I feel I should be the one being charged,” Rio laughs and pads Elphaba’s neck. It sends a grin to Agatha’s face.</p><p>The sky begins to darken a bit with clouds and a wind chill picks up when they start making their way down to the ranch. Instead of taking Elphaba to one of the outside riding patches, Agatha walks them into a quiet part of an indoor riding arena. It’s separated from a group of younger equestrians through three green lines spanning from one end to the other. She helps Rio dismount, this time thankfully with less attention to her butt cheeks, but therefore steadily holding her waist as she safely lands on the ground, her knees shaking a little.</p><p>“I’ll move her a little more just now, there is a small shop and café in the building next to where we parked, if you want to warm up?”, Agatha suggests.</p><p>“I’d rather watch you to be honest.” It’s out of Rio’s mouth before she can think it through.</p><p>Agatha raises and eyebrow but smiles warmly.</p><p>“Well, if you want you can sit down on the bleachers over there then, but don’t feel obliged to stay if you get bored.”</p><p>
  <em>I don’t think I will.</em>
</p><p>And she doesn’t. Agatha swings herself on top of Elphaba with so much more grace and practice it almost makes Rio jealous. As she sit’s down on the benches outside the arena, Agatha has already begun urging Elphaba into a slow trot, easily lifting herself in and out of the saddle as they move through the arena. Rio ignores the things it does to her, gingerly pressing her legs together as she starts to feel a light tingling between them and zipping up her jacket, hiding the lower part of her face, but never taking her eyes of off Agatha. She looks gorgeous like this. Hair in a high ponytail now, gloves on her hands with her fingers spread out and holding the reigns with total focus on the animal below her.</p><p>It’s graceful and royal and so much hotter than Rio had anticipated. She doesn’t even notice the crop Agatha is holding until she is using it on Elphaba, spurring her on to go faster into what Rio assumes is a smooth canter, but it makes her mouth go dry in an instant.</p><p>
  <em>Great, a (light) BDSM kink on top of it all now, absolutely fucking phantastic.</em>
</p><p>She had planned to take a video of Agatha to show her later, thinking she might like it, but it doesn’t feel right anymore in this context. She tries to commit it all to memory though. The way Agatha’s ponytail keeps hitting her shoulder blades like a whip, the soft slope of her hips, and how whatever sports bra she’s wearing is mostly keeping her breasts from bouncing. The things she want’s Agatha to do to her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is all sweaty with pink cheeks when she finally slows Elphaba down at last and comes to stand next to where Rio is still sitting on the Bleachers.</p><p>“I’m almost done,” she pants and wipes her forehead on her arm, “will you wait for me? Come down in here you can walk her back!” She beckons and Rio readily obliges, opening the high gate again and stepping into the arena while Agatha cools Elphaba down for a few rounds and finally dismounts her with a little jump.</p><p>With a bright smile on her face, she hands Rio the reigns and takes off her gloves.</p><p>“I hope I didn’t bore you to death up there,” she presses as they start walking back.</p><p>
  <em>Sure, you bored me to death with your body practically bouncing up and down for nobody else than me to see.</em>
</p><p>“Oh – no it… I’ve never been in an arena like this before,” she tries instead, focusing on her steps and Elphaba’s.</p><p>“I could teach you some day, you know?”</p><p>It’s a suggestion that carves a hole into her chest. She can’t admit how much she wants it.</p><p>“If you have the chance to take me up here again, yeah sure,” is all she can muster, but it makes Agatha smile again and for a moment that’s all that matters.</p><p> </p><p>She releases her hair from the ponytail again when they are back in the car later, large clouds now forming in the sky and the temperature dropping. Agatha doesn’t check her phone before they drive off and instead let’s Rio turn on the radio to a random station that plays old country songs.</p><p>“Immediately get a shower when you get home, or everything you touch will smell of horse,” she jokes as they leave the property.</p><p>“Oh don’t worry, my abuela is gonna put me under the garden hose,” Rio jokes and takes off the boots before slipping into her own shoes again.</p><p> </p><p>Hey grandmother <em>does</em> almost end up chasing her out of the house again when she comes back in. She barely makes it into the bathroom, promising to immediately wash all her clothes as soon as she’s showered. She eventually ends up on the floor next to the washing machine in the tiny laundry room at the back of the house. The noise of the cleaning drum is soothing in her ears, drowning out any unwanted thoughts for a while. Slowly but surely, she starts to feel how her muscles are getting sore, tender flesh beginning to ache pleasantly. And even though the ache is almost intertwined with Agatha she doesn’t think of her for the longest time, until her phone chimes quietly.</p><p>
  <em>Today was beautiful, thank you for taking my mind off things for a while, I needed that.<br />
Tuesday at 8? A.</em>
</p><p>Rio swallows hard. Then starts to write,</p><p>
  <em>
    <strike>I loved spending the day with you… </strike>
  </em>
</p><p>deletes it all again and finally sends it back to Agatha.</p><p>
  <em>Glad I could help. Tuesday at 8! Sleep well!</em>

  <p>Aching muscles have always had a way of putting Rio into a fast, deep sleep. The soreness is always warm and comforting and usually she doesn’t dream during those nights. Not this time though. Glimpses of long, tender fingers with red nails stroking sun kissed flesh reveal themselves to her, strands of long of auburn hair gliding through them, her own hand reaching out in the haze before she wakes just after four in the morning, panting, her throat dry. She doesn’t fall asleep again.</p><p>
  <em>This is a nightmare.</em>
</p><p>Over the days that follow, they settle into a rhythm that begins earlier and earlier, because as soon as Agatha figures out that Rio has a plethora of delicious breakfast recipes up her sleeve, she practically begs her to come before sunrise, sometimes even before Agatha is awake. She loves the feeling of stealing into the house at dawn; with her own key now, that Agatha has attached to a small crochet pendant of an Azalea.  She loves it when Nicky comes down first in his pajamas, hugging a stuffed animal and raising his arms, asking to be lifted up to the counter so he can watch her cook as he wakes up properly. She loves it even more when it’s Agatha who wakes up from the sound of the door and finds her in the kitchen, wearing nothing but her purple morning gown and makes her coffee with caramel syrup and thick, creamy condensed milk. She will usually sit on one of the highchairs, asking Rio what she is making for them, observing as she cooks and always offering to help. Rio never dares to spill too many of her secrets, there is a gnawing thought in the back of her head that once Agatha knows all her recipes, she won’t need her anymore.</p><p>These mornings together quicky start meaning a lot to her. She has never been a particularly early riser, but the mere thought of the hour she gets with Agatha, sipping sweet coffees and talking about nonsense <em>(the latest movie she has seen, something funny Nicky has done the other day, a fond childhood memory they both share)</em> has her waking up before her alarm.</p><p>The one thing that sometimes confuses Rio is how little she will speak of her husband. She only meets Andrew on more time on a Monday when she wasn’t even expecting to see him. He is on the phone already at 6:38 when she opens the door, standing in their living room. He raises a hand to greet her, but otherwise ignores her. When he leaves, he doesn’t say goodbye. It takes her a while to cheer Agatha up that morning, she won’t talk about what troubles her, but Rio can’t shake the feeling it’s because of him. It makes her mad.</p><p>The end of October approaches quickly and she feels like time suddenly runs much faster than before. She loves those last sunny days of the year just before Halloween, when all the houses are already decorated, and the entire afternoon of every day feels like golden hour. One morning after breakfast she looks out into the hills where the end of fall is quickly taking the reins. It’s the perfect day, and maybe even the last day to at least get the small flower beds at the back of the house ready for winter.</p><p>She employs Agatha and Nicky with raking in the leaves from the large trees on the property while she labors away, listening to their banter and watching them as Nickolas finds more joy in riding his rake like a broom instead of helping his mother. Rio is so enthralled by it, that she barely notices the humming in her gardening glove that grows louder and finally turns into a painful sting.</p><p>"Damn it," she hisses loudly and sees the poor animal that has stung her fall out of the glove, probably one of the last ones for the season. It's hurts like a bitch, the stinger still stuck in her skin.</p><p>"What happened?", she hears Agatha nearby, taking steps towards her.</p><p>"I think something stung me, it’s fine," Rio shakes her hand as she rises from her squat and tries to squeeze at the sting and pulling out the stinger. She is so wrapped up in it, she doesn't notice Agatha stepping in front of her, taking her hand into her slender fingers. And she is far too dumbfounded to react, when Agatha doesn't hesitate and brings Rio’s hand to her mouth, wet lips finding it and then gently sucking on it.</p><p>She can't help a quiet, surprised moan escaping her, eyes blown open wide at the sight of Agatha sucking the venom out of her hand. She blows up her nostrils and Agatha spits and wipes her mouth on her arm, only to return her mouth to Rio's hand to have at it again. Rio can't tear her eyes away from the way her lips work on her, grows instantly hot and wet from the feeling of it, completely forgetting about the sting, because every other feeling is suddenly swallowed up by Agatha's ministrations.</p><p>
  <em>Don't ever stop. Fuck, please don't ever stop.</em>
</p><p>For a moment she allows herself to imagine what Agatha's lips might feel like on other parts of her body, sucking other things into her mouth than just her hand. She can hear her own quickening heartbeat in her ears and prays Agatha doesn't notice it. Doesn't notice how she stares. Eventually, she does notice, looking up from where Rio's hand is still in her mouth and meeting her eyes, slowly loosening her grip, and spitting one more time as she releases Rio's hand.</p><p>"We should get you some ice; Nicky go get some ice from the fridge!", she shouts, still looking at Rio while Nickolas drops his rake running back into the house.</p><p>"Thank you," Rio breathes, finally looking at the small, red swelling she is developing.</p><p>"Does it hurt?"</p><p>"It kinda tickles now," she clears her throat and shakes her hand once more, not daring to look back into Agatha’s eyes. It hurts more than she wants to admit, but she doesn't want Agatha to think her labor was in vain.</p><p>She cools her hand with the ice pack Nicky gets her, sitting down at the table while Agatha cleans up the rest of the tools. She feels for the bee even though she knows with the approach of winter her time had run out now either way. As her fingers hover over the side of her hand, testing the tenderness of the flesh, the image of Agatha wrapping her mouth around it comes back to her and she swallows hard at the churning in her stomach. If this is what she thinks of the next time she takes care of herself, so be it. Nobody has to know.</p><p>"How are you feeling?", Agatha quietly asks as she comes back in through the garden doors.</p><p>"It's fine," Rio nods and looks at her.</p><p>Agatha seems like she contemplates what to say next, wavers and then shakes her head.</p><p>"Listen I need to meet with a client in town later, I was thinking you could take Nicky to the Farmer's Market and then we could get some dinner together, the three of us? If you feel up to it – I’d understand if you’d like to go home for the day."</p><p>“No, sounds great,” Rio nods encouragingly as Nicky joins them again, gingerly holding a band aid in hand that Rio lets him put on the sting.</p><p>“Thank you, mister.” She ruffles his hair with her other hand.</p><p> </p><p>When she helps Nicky get into his raincoat and boots later, she recognizes her red and white scarf from weeks ago, the one she had forgotten here in that very first week and makes a mental note to finally take it with her in the evening.</p><p>Agatha drops them off in the center of town, just where the farmer’s market blocks an entire street and texts Rio the address of the restaurant for later. She barely catches up to Nicky when she closes the car door, he has already made a run for the small petting zoo and gets all giddy petting a small, white-and-brown goat that comes up to him almost immediately.</p><p>“He almost looks like Peanut Butter with his markings, doesn’t he?”, he chants and Rio squats down to see the world from Nicky’s perspective.</p><p>“He does!”, she chuckles and pets the goat as well before they walk on to buy ice cream cones and sit down on hay balls propped up along the street, watching families and couples walk by as the air slowly grows colder.</p><p>“Nicky, do you know what your dad does for work?”, she asks him after a while, curiosity finally getting the better of her.</p><p>“He… manages…projects”.<br />Rio grins at how that must’ve come from the very back of his mind.</p><p>“And when he’s not at work, do you spend a lot of time with him?”</p><p>“Not as much as with you,” he picks something off his ice cream, maybe some dirt from the hay balls and smears it into a tissue Rio provides for him.</p><p>“And when you spend time together, what do you do?”, she continues, wiping his little fingers.</p><p>“I don’t know, we like… go to church, and we sometimes play baseball. And we’re going deer hunting next month.”</p><p>Rio raises a brow at that, “and is that something you’re looking forward to?”</p><p>Nicky looks away form her into the crowd, then on the ground, fumbling with is hand. He doesn’t need to answer for her to understand. Instead, she moves over to his hay ball and sits down close to him until he leans into her, absentmindedly finishing his ice cream.   </p><p>“Can I sit on your shoulders?”, he asks when she is cleaning off their hands with a sanitary wipe, and it takes her by surprise, and then not at all, really. She lifts him up like she has done countless times, and he works with her until she gets him situated between her shoulder blades, holding on to his hands at first and then trusting him and herself to balance enough for this to work.</p><p>He makes her laugh with silly fart jokes and curious observations of the people around him, steers her to the stalls he wants to check out and makes her buy him cookies and a soap bar that looks and smells like a piece of chocolate cake. When she realizes he is slowly getting more and more quiet, she sets him down from her shoulders only to pick him up once more, carrying him on her hip, while he wearily snuggles into her, slowly closing his eyes. When he gets too heavy to carry around, she finds a bench opposite the restaurant to sit down on, Nicky still napping in her lap, his face almost disappearing in his scarf and beanie. It’s how Agatha eventually finds them, bending down to him, lovingly stroking his hair, whispering sweet things to him until he finally wakes up again. Rio can only marvel at it, they way Agatha loves him so well, momentarily reduces her entire world to him.</p><p>
  <em>How could anyone not want you, not be completely and marvelously obsessed with you?</em>
</p><p>It almost frightens her, how this admiration, this silly little crush on Agatha seems to slowly take on different a color, one that make her swallow hard at that wide smile, the little wrinkles that form around her eyes and the soft music of her voice. One that lets her mind go blank for several seconds, leaving her completely at peace as she cradles Nickolas.</p><p>Later, in the dim light of the restaurant with Agatha studying her menu, Rio notices how she absentmindedly bites her lip, the fine lines life has left on her face exuding an effortless elegance. She daydreams about tracing the graceful edges of her jaw, feeling the strength and gentleness that seem to radiate from her every movement. She enjoys how Agatha orders for all of them, gently putting a hand on her arm – “let me take care of it” – and how her eyes glimmer afterwards – something Rio can only interpret as a woman that was born to be in charge reveling in the very feeling of it.</p><p>It's mesmerizing.</p><p>After dinner, Nicky holds on to both their hands as they quietly walk back to the car, something she hadn’t expected form a five-year-old, but she feels proud of him, there is no shame in his gentleness and need to be held. She wishes all little boys could know that feeling. It still twists something inside her stomach, and it doesn’t help when she notices Agatha smiling at her, mouthing a soft <em>thank you</em>.</p><p>Nicky falls asleep on the way back home. Rio watches him struggle to keep his eyes open through the rearview mirror as Agatha talks about her day and wants to know how they enjoyed the market. When they reach the house, a comfortable silence settles between them as Agatha checks her phone once more but not immediately opens the door.</p><p>“I hope your hand is doing okay again?”, she asks, taking it into her hand again before Rio can object.</p><p>“Y-yeah, I barely feel the sting anymore,” she murmurs, letting Agatha inspect it before she adds: “someone made good work of it sucking the venom out.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles at that and releases Rio’s hand.</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>If Rio squints, she can tell herself Agatha is blushing.</p><p>
  <em>If I don’t get out of here quickly, I’ll do something stupid.</em>
</p><p>She catches sight of Nicky again, fast asleep behind them.</p><p>“He’s so cute when he sleeps”, she smiles and releases her seatbelt. Walking out into the night, she opens his door and picks him up from his booster seat in the back, his arms instantly wrapping around her neck and shoulders, his face burying in her hair like earlier in the day. She enjoys this way too much.</p><p>“Mommy…”, he murmurs in his sleep, mistaking her for Agatha.</p><p>“Shhhhh, I’m just getting you to bed,” Rio whispers as Agatha takes their bags and leftovers out of the trunk, coming over to them and gently caressing his back.</p><p>There is an ethereal smile on her lips that Rio hasn’t seen before and it makes her chest ache for her even more, for this, days like these, the three of them. She sucks in a deep breath of cold air, pressing her eyes close for a second to get it out of her system, but it’s all-consuming.</p><p>
  <em>You’re playing house with a straight, married woman and her son. You’re disgusting.</em>
</p><p>She carries him upstairs and tucks him into his bed after carefully taking his shoes and jacket off, placing a kiss on his tiny forehead as Agatha watches from the door and closes it behind them. Like they do this every night, like Rio is a part of this, like this is <em>her</em> family. Like she is not just the <em>nanny</em>.</p><p>This isn’t helpful. This cant be healthy. She needs to get out of here as quickly as possible. </p><p>She forgets her scarf again. But it doesn’t matter. Because like a witch, Agatha has her under her spell.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p> </p><p>Just after Halloween, Jim from the landscaping company that frequently hires her calls her up and asks if she can take over some last-minute contracting work for him. It’s nothing exciting, just a hotel that wants bulbs planted for spring and some of their trees pruned, but it’s exactly what she specializes in, getting dead things out of places and making sure new life can sprout. More importantly, it gives her an excuse to get some distance between her and Agatha. She doesn’t like it, hesitantly asks if it’s about money and whether she can pay extra so Rio will turn down the job – and Rio knows how Agatha means it, she knows she means well, but it still makes her nauseous. Puts her back in her place; <em>the nanny, the help, all paid for.</em></p><p>It’s the smack she’s needed.</p><p>The cold air of the first days of winter helps her find the ground beneath her feet again. She comes home with light bruising on her knees and aching muscles every day, dirt still under her nails and windswept hair. She doesn’t bother with any make-up, no one cares if she wears lipstick. No one talks to her a whole lot either – it’s just her, the soil, and the sky.</p><p>The entire group finishes the day at a roadside bar every evening with a beer and a game of darts. She joins them every night, gets completely wasted once and makes out with a woman at least 10 years older than her just outside the backdoor. She already has her hands in the woman’s pants when she suddenly hears a car approaching and the mood shifts. She drives home alone and shows up half an hour late the next morning.</p><p>One evening she is texting a friend when she sees three dots appear behind Agatha’s name, as if she is typing something, stopping, the starting again. Whatever she is writing, she never sends it, so Rio doesn’t reach out either, no matter how much she wants to.</p><p> </p><p>When she goes back there the Wednesday of the following week it feels like she has been gone for both several months and mere hours alike. The house is still quiet when she slips in, exchanging her boots for a pair of slippers. She can see that a single small light in the living room is burning, probably still on from the night before, so she ignores it, first checking on the washing machines and grocery stockpiles, carefully adding to her mental to-do list: bunny feed, canned tomatoes, milk (<em>maybe – Agatha likes the skimmed stuff and they’re out of that</em>), and most importantly sugar. Only when she’s loaded the tumble dryer with wet towels does she walk through the living room into the kitchen.</p><p>She doesn’t get very far though. The reading light is not just on because someone forgot to put it out the night before – Agatha is curled up next to it on the couch under several blankets, a ginormous set of reading glasses on the tip of her nose, a book in her lap – and quite possibly wearing <em>lipstick</em> at what, 6.08am?</p><p>Rio almost shrieks.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, you scared me, why didn’t you say anything?”, she grips hat her chest.</p><p>“I didn’t want to scare you,” Agatha replies dryly, making Rio frown.</p><p>“Since when have you been sitting here? It’s like 6 in the morning?”</p><p>“I wanted to catch you before Nicky wakes up,” she explains, closing her book in a single motion that makes Rio swallow hard.</p><p>“Okay… have I done something wrong?”</p><p>“Curious. I wanted to ask you the same thing.”</p><p>“Uhm… no. No, we’re fine, really,” she tries.</p><p>Agatha nods and bites her lip like she isn’t buying it.</p><p>“Are you sure? Because it felt a little bit like it.”</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath. Her tummy is churning.</p><p>
  <em>What on earth is this?</em>
</p><p>“I rely on good business contacts, if I turn down jobs they will stop asking if I can contract for them.”</p><p>“What if you didn’t need to do that anymore?”, Agatha barely lets her finish. Her voice is louder than normal.</p><p>
  <em>What the fuck.</em>
</p><p>“What do you mean?”, Rio asks instead.</p><p>“What if you didn’t have to do that landscaping stuff anymore? What if you’d just come here full time, I’m happy to pay whatever you need.”</p><p>She doesn’t know what to say to that. Her mind just goes blank as she blinks. It takes a moment to sort through her thoughts.</p><p>“That’s a very kind offer, but Nicky starts school next year, right? So… will you even really need me then?”, she tries.</p><p>“Yes,” is all Agatha says without losing eye contact for even a second.</p><p>
  <em>Bossgirl much.</em>
</p><p>Rio scratches her cheek.</p><p>“Can I think about it?”, is the best she can offer in this flabbergasted state. She’ll need to unpack this later.</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha seems pleased at it. At least that’s something.</p><p>“Shall I make us coffee? I was hoping you could make French toast again for breakfast?”, all of a sudden, her voice is softer again. Rio has to swallow at it.</p><p>“Sure,” she replies and watches how Agatha gracefully gets out from under the blankets, revealing her black, see-through tights and a black skirt.</p><p>
  <em>This woman is going to be the death of her some day.</em>
</p><p>When Rio goes home that evening, she still can’t make sense of it. Heart pounding, she struggles to fall asleep, twists and turns beneath her sheets until, like so many nights recently, she reaches for the small pink vibrator in the third drawer of her nightstand, lays down on her belly and positions it between her thighs. She comes thinking of long fingers twirling brown locks of hair, the curve of Agatha’s breasts, and her low voice whispering things Rio would never dare saying out loud.</p><p>She falls asleep right afterwards without even feeling the need to clean up. And she doesn’t feel bad. She gets to fantasize about this. She gets to dream about this.</p><p> </p><p>Her dreams do come true all of a sudden when she carries a washing bin up the stairs one afternoon and hears quiet cussing from the master bedroom. As she walks by, she sees Agatha in her purple kimono, tearing through her hair with a brush using every curse word in the English language.</p><p>"You alright?", Rio checks.</p><p>"I'm gonna cut it all off, I'm literally going full Daisy Buchanan the next time I get the chance!", Agatha presses out and rips the brush through a strand of hair, not even looking at her.</p><p>"Wait no- what?" Rio drops the bin on the floor, the mere thought of Agatha cutting even a strand off her languish waves makes her feel sick. "You can't cut it all off, you don't mean that!", she interjects louder than she had meant to and pushes the door to the bedroom open further.</p><p>"Then how am I supposed to ever get through any of this without ripping it off?”, Agatha’s face is equal parts anguish and frustration as she finally looks over.</p><p>Rio wants to pretend the next words that leave her mouth aren't pre-meditated, that she hasn't thought about this a thousand times already.</p><p>"Let me take care of it," she extends her hand, silently asking for the brush.</p><p>As if commanded, Agatha gives it to her.</p><p>Rio has never seen the inside of Agatha's bedroom and she tries her best not to stare too much as Agatha sits down in front of her vanity and folds her hands, looking at Rio in the mirror. Her hands tremble as she takes the first strand of what must be at least two feet of freshly washed, but already dry, auburn curls into her hands and begins to brush it at its very end, slowly making her way up to Agatha's scalp. With every stoke she carefully avoids Agatha's reflection in the mirror as much as she can. She only looks up when she scans the vanity for more utensils and sees that Agatha has closed her eyes. It doesn't take long for her to start moaning quietly when Rio uses a comb on the top part of her scalp, gently making sure she doesn't hurt her as she makes her way around her head.</p><p>"Mmmmhm... you have no idea how good this feels Rio," she whispers, and it almost sounds like a prayer, fingers curled up into each other and all.</p><p>It sends warm jolts into Rio's belly as she works her way through all of Agatha's hair and then begins again until it is shiny, and Rio's hands smell like rosemary and lavender. It’s unbearably soft between her fingers as she lets it slip through them. Like water, it escapes her every time she feels like she’s finally got a hold of it – but she knows her hands have long absorbed Agatha’s hair oil and she will undoubtedly smell it on herself for the rest of the day. The thought of it makes her ache between her legs again.</p><p>For long minutes, the room feels like center of the known universe, with everything else revolving around them. When Rio sets down the brush, ready to tell her there should be no more knots in her hair, Agatha catches her wrist and makes her look up. From the sudden movement of her hand, Agatha’s kimono has fallen off her left shoulder, baring it, pink skin exposing itself obscenely. Agatha isn’t wearing anything underneath it.</p><p>“Please don’t stop.”</p><p>It’s no more than a whisper, but there is something in Agatha’s eyes that makes them shimmer, almost as if she is about to cry, so Rio swallows hard and obliges, picking up the brush again only to continue what she can now only describe as ministrations. She commits the way Agatha leans into it, tilts her head so Rio gets better access, to memory, dares not to breathe too loudly in case she might miss Agatha’s soft moans and she can barely take her eyes off the goosebumps on Agatha’s forearms or the ways her hands are cramping up almost - almost as if she is stopping herself from reaching out.</p><p>It haunts her. But she has no time to dwell on it when she hears Nicky shout her name from downstairs where she had left him with a new jigsaw puzzle. Looking down at her own hands, she quickly puts the brush back onto to the vanity as if it’s too hot to hold anymore.</p><p>
  <em>And in a way it is.</em>
</p><p>“I’ll- I’ll go check on him,” she mumbles, avoiding Agatha’s reflection once more.</p><p>She doesn’t see Agatha for the rest of the afternoon and she’s thankful for it. Instead (and ironically) she irons her husband’s shirts, watching how Nicky is putting the Burj Khalifa together on the living room table. When she has finished the shirts, she sits down with him until she hears the front door. She looks up out of reflex, assuming Agatha is leaving for a late meeting, but instead it’s Andrew coming home.</p><p>“Hi buddy,” he greets Nicky when he has hung his coat.</p><p>“Hi Dad,” Nicky replies without looking up from the table.</p><p>“Whatcha doin’? Hm?”, he comes closer and looks down at the jigsaw puzzle they are solving.</p><p>“The Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world” Nicky mumbles, focusing on the piece in his hand until Rio puts her finger down on the table, suggesting a placement.</p><p>“Don’t you wanna say hi to your Dad?”, she nudges him as it fits. She can see how he bites his lip and gets up, his father lifting him up and hugging him tight, placing a kiss on his cheek.</p><p>“You excited for next week?”, Andrew asks with a wide smile and carries him to the kitchen. She can’t hear Nicky’s reply, but scratches the back of her head, thinking about whether there is anything still on her to-do list before she can call it a day.</p><p>“Thank you, Rio, I’ve got it from here,” he answers that question for her as he comes back in, and she nods as she gets up from the floor.</p><p>“Leftovers from lunch are in the fridge,” she mentions and Andrew nods, an awkward silence forming between them before she can get her feet to move to the mud room where she left her things in the morning.</p><p>“Is Agatha upstairs?”, he asks as she is already putting on her coat.</p><p>“Yeah, I think so,” Rio responds.</p><p>“I don’t want to interrupt her if she is still in a call, I’ll tell her you said <em>bye</em>,” he offers as he opens the door for her.</p><p>
  <em>Please don’t.</em>
</p><p>“Thank you,” she nods one more time before she practically runs up the path to the white picket fence, away from the perfect, white New England house and into the night.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <p> </p><p>It’s the muffled sounds of her grandmother’s kitchen gadgets that wake her up the next morning. Wearily glancing over to her window, she notices the first snowflakes of the season gently dancing through the air outside. They won’t stick. They will melt as soon as they touch the soil. But it’s comforting still. Thinking about the months ahead and how they will lull everything into a gentle sleep under a blanket of snow.</p><p>She checks her phone. It’s just after seven and this is her day off. When Andrew is home for the weekend she usually doesn’t go over. What for?</p><p>She pulls the blanket over her face and baths in her self-pity.</p><p>
  <em>On a scale of 1 to 10, how hideous is it to fall in love with a married woman? Your employer? Straighter than a beam?</em>
</p><p>She blushes at the thought of Agatha. Her soft hair between her fingers. That laugh. These glasses. The funny facial expressions. The way her hands had held the reins when she had sat on top of Elphaba.</p><p>The fact that some part of her is fantasizing about that marriage ending in some way or another with herself to sweep in to take care of them makes another part of her violently sick.</p><p>Nevertheless, she thinks of the way Nicky snuggles into her when they sit next to each other. <em>Her</em> little boy.</p><p>She has thought about quitting. Of course she has. When she had been digging up piles of dirt at her landscaping stint she had phrased the resignation in her head, ready to be sent as a text message every following morning. Needless to say, it had never gone out. Because the mere thought of not seeing Agatha again hurt more than quietly pining for her from the shadows.</p><p>She still reconsiders it when she goes to the gym later in the day. Perhaps it’s the lesser of two evils. It’s what Agatha would ask her to do if she knew her nanny was jerking off to her at least once a day. So she runs for at least an hour on the treadmill, showers way too hot and carefully phrases the sentences again, detailing how sorry she is, lying about how an attractive, full-time opportunity has come up for her with Jeff at the landscaping business-</p><p>Her phone rings before she can write any of it down when she is back in her car. The name on the screen makes her heart jump.</p><p>“Ye-Yeah?”</p><p>“Rio? Hi, it’s Agatha.”</p><p>“Hi, uhm it’s Saturday?”</p><p>There is a moment of silence at the other end of the line.</p><p>“I know, I’m sorry, I know you’re off, I just- I just didn’t want to text.”</p><p>“No, no it’s no problem, I was just surprised,” she stammers and turns on the engine to start the car heating.</p><p>“Is this a good time?”</p><p>“Yes, of course, everything okay?”, she massages her forehead.</p><p>“Uhm, almost.”</p><p>It sends a jolt up Rio’s back.</p><p>“Are you alright? Is Nicky okay?”</p><p>“No, no we’re fine, Nicky is great. I’m sorry I didn’t mean to startle you. I just have a question,” she pauses and Rio holds her breath, “Andrew’s father died a year ago next week and I heard today that there is special service for that held at the church tomorrow, which means Andrew has asked me to go and I really can’t wiggle myself out of that no matter how much I want,” she sighs, “it also means his mother and my mother will be there and I- I don’t think I can do that on my own… with no one in my corner.”</p><p>Rio knows where this is going. And there is no fiber inside her that will find any strength or will to deny Agatha.</p><p>“Sure, do you want me to come?”</p><p>There is a small sigh of relief at the other end.</p><p>“If you don’t mind? I’m happy for you to stay home another day next week when Nicky and Andrew are on their trip, I would just really like it if I didn’t have to go there alone.”</p><p>“No, of course. I can drop my abuela off at her church and come straight to yours if you text me the address. I can sort for her to drive home with someone else.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>Rio chuckles.</p><p>“Yes I am, text me the time and place and I’ll be there.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer for a moment as if she is thinking about something to say. Rio wonders if she is hearing a soft sniffle, but it might just be the line.</p><p>“Thank you, Rio.”</p><p>She doesn’t think she has ever heard something sweeter, more from the heart than this.</p><p>“Always, I’ll see you tomorrow,” is the only thing she can answer before she gently hangs up, taking in a long and deep breath and wondering once again what she is getting herself into.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It’s for Agatha.</em>
</p><p>She reminds herself as she drives the last mile through what is looking to be an even more affluent neighborhood than the one Agatha lives in. As she drives on, she notes the sprawling estates and meticulously landscaped lawns that line the street. The houses, each larger and more extravagant than the last, look nothing like her abuela’s home. Luxury cars are parked in the driveways, and the manicured gardens hint at the careful attention and resources poured into maintaining this polished facade. She observes the clean, wide streets, and gated entrances, and all of a sudden isn’t sure anymore whether to be disgusted or enthralled.</p><p>With a deep breath in, she pulls into the church parking lot. She’s early, but the space is already filling up with families in thick winter coats, fathers and sons in suits and mothers and daughters in skirts and dresses.</p><p>Rio reaches up to the lapel of her coat, where a small, pink-white-and-orange heart pin sits. More subtle than a rainbow flag, but something to hold on to in the midst of this crowd of good Christians. Her grandmother had told her to put on black tights and a black dress if she wanted to even try to show some respect at a Presbyterian church, that’s about as much as Rio was willing to give.</p><p>It’s all worth it when she steps out of the car though and already sees Nicky running up her way in a mini suit and tie. She almost snorts at it, but lifts him up nevertheless, moaning under his weight and making him giggle when she puts him on her hip.</p><p>“You look dapper, mister.”</p><p>“You too,” he beams and hugs her.</p><p>Looking up to where he’d come from, she sees Agatha and Andrew with two elderly women, one has short brown hair and looks almost exactly like Andrew, the other one is smaller, stands a little stiff as her grey hair is cascading over her black coat. <em>That must be the mother.</em></p><p>She locks her car with the key that is still sitting in her right hand and carries Nickolas over to the rest of the family, nervously scratching her nose as she sets him down. She can feel Mrs. Harkness’s glance on her, and it isn’t friendly or inviting. She still extends a hand to who she learns is Mildred Fletcher and then to the woman Agatha introduces as her mother, Evanora.</p><p>“So you’re the <em>help</em>,” is all she says with an icy undertone.</p><p>“Again Mom, we don’t call her that, she’s just Rio,” Agatha interjects and tries to nudge her mother’s shoulder.</p><p>“No, it’s fine, I guess that’s what I am. A little bit of a nanny, gardener, cook…”</p><p>“And she has been a fabulous support,” Agatha cuts her short, visibly nervous.</p><p>Evanora Harness still musters her like she is an intruder, and unwanted visitor. Rio almost feels it when her glance lingers on the little heart pin on her lapel. There is something hateful in her eyes when she meets them for a split second before Andrew decides for them to go in.</p><p>Inside, the church feels much nicer and warmer than she had anticipated. The floor is covered in plush carpeting and the sanctuary is filled with natural light streaming through large, clear windows that line the walls. Andrew, his mother, and Nicky take a seat a row in front of them, but because it’s filling up quickly from the other side, Evanora and Agatha lead Rio to the pew behind them.</p><p>“I’m not going to be able to sing any of the hymns,” she whispers to Agatha and it’s the first time she sees her smile today.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” she takes a prayer book out of her handbag, “it’s not like I know them particularly well.”</p><p>She doesn’t, but it’s all the more fun to Rio. Together they scramble through the lyrics of almost every single song. More than once does Agatha put her hand on Rio’s right thigh, trying to catch up to where the song is, and it makes her skin prickle. She can’t remember ever being this physically close to her, arm against arm, legs touching, crouched over a book like teenage school girls. She just wishes it wasn’t in a fundamentalist <em>(okay well, maybe that’s an exaggeration) </em>church.</p><p>To be honest though, the service is not as bad as she’d anticipated. Yes, of course there is a whole lot of more traditional bla-bla – <em>honor thy father and mother, deliver me from evil, stray not from the path and so on</em>, but all in all – it’s decent. And Rio will admit that the sound of a hundred people singing together does touch her heart a little bit, especially when the voice she hears loudest belongs to Agatha and makes her want to fall to her knees in front of her and worship her.</p><p>As the service comes to a close, the reverent asks the little group to come to the front. Agatha hands her the prayer book and sighs quietly, touching Rio’s hand for a moment before she gets up and follows her mother out the pew. They stand in a semi-circle around the reverent and Rio can see that Agatha is dreading it when both her mother and Andrew put an arm around her, pulling her in close while the reverent speaks about loss, redemption, and the second coming of Jesus.<br />Agatha roles her shoulders as she walks back and unclenches her fists a couple times – again, not the right place or time for Rio to think about Agatha’s fingers again.</p><p> </p><p>There is a look of relief on Agatha’s face when they finally shimmy out of the pews and the entire congregation pours into the church’s foyer, larger groups of people chatting away while children run around them. Nicky is all over her when she comes to stand by his father and grandmother, both of them quietly discussing afternoon plans. He stands on Rio’s toes and makes her wiggle, asking her questions about the Burj Khalifa and whether she can name any other tall buildings. It distracts her from what is unfolding at the other end of the room, next to the doors she has just come through. It’s only when the quarrel seems to be getting louder that she looks up and sees Mrs. Harkness pointing a finger at Agatha.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she can see Andrew and his mother looking up as well, stopping their conversation, but before she can even think about overstepping, she lifts Nicky off her shoes and is striding over to where Agatha is being yelled at by her mother.</p><p>“…the mere fact that you let somebody like that into your house, alone with you son is shameful, Agatha, but then you’ve always been a disgrace yourself, haven’t you? Not even making it to Sunday service-“</p><p>“Hi, what’s going on?”, Rio makes a point of standing taller than normally, gently touching Agatha’s shoulder as she arrives.</p><p>“Nothing- we’re fine,” Agatha’s voice is the smallest she has ever heard it.</p><p>“Fine? This is what you call fine? You can’t even take care of your own child – instead you…”, she gestures at Rio, “let a sexual deviant do it-”</p><p>“I’m sorry mam, do we think this is the right place and time to be accusing me of something? Or Agatha?”</p><p>“Why are <em>you</em> getting into this?”, she almost spits at Rio.</p><p><em>Because you cunt of a woman are making a fucking scene and I swear I will break your nose if you keep</em> <em>insulting your daughter like that.</em></p><p>“Because you are being very unkind and I don’t think Agatha deserves it,” is what she actually says, “specifically not inside a church,” she adds for good measure and twirls her hand around, point a figre upwards.</p><p>Mrs. Harkness’s stills for a moment and it’s just enough for her eyes to come to rest on where Rio still has her hand on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“You disgus-“</p><p>“That’s enough now,” Rio interrupts her a little louder and with the sternest voice she can muster so she doesn’t shout. It works, because not only are several people suddenly turning around to them, but they are finally joined by the rest of their group.</p><p>“It’s been an emotional morning,” Andrew concludes, and Rio can barely keep herself from giving him an enormous side eye, she’s not sure whether he has heard the entire conversation. “We were just discussing we could go to <em>Marcelo’s</em> for lunch. Some Italian food like old times?”</p><p>“You go, take Nicky, I think I’m developing a migraine, I’d like to go home.” Agatha doesn’t even look at them, but stares into the church hall, where the dim winter sunlight is no longer able to illuminate the room.</p><p>“I can drive you home,” Rio offers and Agatha nods, her hand clenching around her bag.</p><p>“Of course…” There is something in Andrew’s face Rio can’t point her finger at, but it doesn’t matter. Nicky throws a little fit at Agatha not coming, but he chooses to be more offended than enraged and quickly lets her go when his paternal grandmother promises him Tiramisu for desert (he isn’t normally allowed caffeine). Rio can see how it breaks Agatha’s heart to make him unhappy. One more reason to shove something down her mother’s throat if aggravated assault of hateful harpies wasn’t illegal in Vermont.</p><p> </p><p>They drive back in silence. Agatha has her head turned to the window, but Rio can see how she smears warm tears on the sleeve of her jacket, can hear quiet sniffles even with droplets of rain blotching down on her windshield. When they reach the street, Rio pulls into the driveway for the first time since she’s come here, closer to the front door so Agatha won’t get soaked when she walks in. When she turns off the engine, Agatha blows her nose into a tissue and Rio can see how red her eyes are from crying. She debates touching her thigh, reassuring her, but she doesn’t want to overstep – and does it anyway. To her surprise, Agatha puts her hand on hers and squeezes it gently.</p><p>“Will you come in for a cup of tea until I’ve calmed down?”, she offers quietly.</p><p>And Rio nods.</p><p> </p><p>It’s so cold outside that it’s almost a shock to her when a wall of warmth hits her inside the house. Agatha doesn’t even bother to hang up her coat properly, she drapes it over a chair before she disappears into the kitchen and Rio can hear how she is putting the kettle on before the house goes quiet again. She takes her time taking off her coat and shoes, in case Agatha needs another moment alone, and notes her scarf once more, finally stuffing it into the sleeve of her coat so she will take it when she leaves later. Only then does she slowly follow Agatha into the kitchen, but she never gets there. Because the moment Agatha seems to hear her steps, she all but flies out of the kitchen, grabs her and pushes her into the living room wall.</p><p>It hurts – the way her body and head hit it – but it hurts good the way she has Rio pinned against it. Huffing, almost panting Agatha stares at her, eyes frantically moving from Rio’s to her mouth, her nose, her hair as if she is contemplating something.<br />And it seems she comes to a conclusion when she finally – finally puts her lips on Rio’s, smashing them, teeth and tongue, forcing them open and biting at them in a way Rio had never imagined it at all. There is nothing sweet about it, but Rio doesn’t need it to be, because being pinned in place like this, completely under Agatha’s command, is something she distantly knew she would love, would crave even. It doesn’t even take a second for Rio to put her hands on Agatha’s back, pulling her in even closer.</p><p>That’s when the first curious, demanding noise escapes Agatha, a squeal, high-pitched and needy. It’s also when she begins dragging them into the living room, her fists filling with Rio’s hair until Rio can feel the edge of their couch against her butt.</p><p><em>This isn’t going anywhere good</em>. But she doesn’t want to care, maybe doesn’t care anymore, because she has spent far too many nights dreaming about this, making herself scream to the very thought of it.</p><p>
  <em>Fuck it.</em>
</p><p>It doesn’t take long for Agatha to start finding the hems of Rio’s skirt, violently pushing it up until it sits on her waist, so she has access to the seams of the black tights Rio had specifically put on for church – something she wishes she wasn’t thinking about anymore. They come off so quickly she moans into Agatha’s mouth, one of Rio’s hands going to her neck, the other one steadying herself so they don’t fall over. It’s then that Agatha breaks their kiss for the first time, staring at her with puffy parted lips, smeared mascara, and eyes sparkling. It’s no longer than a second though, because before Rio fully processes what is going on, Agatha is on her knees in front of her, yanking her sodden slip down and discarding it like it’s waste. Then she just stares. Stares at Rio’s pink folds, glistening from her excitement. She doesn’t look up. Instead, she puts her thumb on the very top of them, strokes the bundle of nerves gently, making Rio gasp and then moan, pressing her eyes shut at the feeling. <em>She’s going to ruin the couch.</em> The next thing she feels is Agatha’s mouth on her and as if she has pushed a button, Rio parts her legs further for her, with Agatha’s hands coming up behind her, holding her in place, holding her still so she can lick, and bite, and suck.</p><p>“Fuck, please,” she begs and she’s not sure what for.</p><p>The sounds Agatha is making are absurd and filthy, lapping at her, taking her folds fully into her mouth and sucking on them, her head bobbing obscenely. Her nails are digging into Rio’s flesh as she keeps moaning and cussing, urging Agatha on and that is probably what makes Agatha turn her around and bend her over the couch. Her face is already pressed into the cushions when she feels Agatha’s right hand on her back, holding her down while she spreads her open with the other one. She presses two – then three – of her long fingers into Rio hard and deep enough to take her breath away. She can feel how her insides are tensing up when Agatha begins pumping into her fast and long, the cushions underneath providing just enough friction to rub her clit in a way that will make her come hard if Agatha keeps handling her like this, keeps fucking her like this.</p><p>“Agatha please I-“, she whines digging her hands into the couch.</p><p>And then Agatha suddenly stills.</p><p>At first Rio thinks she is maybe trying to find another angle, but then she can feel Agatha’s fingers pulling out of her and the hand vanishing from her back. When she turns around, she can see Agatha stepping back from the couch, her hands at her sides and her face stern.</p><p>“I’m sorry… I don’t know what’s gotten into me,” she whispers and looks down, “I-I’ll see you Tuesday.”</p><p>And like fucking idiot – maybe because her cunt is still twitching with need and her brain suddenly floods with guilt – Rio nods. Gathering her panties and thighs, she sees Agatha turn around, walking (almost running) into the direction of the stairs before she disappears from her view. All of a sudden, she can’t get out of the house fast enough. She yanks her coat off the hanger and slips into her shoes barefoot without noticing that from the violence of it all her scarf falls out again, landing on the floor.</p><p>As she pulls out of the driveway, it begins to snow.</p><p> </p>

  <em>On a scale of 1 to 10 – how pathetic is it to fall in love with your nanny?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It seems you can be 45, a mother, married and still develop the most profound relationship of your life with a woman what – 15 years (?) younger than you. One that you are desperately paying to spend time with you. And for what? For the hope of it all. The hope that even at 45 you’re still allowed to have the sexual awakening you were not permitted at 15 when you imagined soft, maroon lips on your body rather than the scratchy beard stubbles of your first boyfriend.</em>
</p><p>Agatha had first noticed something was changing the third day Rio had spent with them. Nicky had poured orange juice over her white blouse, and she had asked Agatha for something to change into while she was cleaning the sticky fluid off her upper body in the downstairs bathroom. Only, she hadn’t fully closed the door while doing so. When Agatha had come back with a fresh sweater, she hadn’t tried to stare, she hadn’t even wanted to look. But there Rio was, bare-chested in front of the bathroom mirror, using a pink, damp towel to clean herself. The way she had rubbed it over her soft nipples, hair all loose and bouncy on her shoulders, lips slightly ajar, focused on her task had stirred something in Agatha that she was only distantly aware of now, after so many years. Something that had always been there, neatly tugged away along with any ounce of desire she had ever felt.</p><p>Suddenly, the existential dread she had felt ever since she and Andrew had decided that this was most certainly the very final attempt to save a loveless marriage, had given way to something softer, something hopeful, something true. All of a sudden, all she wanted was to have Rio around herself, spend every day with her, find her in her kitchen in the morning as if she had slept in the same house <em>(the same bed if she dared to dream)</em>. She noticed how she, the woman who had pushed her husband away if he just tried to hold her hand, wanted to have her fingers on Rio every chance she could get.</p><p>
  <em>Something else, nobody ever tells you how good women smell.</em>
</p><p>And Agatha didn’t find out until she was clearing out their mudroom one evening, exchanging the last summer jackets for fall and winter coats. She had almost thrown it in with Nicky’s cardigans – the red and white scarf Rio had forgotten to take home again. In the dim, private light of the entrance to her house, she had held it to her face and breathed in the remnants of Rio’s smell, musky and sweet. She had put it in the drawer of her vanity that night, hoping that in case Rio ever decided she was done being her nanny, she’d have<em> this</em> at least to remember her by. Only when the shame she felt about it became too much did she put it back on one of the hangers of the mudroom, hoping Rio would just take it with her so she wouldn’t have to look at it any longer.</p><p>There are worse things she has done that feel shameful to her, of course. Things that include her writhing against her own hand when she is alone in bed at night for the first time in months when she thinks about all the things another Agatha, a braver Agatha will do to Rio on their living room couch if she ever gets the chance.</p><p>And even more shameful, how it gives her more joy these days seeing Nicky solve another jigsaw puzzle with Rio instead of his own father. How sometimes the little voice in the back of her mind whispers to her how good of a mother Rio would be, how well she looks after Nicky.</p><p>And then there is the most shameful, disgusting, terrible thing she has ever done. Because in the end, violence is seemingly easier than pouring her heart out to Rio. Instead of asking to be held, asking to love and to be loved, she lets her mind go blank as the anger inside of her catches fire and burns through her like flaming gasoline until it’s all gone and there is no confidence left in her. Because how dare she take what at her core she has been wanting so desperately, so thoroughly it hurts? After all, she figures, the shameful, disgusting, terrible thing isn’t the fact that she skipped right ahead to burying three fingers inside of Rio, it’s the fact that she isn’t brave enough to face the music and come to the terms with the fact that she is and has always been a fucking lesbian. And nothing, not even the beautiful big house she has always wanted, with all the happy pictures of her happy family, will ever change that.</p><p>
  <em>And where do you think you go from there?<br />The one woman that has ever mattered running out of your house, forgetting that fucking scarf again, leaving it in the middle of your entryway as a reminder that you are a horrible, goddamn coward. And you? Washing her smell off your hands until you run out of soap. And then you still smell her on yourself even though it’s long past midnight and your earplugs are barely drowning out your husband’s snoring while you realize that she is not gonna be back on Tuesday. </em>
</p><p>Except she is.</p><p>Rio is there before she even wakes up. Agatha can tell from the breakfast that is waiting for her on the dining room table – freshly baked buns and apple jam for her, Andrew, and Nicky. Next to it, a neatly packed lunch box for two – because of course Rio hasn’t forgotten that they are off today on the hunting trip – and Agatha realizes that’s probably why she is here, seeing Nickolas off. She is nowhere in sight though and the dishwasher is already running. She spends precious minutes thinking about whether she should go look for her, explain herself, apologize, and beg her to forgive her. Chewing on her nails, she realizes it’s too late when she hears Andrew’s voice on the stairs, walking Nicky down for breakfast. One look at him and Agatha knows he is dreading this, has been for weeks. Her sweet boy can’t even look at the sight of his own finger bleeding from a paper cut. Andrew on the other hand is beaming with excitement, fixing himself a cup of Rio’s freshly brewed coffee. <em>He</em> has been looking forward for this for months.</p><p>“C’mon, eat something baby,” she cuddles Nicky when he is pressing close to her.</p><p>“I’m not hungry mama,“ he mumbles.</p><p>“But Rio made you buns,” she points to the table and pats the top of his head.</p><p>He sits down unwillingly and stares at his plate. It hurts her so much it feels like she is being knifed down. Instead of taking a seat next to him, she closes the door to the kitchen from behind.</p><p>“Do you really think this is a good idea? I mean I’m sure he’ll slow you and Chad down anyway.”</p><p>“Aggie I’m not having this conversation again, he’s gonna be fine,” Andrew isn’t even looking at her, focused on pouring milk into his coffee.</p><p>“Have you looked him at this morning?”</p><p>“It’s normal to be nervous, he’ll enjoy himself once we’re there.”</p><p>“Andrew I really don’t-“, she can’t finish her sentence.</p><p>“Agatha. Why are we talking about this again? We agreed on this months ago. You get a nanny, I get this trip with him and then we tell him about the divorce – you got all you wanted, why won’t you let me have this with him?”</p><p>
  <em>You know he’s right. That was the agreement, except back then he hadn’t specified what kind of trip he wanted to take Nicky on, and you didn’t ask, because you frankly didn’t care and didn’t think it was going to be a big deal. You never anticipate the things most important to you.</em>
</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha gives in with a sigh and hates herself for it.</p><p>After breakfast she helps Nicky shower and dress in his new outdoor clothes. She can hear Rio in the kitchen and then the laundry room and she knows Nicky does too. He gets more cranky with every passing minute, won’t let her pack the remainder of this gear with him and meanders along in his room as if he is procrastinating, opening boxes he hasn’t look at in months, sorting pens on his little desk.</p><p>“Nicky, I know you’re not looking forward to this, but your dad wants to pick up uncle Chad in thirty minutes,” she tries when she thinks she has everything packed up and her son is sitting on his bed, toy rabbit in his hands. “It’s just two nights baby, like when we camped outside in summer.” She tries to cheer him up.</p><p>“Can’t I stay here mama?”</p><p>“No baby, your dad has really been looking forward to this. It’s really important to him.”</p><p>“Momma I really don’t wanna…”, his voice is getting louder, there are tears in his eyes now, as he presses the stuffed animal to his chest.</p><p>“Baby I…”</p><p>“I don’t wanna go!”, he begins to yell, tears streaming down his little cheeks.</p><p>He slips down from the bed next to her and runs out of the room before she can stop him. Afraid he will hurt himself in his fit, she follows him out, down the stairs where she hears him slam the laundry room door shut behind him just after he screams her name.</p><p>“RIO!”</p><p>When Agatha carefully opens it again, he has flung himself into her arms, wailing and crying, begging her to tell his parents he doesn’t want to go hunting, that he wants to stay with her instead. Rio is on her knees next to the open dryer that is half full with a load of towels she had been washing. She holds him tightly, caresses his back, placing tiny kisses on his ear and the side of his head.</p><p>When she notices Agatha, she looks at her for the first time since the shameful, disgusting, terrible thing that Agatha has let happen, and Agatha really wants to say something, really wants to find the right words to make it all go away right there and then, wants to apologize and tell Nicky he doesn’t have to go if he doesn’t want to. She can’t say any of it. The commotion hasn’t gone unnoticed and Andrew is approaching them, car keys in hand, hunting jacket on, ready to go.</p><p>“What’s this now?”, he steps next to her, watching Nicky press further into Rio, still crying and begging her to keep him here.</p><p>“Nickolas, stop with the temper tantrum and get you stuff,” he orders.</p><p>More wailing, more begging Rio to tell them he wants to stay.</p><p>Agatha can see how Rio whispers something in Nicky’s ear, but it doesn’t seem to help.</p><p>“Nicky I’m going to put your bag in the car and then we’re leaving, I’m done with this,” Agatha can hear he is annoyed, can hear he is overwhelmed with this, wants her to sort it out instead. He’s always been impatient.</p><p>She crouches down next to Rio and puts her hand on his back.</p><p>“Nicky I know you don’t want to, and I promise you never ever have to go hunting with dad again if you really don’t like it, but don’t you at least want to give it a try?”</p><p>He shakes his head violently.</p><p>“How about you go with your dad and if you still feel the same way later tonight, I’ll come and get you.” She knows it’s a lie, and by the look Rio gives her she knows it too. They’re gonna camp somewhere in the middle of the woods with no easy access road, so there is no picking him up like that, even if she wants to. To her surprise and heartbreak, it does seem to help him.</p><p>“Promise?”, he whispers after he has calmed down.</p><p>Agatha nods and ignores the way Rio is looking at her.</p><p>
  <em>Liar. Coward.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She carefully thinks about the words she will say, how she will explain once Andrew and Nicky are gone, but she doesn’t get that chance. Rio is already wearing her jacket when she carries Nicky out to the car and puts him in his seat, whispering what Agatha believes are further assurances. And she doesn’t turn around again to Agatha when the two of them have driven off. Instead, she waves, before she walks to her own car and Agatha is alone again in her beautiful big house, with the white picket fence, and all the happy pictures of her unhappy family on the walls.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p> </p><p>Moving methodically through her grandmother’s garden, her hands wrapped in thick gloves as she is pulling up withered plants and gathering fallen leaves into a large, black trash bag, her head finally clears.</p><p>The cool air is a blessing against her hot cheeks and swollen eyes, even when the sky overhead is a uniform slate gray, casting a cold, muted light over it all. The morning air is still and crisp, every breath she takes visible as a small cloud. Pausing, Rio wipes her brow, even though the chill keeps her from sweating. Her phone is vibrating again, she can feel it in the pocket of her jacket. She knows it’s another text, knows who it’s from and knows she’s not interested in reading it. There is nothing Agatha could say to make her go back there.</p><p>Granted, she has promised Nicky to be there when he comes home, but it now feels like bribery, a bargain, one she isn’t even fully sure she can uphold her side of. She has bribed a little boy with ice cream so that he will go help his daddy kill some deer for sport.</p><p>Rio scoffs. She peels another tissue out of the pocket of her jacket and blows her nose one more time. She’s done crying and she’s done caring, but it doesn’t make the hurt go away.</p><p>Her chest feels like it's been hollowed out, the pain a constant, dull throb that radiates through her body. It’s not the first time she has fallen hard, but this time the heartache is mixed with shame and numbness alternating with the stabbing reminder of Agatha’s hair between her fingers and Agatha’s lips on her skin. Somewhere between self-pity and grief she has repeatedly asked herself what all of this has been about anyway, why she is making such a fuss. How has this moved on from being a silly little crush to suddenly blooming into something more serious without her noticing. Too sudden for her to even think it all through, to sudden for her to even imagine the <em>could-have-beens</em> and <em>would-have-beens</em>. She is a shadow on the wall, present but unseen, lingering yet unnoticed.</p><p>
  <em>It's not like she’s ever gonna leave her husband for her nanny.</em>
</p><p>She curses at the phone vibrating again, a call this time, she needs to find the strength to block her number, but somewhere deep inside she knows it’s not what she honestly wants.</p><p>
  <em>No, what she wants is for Agatha to come in through the garden gate, run up to her, tell her she’s sorry, tell her-</em>
</p><p>The phone vibrates again. She pinches her eyes close, massaging her forehead. She needs an Advil.</p><p>
  <em>One more time.</em>
</p><p>“For fuck’s sake,” she curses and takes off her glove to have better access to the touchscreen.</p><p>“You need to stop calling me,” she shouts with a rough voice as she answers the call, turning away from the house in case she has to get louder. She hasn’t told her grandmother about any of this.</p><p>There is a sniffle on the other end and muddled noises in the background.</p><p>“Agatha?”, she tries and moans in annoyance. <em>Can't the woman speak up at least?</em></p><p>“R-Rio?” Her voice is all breathy as if she has a stuffy nose. Maybe Rio isn’t the only one affected by this after all. It’s only a small consolation, and it doesn’t change anything, because they aren’t headed anywhere – she is a lone moon, orbiting a planet that doesn’t see her light, doesn’t feel her pull.</p><p>“I said you need to stop calling me,” she repeats more calmly, ready to hang up again and be done with it.</p><p>“I know, I’m sorry, I know-,” Agatha sniffles one more time, “Rio, Nicky's run away. They were all camped up and some time last night he must have slipped out of the tent. Andrew woke up early this morning and he was gone, I don’t know what to do, we’ve got Search and Rescue here, but they’ve been looking for him all morning and can’t find him.”</p><p>For a moment, it feels like the world comes to a sudden hold and instead of it, she starts spinning around herself. There is suddenly no air left in her lungs.</p><p>“Wh-where are you?”, she asks, dropping the bin bag and putting her hand over her left ear so she can hear Agatha more clearly.</p><p>“Groton Forest,” Agatha’s voice is smaller than she has ever heard.</p><p>
  <em>It’s about a 45-minute drive, 35 minutes if need be.</em>
</p><p>“Rio I know I’ve not been-“, Rio isn’t listening anymore, she is already walking back towards the house, thinking about the things she needs to gather before she can get into her car.</p><p>“Can you send me your location? Is there a parking lot nearby?”, she asks as she enters through the back door.</p><p>“We’re at the campground, I-I’ll send you a pin.”</p><p>“Okay. And stay there, don’t move, I’m coming!”</p><p>She hangs up without waiting for another answer and heads for the kitchen, packing granola bars and water bottles, a flashlight with batteries, a power bank, her hunting knife and compass together with an old map of the Groton that she has last used when she’d been hiking there as a sophomore. But it’s not like the mountains change a lot. S&amp;R will have the same, but she isn’t gonna wait until they start handing it out and permit civilians to start looking. She stuffs it all into her backpack, before she kisses her grandmother goodbye, telling her not to wait up.</p><p> </p><p>She gets to the campground in under 30 minutes.</p><p>Local police have already closed the area off and there is an ambulance parked on the lawn - no surprise with a 5-year-old missing on the cusp of winter. She hasn’t allowed herself to estimate the hours he’s been out and without shelter, hasn’t thought about more sinister possibilities regarding his disappearance. What she has done is check the weather forecast, and while it is at least supposed to stay dry for now, temperatures are supposed to drop below 50, which means if she can’t find him until sunset-</p><p>
  <em>No, she’s not going there, not yet. </em>
</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>She hears her even before she can fully get out of the car. Even from afar she can see her red eyes and messy hair, she doesn’t look like herself at all. And when Agatha reaches Rio’s car, she slows down for just a moment, unsure, but then sweeps Rio into a tight embrace, practically burying her face in Rio’s hair and sobbing uncontrollably. Rio’s hands glide up to the back of her head, caressing it gently, because even if there are a thousand angry things she wants to throw at her, she knows she will never not take care of Agatha.</p><p>“We’ll find him,” she whispers and knows she has been making too many promises lately.</p><p>“Rio he’s been gone since before 7 this morning, what if someone took him?”, Agatha cries.</p><p>“Nobody abducts a child from a tent in the middle of a forest, there are easier ways to do that. He’s somewhere out here. Is he wearing a jacket? Did Andrew find anything like that in the tent?”, she holds her by the arms and looks at her.</p><p>“N-no there was no jacket in the tent anymore, S&amp;R thinks he’s wearing it,” Agatha rubs her hands on her face, massaging her eyelids.</p><p>“Hey- Agatha, hey that’s good news,” she grabs the backpack and her hiking boots out of the car.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio looks at her, confused.</p><p>“I’m going to look for him, are Andrew and his… I dunno, friend? around? Can they point me to where they’ve camped?”</p><p>“I don’t think the police wants anyone else in the forest yet Rio, they’ve only just suspended the hunting-“</p><p>“Why did you call me then?”, it comes out more hostile than it’s supposed to, and she can see it in Agatha’s face. She can also see a lot of pain.</p><p>“Forget it, just – just where is Andrew?”, she finishes tying her shoes and locks the car before she starts walking into the direction of the barrier tape police has put around the access road to the forest.</p><p>Andrew is useless, but at least he can point to their campsite on the map.</p><p>“Search and Rescue has asked us to stay put though,” the other man (Chad?) shrugs, extinguishing a cigarette on a tree and pointing to a group of people in yellow wests a couple of yards away.</p><p>She shoves her tongue into her right cheek and nods so she doesn’t start shouting profanities at him.</p><p>“Great, stay put then,” is all she says instead and gathers her map, “’this the trail you took?”</p><p>If none of them are gonna go look for her little boy, she will. There is no way she is waiting around for another minute. It’s gonna take hours for them to make up their mind about permitting and organizing civilian searches, and it’s only going to get harder and colder when it gets dark. In the forest she has about 5 hours of light left. She suddenly regrets not taking any camping gear, but she reckons they probably left the tents where they were in case Nicky finds his way back, so if worse comes to worse, she can try to sleep and take shelter there. It doesn’t matter. If she has to, she’ll stay up through the night and look for him.</p><p>Before her, the forest lays quiet but for the rustling of the remaining leaves in the wind. It feels hostile, uninviting – and she an unbidden guest. There is a pang of guilt in her chest. If she can appreciate that the Groton isn’t the kindest place for a hike in this weather, that feeling is only going to multiply for a little boy.</p><p>
  <em>“Can’t you come hunting with us?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I think your dad wants this to be a boy’s trip, Nicky, but I promise I will be here when you come back, we’ll go to the shops, and we’ll get you a puzzle of the Shanghai Tower.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Can we get ice-cream too?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“We can get all the ice-cream for you, I promise.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“And can you help me with the puzzle?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I sure can.”</em>
</p><p>She climbs up the trail for about ten minutes before she hears huffing, footsteps, and then her name behind her and turns around to wonder whether to be thrilled, annoyed, or angry. Agatha is following her in a light, thin jacket and trainers.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?”, she yells at her as she is coming closer.</p><p>“You didn’t let me finish,” Agatha pants, “I called you because I didn’t think I could sit through this without you, but if you’re refusing to stay, I’m coming with. I can’t just wait around alone again.”</p><p>“You’re in sneakers, Agatha, we’re not going on a Sunday walk here, I’m not staying on this trail for long,” there is something condescending in her voice, and she means for it to be there.</p><p>“I don’t care,” she enunciates every word, “I’ve been doing <em>nothing</em> since I got here Rio, I am going crazy if I have to spend another hour watching the clock tick, waiting for something terrible to happen.”</p><p>Rio considers it for a moment.</p><p>“You’re just gonna slow me down Agatha,” she rejects her again.</p><p>“I ran track in college, I can be fast,” there is something hopeful in Agatha’s voice and for the first time Rio feels like she is the one in control, the one who knows what she is doing. And truth be told, Agatha is not the kind of mother that will be kept from her own child, she is willing to give her that. Whatever has come to happen between them, the one thing she will always love about Agatha is how much she cares for Nickolas.</p><p>“Try not to slip then,” she huffs and turns back around, following the trail uphill without looking back, “and keep up!”</p><p> </p>

  <p> </p><p>She grows more annoyed at Agatha every step she takes. Every rustle of leaves under her shoes is one too much, every time she hears her heavy breathing behind her, she regrets her decision to take her. Of course she doesn’t keep up, of course she moans whenever she collects another spec of dirt on her white trainers. Rio can already see her stumble over a root and fall, breaking her ankle. There’s no use in complaining now though, they’re a good hour into the forest, almost at the camp Andrew and Chad set up. Perhaps she can convince Agatha to wait there for her, in case Nicky comes back and finds the camp empty. She has the feeling it’s not gonna work though, there is no way she’s getting rid of her now.</p><p>“Rio wait,” Agatha huffs.</p><p>She stops and turns around. Agatha is following her not far behind trying to climb up a steeper bit of the trail.</p><p>“I told you to keep up, we don’t have all day, Agatha.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she pants and reaches out her hand for Rio to pull her up. She hesitantly takes it and doesn’t like the way it’s soft and how it’s sending a jolt up her arm.</p><p>Agatha sheepishly cleans dirt off her knees once she has scrambled up the boulders.</p><p>“How far to the camp?”, she asks.</p><p>“Not much, a few more minutes that way,” Rio points into a vague direction, looking at where she has circled an area on her map according to Andrew’s descriptions. She looks down at Agatha’s feet, making sure she can still walk. At least they’re on even terrain now.</p><p>“Shall we go?”, Agatha asks and Rio nods.</p><p>They reach the camp after another 15 minutes of walking. It sits on a little clearing. Rio can see that Search and Rescue have already gone through it. They’ve left a small batch of packed-up food and water in one of the tents in case Nicky returns. What worries her is that she had seen dogs at the campground, generally one of the better ways to find someone missing in a larger area, but if even they can’t find him, it’s not gonna be easier for her. She thinks of him, scared and cold, sitting underneath a tree somewhere, unable to find his way home. It breaks her heart in half.</p><p>Agatha squats down by the larger tent, presumably the one Andrew and Nicky had stayed in. She touches the little sleeping bag, then pulls it out and holds it close to her face, closing her eyes.</p><p>“I’ll never forgive myself for making him go,” she sniffles again.</p><p>Rio wants to say something mean, wants to hit her where it hurts, but deep down the knows this isn’t Agatha’s fault, it might not even be Andrew’s. It’s nobody’s fault. She only wishes she had taken his side instead of persuading him to go.</p><p>“Me too,” she whispers to Agatha’s surprise.</p><p>“What did you say to him in the laundry room?”</p><p>“I told him we’d get him another puzzle and eat ice-cream when he came back,” she admits and massages her temples.</p><p>Agatha stays silent for a moment, caressing the sleeping bag with Nicky’s scent.</p><p>“I’m sorry I put you in that position,” she whispers eventually.</p><p>Rio dismisses it.</p><p>
  <em>You didn’t mind putting me in other positions though, didn’t you?</em>
</p><p>“Sorry what?”</p><p><em>Fuck.</em> She knew one of these days one of her thoughts would come out unbidden in the worst of moments.</p><p>“Never mind,” she waves her hand in front of herself to get a fly out of her face.</p><p>“No, I heard what you said.”</p><p>“I said <em>never mind</em>, Agatha, let’s go that way,” she points north to where she sees a little stream on her map, perhaps a sound Nicky could have heard in the dark and walked towards. It’s unlikely it would have distracted the dogs from his scent, but she has to start somewhere, so she starts walking without checking whether Agatha is following at all. Against what Rio is hoping, she catches up fast.</p><p>“Will you let me explain at least?”, she begs. Oh, this is gonna be interesting.</p><p>“What is there to explain? You pin me against a wall, shove three of your fingers inside of me and then drop me like a hot potato and tell me to leave,” Rio snarls, not rewarding Agatha with a single look.</p><p>“Rio it’s not that easy,” she quietly tries to appease her.</p><p>“Well, maybe don’t try to fuck your nanny then? If it’s too <em>hard</em> or whatever. I didn’t start this; I didn’t even dare saying anything to you about any of it all.”</p><p>“Rio I-“</p><p>It’s the way she places a hand on Rio’s arm that makes her stop and snap.</p><p>“Just between us Agatha, why did you do it?”, she spits, louder and harder than intended, but it’s all right there: her anger, her frustration, all the soft things and feelings she doesn’t want to think about, “were you so fed up with it all you just wanted a quick fuck, and I was right there? Just between you and me – did any of this maim you as much as it did me? Because if it didn’t you need to never talk to me again.” She’s shouting by the end of it, half ready to walk on and leave Agatha where she stands.</p><p>“No, no I didn’t. I needed <em>you</em>, I wanted <em>you</em>. And I wanted you so bad I didn’t even dare to ask.”</p><p>Rio scoffs.</p><p>“I don’t know how much it’s been crushing you, but please believe me when I say that I have literally been fighting myself every day almost since the moment I met you.” There is something desperate in her voice, almost as if she is about to cry again. It makes Rio’s heart pound violently in her chest. Makes her want to forgive her on the spot.</p><p>Standing at the stream, she tries not to look at Agatha, tries to avoid that last nail in her coffin. Instead, she tries to focus on the task ahead and leaves her where she is, looking for little footsteps, ripped fabric, anything that might point her to Nicky. Anything that will help her avoid continuing that conversation. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows that dance on the forest floor.</p><p>“Do you see anything?”, she yells after a while.</p><p>“No, not really,” Agatha answers and sighs.</p><p>“I’m just gonna go a little further downstream to check if I see anything, can you walk into the opposite direction for… I’d say about five minutes, and we meet back here in ten?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha nods and Rio is ready to leave, but turns around one more time.</p><p>“Do you need another layer?”, she asks.</p><p>“Another what?”</p><p>“Layer, like… of clothing, it’s only going to get colder now,” she gestures with her hands and regrets asking.</p><p>“Oh, no I think I’m okay,” Agatha answers.</p><p>Rio nods. “Be back here in ten, and don’t go anywhere else, if you find something, yell for me and take a picture, if you’re not back here when I am, I’ll walk into your direction.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>She’d never think she’d see the day where Agatha Harkness is this compliant.</p><p>It doesn’t matter. And it doesn’t matter that whatever has been going on is mutual at least.<br />
She has seen this film before. Married women like her don’t leave their husbands. They might come to terms with their sexuality 30 years after they should have, but the stakes are too high for them. They don’t give up their quality of life, their stance in their community, or the security their husbands are providing to them to go be with women 15 years their junior. No, that’s what men do. Women only fantasize about it.</p><p>She huffs angrily. Why is this happening to <em>her</em> of all people? She wasn’t even planning on looking for anybody, she was just minding her own business, enjoying single life and she certainly hadn’t planned to become a lesbian cliché. She’s too old for that.</p><p>With a tired huff, she squats down, looking at the stream. It’s early afternoon, she can feel how the light is getting softer, warmer, making the grass and water glimmer. She lets her hand glide through the ripple of the stream, enjoys the way the cold water makes her fingers go numb. Is this futile? She sighs.</p><p>And then something catches her attention, something pink and colorful among the brown leaves and mud. Probably just trash, but she reaches for it anyway.</p><p>It’s a jigsaw puzzle piece. A goddamn jigsaw puzzle piece from the <em>fucking</em> Dubai sky at sunset, pink and bright and shiny.</p><p>“Agatha,” she yells form the top of her lungs, well aware that she is probably too far away to hear her, “Agatha!”.</p><p>She grabs a stick and slams it into the earth right next to where the puzzle piece had been, memorizes the trees so she will find the spot again and races back to their meeting point, repeatedly yelling for her over and over again.</p><p>Agatha only hears her when she is almost back at where they started, turns around, eyes going wide.</p><p>“Did you find something?”</p><p>Rio holds up the puzzle piece like it’s a treasure.</p><p>“Do you know if the puzzle on the living room table was complete when you left?”, she huffs.</p><p>“No, no he never finished it, he was waiting for you to come back,” Agatha’s face lights up as she takes the piece into her hand. Rio can see that she’s fighting back tears.</p><p>“It’s just a piece, it could theoretically be from anybody, and just because I found one, it doesn’t mean he is still around, he could have dropped it when they were passing by here earlier,” Rio tries to manage expectations.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, can’t we go back into the direction and see if we find anything else? Or if we yell for him if he hears us?”</p><p>Rio nods and takes it back, brushing Agatha’s hand.</p><p>They rush back downstream, careful no to trip over any roots or slip in the mud until Rio finds the place again.</p><p>“Nicky?”, Agatha shouts and Rio repeats it as they walk further on, eyes peeled on the ground in case Nicky has purposefully or accidentally dropped anything else. Here and there Rio thinks she sees small footsteps, but they could be anything really, from anyone or no one at all. Agatha takes pictures, tries to mark the locations on the map in case they need to find them again and it somehow feels good to focus on something with her that is not touched by the complicated thing going on between them. Because no matter what will come of that, Rio knows one thing for certain and that is that she has lost her heart to the little boy and Agatha will need a restraining order if she wants to keep her form him after this.</p><p>“What if he went somewhere else? Walked back into the forest?”, Agatha asks after another hour of searching. There is something hopeless in her voice.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio whispers. She can feel that the sun is slowly beginning to set. The shadows of the trees are getting longer and longer, and temperatures have already dropped several degrees. Agatha shouts his name again. Nothing.</p><p>Turning around, Rio can see why Agatha is asking about Nicky turning away from the stream – a small path opens up to their right, seamed by trees but going out into a clearing in the distance, where she can see the R2 freeway bridge.</p><p>“Do you think he’s old enough to understand that walking towards cars might help him be found?”, Rio asks and points to it.</p><p>“I don’t know if he wants to be found,” Agatha admits quietly and Rio frowns.</p><p>“And why would that be?”</p><p>“There’s been a lot of fighting lately, and we’re not as good at hiding it from him as we used to be,” she scratches her forehead without looking at Rio.</p><p>
  <em>That bad, huh?</em>
</p><p>She isn’t sure she wants to respond to it, isn’t sure if she wants to know more, anything that might pour gasoline into the flames she has been trying to put out.</p><p>“Is he… violent?”, the thought of it makes her stomach churn.</p><p>“Oh God no… we’re just…,” Agatha gestures and lets out a dry, sarcastic laugh, “well he works too much, and I recently found out I might not be sexually attracted to men after all, which explains a lot, but doesn’t make our life any easier.”</p><p>“Does he know?”, Rio doesn’t look at her.</p><p>“No. No he just knows I don’t love him anymore,” Agatha crosses her arms in front of her chest.</p><p>Rio doesn’t really know what to say about that, what to think about it. Whether she should ask if it’s a recent development.</p><p>“Anyway,” she tries instead, “it’s gonna get dark soon. And if I was Nicky, I would probably walk towards the bridge, even if it’s too far away. Looking at her map, she also sees that the terrain at the stream is going to turn more impassable in about a quarter mile, so even if he didn’t immediately take a left right here, he might have turned around when walking by the stream would have become too difficult.</p><p>Agatha nods and walks ahead, probably trying to avoid her. It gives Rio the chance to pick her own brain again – and she will never willingly confess to it because this is neither the time nor place – but Agatha’s thin leggings leave nothing to imagination. She tries to look away so violently, she almost runs into her when she bends down.</p><p>“Rio, I think I found another!”, she exclaims, momentarily irritated by how close Rio stands to her, but quickly focusing again on a turquoise but dirty puzzle piece in the mud. “Do you recognize it?”</p><p>Rio takes it into her hand. She can’t say she does, but then, who else is dropping puzzle pieces in the middle of Groton Forest?</p><p>“Might be,” she presses out, unwilling to get Agatha’s hopes up.</p><p>They walk on. After another twenty minutes Rio starts hearing the noise from the cars on the bridge, but the forest has gotten thicker again and it’s no longer visible. What makes matters worse, is that another 300 yards on, the path splits and the ground is so dry there, there is no telling if anyone has passed through it recently. She looks at her watch.</p><p>“Alright we’re gonna split up, just like we did last time, walk for 10 minutes and then come back here.”</p><p>“What do I do if the road splits again?”</p><p>“Always go right, and don’t go off the road, unless you see him,” she instructs, looking at the setting sun. She doesn’t tell Agatha that it will get dark and cold soon, that if they don’t find him in the next hour, they will have to go back to the campground and tell S&amp;R what they found, hoping they have the right equipment to search for him throughout the night. She also doesn’t tell her about the chances of survival for young children that are exposed to the elements. She just tightens her fists and nods, taking the trail heading left.</p><p>If she wasn’t looking for a little, lost boy, this would actually be a beautiful afternoon hike, she muses, treading lightly over the blanket of fallen leaves, each step a soft crunch beneath her feet. The air is crisp, carrying the scent of pine and earth, mingling with the distant murmur of the stream that seems to be closer again. The trees stand tall, like ancient monuments, their branches whispering in the gentle breeze. If she wasn’t looking for a little, lost boy, she would have loved to show all of this to Nicky one day – under different circumstances. When nobody makes him point a gun at any animals. She sighs. She’s not sure what she’s gonna do if she doesn’t find him. So she does the only thing she can do – she yells his name again, begs him to come out if he can hear her.</p><p>It's already time for her to turn around and her throat has turned dry and itchy when she stops to have a sip of water, contemplating if she can cover another quarter mile a little faster before she goes back to where they had split up. As she searches her backpack for her water bottle, she stumbles over a small root sticking out almost invisibly from the trail, her water bottle falling out and rolling down into the forest. She drops the bag, curses, and follows it about 20 yards down to where it comes to a still. It’s fruitless, they need to head back, let the professionals do their job.</p><p>At least that’s her last coherent thought before she sees a tiny bit of ripped, green fabric on a tree and takes it between her fingers. On the ground next to it are three puzzle pieces.</p><p>“Nicky”, she shouts “Nicky!”</p><p>He is here somewhere. What if he fell over that same root and couldn’t crawl back up again?</p><p>“Nicky!”, she repeats, even louder this time, goosebumps forming on her skin until she hears rustling leaves from behind her and then sees more of that green jacket, partially covert in mud, and two tiny hands, scratched, but pushing themselves up from inside a hollow tree.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>It’s quiet and a little broken, but it’s there.</p><p>Tears shoot from her eyes as her feet carry her over to where he is, exhausted looking, with pale skin, and she doesn’t waste a single second to take him into her arms, presses him close to her chest and sobs uncontrollably as his tiny fingers dig into her jacket. She is never letting him out of her sight again. As she lifts him into her arms, more puzzle pieces fall out of the pocket of his jacket. She doesn’t care, she is buying him a hundred new sets if he wants her to.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” she cries and kisses his forehead, “I’m so sorry I made you go.”</p><p>He buries his face in the crook of her neck, and she can feel his tears on her skin.</p><p>“Rio, can we go home?”, he asks with his tiny voice.</p><p>“Yeah baby we’re going home now,” she reassures him.</p><p>When they have both calmed down, she offers him some water and a granola bar. His skin is cold, he has scratches everywhere and scraped his knee, but nothing is broken. She still carries him back onto the trail as if he is made from glass, his hands around her neck, chest pressed to hers. She can’t stop herself from kissing his cheek on their way back and finds herself reverting back to Spanish, exhaustion suddenly hitting her like a truck.</p><p>Agatha looks like she is struck by lightning as soon as she sees them coming closer, sees what Rio is carrying. She hugs them both, takes Nicky into her arms, holds him so close to herself Rio feels like she might accidentally squish him. When she starts to cry as well, Rio can’t help it to take her into her arms, carefully caressing her hair with one hand and Nicky’s back with the other.</p><p>For no longer than a moment she imagines what it could feel like to hold them like this every day.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p> </p><p>It’s pitch black by the time they make it back to the campground. She can hear commotion from outside the forest as her flashlight shines the way for them while Agatha carries Nicky the last part of the trail. They are barely past the trees when several men and women come rushing towards them, the shouting starts just after they realize Nicky is with them.</p><p>A small news crew from a local station has picked up the story. They get prime-grade footage of the family reunion when Andrew comes rushing towards them. Rio stands aside and happily accepts a warm cup of coffee someone from S&amp;R hands her. Her fingers are cold in the night air, and she can smell the sweat on herself from carrying Nicky through most of the forest. Her little boy waves at her from where he is slung over his father’s shoulders, and she waves back and blows him a gentle kiss. He does the same and she has to fight the urge to go over to hold him.</p><p>Instead, she empties her cup with one last gulp and sets it onto a table.<br />Time to go home.</p><p>She doesn’t say goodbye, she just glides into the darkness, walks past the camera team that is still reporting and heads into the direction of where her car is parked. As tension and excitement are slowly leaving her body, she becomes aware of how much her head and feet are hurting, so much so, that she pulls an expired package of Advil from her glove compartment and swallows two pills at once with the remaining water in her bottle.</p><p>
  <em>What the fuck are you doing?</em>
</p><p>She rests her head on the steering wheel, the cold leather comforting against her forehead. Hot tears fight their way into her eyes, she presses them back, but she can’t hide the sniffle, can’t fight back how her nose is swelling shut. She tells herself its out of relief.</p><p>It Isn’t.</p><p>She is just about ready to let it all out right there and then when she hears faint knocking on the driver side window.</p><p>“Everything okay?”, she asks as she has rolled it down.</p><p>Agatha’s hair is everywhere, she hadn’t noticed in the dark while they had been walking back.</p><p>“I meant to ask you the same thing, you just left.”</p><p>“Didn’t think you needed anything from me anymore.”</p><p>It’s a loaded question, Rio knows it and Agatha knows it too. She swallows hard.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry for everything I put you through. You don’t deserve the mess I have made.”</p><p>Rio nods and looks past Agatha into the darkness.</p><p>Agatha carefully lifts her hand and puts her index finger on Rio’s chin, directing her eyes towards herself.</p><p>“Rio where do we go from here?”, she asks, quietly.</p><p>Agatha’s finger on her chin is soft and cold. Both comforting and maddening at the same time. She looks up at her. In the dim streetlights she can’t see the blue in Agatha’s eyes anymore, but she marvels at the shape of her lips, the dimples on her cheeks. And she knows it’s still there. All of it: Every inch of gut-wrenching, all-consuming love and longing. She has never loved anyone like this. Agatha has cut her open at the chest, torn out her little, beating heart and kept it ever since.</p><p>
  <em>Married women don’t leave their husbands. They don’t give up their quality of life, their stance in their community, or the security their husbands are providing to them to go be with someone like her.</em>
</p><p>“I don’t know Agatha,” she replies and looks away again, unable to bear the sight of her anymore.</p><p>
  <em>The sight of what could be hers.</em>
</p><p>“Can I call you? Tomorrow, or I don’t know – later this week?”</p><p>Rio nods. She nods because it’s the only thing she can bear, because it’s the only alternative to letting her tears roll or tell Agatha to never speak to her again.</p><p>“Can you promise me to drive safe and text me when you get home?”, Agatha asks just as Rio is ready to start to roll up the window. The warmth in her voice tastes like a special kind of betrayal.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio answers without looking at her again.</p><p>She manages to hold back her tears until she is home and in her shower. The water is scorchingly hot on her skin, but at least its loud, loud enough to drown out her sobs, washing away all the tears she sheds in the privacy of her own bathroom for no one else to see or judge. In earnest, she doesn’t remember the last time she has cried this much.</p><p>She falls asleep with her hair still wet and a chrome-casted youtube video idly playing on her television.</p><p>It’s not until the next morning that she sees three missed calls and four texts from Agatha, all sent between the hours of midnight and one.</p><p>
  <em>00:09 Did you make it home alright? A.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>00:11 Rio?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>00:26 Rio did you make it home okay?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>00:40 Can you please answer me, I’m worried.</em>
</p><p>When she texts back a short <em>I’m okay,</em> three dots appear next to Agatha’s name but vanish immediately. She doesn’t hear from her again that day.</p><p> </p><p>Three full days pass until she tries to call again. Rio lets it go to voicemail, but she doesn’t leave a message. Instead, Rio sees a text from her that same evening, when she is playing cards with her grandmother and some of her friends.</p><p>
  <em>Nicky is asking about you. I know this is a lot to ask, but I am out on Thursday, you won’t have to see me, but do you think you’d like to watch him while I’m gone? A.</em>
</p><p>Rio bites into the inside of her cheek. Is this how Agatha expects her to go back to normal? Does she seriously think they are just picking up from before it all went to shit? She lets out a huff and carelessly throws a card onto the table, her grandmother scolding her for not placing it neatly on the established stack of other cards.</p><p>She doesn’t decide on what to reply until later when she sits on their back patio, the first cigarette she has smoked in years between her lips (it’s disgusting, and it’s the only one for a while).</p><p>
  <em>When do you want me to be there? R.</em>
</p><p>The answer is almost instant.</p><p>
  <em>At 10? I’ll be back in the early afternoon.</em>
</p><p>She flicks the cigarette into an ashtray.</p><p>
  <em>Okay.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She arrives at house just after 10 and parks her car on the street. Agatha’s G-Wagon is still in the driveway, but she can see that the front door is already open and when she takes the key out of the ignition, Agatha and Nicky are on the top step of the small staircase, Nicky waving at her enthusiastically.</p><p>It feels good to see him smile again.</p><p>Rio locks her car and before she can even set a foot on their plot, Nicky has run all the way down to her, giving her a long and tender hug she squats down for.</p><p>“I’ve missed you,” she whispers into his ear and puts a kiss on his cheek.</p><p>“Me too,” he answers, “I got a new jigsaw puzzle!”</p><p>“Oh nice, do you wanna look at it together?”, she offers.</p><p>“Yes please!”</p><p>She picks him up and puts him on her right hip again, as usual, and she knows she will do it for as long as he lets her and is still light enough. He keeps telling her about how Peanut Butter had escaped from Agatha’s study a day earlier, hiding in his closet, while Rio walks up to the house. Against her hopes, Agatha still hasn’t left when they get to the door. So much for not having to see her.</p><p>She looks beautiful as always, gorgeous, in that black, oversized suit and the white dress shirt, hair all open and smooth for once. But Rio sees right through it. Agatha can slap as much lipstick and powder onto her face as she sees fit, but it doesn’t hide the dark circles under her eyes, doesn’t hide something Rio decides to interpret as agitation.</p><p>“You’re gonna be okay?”, she asks and Rio nods, biting her lower lip.</p><p>“My appointment ends just after noon, I’ll try get something to eat and then be back here at two for a call,” she adds.</p><p>“Sure,” Rio says and nods, Nicky suddenly feeling heavier than before.</p><p>She musters the courage to look up and realizes that the blue has returned to Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“If you’re still here when I’m back-” – “I don’t know how long I can-“</p><p>They say it at the same time, and it causes Agatha to hold on to her work back with two hands.</p><p>“Okay,” she nods one more time and presses a kiss to Nicky’s forehead before she walks up to her car without turning around. Rio hates herself for wanting her to.</p><p>It’s Peanut Butter’s soft fur that takes the edge off. Nicky can’t be stopped to demonstrate to her how exactly the bunny had managed to escape his nightly enclosure, but Rio isn’t fully certain he has the full story, because the couch in Agatha’s office looks slept on and she wonders if someone else had also found solace in cuddling with the little furball late at night.</p><p>“How’s your mama doing with everything?”, she asks, sitting on the floor, leaning against one of Agatha’s bookshelves, still petting Peanut Butter against her chest.</p><p>Nicky shrugs. “She’s mad.”</p><p>“Is she mad because you ran away in the forest?”</p><p>“No,” he fumbles with what Rio can only identify as one of Agatha’s hair ties.</p><p>“Do you know what she’s mad about?”, she presses on.</p><p>“She’s mad with Dad,” he doesn’t look up, “and Dad isn’t coming home over the weekend this time.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t force anything else out of him, instead she asks him what he’s in the mood for. She expects it’s the jigsaw puzzle, but he wants to go to the playground to swing. It gives her another idea.</p><p>“How about we build you your own swing?”, she offers, raising an eyebrow. His face lights up with excitement.</p><p>It’s already been a while, but she finds the pieces of wood and rope she had been thinking of in the shed in no time. When she had first gone in there when she had helped them prep their garden for winter weeks ago, she had wondered whether all the trinkets and machines inside of it had belonged to the previous owner, but then, they could just be remnants of unfinished projects. So instead of driving five miles to the next playground, she puts a little stool for Nicky next to the workbench and collects an electric drill from the dusty shelf in the back. She drills three holes into every corner of the wooden plank and let’s Nicky drill the fourth, carefully holding the drill for him and guiding his arms.</p><p>
  <em>Something to remember her by, if one day they tell her not to come anymore.</em>
</p><p>She lets Nicky pick a tree with a sturdy branch and fastens the rope around it. It’s makeshift, and maybe she needs to swing by Home Depot later to find a more permanent fixture, but it will hold him just fine for now.</p><p>He is so eager to get on, he almost falls off backwards again the first time. She laughs and helps him climb on top once more, and then pushes him, helping him swing back and forth while he is shouting with joy. She leaves him there to swing a little more when she realizes it’s almost time for lunch.</p><p>She thinks about what to make for a while, rummages through the fridge, noting with a little bit of arrogant pride how badly it is stocked in comparison to when she was still running this household. There is, however, a pumpkin still sitting their vegetable drawer, and of course bacon on the top shelf. She toys with the thought for a moment. She is certainly not troubling herself with making dumplings, but even rationally speaking – pumpkin soup is on the quicker side of preparation. And it freezes well if there are leftovers. And it’s healthy – somewhat… well without the bacon.</p><p> </p><p>And yes, it does send a pang of<em> something </em>into her chest when she mentions to Agatha, who comes home without having had lunch, that it’s there. Sue her for it. She doesn’t care. She will never confess to anyone that the warm, excited smile Agatha gives her is worth it. Not even to herself. Because it doesn’t mean anything. It’s just her favorite food.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <p> </p><p>Rio answers the phone when Agatha calls early on Saturday morning. She is still beneath her sheets and blames it on the two beers she’s had last night while watching Jeopardy with her grandmother <em>(on a Friday night, really, she is such a looser).</em></p><p>“I wasn’t sure you’d pick up,” Rio can hear that Agatha is rummaging through something.</p><p>“You just woke me up,” she mumbles with a husky voice.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, should I call again later?”</p><p>
  <em>How about just not calling me anymore?</em>
</p><p>Rio sighs.</p><p>“No, it’s fine, what’s up? Is Nicky alright?”</p><p>“Yeah, no he’s fine, he’s with Andrew’s mother this weekend, probably stuffing his face with ice-cream for breakfast right now…”</p><p>
  <em>Alright, good to know.</em>
</p><p>“Great, anything else?”, Rio cuts her off. This isn’t necessary. And it’s annoying as hell.</p><p>“Yes!”, Agatha exclaims, the rummaging stops, “would you talk to me?”</p><p>“Am I not talking to you right now?”, Rio rolls over in her bed, pretending and acting dumb.</p><p>There is a silence on the other end. For a moment Rio thinks the line has gone dead.</p><p>“Rio please will you let me talk to you? I just want to explain and then you never have to see me again.”</p><p>She presses the phone to her chest and closes her eyes. She wants to go back to sleep.</p><p>“And I can bring your scarf! I think you forgot it here that very first week and never picked it up,” she hears her plead.</p><p>
  <em>Bring?</em>
</p><p>Rio rubs her face. <em>This is just going to keep giving her heartbreak, isn’t it?</em></p><p>“Fine,” she mutters.</p><p>“Would 12 work for you? I know it’s spontaneous.”</p><p>She looks at the clock over her bed. It’s just past 8.</p><p>“Sure,” she sighs again, audibly, so that Agatha can hear.</p><p>“I’ll send you the location.”</p><p>Rio is almost about to hang up when she hears Agatha add one more thing.</p><p>“Thank you, I know this isn’t easy for you.”</p><p>“Hmm,” she adds in lieu of anything better and let’s her phone fall onto her carpet, pulling the sheets back over her head wishing she was a stronger woman than she is. She tries, but she can’t bring herself to regret the day she found the advert. Instead, she crawls underneath her cushions and presses up to the wall her bed stands next to, as if she can merge with it and hide from it all.</p><p>She falls back asleep and wakes up again closer to 11 than she had wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>When she gets to her car, the upper half of a cream-cheese bagel in her mouth, she doesn’t even check the address, she’s already 10 minutes late and while she’s happy for Agatha to wait for her, she personally can’t stomach tardiness.</p><p>The sky looks grey and dull as she drives upstate, trees without leaves lining the country roads, looking like ghosts of their former selves. Just two months ago they had been lush and golden, fluttering in the autumn sun – but then, a lot can change in two months.</p><p>Halfway through her drive she regrets not even looking at the general area of the address. None of it looks even vaguely familiar to her and it gets more and more remote with every mile she drives. At some point she even starts to worry about her gas levels, even if her phone keeps telling her it’s just a few more minutes.</p><p>It all comes clear when she turns onto a gravel road that she finally recognizes. Just a little further on, just before she turns to park, a large sign confirms her suspicions.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>North Vermont Giddy Ranch<br />Private Property – No Trespassing</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Agatha’s got to be kidding her.</em>
</p><p>She presses out a laugh and shakes her head, not sure what to make of it.</p><p>The property is more quiet than last time, even though it’s a weekend, there are only a handful of other cars parked on the gravel patch, Agatha’s G-Wagon amongst them. Perhaps it’s the weather or people have already taken care of their animals and left again, but then, what does she care. Checking her phone, there are no new messages, nothing regarding where Agatha expects to meet her. Looking around, she recognizes the stables where Elphaba’s box had been and decides to look for her there.</p><p>A drop of rain lands on her cheek as she walks over, the clouds above look angry, like there is going to be a downpour later. She zips her jacket all the way up to her chin, but it doesn’t make her feel any warmer until she enters the stables. She spots Agatha from all the way over at the entrance, heaving a saddle on top of Elphaba.</p><p>“Sneaky to just give me the street address instead of the facility,” Rio chooses to open with, once she is close enough. She doesn’t think about the way Agatha’s hair gently sways when she turns around to her.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure if you’d have come otherwise,” Agatha admits with a small smile on her lips.</p><p>“We’ll never know,” Rio shrugs as Agatha fixes the saddle underneath Elphaba’s belly, fastening the belt as tightly as possible.</p><p>“I thought you wanted to talk,” Rio moves a bit of hay over with her foot, looking down at it, because where else is she supposed to look.</p><p>“Can’t we talk here?”, Agatha huffs from the strain, still working on the belt.</p><p>“Yeah, but why?”, Rio retaliates as Agatha straightens up again, testing the saddle fixture.</p><p>She doesn’t answer for a short while.</p><p>“I messed up and I know it. And I thought long and hard about what to say, but it doesn’t really feel like there is anything I could say to make it better. So I thought the best I can probably do is give you this at least,“ she pats her right hand on the saddle, “so we can part on a positive note,” she smiles, “we were both happy here that day, weren’t we?”</p><p>Rio raises a brow and it visibly confuses Agatha.</p><p>“At least I thought last time that you wanted to learn how to properly ride a horse, did I misinterpret that?”</p><p>
  <em>Oh? Oh.</em>
</p><p>“You want to teach me how to ride her? On my own? In an afternoon?”</p><p>“It’s not that hard. I promise. And if you want you can shout at me afterwards and then I will disappear from your life and you will never have to see me again.”</p><p>“It’s a little more complicated than that though, isn’t it?”, Rio lets out a sad laugh.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha nods, “let me do this for you first, alright? And then… well everything else. Or nothing at all. Whatever you want.”</p><p>Rio takes one long look at Elphaba. The black mare is calmly chewing on the snaffle, relaxed and happy as ever. From what she remembers, she is all set-up and ready, Agatha must have been her for at least an hour. Seems a shame to waste it.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ll be very good at this,” she claims in one last, half-hearted moment of defiance.</p><p>It makes Agatha laugh heavenly, “you’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha hands her a black helmet and gloves and asks her to take off her jacket and leave it near the box. Rio still remembers the walk over to the arena and Agatha makes her take Elphaba’s reigns this time, silently walking next to her, a long leash in hand. Inside, she fixes it to Elphaba and walks them to the very middle of the building, taking advantage of its emptiness. There is only one other rider at the other end of the arena, gently making her rounds without acknowledging them.</p><p>“I’ll have you sit just like last time, and then I’ll extend this line,“ she points at the leash, “so that I can make your go around in a circle. We’re just gonna make her walk in the beginning and then we’ll see how you go.”</p><p>Rio nods and is glad she makes it into the saddle without needing Agatha’s hand on her butt this time. The perspective is just as amazing as when she had last sat on Elphaba’s back and she can feel her breathe underneath her shanks, can feel how warm she is. On the ground, Agatha makes sure her stirrups are the proper length, adjust something and then tells her how to angle her legs and how to use them to communicate to Elphaba to move and to keep her hands as still as possible in order not to hurt her. She then makes Rio squeeze her legs to that Elphaba begins to gently walk underneath her, while Agatha moves away from them, extending the leash as she said she would.</p><p>Rio’s heart starts to beat faster at the feeling of movement below her. It’s both beautifully exhilarating and anxiety-inducing at the same time. The way she’s putting all her trust into the mare not to just bolt and throw her to the ground.</p><p>Agatha let’s them walk together for a few minutes, regarding them in silence, before she suggests going a little bit faster and to start a trot.</p><p>“It’s always scary the first time,” she laughs and explains to Rio how to use her heels to encourage the mare to start.</p><p>It’s a completely new feeling and it almost makes her giggle how much it’s shaking her up as she adapts the verbal signals Agatha is using to praise Elphaba while trying to stay on top of her. Only vaguely does she suddenly perceive the grassy smell of hay in her nose, they way it makes her feel homey and grounded. She can’t help marveling at how the two of them work in tandem and when Agatha finally encourages her to indicate Elphaba to canter it sends a tingle into her stomach every time she gently launches them into the air. Even if she wanted to hide her enjoyment from Agatha, she wouldn’t be able to. Her grin is wide as she eases into it as if it’s second nature to her now.</p><p>“I can recommend a good stable nearer to where you are if you want”, Agatha suggests when it’s time to Rio to dismount, both her and Elphaba sweaty and out of breath.</p><p>Rio nods, adrenaline slowly draining out of her veins, her leg muscles starting to ache pleasantly.</p><p>Their walk back to Elphaba’s box is as quiet as it had been earlier. Rio hesitates, and suddenly feels like if there is anything to be said, Agatha needs to be the one to speak first. She almost doesn’t want to spoil the afternoon with what is inevitably coming for them. The things that need to be said to make sense of whatever this has been. The things that will ultimately close this chapter between them.</p><p>She avoids it all until they have cleaned Elphaba up, fed her, and there is really nothing else to do anymore except to part ways. Maybe Agatha feels it too, so Rio is almost surprised, when she finally does begin to talk as they exit the stables on the back-side to walk back to their cars.</p><p>“I realized last night I never actually really thanked you for what you did. That you came at a moment’s notice when I called, after everything I did,” she puts a hand on Rio’s arm and caresses it carefully, “thank you for bringing him back to me.”</p><p>“I was always gonna come for him, Agatha,” she answers.</p><p>The fall quiet again for a while and stop, Agatha doesn’t move her hand, just keeps gently stroking her thumb over the fabric, carefully avoiding Rio’s gaze.</p><p>“We’re getting a divorce, you know.”</p><p>
  <em>Sorry what?</em>
</p><p>“What the fuck? Because of this?”, she gestures between them with a raised voice, “No! What the fuck Agatha? You can’t make me a homewrecker!”</p><p>Agatha snorts.</p><p>“Rio I’m not divorcing him because of you, don’t worry you’re not getting that credit, <em>you </em>didn’t ruin my marriage. We’ve been talking about it for months now. It’s over, and it has been for a while, there is no saving it, and I don’t want to save it anymore.”</p><p>
  <em>What the fuck?</em>
</p><p>She stares at her with big eyes until Agatha let’s her shoulders fall and starts to explain.</p><p>“Moving out here,” she circles with her finger, “was our last try. We thought it would give us the chance to grow together more as a family, take us away from Boston where we were both working 55 hours a week and barely saw each other. But I think we both knew relatively soon nothing was changing. So in August I told him I wanted to go through with the divorce after all. He begged me to take Nicky on this… <em>fucking trip</em> and wanted to tell him after.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio raises a brow.</p><p>“I said we could do that, but that I wanted to have someone, you know… someone who was gonna support me with the house, because I wanted to increase my hours to save up money for when we would eventually split,” she takes a break and a sad half-smile forms on her mouth, “and that’s how I found you.”</p><p>Rio looks at her in sheer disbelief. Still, some pieces finally fall into place for her. Why she has never seen them kiss or hug, why Agatha seems to regularly sleep in her office, and why she prefers to spend her weekends anywhere else but with Andrew.</p><p>As they slowly start walking again, another drop of rain hits Rio’s face, and then another, and then Agatha notices it too. Instead of rushing back or to their cars, Agatha opens a door on the red barn they have been passing. It’s just in time before the New England sky above them begins to relief itself of all the water it has been holding in its mean, dark clouds.</p><p>Agatha leaves the door open, and they stand in the frame for a while, looking out at the rain.</p><p>It’s nice for a while. Both of them simply existing in the same space together like they used to. The taste of morning coffee forms on Rio’s tongue. How many mornings had they spent like that? Quietly bathing in each other’s company.</p><p>“You still had no right to do what you did,” Rio establishes – and there is something bitter in her voice.</p><p>“No, I didn’t. And I’m sorry.”</p><p>“What was it? What made you send me home that day?”</p><p>Agatha picks at her nails for a second, then looks away.</p><p>“I was scared. I was scared what it would mean – for me, for Nicky, for you of course. I was already on the brink of a divorce and…”</p><p>“You didn’t also want to become a lesbian overnight.”</p><p>Agatha let’s out a hollow laugh.</p><p>“I’ve been a lesbian all my life Rio. But I’ve never…”, she bites her lower lip, “I’ve never liked <em>anyone</em> in my life… <em>this</em> much. Let alone someone I was paying to put up with me,” she grins again and gestures to Rio, “someone so young.”</p><p>“I wasn’t just putting up with you, you know,” Rio adds quietly, “I was feeling bad you were paying me when I was enjoying it so much.”</p><p>“Thank you for saying that,” Agatha answers and touches her side, “can I give you a hug?”</p><p>Rio nods and let’s herself be pulled in, burying her face in the crook of Agatha’s neck, breathing in, and marveling at the smell of hay mixed with what can only be described as unequivocally Agatha. She can feel her hands carefully stoking her back, reaching all the way up to her hair, twirling it, and then letting it go. Letting Rio go.</p><p>“Thank you for everything. If you want to spend time with Nicky, you’re welcome any time,” Agatha takes her face into both of her hands and strokes her cheek with her thumbs. The smile on her lips is finally warm again, as if she has made peace with something.</p><p>
  <em>This is where the girl kisses you? Right? In all the movies, that’s where it leads. That’s where it culminates, where the happy ending starts. Right?</em>
</p><p>But Agatha doesn’t kiss her. Instead, she let’s her hands fall to her sides and takes her car key out of the pocket of her jacket. Nodding, she steps out the door and into the rain and leaves. She doesn’t turn back.</p><p>The barn feels cold and empty all of a sudden. Rio can’t smell it anymore. Her nostrils are doing that thing again where they are swelling shut, just before tears are about to flood her eyes. She touches her forehead, light, with fingertips that have gone numb. The sound of the rain on the roof is deafening. It hurts so bad. Like nothing has ever hurt before. Like it will crack her chest open and split her in half. She shivers.</p><p>
  <em>Is this how this ends?</em>
</p><p>She steps out of the barn and sees her walking towards the cars. She hasn’t gotten far.</p><p>“Agatha!”, she screams through the downpour, feeling how the water is seeping into her clothes, as her feet carry her all the way down. “Agatha!”</p><p>Thankfully she hears her and stops. Her entire face is wet, but Rio can still see the tears on her cheeks. When she reaches her, she swallows.</p><p>“You didn’t bring my scarf!”</p><p>Agatha looks at her in utter confusion.</p><p>
  <em>Coward.</em>
</p><p>“You didn’t bring my scarf and now you have the audacity to leave me standing here again? You are <em>such</em> an asshole! You say all these things, you hug me like that and then you just leave?”</p><p>She uses both of her palms to push Agatha away. She isn’t sure if she’s ever been this angry.</p><p>“You’re nothing but a coward! Tell me about being happy here! What are you gonna do? You’re not even halfway out the closet and you’re already on your way back in again? Huh?”</p><p>She wants to push her again, but Agatha catches her hands this time.</p><p>“I-I didn’t think you-you’d want me after all this,” she stutters, eyes wet.</p><p>It’s quiet and it’s quaint, as if she doesn't dare asking for this, for them. It breaks Rio’s heart in half as her hair clings to her cheeks, wet and cold. It’s also what makes her take Agatha’s face into both of her hands and pull her in like that, finally kissing her again.</p><p>It’s rough and it’s messy and will probably always be. But she can feel Agatha’s hands rising up to her wrists, not fighting them but firmly keeping them in place like she doesn’t want to risk Rio pulling away.</p><p>They make it back into the barn with drenched clothes, but it doesn’t matter, because as soon as the door is shut behind her, Rio tears Agatha’s clothes off of her, jacket first, then top and pants. They land on the dirty stone floor and she doesn’t care. She doesn’t care about it either when Agatha presses her down into the straw, straddling her legs, and the dry stalks poke into her bare back.</p><p>Between kisses, she looks up at her, swollen lips and fluffy wet hair that is slowly beginning to dry. Agatha’s cheeks are pink from tears and arousal, Rio can’t tell it apart, but it doesn’t matter because no one has ever kissed her like this. Hands on her head, almost devouring her lips, like it’s the last thing they will ever touch. No one has panted like this for her either when she takes Agatha’s breasts into her mouth, softly biting on the sensitive buds and scratching her back open at the same time. And no one has moaned like this, when it’s finally her turn to bury two fingers inside of Agatha with her thumb stroking over her clit, wet and wanting.</p><p>She expects Agatha to close her eyes, maybe concentrate on the newness of it, but she keeps them open, her pupils dilated to a degree where Rio can’t see any blue in them anymore. Mouth open, she kisses her again and again, riding her fingers, muttering soft encouragements into Rio’s ears.</p><p>
  <em>I’ve thought about this for so long.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don’t stop, don’t stop.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You have no idea how I’ve dreamed about this.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don’t ever leave me, please.</em>
</p><p>She comes with a cry that is so sweet Rio wants to record it so she can listen to it until the end of time. Agatha doesn’t let her go at first, seems to enjoy how she is still wrapped around Rio’s fingers. Rio can feel her move gently, testing it out, until she kisses her again, long and sweet.</p><p>“Are you gonna come home with me?”, Agatha asks her, “to pick up that scarf?”</p><p>“Depends on whether I can use your shower and warm up first,” Rio teases.</p><p>And Agatha laughs.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <p>
  <strong>EPILOGUE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>There are a handful of things she will never grow tired of. First, the change of the New England seasons – summer kissing spring goodbye and extending its open arms to every approaching fall before winter is ushered in with its cozy, dark nights and it starts all over again. She doesn’t do favorites, but she likes fall best still: yellow leaves and crisp, fragrant morning air, stretched out afternoons on the couch next to Agatha reading books and drinking coffee. Midnight cuddles with peanut butter, solving 15000-piece jigsaw puzzles with Nicky – and then just before Halloween, celebrating Mimi’s birthday.</p><p>Another thing she will never grow tired off are tiny little squeals and the sound of small steps rushing towards her from the front door when she comes home at night. She can’t lift Nicky of the ground anymore, but Mimi still is small and light enough and loves it when she twirls her around, throws her into the air, and carries her on her hip like she used to with Nicky until it became <em>lame</em> and he no longer wanted snuggles (thankfully that phase didn’t last very long).</p><p>Every night when she comes home there is a tiny human waiting for her in the door frame, driving Agatha insane because originally, they had agreed she’d still go to bed at 6.30 PM even now that she has turned four. But Mimi won’t have it. After all, she gets her stubbornness from Agatha.</p><p>Rio can’t even set her tools down before Mimi audibly demands a hug. Sometimes she worries whether she is gone too long throughout the day, whether she is doing right by her, whether all the love she’s giving her will ever just come to touch how much she actually deserves.</p><p>“Where are Mama and Nicky?”, she asks when Mimi begins to toy with the strands of black hair that have come undone from Rio’s do-up.</p><p>“Puzzle room,” her little monster mumbles.</p><p>Rio sets her down and takes off her boots, asks after Mimi’s day at daycare and washes her hands.</p><p>The <em>Puzzle room</em> is Agatha’s an Andrew’s old bedroom, now converted into a space where Nickolas’ jigsaw puzzles can remain spread out over the floor instead of covering every surface in their living room. It’s where they’d installed his PlayStation too – <em>also to reclaim their living room</em>. He and Agatha are on it when she opens the door to peak in, playing Minecraft, snuggled up together on several bean bags.</p><p>“Let me guess, I’m making dinner,” she chuckles, Mimi still on her hip.</p><p>“Shit, is it that late already?”, when Agatha looks over and then at her wrist watch, Rio sees that the new glasses have apparently arrived. Her mouth goes dry in an instant. Agatha had gushed about them all morning, tracking the delivery on her phone until Rio had to leave for work.</p><p>
  <em>They one hundred percent were worth the wait. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>On a scale of 1 to 10, how pathetic is it to get this instantly horny for your wife about a pair of new, wide-rimmed glasses?</em>
</p><p>The third thing she will never get tired of is the sounds Agatha makes when Rio’s head is between her legs, Agatha’s shins over her shoulders, hands in her hair, pushing her down, rubbing her cunt on Rio’s face. Over the years she’s started to mumble the most gorgeous obscenities when she’s this close. Things that make Rio feel a primal need she didn’t know she was capable of, things like <em>you fuck me so fucking good baby</em>, or <em>fuck, harder Rio, please</em> or <em>be my good little girl for me</em>. In another life, Agatha muses sometimes (<em>and Rio knows she doesn’t mean another life, but her old life</em>), she’d sought out therapy over it. Maybe also over the way she still likes to fuck Rio into the mattress face first, two fingers in her cunt (<em>and, when Agatha is extremely pleased with herself, one in her butt as well</em>).</p><p>Sometimes she wonders if it’s all <em>this</em> hideously good because Agatha has to catch up on 20+ years of lesbian sex, or if she’s just extremely lucky that for some reason Agatha still finds her <em>this</em> attractive after almost 10 years together.</p><p>It doesn’t really matter, not when this is her little piece of heaven – wrapped up in each other’s arms, sweaty, over tangled sheets, the children soundly sleeping upstairs, the moon shining into their new bedroom.</p><p>After nights like these, she often wakes up early, her heart too full to fall back asleep, and walks out onto the back porch she has built a few years ago. Equipped with a hot water bottle and a thick blanket, she likes to watch the sun come up over their property, chasing away the remaining fog that still hugs the hills. Somehow, bathed here in this golden light it is how she finds her faith again, thankfulness engulfing her.</p><p>She stirs when she hears the back door open next to her, Nickolas sticking is head out, one eye pressed closed, still in the hoody and sweatpants he likes to sleep in.</p><p>“Aren’t you cold?”, he asks with that lovely voice of his that has slowly gotten deeper.</p><p>“Mama’s hot water bottle,” she lifts her blanket to show him, and he takes it as an invite, grabbing another blanket from the basket inside and snuggling up next to her.</p><p>“What’s this?”, she asks when he puts a manila folder on the little wooden table.</p><p>He doesn’t answer for a while, looking out over the hills and to the swing he’s become too heavy for, but that they have reinforced together last Easter for Mimi.</p><p>“I have a question.”</p><p>“Wear a condom,” she jokes, and his ears go red before he bumps his elbow into her side.</p><p>He laughs.</p><p>“No, you can’t have the keys to the Mustang, and if you want the Mercedes you have to talk to Mama,” she continues and he shakes his head with a smile.</p><p>“No nothing of that sort,” he sticks out his tongue and grabs the folder. Rio can see that his hands are shaking.</p><p>“You okay baby?”, she’s suddenly worried.</p><p>“I need you to sign something for me.”</p><p>“Sure, something for school?”</p><p>“No, not for school.”</p><p>He stays quiet again, biting his lip.</p><p>“Baby you’re having me worried here,” she gently touches her teenager’s arm and he clears his throat, scratching his forehead.</p><p>“I wanna change my name!”, he blurts out suddenly.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you name?”, Rio frowns and takes the folder from him, “I never heard you complain about the name <em>Nickolas</em>, what you want? Harvey? Steve? That cooler?”, she chuckles and opens the file.</p><p>
  <em>Oh.</em>
</p><p>It’s a single, white sheet of paper. A form to be specific. It’s already filled in.</p><p>Appeal for name change of <em>Nickolas Harkness</em> to <em>Nickolas Harkness-Vidal</em>.</p><p>Her eyes blow out wide.</p><p>“I’d like to add your name to mine.”</p><p>She doesn’t know what to say.</p><p>“I already filled in all the legal stuff and Mama and Dad have already signed it, but I need the signatures of all my parents or guardians. And also, I wanted to ask…”, he swallows again, “if it’s okay with you?”</p><p>“Nicky where is this coming from? What do you mean your Dad signed it?”</p><p>“You’re all called <em>Harkness-Vidal</em>. You, Mama, and Miriam. I’m the only one stuck on just <em>Harkness</em>.”</p><p>“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean I love you any less,” she tries to defend herself. Where is this coming from? Has she not been a good enough mother that he feels the need to make sure he’s part of this family? Suddenly her head is spinning.</p><p>“No, I know, I know Rio, it’s just – “, he sighs, “it’s-it’s<em> because</em> you don’t love me any less that I want this. I’m not just Mama’s, I’m yours too – and I want my name to show that.”</p><p>She has to swallow hard at that. Tears well in her eyes.</p><p>“And your Dad isn’t upset with this? I don’t want him upset with me!”</p><p>She is very proud that they are making this whole patch-work thing work with Andrew and his new wife.</p><p>“He said he had expected you and Mama to change my name after Mimi was born anyway and was actually surprised you didn’t.”</p><p>“We didn’t want to force anything on you,” she tries to justify herself, burying her face in her hands.</p><p>“And it’s okay – but I want this <em>now</em>. Will you please sign so I can ask Mama to set a court date? I’m starting to think you don’t want me too.”</p><p>She can feel his hand on her knee and all of a sudden, she sees her little boy again, lost in the woods, running towards her all those years ago. Her tears come unbidden, but she can’t do anything about them when she pulls him into a tight embrace and buries her head in his hoodie, the only boy that will ever matter to her returning the embrace. Her heart is beating so fast she fears it might jump out of her chest. She signs the form with shaky hands and starts crying all over again. He has to pry it out of her hands to she doesn’t smudge any of it with her tears.</p><p>She also cries at the court hearing and then again when they go to dinner.</p><p>“You need to stop now, or Mimi will think something is wrong with you and worry,” Agatha comforts her when they walk back to their car, Nicky carrying his little sister a few steps ahead of them.</p><p>“How the fuck do I deserve this?”, Rio wails and pulls her scarf over mouth and nose. Her wet cheeks burn uncomfortably in the evening air.</p><p>“Just between us, I keep asking myself the same thing,” Agatha chuckles and pulls her close. A bit of wind picks up - the nights are getting colder now, winter is being ushered in.</p><p>When Agatha notices that her scarf is coming undone, she stops them and wraps it tightly around Rio’s neck again, planting a soft kiss on her lips.</p><p>Rio kisses her back.</p>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This is it.<br />That's the story. 10 Chapters and an epilogue that tore my little heart out. I hope this didn't get too fluffy, but as I keep saying, this is as much Rio's and Agatha's love story as Nicky's and Rio's. My fiancee really didn't like the idea of Miriam, BUT SHE JUST FEELS RIGHT, SO SUE ME.</p><p>In case you don't know yet, since I know a few of you are new here - my current long-form project <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/62180950?view_full_work=true" rel="nofollow">Crescendo</a> is currently on it's third chapter. And I recently posted Part I of my little Cowboy AU <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/62668030/chapters/160424860" rel="nofollow">Beneath Wilder Skies</a>. Also, someone just told me Ao3 has subscriptions now (I had no idea omg) so I guess if you liked this, subscribe or follow me on TikTok 😅</p><p>I'm so grateful for all of you coming along for this.<br />Thank you so much again, this wouldn't be where it is without you all! 💜💚</p></blockquote>
