    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Hello, coven! I've been working on this fic for the past few months and finally decided to start posting it. This fic was supposed to be almost complete (like 3 chapters left to write), but I had new ideas yesterday, so I guess it's now 65% complete. I will try to post regularly as soon as I have a new chapter finished and corrected. I really hope you'll like it because this fic is really important to me &lt;3
     </p>
     <p>
      If people didn't understand from the tags, Rio is a famous actress in this, and she accidentally texts Agatha as a wrong number. There will be fluff, sex, drama, and crying; but don't worry, it's a happy ending!
     </p>
     <p>
      Enjoy! Sincerely, C 💜

   <div>
    <p>
     Where was the Declaration of Independence signed?
     <em>
      On the bottom of the page.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares at the answer for a full three seconds, her brain trying to debate whether it's a joke or an actual answer. She really,
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     does hope it's the first option. Then, she exhales slowly through her nose, tight-lipped, and draws a clean red line through the words, replacing them with surprisingly still good handwriting:
     <em>
      the Pennsylvania State House, later renamed Independence Hall, in Philadelphia.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She can't believe a student wrote this. An actual teenager, who supposedly attended the class where she explained this exact thing, even showed a picture of the damn building, circled the date on the board. Not knowing the answer is one thing—God knows she's not unreasonable, they're kids, they forget, they zone out—but this feels pointed. As if one of them decided to make a joke of the whole thing, of her, as if all her hours of teaching were nothing, and now she's sitting at her dining table at 1 a.m., surrounded by two precariously leaning towers of papers, sipping lukewarm coffee and playing red-pen therapist to a classroom's worth of teenage nihilism.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then rubs at one temple and sighs, while trying not to think about how much more she has to grade. A class and a half, by her estimate. It's not so much the content—to her surprise, there aren't that many wrong answers or stupid ones like the one she just corrected—but the handwriting, the smudges, the loose glitter from someone's colorful decorative pen, make it way harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha told her students many, many times to only write in either blue or black, with a pen that does not smudge and that does not have fucking glitter (it's a high school test, goddammit, not a romantic journal!), but alas, they're teenagers. They do not listen and certainly don't take care of their handwriting, which, at the end of the day, is the hardest part of her job.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she really can't read an answer, she just counts it as false. She told her class about this, and some still decided not to write properly. Well, their loss then. It might seem rude, but as a history teacher that corrects hundreds of copies per week, she's tired of all this. And anyway, she
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     rude. She knows about the chatter behind her back. She knows her nickname in the student and teacher circle is '
     <em>
      the witch
     </em>
     ,' because she sometimes can be heartless and rude. She doesn't even do it on purpose, it's just how she is. And in all honesty, she doesn't even mind the nickname. The Salem Witch Trials is actually the reason she chosed to be a history teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence of the house doesn't help Agatha focus on her copies. Besides the annoying, buzzing sound of the refrigerator and the ticking of the wall clock (that she will absolutely remove the batteries from very soon because the noise makes her want to smash it on the floor), it's silent. It's so unusual for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has never liked the silence; it reminds her of her childhood. Reminds her how she grew up with an abusive mother who wished she was never born, who never allowed her to watch tv or listen to music, who raised her in silence, where the only things she allowed her to say were her daily prayers. At the table during lunch and dinner, at night before going to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has never believed in God—especially not with a mother who forced religion on her and only swore by Jesus' name—but she didn't have a choice other than to obey her mother. Pray every day with the lines she was forced to memorize at a young age, limes that she didn't even understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence reminds her of those lonely days she spent at home, locked in her room, punished for doing something she didn't even know was wrong. She usually corrects her copies with some music as a background noise (mostly Fleetwood Mac and other vintage stuff), but not today. It's way too late and she doesn't want to wake up her seven-year-old son who, unlike her, needs his eight hours of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though correcting copies late at night is far from enjoyable, Agatha loves her job. She really does. She teaches history to juniors four days a week. From a young age, she has always been passionate about history, especially witches, so teaching everything she knows is enjoyable. Well, when her class doesn't make her want to jump off the window—or worse, throw a
     <em>
      kid
     </em>
     out the window. Some of them provoke her on purpose, as if making the witch angry will make them win a bet, but besides those annoying kids, everything's great. So is her schedule, which leaves her her Wednesdays and weekends free so she can spend some time with her son.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her cute, amazing, smart seven-year-old son, who still insists on dinosaur-shaped pancakes and already dreams of being a paleontologist. Even at his young age, he can already name so many dead lizards, and even corrects his mom when she makes a mistake while trying to speak with him about his passion. She remembers how, one day, she made the mistake of talking about a Quetzalcoatlus as a dinosaur. Nicky had immediately corrected her, telling her that flying reptiles were not dinosaurs. Well, sorry she isn't a dino nerd like him. She teaches history, not earth science.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't mind the correction, though. While everyone thinks she's a mean witch, her son is her entire life and she absolutely loves hearing him talk for hours about the things he likes.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a kid, Agatha was alone, unloved. Her mother hated her, her father was gone. She had no one to speak to about her hobbies and obsessions. Well, she did try to talk to her mother about the Salem Witch Trials, which she... didn't like. She said that witches are a creation of the devil, and that Agatha shouldn't be interested in them. The poor kid had spent an hour locked in the closet—a place Evanora arranged as a praying point, sort of. She hung a cross there on one of the four walls, and pages of the Bible on the others, as if locking her daughter in for hours would change anything. It never did, obviously. It only gave Agatha claustrophobia and religious trauma.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she now makes sure that Nicky knows that he can talk to her about anything, absolutely anything. Even if it's hours of babbling about dead reptiles, she doesn't care. If it makes him happy, then it makes her happy too.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the next ten minutes or so, she silently continues to correct the copies. Her spine protests every time she shifts in her uncomfortable chair and her wrist has developed a faint, persistent ache. Her eyes keep threatening to blur; not surprising considering it's past 1 a.m. And still, the pile waits.
    </p>
    <p>
     A single, sudden vibration of her phone against the wood of the table makes her jump in her seat. She didn't expect someone to text her so late at night, and it can only be a text, as the woman doesn't have any social media and all her other apps are silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who the fuck could it be?
    </p>
    <p>
     Quickly, she turns her phone on and looks at the notification hovering above her beautiful lock screen: a photo of her and Nicky her friend took a few weeks ago. They're both laughing, Agatha holding him from behind after she chased him at the park.
    </p>
    <p>
     The message is from an unknown number, and there's only an attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's... strange.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her brow furrows as she unlocks the device, thumb hesitating for just a second over the message before she decides to open it. If it's a scam, she'll just delete it. At least it's not a link—though she'd never click on one coming from an unknown number. She might be a middle-aged woman, but she's not stupid; she knows how scammers scam people. It won't work on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as she opens the message, her breath leaves her in a quiet, startled sound that is not quite a gasp but definitely not neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's a photo, as she expected. What she didn't expect, however, was the content. It's a woman. Topless, arm slung across her chest to hide her breasts. The focal point, though, is the tattoo she has on her underboob and around. She immediately recognizes the flowers as azaleas, her favorite. They're in bloom, delicate purple-ish blossoms etched into the soft skin just beneath the curve of her right breast, following the line of her ribcage on one side and her boob on the other. It's still in the plastic wrap, so the colors are more pigmented than they will be in a few weeks, but Agatha can't lie, the tattoo is more than beautiful anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
     The teacher has never been a big tattoo girl (though she thought about getting one when she was younger just to piss off her conservative mother), but she does enjoy them on others. Especially if it's a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole thing is unexpected enough that Agatha just stares at it, caught in the moment between shock and amusement. The tattoo isn't the only beautiful thing. Though she can't see the woman's face as the photo stops at her neck, the glimpse she has of her body is enough to tell she's a pretty one. Her eyes linger—unconsciously, of course—enough to notice a few clear lines on her hips, right above what seem to be a pair of green pajama shorts, or even boxers, she can't really tell from this angle.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Stretch marks.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She has some too. She used to hate them, but now she's learned to accept her body as it is. She had a child, of course her body is covered in them. She never minded them on other women, though, even finding them beautiful, so she just... learned to love hers. Learned to love
     <em>
      herself.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Shaking her head, she finally decides to type something.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     <br/>
     I think you got the wrong number
    </p>
    <p>
     A wrong number, there's no doubt there. At least, it's a beautiful woman and not a creepy man. The last thing she wanted right now is to be flashed by a naked torso. Ew. Just ew.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then puts her phone back down on the table to focus on finishing correcting her copies, but she's interrupted by another buzz.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already? She opens the message.

     10 p.m. About to head to bed. What are you doing up at this hour?
    </p>
    <p>
     The teacher lets out a snort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good question: why is she still up at this hour, working on stupid, unreadable history copies instead of sleeping? If she doesn't go to bed soon, she won't even have four hours of sleep. And it's better for everyone (especially her students) that she isn't sleep-deprived. Bit late for that, but well.

     This stranger is curious. Too curious, even. Agatha quickly looks at the time on her phone, and lets out another sigh. It's almost one-thirty in the fucking morning, and she still has over an entire pile to correct for tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, maybe she should have done it before, but she didn't have time. Being a mother comes before being a teacher, so as Nicky was sick this week, Agatha called sick at work to take care of him. And taking care of her sick son meant being with him all day. Cooking some nice stews and soups, reading books to distract him, cleaning up his clothes and his bed after he threw up in the middle of the night. No matter what happens in her life, her role as a mother will always,
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     come first.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Agatha 1:20 AM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Look, I don't want to sound rude but it's late, I don't know you, and I have some work to finish ASAP so I can finally get some rest. So goodnight, unknown number
    </p>
    <p>
     She stares at the message for a second before sending it. She doesn't have the energy or time to talk to this stranger, no matter how tempted she is.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe if this had happened during the day, she would have let it unfold, played along a little, let it distract her from the ever-growing pile of stress that comes with teaching teenagers and parenting alone. But it's past 1 a.m. Her coffee's now completely cold, her back is killing her and her wrist aches. And the exams still aren't finished.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she puts the phone down, then picks the pen back up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next hour drags. She finishes the last half-class of exams slowly, painstakingly. Her handwriting gets sloppier with time and her eyes are closing themselves. She's
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     close to falling asleep on the dining table, which would be an awful thing. Her spine would not be happy about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she finishes the final one (fucking finally!), scrawls the last red note and lets the pen drop with a soft clatter, it's 2:25 a.m. Her whole body feels like it's been compressed into the shape of this chair, every joint stiff and sore. She leans back with a groan, stretching until her spine pops, then slowly gathers the corrected papers into a single pile before putting them back in her teacher's purple leather cross-body bag.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lets herself sit there for a while, not moving, eyes closed, head tilted toward the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could fall asleep like this. She probably would, if not for the thought nudging at the back of her mind. For some reason, she can't stop thinking of this tattoo. About this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Azaleas, her favorite flower. Funny, isn't it? And purple. Her favorite flower
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     her favorite color, etched on that woman's skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shakes her head, almost smiling, like she can physically dislodge the moment. It doesn't matter, anyways. It was nothing. A random photo from a wrong number, it happens. A fleeting coincidence in the middle of a long, exhausted night.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'll never talk to that person again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Probably.
    </p>
    <p>
     After another minute or so, the woman finally gets up from the chair, her whole body aching from staying in the same position for so long in an uncomfortable wooden chair. She stirs some more, then grabs her mug of unfinished cold coffee before dumping it into the sink. With a grimace, she rinses the ceramic out like muscle memory so she doesn't have to in the morning, then turns the kitchen lights off and makes her way towards the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's past two in the morning. Tomorrow—no, today, technically—is going to be hard, physically and mentally. If she's lucky, if she doesn't lie awake thinking too much, if she doesn't check her phone or remember that photo or replay that brief, strange exchange with that
     <strike>
      beautiful
     </strike>
     stranger, she might get three hours of sleep. Maybe. Probably not. Unfortunately, Agatha is one of those people who just can't lie in bed and immediately fall asleep. She's not even wearing pyjamas yet and she didn't brush her teeth after dinner. Her outfit for tomorrow isn't chosen either, so she'll have a lot to catch up on before finally being able to lay down and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a teacher, she also loves to read, especially before sleeping. It helps her relax, both physically and mentally, and distracts her brain so she doesn't think of the things that are bothering her in life. But right now, it's way too late to read, and her eyes are already closing themselves anyways. No reading time before sleep, meaning no distraction, meaning she might think of
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
     Or something else, someone else, but there's no way Agatha will be able to fall asleep so quickly, no matter how tired she is. Her body might be exhausted, but her brain isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     With another sigh, the woman makes her way upstairs. The first creak of wood underfoot makes her wince and freeze mid-step, breath caught in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fucking stairs!
     </em>
     She tried to be discreet, walking on her tiptoes wearing only a pair of purple socks, yet the wood decided to scream under her. Her hand flattens against the wall for balance. The last thing she needs right now is to wake Nicky. Her boy, her entire universe, is a light sleeper. Unlike her, he can fall asleep pretty fast, but if he's awoken during the night, well... that's a whole other kind of night. She knows how those go. She's lived them, especially these past few days when he was sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fucking old stairs," she murmurs under her breath, barely a sound, and shifts her weight more carefully. She climbs the rest of the way srtill on her toes, hoping this time, the stairs will shut up. And on her way to her bedroom, she pauses outside Nicky's door to check on him, to make sure he's peacefully sleeping and well.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door is cracked open just enough for her to slip inside. The glow-in-the-dark stars stuck to his ceiling are barely visible in the gloom. The light from the corridor lights the room enough so she can see Nicky, who is out cold, a little tangle of limbs in his dinosaur pajamas, lying facedown with one arm flung above his head like he's mid-dream gesture, the other curled tight around Señor Scratchy (his favorite stuffed animal—a white and brown rabbit Agatha got him a few years ago. Well, it used to be white, but now the color looks more like cream with time. But alas, Nicky doesn't want to let go of it, even if she had to sew one of his arms back once).
    </p>
    <p>
     His snores are soft, barely there, but Agatha hears them in the silence of the house. He's still deep asleep, thankfully, and oh so cute.
    </p>
    <p>
     She's really happy that he's feeling better now, because the last few days have been hell. He had a fever, refused to eat—or if he did, he ended up throwing up. He spent the days sleeping on the couch, curled against his mother and his nights were restless. He also refused to let go of Agatha, scared to be left alone to sleep, so she had him sleep in her room. Well, sleep is a big word, more like cuddle while she read to him, hoping he'd finally fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     These days were awful. The doctor said it was a small flu, that he'd get better soon with medicine, but as a mother, Agatha was terrified. He's the only family she has left. If something ever happened to him... fuck, she doesn't know what she'd do. Her child is her whole life, and seeing him so sick, so unwell for three entire days and nights, was pure torture. She had wished she could take his place, take his pain—she had to endure much more pain than a simple flu when she was younger, she could've handled it—but there was nothing she could do, and she felt useless.
    </p>
    <p>
     The medicine, besides lowering his fever and making sure the very few things he drank and ate stayed in his body, didn't really help. The virus was still there, making his whole small body ache, and Agatha had to be there and watch it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky hasn't been so sick in over a year, and she had forgotten how bad it was. Now, he seems to be better and ready to go back to school, though she had told him he could spend the rest of the week at home to rest some more. He refused, though, telling his mother he wanted to see his friends and learn new things.
    </p>
    <p>
     How she loves him, her little nerd.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leans against the doorframe for a few more minutes, watching him breathe. He's still under the blue blanket she tucked around him earlier, still warm and safe in the dark. That's good. He needs the sleep, needs to catch up on this awful past few days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually, after a while, Agatha decides to step inside, still on her tiptoes. She stops at his bed and brushes a soft curl away from his forehead, making sure he doesn't have a fever as she does. Thankfully, his forehead isn't warm. He does seem to be healed and ready to go back to school—though, as an overprotective mother, she would've kept him at home for the rest of the week to be sure he's fully healed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kisses his head gently, then mutters a quick "Good night, buddy," before discreetly returning to the corridor, making sure to leave the door ajar, as she knows he doesn't enjoy sleeping with it entirely closed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, the teacher quickly heads to the bathroom to brush her teeth and change into a pair of pyjamas—lilac Juicy Couture top with matching shorts—before heading straight to bed. She lays down and closes her eyes, but to her surprise, instead of seeing black (or technically a dark gray color called
     <em>
      eigengrau
     </em>
     —looks like black but isn't black; Nicky, being the nerd that he is, had told her this not long ago), no. Instead, she sees an azalea tattoo and a bare chest covered by toned arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck.

     The next morning, Agatha is finishing her coffee at the dining table with her head tilted slightly to the side and eyes half-lidded as she fights the urge to let her forehead drop against the surface. The mug between her hands is warm, but barely; she's been nursing it for too long, distracted by exhaustion and the sound of the rain outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha usually loves the rain—she loves the vibe, the calm and soothing sound of it, even the gray of the clouds—but not today. She's been freezing since she got out of bed, even with her floral robe she wears over her work clothes to keep her warm. According to her phone, temperatures outside are only thirteen degrees celsius, which is not that bad, but when your body lacks sleep, it's always cold. The rain won't help, nor will the wind. Plus all these annoying teenagers so early in the morning... ugh, Agatha is certain that this day will be awful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Across from her, Nicky, who unlike her had the
     <em>
      immense
     </em>
     privilege of getting his full eight hours of sleep, is already wide awake and munching away on a bowl of unhealthily chemical, colorful cereal. He asked for
     <em>
      Froot Loops
     </em>
     —could also be called diabetes in a bowl considering all the chemicals and sugar in them—but Agatha wasn't in the mood to argue this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     She's a good mom, don't get her wrong. Even on three hours of sleep, she'd still whip up eggs and bacon or pancakes shaped like dinosaurs if that's what he wanted. But when she offered, he scrunched his nose and insisted on the cereal with the weird bird on the box. She really shouldn't have bought this and will make sure to never buy it again, because her son deserves to grow up eating healthy things. At least a normal breakfast, homemade, with no weird artificial colors and a crazy amount of sugar and shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     While eating, Nicky hums under his breath, and Agatha recognizes the tune almost immediately as
     <em>
      The Ballad of the Witches' Road
     </em>
     by Lorna Wu. It's been playing on a loop in their house for weeks. He's completely obsessed with that song and the entire album it comes from, and though she'd never say it aloud, Agatha might actually like it too. Let's say it's not that bad. Kind of similar to Fleetwood Mac, but without Stevie Nicks' iconic voice. That's actually what Agatha got him for Christmas: a vinyl of the full album, the fancy edition with the purple cover and silver lettering. He screamed when he opened it and immediately went to his room to play it on his record player. Now, every time she hears the intro chords, she finds herself tapping her foot before she even realizes it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She's just about to tell him to hurry up and get dressed when her phone buzzes on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart skips a beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shit, is she late? Did she lose track of time somehow? She fumbles for the phone, blinking hard to get her tired eyes to focus on the screen, and when she finally does, she exhales with quiet relief. 7:02 a.m. Still plenty of time before she has to leave for school. It's not, as she expected, a message from the school, no. It's a new message from the unknown number.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Unknown Number 7:02 AM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry for interrupting your work last night. Hope you managed to finish everything
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares at the message for a second, caught off guard by how oddly considerate it is. She should probably delete it—ignore it, move on, pretend none of this ever happened because this woman is nothing but a wrong number—but something makes her pause. And before she can stop herself, she types back.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     <br/>

    </p>
    <p>
     That woman is nice. She always uses those weird emoticons and does seem like a sweet person. Agatha now realizes how rude she was yesterday, and she feels the need to apologize—something she normally never does (except to Nicky, of course).
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Agatha 7:05 AM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't want to sound mean or anything, I was just exhausted and wanted to finish my work ASAP to be able to get a few hours of sleep. I was rude to you while you did nothing wrong. I apologize

    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyebrows raise a little, one corner of her mouth twitching up in reluctant amusement. She doesn't exactly know what to make of that last message, and she's too tired to decipher any implied flirtation—if that's even what it is—so she lets it hang there and replies with something completelly different.
    </p>
    <p>

     The teacher gives another glance at the time, and something clicks in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Agatha 7:10 AM
     </strong>
     <br/>

     <em>
      Holy shit.
     </em>
     No, no, no, she can't say this. She just can't...
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes widen a bit at the unexpected message, before a new one comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Unknown Number 7:11 AM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And good luck for today. I'm sure it'll be okay
    </p>
    <p>
     The teacher can't stop the smile forming on her lips. She then sets the phone face-down on the table and glances up just in time to see Nicky looking at her, spoon paused halfway to his mouth and milk dripping down his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mama, who are you texting?" he asks, curious. She doesn't wonder why. Agatha Harkness isn't the kind of woman to have her eyes glued to her phone—when she texts, which is very rare, it's either to the school, her colleagues, or her best friend Wanda. But considering she lives in the house next door, they just meet up in person to talk instead of exchanging texts. So it's no surprise that Nicky is curious about who his mom is texting so early in the morning, and especially why she's smiling like an idiot at the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, panicking, simply clears her throat and says, "No one important." It's real. It's no one important, just a wrong number. Nicky doesn't have to worry about that. "Finish your bowl, sweetie. You still need to get dressed for school."
    </p>
    <p>
     +++
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Agatha gets to Westview High, right after dropping Nicky at his own elementary school, it's already 8:13 a.m. Thirteen whole minutes late. Between helping her son get dressed (which included a twenty-minute hunt for one missing shoe), struggling to do her own makeup without poking her eye out and getting stuck in the morning traffic, she ended up arriving late for the first time in nearly three month. And Agatha Harkness is
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     a woman who arrives late. She prides herself on punctuality; it's part of the image, part of the persona. How else are her students supposed to respect her—or better, fear her—if she doesn't at least show up on time?
    </p>
    <p>
     But not today. No, today, on a Friday of all days, she walks into the main hallway and sees a group of her students already waiting outside her classroom. Some are sitting cross-legged on the floor, heads leaned against their backpacks or the lockers behind them, while others are simply standing around in loose circles, chatting like it's recess in middle school instead of the start of a junior history class.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shit. Agatha really hopes her colleagues, who unlike her started their class on time, won't say anything about her being late and leaving her loud students bothering the whole hallway during class time. If there's one thing she hates above all, it's being scolded like a schoolgirl by adults.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're late, Professor Snape," one student jokes when he sees the teacher walking towards the locked classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ugh, seriously? She hasn't even been there for five fucking minutes and she already wants to throw a student out the window (come on, it's the ground floor, it's not like they're gonna break a bone or anything).
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking a deep breath, Agatha turns around in a swift movement, twirling her long royal blue coat as she approaches the door. Okay,
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     is probably the reason why that one student called her Professor Snape, but she won't stop doing it. This coat is her favorite, and if she wants to dramatically move it like the Slytherin's robe, well, she fucking will. Agatha Harkness isn't scared of a seventeen-year-old child, for fuck's sake. If someone should be scared, it's them, because the history teacher is not known for her patience, especially with three hours of sleep and an unhealthy amount of caffeine in her body so early in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she arrives in front of the closed door, she takes out her key (which has a cute rabbit keychain on it, matching the one Nicky has on his schoolbag), but not before turning her head and giving the courageous student that called her Snape a dark glance. But not any kind of angry glance, no, the kind that will certainly make him shut up for the rest of the semester, the kind that screams
     <em>
      'if I had powers, I'd cast Imperio on you and force you to ridiculize yourself in front of the whole school.'
     </em>
     Of course, Agatha is not heartless, she is a mother herself and would never truly harm a child even if she could. So no
     <em>
      Crucio
     </em>
     spell on anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boy quickly looks away from her scary glance, pretending to talk to a friend, though his flushed ears betray him. Not so brave now, huh?
    </p>
    <p>
     Without wasting another second, Agatha finally unlocks the door and strides into her classroom, with her dear coat moving behind her. She tosses her purple leather cross-body bag onto the desk and begins pulling out the neat stack of graded exams she worked on for half the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those fucking copies, ugh. Sometimes she isn't sure if she's teaching high schoolers or preschoolers, considering their ridiculous false answers and their unreadable writing. Maybe she should send a few back to preschool so they can learn how to write properly, in a readable handwriting. Even Nicky can write better than them, can you believe it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her students file in behind her and sit down at their assigned seats.

    <p>
     Her class isn't that big, fifteen teenagers only, but this doesn't mean it's any easier. Some are evil. Pure evil. Making fun of her as soon as she has her back turned, laughing and throwing paper balls at her. Her response is usually yelling at them about how immature they are for juniors, which works for some because they stop their shenanigans right after, but some resist and don't care about getting yelled at, like the boy who called her Snape. Pretty courageous boy—she'll make sure to keep an eye on him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once everyone is more or less seated and semi-silent, she walks to the front of the classroom and stands tall, arms crossed to look more intimidating. If her demons—sorry,
     <em>
      students
     </em>
     —realize that she's sleep-deprived and that she can barely keep her eyes open, if they realize that today, she's not at her best, weak even, they'll take advantage of it to make her day a living hell. Agatha knows them well, especially a small group that loves to test her patience, see how far she'll go.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning, class," she begins. "Sorry I'm late today. As you may have noticed, I've been absent the past few days. My son had the flu and I had to take care of him twenty-four seven. This morning, I had to speak with his teacher about his homework and the things he missed, which made me run late. Anyway, moving on. I corrected your copies, and I have to say... this is catastrophic. Even my son could have done better than some of you."
    </p>
    <p>
     She spends the whole hour talking about the exam with her students. Then, finally, they're out of the room and Agatha has a ten minutes break before her new class arrives. She's about to close her eyes to rest them a bit, but of course, her phone buzzes again. She hesitates for half a second before pulling it out, secretly hoping that it's that stranger again.

     <em>

     She can't help but blush at that response. It's stupid, really, why would she blush at that like a teenager who's just been flirted with? Maybe that stranger wasn't even talking about the innuendo with that response. Or maybe she did. Fuck it.

     <br/>
     Good luck with your day :)
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha can respond to this—maybe wishing her good luck for her mysterious early-morning appointment or just say goodbye—the second wave of students starts filing into the classroom. They don't even wait till the teacher opens the door for them, no, they enter the room as soon as the bell rings, not even bothering to say hello or acknowledge the older woman half-asleep at her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha quickly locks her phone, without even taking the time to respond to that stranger, and sets it aside, putting on her most authoritative expression as she calls for everyone to settle down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, this day is just getting better and better. Obviously, that's a joke. This class is the worst; they don't respect her, keep chatting when she speaks, use their phones during lessons. She hates them all, as much as they hate her. If they see just an ounce of hesitation in her expression, something that can tell them that she's not as bossy as she wants them to think, or that behind her Professor Snape statue is just a soft, overprotective mom, they'll make her pay for the rest of the school year. They're even worse than her previous class.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearing her throat, she starts the lesson, trying hard not to think about how the stranger reacted that way when she asked her about her job. Sensitive topic, maybe, or too early to talk about as they've known each other for not even a day.
    </p>
    <p>
     The morning passes in a blur, and Agatha already wants to go home. All she wants to do right now is lay in her bed, close her eyes and sleep all the afternoon. Alas, she still has a class to teach after lunch before she'll be able to go home. And then, she won't even be able to rest because she'll have to clean the house, go get Nicky at his own school, then prepare him a snack, then eventually make dinner, and then, fucking finally, she'll be able to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     This day is absolutely endless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully, though, now is the lunch break. Agatha isn't that hungry—she never is when she's sleep-deprived—but she forces herself to eat a few bites anyway to give her body some strength. She'll need it if she wants to survive the rest of the day in one piece.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she forces herself to sit at the teacher's table in the break room, fork lazily poking at her half-eaten salad, trying her absolute best not to rest her head on the table and fall asleep in front of her colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you okay?" Jen asks, frowning at her from across the table. Jen—a short nickname she let her colleagues use instead of her full name, Jennifer Kale—teaches English, and thank God she's one of the good ones. Agatha can't say she's her best friend, but she's not that bad to be around.
    </p>
    <p>
     The history teacher lifts her head slowly, blinking at the voice breaking the silence of the room. "Hm?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I asked if you were okay. You look like death."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I feel like death," Agatha mutters, rubbing her temple. "I spent half the night correcting the history exams."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oof," Alice says from her seat nearby, stirring her yogurt. Alice Gulliver is the music teacher, also known as Jen's love interest (or secret girlfriend, who knows?). "That bad?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That bad," she confirms with a sigh. "Even Nicky could have answered better than some of them, and he's seven."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean, with Agatha Harkness as a mother, that boy must be a genius," Alice chuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not that authoritarian as a mom."
    </p>
    <p>
     That's true. Though the woman terrifies a lot of students—and even some teachers, the ones she doesn't particularly get along with—she is a soft mom. Nicholas is her whole world, her only family left. Her own blood. She loves him with all her dark heart and can't help but be soft and overprotective with him.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she not? That boy is nice, smart, respectful. If they go to the store, he always says hello and goodbye. If he sees their elderly neighbor Sharon carrying her groceries, he insists on helping her (though Agatha keeps repeating he doesn't have to, but alas, he's a very polite guy). Nicky is the easiest person to love, and Agatha can't see her life without him. Not making him shitty dinner, not reading to him before sleeping, not hugging him while they watch movies that he's way too young to watch... Her life would be so miserable without him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides yelling at him when he really does something bad (which is extremely rare, and when she does, she always feels guilty afterward), she's not authoritarian at all. She lets him do many things, does anything to make him happy. She lets him live his child life. Lets him do the things she never got to do as a kid because her mom was a bitch who hated her daughter for simply existing.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Nicky was born, Agatha was so scared she'd be a bad mom. That she'd be like Evanora. She promised herself to never, ever hurt her baby like that evil woman did, and she kept that promise. Nicky is her sweet, spoiled baby, and so loved.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts are interrupted by her phone buzzing on the table. Instinctively, she glances down, and she can't help the smile that spreads across her face when she sees who it is.

     <br/>
     Come ooon, you saw a bit more than that ;)
    </p>
    <p>
     Her cheeks heat up unconsciously as her mind goes back to that photo. How the stranger's strong arm was covering her breasts, how the tattoo—Agatha's favorite flower and color, mind you—was etched to her skin. How those white-ish lines stood out on her hip, right above what seemed to be green boxer briefs. How her tanned skin framed the photo...
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck, no. Shut up.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Quickly shaking the photo out of her head, the teacher types back.
    </p>

     <br/>
     I wouldn't know about that...
    </p>
    <p>
     The heat she felt on her cheeks now starts spreading to her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who's making you smile like that?" Jen's voice interrupts her and her smile drops immediately, replaced by embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clears her throat and turns her phone off. "No one."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So
     <em>
      no one
     </em>
     is the reason why you're blushing so hard right now, huh? Jeez, Harkness, don't tell me you're sexting at work."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh. My. God.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jennifer! Are you crazy? I'm not! I don't even know her."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen exchange a glance, and the music teacher is the next one to speak with a smirk on her lips. "So that's a
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     . Come on, Agatha, spill."
    </p>
    <p>
     She crosses her arms over her chest, her half-eaten salad now abandoned on the table. She's not hungry anymore anyways, and the school's food is far from being the best. Obviously, she didn't have time to pack her own lunch, unlike the two other women who reheated some stuff they brought in tupperwares. Stuff that looks so fucking delicious. "There's nothing to tell."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The blush on your face says the contrary."
    </p>
    <p>
     Damn you, stupid teachers!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ugh!" She sighs in defeat. She knows that if she keeps the secret, they won't stop harassing her about it. "Fine. Yesterday, a girl sent a photo to the wrong number and we kept talking for some reason. That's all." At the weird face the two women make, she clarifies, "A photo of a
     <em>
      tattoo
     </em>
     . She said it was meant for her friend, but she changed her number and typed it wrong or whatever. As I said, nothing important."
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen smirks. "And yet, you keep talking."
    </p>
    <p>
     "She keeps texting me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you keep answering. Is she hot?"
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yes
     </em>
     is the only response that comes to her mind. Sure, she didn't see her face, but fuck, the few things she saw were indeed very hot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know," she lies, "she didn't send her face. Just her tattoo."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So how do you know she's a woman? Did she tell you?" Alice asks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck, why are they so nosy? "Well... uh, it was an underboob tattoo. Kind of. Vines and flowers going around the... breasts."
    </p>
    <p>
     Both women gasp at that, as if it's something scandalous. And it's not. It was just a tattoo, nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha Harkness—"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't
     <em>
      Agatha Harkness
     </em>
     me, Jennifer! Her boobs were covered by her arm, obviously, you perv. But still. Could clearly tell it was a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, okay, you absolutely need to show us this photo."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Absolutely not."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And why's that? I thought it was just an underboob tattoo, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She nods, "Yes, it is. And it wasn't meant for me. I won't show this photo to anyone, it's private."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How considerate of you," Alice jokes with a smile. "But you're right. So, what have you been talking about, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Honestly? Nothing besides some (flirty?) jokes. But Agatha enjoyed it, enjoys talking to her. She makes her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing," she replies honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen chuckles. "Nothing? You were texting her two minutes ago. What did she say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're such a nosy one, Jen."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come on, Agatha! This is exciting. You never talk to anyone, your life is so boring. Entertain us a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, she's not wrong. Her life
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     boring. While she does enjoy working as a history teacher, the lessons are always the same. Every year, she teaches the same thing to the new classes, and every year, she gets the same wrong, stupid answers to tests. On the weekends and breaks, she spends time with Nicky, which is probably her only source of entertainment. But besides him and Wanda, her life is indeed boring.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hasn't had a girlfriend—or even got laid—in years. She went on a few dates with women she met on dating apps months ago, but they just ran away as soon as they learned Agatha had a son. She can't blame them, though. Who would want an old single mother, huh? She also did have a few one-night stands here and there because she missed having sex, but she quickly got bored of it and rarely came. The women she had sex with were... boring. She didn't know them for more than an hour. They didn't know what she needed, didn't know what to do to please her, and Agatha never tried to tell them. She just faked an orgasm so it would end and she could finally go home. Ever since, she's had her own solitary pleasures with her dear toys. Way better. At least, she knows what she needs, knows what her body needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a moment, Agatha clears her throat. "We were just joking," she responds, talking about that unknown number. "I told her one of my students called me Professor Snape this morning, and she made fun of me. So I called her Dumbledore, and we kept joking about it, that's all. As I said, nothing interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
     Once again, Jen and Alice exchange a silent, understanding glance before returning to their lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighs. She can't wait for this endless day to end so she can
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     go home.

     As soon as Agatha gets home from work and from picking up Nicky at his elementary school, which thankfully is just five minutes away by car from the high school she teaches at, she kicks the door shut with her foot and drops her bag by the entrance, not even bothering to hang her coat. Her body aches, her mind is fried, and her eyes are already begging to close.
    </p>
    <p>
     This day was one of the most horrible she'd had in weeks, and she's not even surprised. End of the semester; the kids are taking the opportunity, since they don't have any more tests before the next semester starts, to cause some mayhem. In her afternoon class, she had entered the classroom only to find a
     <em>
      penis
     </em>
     drawn with white chalk on the blackboard. Seriously, what the fuck? What are they, twelve? No, they're freaking teenagers—teenagers that, in a year, will be considered adults once they reach eighteen years old.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had sighed at it and immediately removed the disgusting, silly drawing while waiting for her students to arrive. She wasn't even sure how they managed to get inside the locked classroom, or even who did it, but she has an idea. However, without proof, she can't just go and accuse a student, so she just shut up and spent an hour speaking about the American Civil War, aka one of the things she hates the most.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, the woman is a history teacher, and no, she isn't interested in every single thing she has to teach. Wars are her least favorite subject to talk about and, without any surprises, her favorite is the Salem Witch Trials and Colonial America, which she taught last semester. She just never understood why people fought—and why they
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     fight—for absolutely no reason, like two kids fighting over a toy. It's just ridiculous, and she really hates lingering on it. But alas, that's her job, so she doesn't have a choice, even when her students don't listen to a single thing she's saying.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a tired sigh, the teacher stumbles into the living room and falls onto the couch. Finally, some calm. Finally, more than ten seconds of silence. High school? Nah, more like a zoo. Agatha spends her days teaching some wild animals who can't understand a single word of English and just do stupid things all day long. Maybe she should switch to elementary school—she's sure the kids would be easier to handle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you okay, mama?" Nicky asks from the hallway as he drops his schoolbag on the floor. It's a brown and green one with a t-rex and all sorts of dinosaurs on it that Agatha got him before the new school year started. They had seen it at the store, but it was a bit pricey, so Nicky didn't say anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     His mother, however, noticed how he looked at the bag, noticed that he wanted it but never said anything. As if he had to care about her money. So obviously, she bought it and surprised him with it before going back to school. He was so happy when he got it and gave his mama a big hug before hanging a silver rabbit keyring on the zipper as an accessory, matching the one Agatha has on her own bag. Like that, they both have a part of each other with them, and if they have a bad day, they just look at it and smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiles. She loves how worried he always is, how caring he is. He's such an amazing kid, the best in the world. "Yes, sweetie, I'm good. Just tired, you don't have to worry about me. Just do your homework, okay? I'm right here if you need help."
    </p>
    <p>
     He nods at her, smiling, then sits on the floor next to the couch where she is sitting and pulls out his notebooks. He always does his homework on the coffee table, even though he has a desk in his bedroom and the dining table is free too, if he wants to be downstairs. But no, he always chooses the coffee table. Agatha knows it's because he likes being near her, and she's glad for it, though sometimes she wonders how long that'll last before he becomes one of the teenagers she teaches every day, rolling their eyes and pretending they don't care. For now, he still looks up to her. For now, she's still his favorite person in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you need help?" she asks after a moment, when he starts writing something.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm good for now, ma!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, yes, this nickname. A short for
     <em>
      mama
     </em>
     that he often uses when he's focused or, on the contrary, in a rush. It's sweet, and she doesn't mind it at all. At first, Agatha was surprised that he didn't use
     <em>
      mommy
     </em>
     or just
     <em>
      mom
     </em>
     like the other kids, but at the same time... she also wasn't that surprised. His father, if we can call him that, was a Latino man. Nicky, no matter the fact that he has never seen or heard about the man that helped with his conception, has a part of Latino in him. Agatha never denied it. She isn't sure, however, where he heard that word for the first time, but he's been using it ever since, and she doesn't mind at all. It's cute.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watches him for a second, making sure he's all good and doesn't need any help (though she doubts he will; Nicky's a smart kid), then gets up from the couch. She quickly kisses his head before dragging herself into the kitchen. If she doesn't have a boost right now, she's gonna fall asleep, and she can't allow that. Not when Nicky still hasn't done his homework and needs dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sighing, Agatha opens one cabinet and after a few seconds, she decides to grab the bottle of Italian wine Wanda gifted her ages ago. She wanted to keep it for a special occasion, but that never came. She's already birthed a child and isn't going to do it again, she has no partner to get married to, no special occasion ahead. But surviving a day of class surrounded by loud, annoying teenagers while being sleep-deprived can totally count as one, yeah.
    </p>
    <p>
     So the woman pours herself a glass and leans against the counter. She's not even much of a drinker—usually only when she's out with friends or celebrating something—but she really needs it right now. A small moan escapes her lips as soon as the expensive taste of red wine touches her lips. Agatha isn't an expert when it comes to wines, but she can't deny that this one is a great one. This is different than anything she's tasted before, with a rich aroma yet delicate. It's simply perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
     She closes her eyes for a second, trying not to think about how much she still has to do tonight before she can finally go to bed and get some well-deserved rest. She's gotta feed Nicky, and not just chips or toast, though both sound tempting right now. She has to come up with something halfway nutritious, even if the fridge is basically empty and her brain isn't working anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could skip dinner herself, honestly. Wouldn't be the first time. But her lovely seven-year-old needs a proper dinner, so she'll have to find something. Hopefully. She was supposed to get groceries today, as she only had one afternoon class, but she was too tired to go. Just the thought of being in a store for more than five minutes, surrounded by loud people, made her headache worse, so she decided not to go. Which was a mistake, considering the fridge is basically empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes another long sip of wine before she feels her phone buzz in the back pocket of her pants. The sound alone is enough to make her heart skip a beat. She already knows who it is. It can only be
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She turns her phone on, and a smile immediately stretches across her lips as she reads the new message from that stranger. It's stupid, really, but she can't help it. Even if it's a wrong number—a complete stranger—she actually enjoys talking to her. Besides Nicky, she's currently her only source of distraction, and for once, Agatha allows it. At least for now.

     Her job. Here we go again. What kind of job can this woman have that she can't even talk about it? Agatha raises an eyebrow at the vague response but decides not to push. Maybe she just wants to keep her privacy, which she completely understands, though revealing her job wouldn't put her in danger. It's not like she'd tell her where she lives exactly, or where she works, or anything.

     Agatha takes a deep breath as she reads the response. She blinks once, then twice, like maybe she read it wrong, or maybe her phone glitched, or that woman's autocorrect had some wild stroke and replaced the real number with another one.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Twenty-six.
     </em>
     Holy fucking shit. That's a
     <em>
      child.
     </em>
     That's someone who was a baby when
     <em>
      Friends
     </em>
     was airing live, someone who probably never had to memorize a landline number or rewind a VHS, someone who uses slang she doesn't understand. Agatha didn't think about the fact that she never asked her age. And fuck, she should have. What was she thinking? She sets the wine glass down on the coffee table a little harder than she means to, the bottom clinking against the granite as her stomach does a slow roll.
    </p>
    <p>
     She's thirty-seven, a high school teacher with back pain and a seven-year-old son who still calls her Mama and sometimes crawls into her bed at night after a bad dream. What the hell is she doing? What kind of midlife crisis is this, exactly? Is she
     <strike>
      flirting
     </strike>
     talking with a college student? Is she the creep now, the older woman who lurks around younger ones? Okay, twelve years younger isn't
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     bad, but for Agatha, it is. She's a mom, a woman who never goes out anymore, who works all day and takes care of her son. That stranger is so... young. Their lives are so different.
     <em>

     Fuck. What would she even do with someone that young? More importantly, what would someone that young want with her?

     After a moment, she finally replies.

     <br/>

    </p>
    <p>
     She hesitates before typing, fingers hovering above the keyboard. She could order something, yes. She'd do that—or even skip dinner altogether—if she didn't have Nicky. But her sweet boy deserves a real dinner, especially since tomorrow's their usual game night at the Maximoff's, where they order takeout. Once a week is more than enough.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks down at Nicky, who's silently finishing his homework at the coffee table. One of his hands is busy scribbling something in his notebook, while his free one reaches into the bag of salt and vinegar chips. He's completely unbothered by her, focused on whatever he's doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Should she talk to that woman about him? They've known each other for two days. But she does enjoy talking to her, and she already saw that she's a woman. A beautiful one. She's not a creepy man, just a wrong number who happens to be fun to talk to.

    <p>
     She finally decides to respond something mysterious. It's their thing, after all, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     To her surprise, she doesn't receive a response for the next three minutes or so. Which is strange, considering how fast she usually answers. Maybe she's just busy with her mysterious job, or just something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finishes her glass of wine in one long sip and takes the opportunity to look down at what Nicky is doing. Unsurprisingly, he doesn't need any help, answering each question one by one. And from what she's seeing, they're right. Obviously they are.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, a new message comes in.

    <p>
     <em>
      Oh?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     A small smirk forms on Agatha's lips at the thought of that pretty stranger reading the message, wondering who she was talking about. And the thought of a man sharing her house, her bed, makes her want to throw up.

     Better to be honest here. If she plans on continuing to talk to that woman (which she definitely plans to, as of now), she wants her to know who she is. A lesbian, middle-aged woman who has a seven-year-old nerdy son. The kind of woman people don't usually want to be friends with. Besides Wanda and her colleagues—who Agatha refuses to call friends—she has no one. No one wants to hang with

     <br/>
     You said you're a lesbian. So how...
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      How did she make Nicky.
     </em>
     Everybody she meets who learns that she's a lesbian asks this question. Which is understandable, and Agatha has never been ashamed to admit the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was getting older—twenty-nine at that time—and she knew that if she wanted a child, she'd have to have one fast before she got too old. But as a lesbian and with no partner? It would've taken forever. IVF is expensive, long, and not guaranteed to work. Adoption was out of the picture, as Agatha wanted her own child, from her own blood. So the last solution was getting drunk and sleeping with a man. She and Wanda spent days at the bar, trying to find a decent man. They eventually found one—a Latino guy, respectful and smart. Agatha had flirted with him beforehand, until he nicely offered to go back to his place. With no pressure, he made sure she was okay with it, and she had agreed, thinking he was a decent man. And then, she just let it happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was gross, but necessary. She lied to that guy, telling him she was on the pill, hoping one fuck would be enough—and thankfully, it was. She had planned everything; made sure she was in her fertile window and all of that. That man—that she can't even remember the name of—never knew about it. About Nicky. It might seem rude, awful even, but that's exactly what Agatha is. She wanted a child, and she found a way to have one. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. And according to Wanda, he moved not long after that drunken night, which made things much easier for everyone.

     For the next twenty minutes or so, Agatha helps Nicky with his homework. Though he rarely asks for help, she's happy to be there for him whenever he needs to, for whatever he needs. She wants to be a good mom. She
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     a good mom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Nicky is done, he runs upstairs to take a shower while Agatha starts preparing dinner. Or, well, trying to find something to cook for dinner. With the fridge empty, it's not that simple.
    </p>
    <p>
     A new buzz from her phone interrupts her thoughts. With a smile, she closes the fridge and looks at the new message. This time, she doesn't even wonder who it is, she just knows.

    <p>
     The woman frowns. Bananas? Why? She does have a few—Nicky likes to eat fruits as a dessert or a snack—but how will that be useful for dinner? They're not even ripe yet, as the store only had green ones. She'll have to wait a few days for them to be edible.
    </p>

     Perfect, then. You can make Pastelón. It's delicious. It's like lasagna but with bananas instead of pasta. Well, normally you have to use plantains, which are less sweet bananas, but normal ones will do, especially green ones. Trust me with this, it's amazing
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts. She has not a single clue what Pastelón is and thinks it's really weird to make dinner with fruit.

     "That was so good!" Nicky says, placing his cutlery on his empty plate. "Where did you get the idea of cooking bananas for dinner, ma?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiles. That was, indeed, delicious. Making it wasn't that hard, especially with that stranger's detailed instructions, and it was really good. "A friend gave me her recipe."
    </p>
    <p>
     "A friend? Who? Auntie Wanda?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, sweetie, not Auntie Wanda. You don't know her, actually."

     "What's her name? Why don't I know her?"

     Later that night, Agatha lies next to Nicky in his bed, his favorite book open in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This one, again?" she asks, fake-sighing. She knows how much Nicky likes this book, and she doesn't mind rereading it over and over again if it makes him smile. "It's the third time this week."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please, mama. I love this book. One more time?"
    </p>
    <p>
     One more time. One more time
     <em>
      this week
     </em>
     , yeah.
    </p>
    <p>
     The book Nicky is talking about is called
     <em>
      The Legend of the Christmas Witch
     </em>
     , written by Rio Vidal and illustrated by a woman called Lilia Calderu. It's a great book, Agatha has to admit it, but she doesn't necessarily enjoy rereading it over and over again. Nicky, however, doesn't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright," she smiles. "One more time, huh? Then I'll see if the author has written other books so I can order them. What do you think about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes! I heard she wrote a second book to this. I want to know what happens to Kristtörn next. Oh! And I think she's working on a new book."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll check it out tomorrow and see if I can order it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky turns to her and throws his arm over her belly to hug her. "You're the best. I love you, mama."
    </p>
    <p>
     This? She wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. Agatha kisses her son's head, then starts reading as she caresses his hair with her free hand. "Twas the season of Yuletide, and as the Cold Moon shone down, the Christmas Witch traveled to each little town. While Mother and Father slept soundly in bed, some children snuck to their windows instead. They fixed their eyes on the falling snow, in hopes for a glimpse of the witch's shadow."
    </p>
    <p>
     It doesn't take long for the boy to fall asleep, just ten pages or so. Kissing his forehead one last time, Agatha gently slips away, trying not to wake him. Thankfully, tomorrow is Saturday, and they will both be able to get some rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally returning to her room after a long, exhausting day, Agatha falls into her bed. Literally. She lies there, on her stomach above the blankets, still in her work clothes, and she just closes her eyes. She falls asleep within a few minutes.

     Twelve hours. That's how much sleep Agatha had today. Does she feel guilty about it? Not in the fucking slightest. That rest was much needed and more than well deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she wakes up in the morning, at eleven, she stretches in her bed, still above the blankets, and notices that she's still wearing her work clothes. White button-up with purple slacks. How the fuck did she manage to sleep with her bra on? She must have been really tired, because this shit is the most uncomfortable thing ever, and she wishes she could just never wear one again. Unfortunately, she can't. If she had smaller breasts, she probably would, but she doesn't, so she has to keep wearing uncomfortable bras all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sits down on the bed and gently rubs her eyes, blinking slowly. She feels much better than yesterday, full of energy and ready for their usual Saturday game night. That's something she, Wanda and the kids do every single week. Agatha and Nicky head over to their house around six-thirty, sometimes earlier if everyone is free, and start the day with some snacks. Usually a mix of chips, cheese, and cold cuts before they order a late-night dinner—always takeout, because neither Agatha nor Wanda has the energy to cook after a long week of work, and it's better for everyone if her husband doesn't approach the kitchen (Agatha still doesn't understand what her best friend is still doing with this man... but well).
    </p>
    <p>
     So Saturday nights are their unhealthy day. They often eat pizza or Thai, or whatever can be ordered online and delivered to the house. Today, it's the Maximoffs', and next week will be the Harknesses'. They do a week each. Then it's board games until late, with the adults drinking cheap wine while the kids argue over the rules of Uno or scream about someone cheating (often Agatha, but shhh, they don't need to know about this).
    </p>
    <p>
     Saturday game night is a tradition they've been following for the past year. They never miss a single week. It gives the two friends a chance to decompress, catch up on the latest gossip, and for Nicky to run around with Wanda's twins, who are both two years older than him but still young enough to include him in whatever ridiculous game they've invented. They've built blanket forts together, turned the living room into an obstacle course, staged battles with stuffed animals and action figures, and once, memorably, tried to summon a ghost with a homemade Ouija board in the twins' room. That one ended in tears, and Agatha had to remind them that fifty percent of horror movies always start like that, and that they should never touch a fucking Ouija board. Don't fuck with death (except if she's a hot cosmic entity as sometimes described in medias).
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky loves it. He counts down the days to Saturday like it's Christmas. He starts asking on Wednesday if he can sleep over, and most of the time, Agatha can't refuse. He's just too cute to say no, especially when he does his sad puppy eyes. This always works—Agatha can't resist those sweet eyes even if she tries really, really hard. And anyway, Wanda lives in the house on her right, so if there's any problem, she can go get her son in barely three minutes. He always packs his bag hours in advance, triple-checks it for his toothbrush and favorite pajamas, then stands at the door until his mother finally says it's time to go. And when the night's over, when the games are done and the takeout boxes are stacked on the counter, Agatha helps him change into his pajamas and puts him to bed before kissing his head and walking home, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     She really loves her son with all her dark heart, but she must admit that sometimes, it's nice to be home alone. She has plenty of time to watch bad movies with unhealthy snacks, she can spend hours touching herself if she wants to, she can do absolutely anything and everything she can't when Nicky's around. Or she just needs a break, which is understandable. While her sweet, nerdy boy is perfect most of the time, he's still a seven-year-old kid. He gets loud. He asks her to play with him. He makes her watch silly cartoons.
    </p>
    <p>
     A little break once in a while is really nice. Especially after a Sunday. The weekend is the only time of the week where Agatha spends it with Nicky, the only time of the week when they can have fun all day. And by fun, it means playing video games, playing
     <em>
      Just Dance
     </em>
     , doing karaoke, sometimes going to the store. It's a very, very long day. But she isn't complaining. Agatha is glad to have this kind of complicity with her son. As a kid, she never got to do any of these, never got to play or be happy. So now that she's a mom, she's doing everything in her power to make Nicky happy, so he can have the childhood she never had. He deserves it. He really does.
    </p>
    <p>
     With no surprise, a new message from the wrong number is there when she turns her phone on for the first time after falling asleep.

     The Legend of the Christmas Witch??
    </p>
    <p>
     The teacher raises an eyebrow at the new message. The book is quite famous in the parents' circle as it's a sweet Christmas story focused on old traditions, magic, and family, but how can this woman know about it? Agatha already knows that she doesn't have any children, as she mentioned it previously, so how does she know about this book? It's not the kind that adults read for fun (except if they have a crush on the author—is that the case here?)

     Did she like the book? She hates to admit it, but she did. It's well-written, it's a sweet story she enjoyed reading, way better than the other books she used to read to Nicky before bed. Some stupid ones about stupid characters and stories. But now, all those other books are forgotten, and the boy only ever asks for
     <em>
      The Legend of the Christmas Witch.
     </em>
     While Agatha found the book interesting, she doesn't exactly appreciate having to re-read it almost every single day.

     <br/>
     I guess it is. But what kind of name is Kristtörn?? I had to google the pronunciation
    </p>
    <p>
     And that's true. She'd bought the book a few weeks ago during one of their monthly bookstore shopping trips and ended up googling the character's name pronunciation while Nicky was in the shower, just so she wouldn't look ridiculous mispronouncing it during story time. She does admit it's a very unusual name, but it made sense. She remembers scrolling through a few websites about the name's etymology and realizing how perfectly it suited the main character. Its roots are Icelandic:
     <em>
      Kristtörn
     </em>
     means
     <em>
      holly
     </em>
     . Like a wreath of holly leaves, like the Christmas holly spirit; the choice wasn't random. The character of Kristtörn is tied to old Yule traditions and wild nature magic, so it fits the story's theme perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The author had done their research, and it shows. It's nice to see. Most authors, especially ones writing for kids, don't usually go out of their way to pick names with real meaning as they assume kids won't care (and most adults won't either). But this
     <em>
      Rio something
     </em>
     did, and it's fantastic. It makes sense. Though the name is very... different. Agatha has never heard it before—which is not surprising considering it's Icelandic—and she doesn't personally like it much. But the story and the etymology of the name are interesting, so it doesn't matter.

     </strong>
     <br/>
     I understand now. You're indeed an evil hag
    </p>
    <p>
     Setting her phone aside, she can't help but smile. Even though this all started as a wrong number, she still looks forward to
     <em>
      Evil Hag
     </em>
     texting her. She doesn't even know that mysterious woman, and yet... yet, she can't stop talking to her. She makes her smile. She gave her a recipe that Nicky loved. She's nice and, as much as she hates to admit it, funny. Agatha doesn't want to stop talking to her. Maybe they can be friends. Everyone has an online friend. Well, mostly teenagers or young adults, but still.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sigh, Agatha finally finds the courage to get up and head towards the bathroom. She's still in her work clothes, as she fell asleep immediately after collapsing on the bed yesterday, and she desperately needs a shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her face in the mirror after she turns the lights on makes her jump.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck, she looks like shit. She has dark circles under her eyes so big she looks like a Tim Burton character; her makeup is smudged all over her eyelids like she took part in a bar fight last night, and her lipstick's faded around her lips. Her hair... fuck, that's even worse than what she expected. Her hair's a mess, probably full of knots and so dry.
    </p>
    <p>
     She has to admit that recently, with her job, Nicky, and the very little free time she has for herself, she hasn't taken care of herself in a while. She stopped using expensive hair creams that she has to leave on for a while before rinsing; she stopped slathering her face with moisturizer before bed, and it's been a long time since she's had a good night's sleep, causing dark circles to accumulate and make her look like a zombie. And then there's the rest. The part she always pretends not to see. The fine lines starting to form around her mouth and eyes, more visible when she's this tired. The faint creases between her brows, deepened from years of frowning—at papers, at students, at her own reflection. And just above her right temple, a single silver strand catches the light. Actually, no, two. Maybe three. Shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leans in closer to the mirror, squinting at herself, and pushes her hair back behind her ears with both hands, trying to flatten it into something passable. She takes the time to look at her face, at every close detail of it. And fuck. There's no denying it, she looks older. Not
     <em>
      old
     </em>
     old, she's only thirty-seven, she knows that, but older than she felt five years ago. No wonder she's still single looking like that. She's never been the type to obsess over wrinkles or spend a fortune on creams that promise to erase time. But still. She notices. She sees it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     And on mornings like this, when the exhaustion sticks to her skin and motherhood has left another invisible bruise on her soul, she feels it. The slow, relentless passing of time. She's growing older. Uglier. One day, she'll look like an old dried prune and she'll spend the rest of her life alone. With no partner, with no son, as Nicky will be grown and probably would prefer to spend time with his friends than his boring, old mom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finally sighs and looks away from the mirror. She needs a shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     The water takes a moment to heat up, so she lets it run as she undresses slowly, peeling off the work clothes she never meant to sleep in. She drops everything in the laundry basket without folding, without caring. And finally being free from her uncomfortable bra is so fucking good. When she turns to enter the shower, she catches herself in the mirror again, this time fully. And yeah. That's not much better.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a softness to her stomach now that never really went away after Nicky was born. The skin is stretched and loose in some places, marked by pale, silvery lines that no cream ever managed to erase. She runs a hand over them without thinking, then quickly pulls it away like she just touched a bruise. Again, Agatha doesn't mind it on other women. Stretch marks are pretty on them. But on her... they don't look pretty. She's maybe just too harsh on herself because that's what she's always known, and today is harder than the other days. Maybe it's just the exhaustion of the week. Maybe not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thighs are touching, her hips are wide. Wider than before she gave birth to Nicky. Her chest lower; she could blame gravity, or time, or genetics. But mostly, she blames herself for not taking care of herself earlier. She only started using creams and all that after she met Jen. The teacher has a side hustle where she sells bio creams and lotions for the body, the hair, for age. She gave a few different ones to Agatha for free, and the woman had used them for a few weeks. Until her job as a history teacher and a single mother left her no more time for herself. So she just forgot about it, didn't care for her skin, didn't care for her hair. Weekdays were focused on her job, after work for cleaning the house and preparing dinner, and the weekends dedicated to Nicky. Not to herself. The rare times when she's home alone, she often uses that time to rest or for self-pleasure. But not for taking care of herself like she knows she should.
    </p>
    <p>
     The steam finally starts to fill the room, fogging the edges of the mirror until her reflection blurs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good...
    </p>
    <p>
     She finally steps into the shower and let the hot water hit her back first, rolling down her spine, easing the tension she didn't even realize had built up in her shoulders. It feels good. So, so good. She stays under the spray for longer than usual, letting her hair soak through until it hangs down her back, dark and tangled and wild.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sigh, she reaches for the expensive hair cream shoved in the back of the shelf—the olive oil one Jen gave her ages ago. It doesn't smell that good, but it's amazing for her hair, to make it all soft and light and hydrated. She scoops a generous amount into her palms and works it into her hair, strand by strand, finger by finger. She remembers the directions said to leave it on for ten minutes, but she gives it fifteen. Because fuck it, she deserves fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the hair cream sits, she scrubs her body with her purple loofah that's on its last leg, tracing the curve of her belly that she hates so much, the underside of her arms, the soft parts she always tries to hide under her work clothes. She's not ashamed of it—all of that shows that she birthed a boy, a little human that she loves with all her heart. But it's just... she doesn't find herself pretty anymore. She never really did (her mother did a great job at making her feel ugly growing up, criticizing her strong nose, her hair, her body, her attitude), but now that she's aging, it's even worse. Who would want a thirty-seven-year-old single mother? No one. No wonder she can't find a girlfriend. She's old and ugly and boring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shaking the thought away, she finally rinses herself and the cream out of her hair. It feels softer already—less like straw, more like the healthy hair she used to have. Then, she grabs a towel and tries to smile. Today's the weekend, meaning the entire day will be dedicated to her lovely son and their weekly game night. Today is going to be a good, funny day. She can't let stupid thoughts ruin that.
    </p>
    <p>
     +++
    </p>
    <p>
     When she's dried and dressed (in comfortable purple Juicy Couture pants and a white t-shirt from the same brand), she finally goes downstairs. As she expected, Nicky is sitting on the couch, still in his dinosaur pyjamas, watching cartoons. She's never worried about him—even at seven years old, he's already an independent boy, and he knows that if he needs anything, he can just wake up his mama.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiles and walks toward him, then kisses the top of his head. "How did you sleep, sweetie?" she asks him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky's eyes don't leave the tv as he answers, "Good. You slept for a long time, mama."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know. I'm sorry, I was very tired."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't have to be sorry. I'm a big boy, Ma, I can take care of myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart melts at this. "Have you had breakfast?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He shakes his head. "I wasn't hungry when I woke up, but I ate some Froot Loops earlier."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But are you hungry now? What do you want for lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Huh-huh. Can I have pancakes? Please? With a looot of maple syrup. And sausages too."
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck. Pancakes are one of the things that she can't bake. The first ones always come out burnt or undercooked, and there are usually only two or three edible ones that she obviously leaves to Nicky.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pancakes?" she smiles. "Alright. Just wait here, okay? I'll be back soon."

    </p>
    <p>
     Thank God, that woman is a lifesaver. Agatha has tried all the recipes she could find on the internet—from cooking blogs to random Tiktoks (Jen introduced her to the app... sadly. At first, Agatha found it stupid, how teenagers followed 'trends' and danced weirdly, but the app itself isn't that bad. She can find many interesting things on it)—but none of them worked. Every single time, the pancakes came out either completely burnt, or raw in the middle, or stuck to the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Evil Hag is clearly a good cook (maybe she's lying and it's actually her job?), and the banana recipe she gave her yesterday was delicious. Agatha had never thought of using fruit for dinner—not in that way, at least—and yet it ended up being one of the best things she's ever had, or even managed to cook herself. So yeah. She trusts the woman. She trusts her enough to believe her pancake recipe will save her lunch (or brunch? Whatever this late-morning snack is called). More importantly, from disappointing her son again.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few moments later, she receives a new text from Evil Hag: a photo, a close-up shot of a notebook, open across two pages, the pancake recipe written out neatly by hand in black ink. But Agatha doesn't see the words at first, no. Because right in the center, holding the book open, is a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     And
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     . What the actual fuck?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can't help but stare. The fingers are long. Weirdly long. Not in a creepy, horror-movie Slender Man kind of way, but in a stupidly attractive kind of way. Her nails are short, clean, not polished, simply natural. Her skin is tanned, darker than Agatha's pale tone. The woman blinks, realizing she's still holding the phone in one hand and a half-empty mug of cold coffee in the other, standing there like an idiot in her kitchen with the fridge door still slightly open behind her. She zooms in. Not on the recipe, no, but on the hand. Because apparently, that's who she is now, a creep who's zooming in on fingers like they're porn.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for a second—a long, dangerous second—her brain runs with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She imagines those long, pretty fingers playing with her hair while they're watching a movie on the couch. She imagines those soft fingers on her waist, caressing her sides while murmuring sweet nothings. Sliding up her thigh under her dress. Stroking down her stomach, making her feel loved and pretty. One of them lazily circling her nipple. Two of them slipping between her legs. She's even certain that they're long enough to reach her cervix—
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chokes on nothing and physically jerks her head back like someone slapped her.
    </p>
    <p>
     No. Absolutely not. Unacceptable. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is wrong with her?

     Here you go. The secret to not burn them is to not use butter. You can add some oil with paper towel so it doesn't stick to the pan, but no butter. And you have to flip them once you see the bubbles forming

     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sure. Good luck with whatever mysterious work you're doing, stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     The pancakes come out perfect. Delicious, not too sweet, and most importantly not burnt or undercooked. They're simply perfect. Agatha followed Evil Hag's instructions to the letter, from the handwritten recipe (she still can't get over how delicate her handwriting is, just like her long fingers) to the little tips she sent afterward by text.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, she used oil instead of butter—just like Evil Hag said—and it worked. All the recipes she tried from blogs or videos before never said not to use butter. So she always did, so they wouldn't stick. Turns out that's what made them stick. Crazy... But now, with a tiny bit of oil, the pancakes didn't stick to the pan. They didn't burn. They cooked evenly, golden and fluffy and warm. And most importantly, Nicky loved them. He ate three with maple syrup, then two small sausages and a slice of bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That was so good," Nicky says, smiling, his hair still wet from the shower he took while his mother was cooking, as he sits at the dining table with maple syrup all over his face. "How did you not burn them this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "My...
     <em>
      friend
     </em>
     gave me a new recipe and a few tips."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The same friend that gave you the banana recipe?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiles. "Yes, that one."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What friend is this, mama? Why don't I know her?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifts in her seat. What is she supposed to say? "She lives in Los Angeles, and we met recently. It's a long story."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh!" Nicky's eyes gleam as he remembers something. "Speaking about stories, did you order my book?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, yes. The book. "The Return of the Christmas Witch?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, that one!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not yet. Sorry, sweetie, I slept a lot and then I immediately showered and prepared breakfast. I didn't have time to look it up, but I will do it later."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Promise?" He holds up his pinky in the middle of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Smiling, Agatha links their pinkies together. "Pinky promise, my little spoiled gremlin."
    </p>
    <p>
     As promised, Agatha grabs her laptop as soon as lunch is over. She and Nicky are curled up together on the couch now; he's half-watching cartoons with syrup still crusted near the corner of his mouth, and she's scrolling through her tabs, fingers sticky from helping him with the maple bottle earlier. She should be cleaning up the kitchen, but today's the weekend and she deserves a long break. And she knows how excited Nicky is about this book, so she needs to order it now if she wants it to arrive soon.

     The cover is an illustration of the white-haired main character Kristtörn standing next to Santa Claus behind the title written in a Nordic-looking font in a beige color. The background is blue with weird mushrooms, and at the bottom, there's a bubbling cauldron. On it, the name of the author:

      The Christmas Witch.
     </em>

     <em>
      Her story begins many, many years ago when her brother was torn away from her as a child. Raised alone by a witch of the woods, Kristtörn's powers of magic grew, as did her temper. Determined to find her long lost twin, she set out on a perilous journey across oceans to find him. But what she found instead was a deep-seated fear of her powers and a confrontation that would leave the fate of Christmas hanging in the balance.

     Sounds good. Agatha clicks on

     , then proceeds to checkout.
    </p>
    <p>
     Order confirmed. It should arrive on Wednesday, which is rather quick.
    </p>
    <p>
     Satisfied, Agatha closes the tab, sets the laptop aside, and leans back into the couch. Nicky shifts closer to her without saying anything, tucking himself under her arm while he lets his head rest on her side. With a soft smile, Agatha brushes a hand through his hair, damp but already drying wild, enjoying the few moments of calm before the storm.

     The two Harknesses spend the whole day at home, just the two of them. No errands, no cleaning, no adult responsibilities—just tv, games, and each other. That's usually how they spend their weekend, just the two of them. They start with cartoons, then move to their old karaoke mic set Agatha bought last year. It's cheap, the reverb is awful, and the green one always crackles, but it doesn't matter. Nicky begs to sing the Moana soundtrack, and Agatha, being the softie that she is (despite what her students thinks), ends up belting Disney songs until her throat hurts.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hates to admit it as well, but she loves karaoke, even if it's Disney songs. She has a good voice, she can control it quite easily. It's one of her favorite activities to do; alone, with Nicky, or drunk at a bar with the girls singing her lungs out to
     <em>
      Don't Stop Believing.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     They move on to board games in the afternoon, then dance-offs, then a movie. Nicky insists they watch
     <em>
      The Good Dinosaur
     </em>
     again, and Agatha has seen it so many times she could recite the lines by heart, but his smile makes it worth every second.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are the kind of days she lives for. Just them. No rush, no obligations, just quality time with her son. And she's aware, maybe more than she wants to admit, that these days are numbered. Nicky is already seven. In a few years, he'll be more interested in his friends, in school, in whatever weird video games kids will be playing then. He won't want to spend his Saturdays watching cartoons with his mom, singing duets and cuddling on the couch. So she holds onto this. Tight. She already doesn't know what she's gonna do when that day happens.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, around six, they head over to Wanda's place for their usual Saturday game night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda's already walking around the living room, balancing snack bowls and wine glasses while the twins argue over which game to play first. Vision hovers nearby, trying (and failing) to make sure they don't make a mess. But it's a bit too late for that. There are some open game boxes on the floor with papers scattered around, and the boys are arguing. Billy wants to play
     <em>
      Uno
     </em>
     , but Tommy wants to play
     <em>
      Monopoly
     </em>
     , while Nicky prefers
     <em>
      Clue
     </em>
     . Vision tries to tell them that they'll play each game as the night is still young, but they don't seem to listen. Wanda is way better at this, but she's currently busy going through the cabinets to find snacks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sits on the couch cross-legged while she sips on a glass of red wine. She loves these nights, even if the volume level sometimes makes her ears ring. This is supposed to be relaxing, but well.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Should we order pizza?" Wanda asks, putting different snacks on the coffee table in front of Agatha. There's a mix of chips, cured meats, sliced cheese, some nuts tossed in a little bowl. Enough to eat while they relax in the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you want," Agatha answers, shrugging. "I'm sure the twins and Nicky will be happy. I'm not that hungry, but we can ask for later delivery."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Exactly what I was thinking." Wanda plops down beside her, letting out a long, exhausted sigh after giving a glance to her sons. "Finally, some rest."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Long day?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can't imagine. Vision had a work thing at the office, so I had the twins all day. They're little demons when they're together. Especially Tommy."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirks into her glass. "You know you can dump them at mine if you need a break. Nicky would be overjoyed. And unlike you, I can be authoritative. How do you think I got the name Snape? I earned it, and I'm proud of it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
     The redhead lets out a pleased sigh. "Thank you so much, Agatha, you're a lifesaver. Okay, I'm gonna go search for the pamphlet of that pizzeria so I can call and order. Be right back."
    </p>
    <p>
     As Wanda gets up from the couch after taking a sip of wine, Agatha's phone buzzes. A smile immediately spreads on her face.

    <p>
     <strong>
      Agatha 7:21 PM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Are you laughing at me?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Evil Hag 7:21 PM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Me? No, that would be evil ;)
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Agatha 7:22 PM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I hate you
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Evil Hag 7:22 PM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sure you do :)
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts quietly to herself, then Wanda returns with her phone against her ear. "Hey, Ags, what kind of pizza do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, uhm... Margherita? Nicky loves it. We'll share."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Noted. Kids!" The redhead then raises her voice so she can be heard through the arguing. "What do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pepperoni!" Billy shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hawaiian!" Tommy yells over him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose. It sounds awful to say this, but she never really liked Tommy. He's such a complicated kid, always trying to argue over something, always causing chaos. Unlike his twin brother Billy, who's a real sweetheart. She's not even surprised that this demon wants a pizza with fucking pineapple slices on it. It's a real insult to Italy. "Oh God. Hawaiian? Pineapple on pizza should be illegal."
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughs. "Tommy likes it. I don't, and I agree with you. Atrocious."
    </p>
    <p>
     They settle the order. Pizza's scheduled for delivery in an hour and a half, which leaves them enough time to eat the snacks and start a game. They choose
     <em>
      Clue
     </em>
     , as it's way quicker than Monopoly, and it's also Agatha's favorite. Solving crimes? That's her thing. She always wins. After all this time, she knows the trick. She has a technique to remember who has what card, and it always works.
    </p>
    <p>
     They play a few games of Clue (because Wanda can't stand losing) while eating the pizza. And then, during the game, Agatha's phone buzzes again. It's Vision's turn to play, and she already knows all his cards, so she can take a minute to check the message. She doesn't need to be a medium to guess who this is from.

     You're the one to talk, evil hag
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifts her head, startled. "Hm?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's your turn," Wanda says, clearly amused at something her husband said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh. Right." She sets her phone aside and rolls the dice. She's this close to winning once again... she just needs the room to solve the crime. But alas, the room is always the hardest thing to find. She knows that Wanda has the kitchen and the study; Vision only has the hall; Nicky has the ballroom, Tommy doesn't have any, Billy has the lounge, and Agatha has the conservatory and the library. Vision can't have any, as she knows all his cards, and she only misses one to find the right one.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Four.
     </em>
     She can't go anywhere, so she moves her pawn—the purple one, obviously—towards one of the rooms she doesn't have.

     <br/>
     Okay, I'll leave you now, Professor Plum. Go arrest the suspect ;)
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha. Your turn."
    </p>
    <p>
     She blinks up. Already? "Right... sorry." She puts the phone down again and rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda leans in. "So... who's the mystery texter?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You've been glued to your phone all night. Who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh. Uh..." Agatha clears her throat. Right. She hasn't told her best friend about that mysterious stranger yet. With work and all, she didn't have time to talk to her. "It's no one. A girl texted the wrong number by accident."
    </p>
    <p>
     Vision raises an eyebrow. "Yet you've been talking to her all evening."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Uh... well... since yesterday, actually. I mean, Thursday night."
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda's eyes widen. "Wait, wait, wait! You've been texting a wrong number for three days!? You can't be serious right now."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dead serious."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, now I need details. Spill."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's nothing to spill," Agatha insists, though her face is starting to betray her. "She accidentally sent me a tattoo pic—"
    </p>
    <p>
     She gasps. "Wait, what kind of tattoo?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Relax, Maximoff. It was just an under-boob tattoo."
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughs so hard she nearly spills her wine on the game board. She's already tipsy, which is not surprising considering it's her third glass. "Agatha Harkness! Are you sexting a stranger!?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh my God. Is she crazy? Agatha hisses, glancing toward the kids to make sure they're not paying attention. They're busy chatting, thankfully, and she doubts they heard that. "I am not sexting!" she whisper-yells. "She sent it by accident. Said it was for a friend. We started talking after that and... I don't know. It's fun. She's funny."
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda's expression softens. It's been a while since she saw her best friend so... happy. "Fun how?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitates. She takes another sip of wine—her second glass of the evening. The thing with her is that when she drinks, her filter completely washes off and she doesn't hesitate to say what she's thinking. "I don't know, she's... easy to talk to. Witty, clever. She makes me laugh. She shares recipes with me. Yesterday, I had no idea what to make for dinner and she gave me a great recipe from her culture. It was delicious, Nicky loved it. Even if she's a wrong number, I enjoy talking to her."
    </p>
    <p>
     The redhead's smile turns into a knowing smirk. Oh, she can't fool her. They've been friends for a while, she knows when Agatha has a crush. "Sounds like you're into her, huh."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't start. I don't even know her name or what she looks like. And she's twenty-six, Wanda. Twenty-six! That's twelve years younger. She's a kid! And I've known her for, like, two days."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Twelve isn't that bad at all. She's an adult. Sure, she's younger than you, but twenty-six is still an adult. Also, two days is like two weeks in lesbian time. And, wait, what do you mean you don't know her name?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "She won't tell me. She likes to keep things mysterious."
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda tilts her head. "Weird. But kinda hot."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groans. "Don't make this a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So what are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know. Keep talking to her? She's nice. Long-distance friends are a thing, you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Wanda can tease her further, Nicky tells Agatha it's her time to play once again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The teacher rolls the dice.
     <em>
      Six.
     </em>
     Perfect. She goes to the room she wanted to go in—the dining room. "Miss Scarlet with a revolver in the dining room."
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shows her a card. The room one. Bingo.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a smirk, she rolls the dice again since she did a six.
     <em>
      Five.
     </em>
     It's enough to go to the middle. She moves her pawn there and says, "Miss Scarlet with the revolver in the billiard room."
    </p>
    <p>
     Vision checks the result, and damn right. She won. Again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No!" Wanda groans, slamming her cards on the table. "You're cheating."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not. You're just bad at it, honey."
    </p>
    <p>
     She scoffs. "This conversation isn't over. I need all the details of your mysterious texter, huh."
    </p>
    <p>
     They're interrupted by Nicky. "Can we play Monopoly now?"

     The package arrives on Wednesday afternoon, when the sky outside is covered in gray clouds and the temperatures are still low for the season. Agatha didn't expect them to be high—it's still the end of February—but she didn't expect them to still be
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     low. It's been raining for the past few days, and today won't be an exception. The air outside has that strange earthy, fresh smell that's always there right before it rains.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hears the doorbell ring while she's still in the middle of slicing carrots, the knife halfway through the orange root when the sound pulls her from her task. Her fingers pause instinctively, her head jerking up in the direction of the door. She took the opportunity that Nicky is still at school (he doesn't have school on Wednesday afternoons, only the mornings, but he almost always insists on staying with the other kids at the school's daycare to play with his friends) to try to cook something new.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's another recipe that Evil Hag sent her from her notebook, and to Agatha's dismay, this time she didn't have her pretty hand in the middle of the pages to keep them open. Well, it's not really a full recipe as it's quite simple, but the teacher never thought of eating that for a snack. It's sliced carrots with a special homemade sauce. She's going to put half in vinegar to do some pickles and keep the other half to eat with the sauce. Hopefully, Nicky will like it—the kid needs some healthy things too.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as she hears the doorbell, she places the knife next to the cutting board and completely abandons what she was doing. Her hands are slightly wet from rinsing the carrots, so she wipes them on her jeans absentmindedly before stepping out of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The package is there, just on time, waiting for her on the floor in front of the door. It's not big, just the size of a book, and meticulously protected by a carton.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her long and busy days at work, she forgot it was supposed to arrive today. She actually didn't even think it would arrive on time. But it did, and fuck, she's excited, especially to see how happy Nicky will be to finally be able to read the continuation of his favorite story.
    </p>
    <p>
     She quickly picks it up before the rain starts and goes back inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Nicky will be over the moon when he gets back from school. He's been waiting for the book since Agatha ordered it. He talked about it every day since Saturday, asked her if she checked the mailbox even when she told him it was too early.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sits on the couch and takes some time to open it. No rush. She grabs a pair of scissors and carefully slices the tape along the top edge of the carton, careful not to cut a part of the cover or the pages. Inside, cushioned between two sheets of folded brown paper, is the book.
     <em>
      The Return of the Christmas Witch
     </em>
     . The author could've chosen a better title... but well. The book is exactly like on the website, with a pretty cover with colors brighter than on the photo. There are fifty-six pages, just like the first one. All good.
    </p>
    <p>
     She flips through the first few pages slowly, though she makes sure not to read to avoid spoilers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, she's a thirty-seven-year-old woman, and yes, she actually enjoys the book. There's no maximum age limit to like a story, after all. The illustrations are pretty, just like in the previous book. That Lilia Calderu woman did a great job at drawing Kristtörn, the other characters and all the pretty landscapes. Everything is so magical—Nicky will love it. It's definitely worth the price for such a great story and quality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sets the book down on her lap and stares at the cover again. She has to admit that she prefers this one to the one from the first book. There are more magical elements, with the bubbling cauldron at the bottom and the weird blue glowing mushrooms a bit everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whoever that Rio Vidal author is, she has a great imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a small grin tugging at the corner of her lips, Agatha picks up her phone and quickly texts Wanda to tell her that the book finally arrived. She actually lent the first one to the twins; even if they're two years older than Nicky, they might enjoy the story too. At least Billy, who likes to read unlike his brother. And when she opens the message app, she isn't surprised to see new texts from Evil Hag. They haven't stopped texting since Saturday, talking about everything and anything. She enjoys her company quite a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
     She quickly texts Wanda, then hurries to open the stranger's text.

     Yeah. I'm one hundred percent sure she doesn't like him. He's old and ugly. Like close to death old. She's just waiting for him to kick the bucket so she can inherit his money. As long as she stays away from my family, I could care less about her life

     No, he's still in school. He doesn't have class on Wednesday afternoons but he always insists on staying at the school's daycare so he can play games with his friends. I'm actually glad, it's nice to have a break sometimes. I love him to death but he's still a 7yo kid, he can get annoying

     First date? What would you want it to be?

    <p>
     <strong>

     <br/>
     I haven't been on a date in ages, I don't know
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Evil Hag 3:15 PM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Come onnn what would you like?
    </p>
    <p>
     Tricky question. Her last date, ages ago, was with a woman who took her to a fancy restaurant. The kind that has a live piano player, where you can't enter unless you're wearing a proper outfit, and where everything is so... different. She remembers that while they were talking, a waiter came to sweep up the crumbs on the table with a kind of table brush. Like, what the actual fuck? She hated it. Not her vibe, and her date was boring. Only talked about herself, didn't show any interest in Agatha. Never again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her idea of a perfect date would be something simpler and more intimate. Not a room full of rich people. Maybe a simple movie marathon at home with supermarket popcorn, or a cute picnic in the middle of a flower field. But no restaurant. Especially not the fancy kind.
    </p>
    <p>

     <br/>
     Something private. No fancy dinner or anything like that. Maybe a cute picnic date?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Evil Hag 3:17 PM
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Same, honestly. Nothing fancy, I hate that. My perfect date would be in a museum, then a picnic near a river. Something calm and sweet and intimate
    </p>
    <p>
     Nice to know they're on the same page. Not like they're ever going to go on a date, anyway... that stranger lives all the way across the country, and, well, she's a stranger. Even if they've been talking non-stop for six days straight.
    </p>

     <br/>
     Yes ma'am :3
    </p>
    <p>
     The teacher has to close her eyes for a second and take a deep breath at this. Praises are her soft spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Noticing that the mix of water and vinegar is boiling in the saucepan, she turns the heat off and carefully pours the liquid into the jar of sliced carrots. That's what the recipe said, to make pickles with other vegetables. Then she closes the lid and lets it rest on the side.

    </p>
    <p>
     At the end of the day, Agatha is standing outside Nicky's elementary school with a purple umbrella protecting her from the rain and the wind messing with her hair. She has some strands in her mouth, some in her eyes. It's even worse than when she left the house. The teacher does enjoy the rain... when she's not the one under it.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as Nicky sees her in the courtyard, he runs toward her. His dinosaur backpack bounces on his back and his curls are damp from the rain, as his green coat doesn't have a hood and he didn't have an umbrella. They were in a rush this morning and Agatha forgot to give him one. Her fault. She just hopes he won't get sick; she'd feel so guilty if he did. His cheeks are flushed from the cold, a bit red, but he doesn't seem to care. Agatha crouches a little when she sees him running toward her and she opens her arms, and he crashes into her with full force, hugging her waist tightly like he hasn't seen her in weeks, even though it's only been a few hours. But hey, he's a clingy boy, and his mama doesn't mind in the slightest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey, sweetie," she says with a smile, kissing the top of his head and hugging him with one arm while the other holds the umbrella. "Come on, let's get out of the rain."
    </p>
    <p>
     They walk back to the car, and on the way home, Nicky talks non-stop about the daycare—what he ate at lunch today, what he drew, what game he played with his friends. Agatha listens and gives him a few hums to inform him that she's still listening, and when they're a few minutes away from the house, she finally speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have a surprise for you."
    </p>
    <p>
     She looks in the rear-view mirror to see his reaction to this. He raises an eyebrow, curious. "A surprise? What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You'll see when we get home. It's something you wanted for a while."
    </p>
    <p>
     His eyes sparkle. "A rabbit?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, yes, the rabbit. He's been asking for one—a real one, not a plush one—for months. But Agatha said no. And it broke her heart because she really hates saying no to her son, but a pet is not a toy. It demands time and patience and money. She only has one, the money part. Being a teacher makes a nice salary. But with this job, she also doesn't have much time, and she doesn't see the point of having a pet if she or Nicky are never there to take care of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, still not a rabbit," she rolls her eyes with a small smile. "It's not alive."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh." His voice drops, sounding disappointed, and Agatha's heart breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We already talked about this, honey. A rabbit is not a toy, it's a living soul. It needs attention, time, patience. I know how much you want one, but right now we can't. I don't see the point of having a pet if you're gone all day. You understand, right? You wouldn't want it to be all sad and lonely at home when you and I are at school?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh... right. I don't want it to be sad."
    </p>
    <p>
     When they arrive home, they both remove their soaked shoes and leave them at the door. Then they hang their coats, and Agatha points toward the living room. "Your surprise is on the couch."
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky doesn't waste any time and runs into the living room. As soon as he sees the book, his eyes widen and a smile spreads across his face. "It arrived! Mama, look how pretty the cover is! Can we read it now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not now. You still haven't had dinner. And I made you something for a snack. Come see."
    </p>
    <p>
     He follows her into the kitchen with the book clutched to his chest like a stuffed animal. She opens the fridge, takes out the small glass jar and sets it on the table. Nicky watches with curiosity as she twists off the lid.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They're pickled carrots," she explains. "I tried one earlier, they're really good and homemade. There's also a few sticks to eat with the sauce I made."
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky makes a weird face at it. "Since when do we eat healthy stuff?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Since you eat way too much chemical stuff. Now please, try one. If you don't like it, you don't have to eat it. But you'll never know if you don't try."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha isn't the kind of mean mom who forces her kid to eat things he doesn't like. She can't force him to like something, everyone has different tastes. But she always encourages him to at least try it. If he likes it, that's great. If he doesn't, then it's fine too, she'll know not to cook it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a small sigh, Nicky sits down on a stool, poses his book on the counter and grab one of the carrot sticks from the jar. He dips it generously in the creamy sauce Agatha took out from the fridge, and bites down. The bone-cracking sound break the silence of the house. "It's... sour."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's like pickles but with carrots. Do you like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He waits a few seconds, takes another bite and chews, as if he's focusing on the taste to know if he likes it or not. "It's not too bad. You made this?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolls her eyes. At this point, everyone knows she can't cook or bake, even her lovely son. "I did. My friend gave me the recipe. Y'know, the one who gave me... well, all the other recipes of the good things I've made recently."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your friend from Los Angeles?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughs under her breath and sits next to him, watching him eat more of them. He doesn't even need to be convinced, he just keeps going. It makes her feel weirdly proud. Nicky is not a complicated child, but like many kids, he isn't the biggest fan of vegetables, and it's sometimes hard to get him to eat some. She'll have to thank Evil Hag later, once again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dinner goes by quietly. She reheats leftovers from yesterday—some pasta, grilled vegetables, a bit of chicken from the stranger's recipe again—and Nicky eats everything without complaining. As soon as he's done, he runs to the bathroom to brush his teeth before she can even remind him. And she knows why: he's excited to finally read the book. She made him wait until bedtime, because that's their ritual, and he's been excited all evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, in bed, he crawls under the covers in his dinosaur pajamas and settles against her side with the book in his hands. Agatha adjusts the pillows behind her back, stretches her legs, and pulls the blanket higher up around them both. Then she takes the book from him, opens it slowly, and starts reading aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Christmas Witch was dreaming. For hundreds of years, buried deep in the ice, she had slept while the world changed around her, dreams swirling through her head like snowflakes. In them, she saw those she had known—Lutzelfrau, Elsmere, Malachi. The animals of the wood, the people in the small towns she'd visited."
    </p>
    <p>
     Halfway through the book, Agatha glances down and realizes Nicky's eyes are closed. His head is resting against her arm, his breath slow and even. He fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Smiling, she folds the corner of the page and closes the book. She slides it onto the nightstand, then carefully shifts out from under Nicky, adjusting the blankets so he won't get cold. Thankfully, he doesn't stir.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then leans over and kisses his forehead. "Goodnight, baby," she whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she steps out of the room, gently closing the door behind her while leaving it ajar, just the way he likes.

     "Come on, Agatha, you have to come!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighs at her best friend's insistence, leaning back against the kitchen counter with her phone pressed to her ear. She just finished doing some cleaning, finally taking advantage of the fact that Nicky isn't around to get it done without him constantly interrupting to ask her to play with him. He left this morning for the neighbors' house with a little backpack on his shoulders and his favorite bunny plushie squished under one arm, practically bouncing from excitement as he talked about all the things he was gonna do with the Maximoff twins.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's not unusual for him to have sleepovers with them. Agatha is sure she'd be more protective if it was at any other friend's house, but she's not worried. She knows he's in good hands, and if for some reason he has a problem, she's just a few steps away. And honestly, she's not complaining. She loves her son more than anything in the world, obviously, but being alone—even for just twenty-four hours—is something she absolutely needs from time to time to not go completely insane. Being a single mom of a seven-year-old boy is not always easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sleepover at the Maximoffs' means Agatha has the house to herself. It's been a while. This morning, she did some cleaning—tidied Nicky's room, cleaned her own, swept under the couch and other furniture that she usually neglects. She also cleaned the oven and microwave, sorted through the refrigerator and threw away everything that was expired.
    </p>
    <p>
     And okay, she hates that there was quite a lot of things... like leftover food she had put in a Tupperware a week ago then completely forgot about. It had mold and she couldn't even tell what it used to be, and the simple thought of opening it made her want to throw up, so she threw the Tupperware with it. It's just some plastic stuff anyway, she can buy it again. Who fucking cares.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm too old to go to the bar, Wanda," she mutters into the phone, responding to her best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh my God, you're not a fossil, you're thirty-seven! And there's no age to enjoy a night out. Please, I don't want to be Jen and Alice's third wheel again."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirty-seven. Almost forty. Agatha's at the age where staying home on a Friday night sounds ten times better than going out to some noisy-ass bar with her friends. Because what's the point, anyway? Jen and Alice are gonna get drunk and start flirting with each other like they always do, probably forgetting she and Wanda even exist halfway through the second round of drinks. She's certain they're secretly dating, or in a friends-with-benefits relationship, because there's
     <em>
      no way
     </em>
     these two have never fucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda's gonna want to do karaoke, that's for sure, and Agatha will be stuck standing awkwardly by the bar while some guy with beer breath and a wedding ring tries to hit on her just because she looks straight and he thinks he's got a chance. And even if she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     wear something a little more obviously gay like a carabiner or even a white t-shirt with red scissors scissoring, those drunk idiots wouldn't even get the hint.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or even if they do, they'll just say some shit like
     <em>
      you'll never know if you like it until you try
     </em>
     (she already did and she, in fact, didn't like it) or even
     <em>
      you're too pretty to be gay.
     </em>
     And yes, this unfortunately happened before. Men. Men who don't even care about her sexuality, even after she explicitly says she likes to eat pussies. No wonder she's a lesbian; men are so disgusting, in every way possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just to say, that's not the kind of night she wants to have. Not after the week she's had surrounded by hormonal teenagers who think they're smarter than her, the fucking history teacher, and dealing with parents emailing her asking why their kid got a C when they never do the damn homework.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha loves her job—teaching history, one of the things she likes the most, is a dream—but it's not always easy. Teenagers are, well... teenagers. They're loud, annoying, always trying to cheat on tests or piss the teacher of. At the end of the day, that's the hardest part of the job. Teaching is easy; dealing with the kids and their parents is not. Especially those who are way too overprotective with their kid, who defend them even if they did something bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the last PTA meeting, Agatha had told a single mom about how her son cheated in class. He had a piece of paper hidden in his pencil case with all the test's answers written on it (very subtle... could've done better). And you know what happened? The mom denied it. Said her son probably wrote this when studying with his friends and forgot to take it out of the case. Literally a fucking joke. As a single mom herself, she gets it—how she wants to protect her baby—but she'd never go that far. Agatha hates those kinds of parents with all her heart, maybe even more than their kids. But as we say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh.
    </p>
    <p>
     So after this long, annoying week, all she wants to do right now is take a hot shower—or even a relaxing bath with sweet candles and a face mask from Jen's brand, it's been a while—and then order take-out, because there's no way she's gonna bother cooking if Nicky isn't here, and then just crash in bed for twelve hours straight. And maybe talk to Evil Hag too, if she ever texts back.
    </p>
    <p>
     They've been talking basically non-stop since last Wednesday. It's been almost two weeks now, since that stranger accidentally sent her that tattoo pic. Two weeks of talking every day with a woman she only knows as Evil Hag, a silly nickname she uses to refer to her. She actually can't believe they're still talking. She had hoped so—she's a really entertaining person—but she's still surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
     They keep talking, yet they know nothing about each other's identity. They only know where they're from; Agatha knows she's from the City of Angels, but Evil Hag only knows she's from New Jersey, no specific city. Considering how small Westview is, she prefers not to share her exact location, just in case. Even though she knows her now. She doesn't, but at the same time, she does. She's an accident, a wrong number, nothing more. Not a creepy guy named Joe who's gonna stalk her then come murder her in her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Evil Hag is a woman—and from that little snippet she saw, she's a pretty one with tanned skin and toned arms and a very pretty tattoo—she's a real person who enjoys talking to her. Agatha also knows about her favorite things, as they shared a lot during their twenty questions game, but she still doesn't know what she looks like. She imagines it in her head, though. She knows she's a brunette with hazel eyes and tanned skin. She imagines a soft face, a cute smile, a soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     They've been talking for two weeks. Nothing too personal, that's kind of their thing, but somehow they never run out of things to talk about. Books, movies and shows, music, food. They always find something to talk about while keeping their identities secret. Which is kind of funny; after all this time, they could share more. They both know the other is not a creepy man and they could easily call each other friends, so why not? But Evil Hag doesn't overshare. Never. She's always mysterious, especially about her job, which makes Agatha wonder what is it for her to be so secretive about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is she, a drug dealer? A hitwoman? An FBI agent who can't share her job for safety? Who knows. She just hopes that one day, she'll feel safe enough to share more. She already knows that Agatha is a teacher and that she has a son called Nicky—though his real name is Nicholas, but she only uses it when he needs to be scolded or in more formal settings—but Agatha doesn't know anything else about her besides the fact that she has a tarantula, which is absolutely disgusting. Just thinking about it makes her shiver. She wouldn't call herself arachnophobic, but thinking of all those eyes looking at her... ew, no.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's been looking forward to her messages a little too much now, refreshing her texts way more than she should, especially the past couple of days. She knows, deep down, that it's stupid. That refreshing is useless. Her phone is not that old—if Evil Hag texts, she'll simply get the notification on her lockscreen or control panel thing. But she can't help it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hasn't replied in two full days. Which is fine, she's probably just busy with her mysterious job, but Agatha can't help overthinking it anyway. What if she got bored of her and blocked her? No, no, otherwise she wouldn't be able to text her anymore. Then maybe she's just ghosting her... Maybe Agatha said something weird or made her uncomfortable somehow. Or maybe, again, she's just working and it's nothing, just her mind making up things. That's most likely what's really happening. But still.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hates how much she misses her. It's dumb, but she does. She got used to the attention, to the easy back-and-forth, to the flirty little jokes that always made her smile like an idiot. The thirty-seven-year-old teacher is now glued to her phone all day like the teenagers she teaches. Funny, isn't it? Not the best role model to Nicky, who as for now only has a tablet he only gets to use a certain amount of time a day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is lucky, because when she says stop, he doesn't fight her. He just hands her back his tablet without complaining. And he's so polite and sweet that Agatha always lets him finish whatever he was doing before his screentime got to an end. If he's watching a movie—depending on the time left, of course—she lets him finish. If it's a game, that's the same thing. And maybe that's why he's so good about it, because she's doing a great job at parenting while taking consideration of her son's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without Evil Hag, everything just feels kind of... boring. She's the only entertaining thing in Agatha's life right now, and with her gone and Nicky not home either, the house is way too still today. The morning was fine because she was busy doing some cleaning, but now, it's different. She could watch tv, catch up on the latest shows and movies on Netflix or any other overpriced streaming platform she subscribed to, but she's sure she'd be too distracted to follow whatever she's watching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Wanda's right. Maybe she should go. Get dressed, go out, get drunk, forget about everything. Maybe she'll even enjoy herself. Or maybe she'll spend the whole night regretting not staying in her pajamas, binge-watching a shitty show and eating unhealthy, greasy take-out on the couch with a beer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know," she finally mumbles into the phone with another sigh, shifting her weight to her other leg and glancing around the kitchen, only to notice how spotless everything is. Well thank fucking God, she spent over an hour cleaning it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come on, it's gonna be fun! Vision's babysitting the boys. Please, Agatha. It's been forever since we went out and had fun together."
    </p>
    <p>
     She looks at the time on the microwave, then sighs again. It's still early. Too early to go to sleep and too late to be productive with anything. Thankfully, this week she doesn't have any copies to correct.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thinks for a moment, then agrees. "Fuck, alright. But if some guy flirts with me, I'm stabbing him with a broken beer bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Amazing! I'll help you hide the body. I'll pick you up in an hour, be ready by then! Love you, see ya soon!" And just like that, Wanda hangs up before Agatha can even answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     An hour. Fucking seriously? She still needs to shower, wash her hair, find an outfit, then do her hair and makeup. There's no way in hell she'll be ready to leave in an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
     With yet another loud annoyed sigh, she rushes to the bathroom, where she strips in record time and steps into the shower. She doesn't even wait for the water to heat up, which might actually be a good thing because the cold shock wakes her up a little and she's gonna need the energy if she wants to survive the night. She's already half-regretting her decision... but Wanda is right. It's been a while since they got out together, and with Jen and Alice, they all need it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the water hits her skin, she shivers, but she ignores it and grabs her shampoo bottle. It's the olive oil one Jen gave her from her shop, the one that doesn't smell really good but makes her hair incredibly soft. And she really needs this now because her hair looks like a bird took a nest in it. She squeezes out a generous amount and tries to cover as much of her hair as possible, which is always a bit of a struggle considering how thick and long it is.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once it's lathered in, she lets it sit while she grabs the body wash and scrubs down as fast as she can. The whole thing is rushed, but she doesn't have time to waste. After she's rinsed and out of the shower, she wraps herself in a towel. A quick look down at her phone posed next to the sink confirms that she already has only half an hour left. How the fuck did she spend this much time in the shower? Jeez, she really has no concept of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabs a brush and quickly runs it through her wet hair, not even bothering to dry it since she knows it takes forever and it always looks better when it air-dries anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still wrapped in her towel, she heads to the bedroom so she can finish drying off while figuring out what the hell she's going to wear...
    </p>
    <p>
     ...And fuck. It's going to be harder than she thought, because she has nothing to wear. Not
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     as in her closet is empty,
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     as in most of the stuff she used to wear to go out doesn't fit anymore, not since she had Nicky. Pregnancy did a number on her body, and while she's mostly made peace with it, her closet hasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half of her old dresses are too tight, too short, or she now finds them ugly. Time really changed her tastes. And the stuff that does fit, well, it's either way too formal for a night out or not comfortable enough. The simple fact that she'll have to wear a bra for god knows how many hours already makes her want to cancel. She spent the entire day braless, wearing old comfy clothes she now wears as pajamas, so thinking about her boobs being compressed again... damn it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She finally decides on a simple pair of black slacks with a white button-up. Something safe, not too sexy (so men won't try to flirt with her) and not too uncomfortable either. The slacks don't have a zipper and don't make Agatha feel compressed, which is a win, especially since she hasn't eaten for hours and the alcohol she'll probably drink tonight might make her feel bloated later. It's not the most exciting outfit ever, but it'll do.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts are interrupted by three knocks on the door of her bedroom. Agatha jumps, startled, and immediately turns her head toward the sound, only to find her best friend standing there, already fully dressed in a beautiful red dress that reaches her knees, hugging her body just enough to make it hot but not slutty. Her heels are the exact same shade, matching perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Red has always been her color—it makes her hair pop and it brings out the green in her eyes. Her ginger hair is curled and falling over her shoulders, and her makeup is soft, subtle, nothing too much, just enough to highlight everything that's already pretty. She looks amazing. Like always. But there's absolutely no way she wasn't at least half-ready when she called Agatha, because an hour to do all of this is just impossible, even for the one and only Wanda Maximoff.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wanda, what the fuck!" Agatha gasps, a hand flying to her chest. "Ever heard of knocking?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The redhead leans against the doorframe, arms crossed over her chest. "I did. Three times. You didn't hear."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How did you even—"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Spare key under the weirdly shaped rock," Wanda cuts her off with a smirk, looking at her up and down with a slight frown. "I know you, Agatha. First of all, that's such a bad hiding place, literally anyone could find it and break in. And second, what the fuck is this outfit?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs. "My outfit for tonight. And by the way, you're early."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, thank God I am. You can't fucking be serious."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?" Agatha frowns. "I look good."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You look like you're going to a fucking PTA meeting. We're going to a bar, not the school. You need to look sexy."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And attract drunk ugly men? No thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That doesn't mean you have to look like you're about to give someone detention."
    </p>
    <p>
     The history teacher groans, throwing her hands in the air. "I don't even own anything sexy! Have you seen me? I'm not the skinny twenty-something I used to be. Half my closet doesn't even fit me anymore. You know my body changed with the pregnancy."
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda sighs, stepping fully into the room. She's been there for years, hearing her complain about how her body changed, then start accepting herself again. She lived it all. "You were hot before having Nicky, and you're still hot after having Nicky. Got it? Your body is different, yeah, but it shows that you birthed a literal human. You created life, Agatha, that's huge. You don't need to hide that. I'm sure you have something less... formal to wear. And there's no way I'm letting you go out with wet hair, Jesus."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flops onto the bed and smiles at Wanda's reassurance. How is that woman straight, she wonders. She always calls her hot, or sexy, or gives her many weird pet names old married couples use. And just to say, she never uses any with her dear husband. That's not a very straight thing to do... but alas, Wanda Scarlet Maximoff is a straight woman. Sadly. Agatha would've fucked her years ago if she had any interest in girls back then and wasn't married.
    </p>
    <p>
     The redhead, while her best friend watches her from the bed, starts going through her closet. "By the way," she breaks the silence, "did Nicky enjoy the book?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Did he enjoy it? Fuck yeah he did. It took them three days to finish it, since he kept falling asleep before they could make any real progress, but he loved it. Totally obsessed, as his mother had hoped and expected. "He did," Agatha says, smiling at the memory. "But now he's sad there isn't a third book in the series."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yet."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I checked the author's Insta last time. I was curious to see if she had one and what she looked like. She's really hot, by the way, totally your type. But she's not super active. Her last post was, like, a month ago and she said she's working on the third book. The final one, apparently. But she also has a new book coming soon. Not part of the Christmas Witch series, but I think Nicky might still like it. If I remember right, it's about a witch too, Luna something."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh? Agatha raises an eyebrow, surprised. "You stalked her social media?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda rolls her eyes. "I didn't
     <em>
      stalk
     </em>
     her. People have social media for a reason, you know. To engage with fans, announce new stuff, post about their projects. She's also an actress, by the way. Four million followers. Just a few posts, some highlights too, she's the discreet kind."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jeez, do you have a crush on her now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm straight," the redhead reminds her for the umpteenth time with a small chuckle and a roll of her eyes. She's still going through all her clothes, muttering a few
     <em>
      nope
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      ugly
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      ew
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      what the fuck
     </em>
     here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, and so am I," Agatha deadpans.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, sure you are. Anyway, you should follow her. She's your son's favorite author. Wouldn't hurt to keep up with her work, y'know. I can't remember when exactly but I'm almost certain her new book releases next week. You should follow the illustrator too, that Lilia Calderu woman."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're literally never gonna beat the bi allegations."
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda groans. "Agatha, for the last time, I'm straight! I can find
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     girls hot without it meaning anything. And Lilia's like, sixty or something. I'm only following her because she's an amazing artist. And Rio's just a good author, okay? Billy loved the book. Tommy not so much, but I'm still one hundred percent getting the next one. You should too."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't even have Instagram anymore."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I uninstalled it. I never used it," Agatha shrugs.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's true. Technically, she still has an account—Wanda made her sign up months ago—and she posted a few pictures here and there, but she never really got into it. The app wasn't fun for her. Her feed was just teenagers doing dumbass trends and random shit she didn't care about. Wanda tried explaining how the algorithm worked, how she had to follow people for her to see content she was interested in, but even then, Agatha never liked it. She felt too old for all that. So eventually she just deleted the app. Problem solved, and she saved some storage on her phone to take many more pictures of her son doing everything and anything she thought would be nice to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, reinstall it," Wanda says while holding up a long black dress with a neckline so high it looks like something a nun would wear. "What the fuck?" she mutters, turning the dress around to show her best friend. "When are you ever gonna wear this? At a funeral?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts. She actually wore that once, right after Nicky was born, back when she didn't feel as confident showing skin. But now that she looks at it again, now that she feels more comfortable in her body and that her clothing style changed a lot... absolutely the hell no. What the fuck is this ugly thing? How did she even wear it in the past? It looks like something her mother used to force her to wear at her Catholic school. Hard pass.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm saving it for when my mom finally kicks the bucket," she jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you wanna really piss her off, you should show up to her funeral dressed in rainbow from head to toe. She'd probably crawl out of her grave just to call you a dyke and be homophobic about it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "She totally would. Can't wait to be haunted by her ghost and have to call a fucking exorcist."
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughs as she keeps digging through the closet. The problem is, half the clothes Agatha owns are too small now, and the other half is basically what she wears at work. High-waisted slacks, button-up shirts in like ten different colors. A few pairs of jeans, t-shirts, comfy pants she wears on her days off that totally double as pajamas. But something she can wear to a bar? Yeah. That she doesn't really have. It's been so long since she went out that she's forgotten what even counts as 'going out' clothes. Last time, she threw on a Fleetwood Mac tee with high-waisted jeans and called it a day. She could technically do that again tonight, but she already knows Wanda would strangle her before letting her walk out the door like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Wanda pulls something out. "This," she says. She's holding an olive green knit long-sleeved midi dress with lace detail at the chest and a squared neckline.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck. Agatha forgot she even had that. She wore it once last Christmas over a red sweater. It was objectively ugly as hell like that, but it matched the holiday colors, so it felt festive enough to spend the night at the Maximoffs'. Agatha was only celebrating Christmas for Nicky, and because it's similar enough to Yule that she can celebrate it as a pagan holiday and not a Christian one. Otherwise, she hates it. An entire holiday focused on a man people have never seen but believe in because it's written in an old-ass book... yeah, no. She never believed in it, and with the way she grew up, she could even say she hates it and anything related to Christianity. Once the holiday was over, the dress went right back into her closet and never saw the light of day again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's perfect," Wanda continues with a proud smile. "And forget the bra. It'll look sexier without and way more comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raises an eyebrow. Is she serious? The dress is cute, yeah, she'll admit that. But braless? In public? At a straight bar? Absolutely not. She'd do it if they were going to a lesbian bar, no hesitation. Girls, even the gay ones, are way more respectful than straight cis men. But the only one in Westview's closed for renovations, so they're stuck going to a regular bar. With men. Drunk, straight, married men who will forget they have a wife at home and try to flirt with any girl.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm gonna freeze my tits off," she scoffs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, and you'll look hot. Worth it. Come on, Ags. You can't show up looking like a teacher about to give a lecture on the dangers of vaping. This is literally the only acceptable outfit in your closet tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
     Grumbling, Agatha grabs the dress from Wanda's hands and accepts her fate. "Ugh, alright! But I swear to Hekate, Wanda, if a man tries to flirt, I'm leaving."
    </p>
    <p>
     She starts unbuttoning her shirt without giving a single fuck that Wanda is still standing right there in the room (it's not like she hasn't seen her naked before, anyway) and once the fabric is off, she reaches behind her to unclasp her lilac bra and tosses it on the bed next to her slacks. She doesn't even bother folding anything. She'll probably end up putting everything on the floor later if she's too drunk, or even fall asleep over them. Doesn't matter. She'll put the clothes back in her closet tomorrow... if she's not too hungover to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then slips the dress on, adjusts the sleeves, pulls it down over her hips, and smooths out the fabric a little before walking over to her full-length mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes a breath and looks at herself properly. As expected, the dress hugs her figure more than she's used to. It's not tight, exactly, but it's close-fitting. Her hips definitely look bigger than they do in jeans or slacks, and her tummy shows a bit more than she'd like. She shifts uncomfortably, eyes focusing on the way the fabric outlines the small swell of her stomach. She tries to remind herself that it's fine. That it's normal. She's thirty-seven, she created life, her body's changed, and that doesn't make her less hot. Maybe if she repeats it enough times, she'll actually start believing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she forgets about how her curves show more in this outfit for a second, she does kinda love the dress. The neckline dips lower than what she usually goes for, shows off more cleavage than she's used to, but... she doesn't look too bad. Her boobs look good, actually. Great, even. She just adjusts the fabric a little so it hides more skin—that part of her boobs that is now covered in stretch marks from the pregnancy, when her boobs got bigger for breastfeeding, then smaller again after. Nothing wrong with them, she knows that, but she's not very comfortable showing that yet. Especially in a straight bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fabric is soft and stretchy, the fit is comfortable and the olive green color suits her. It's far from her favorite purple shade, but it works with her hair, brings out her skin tone, and somehow reminds her of nature. A smile grows on her face when she remembers that green is Evil Hag's favorite color and that she's a nature kind of girl.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So?" Wanda mumbles from behind her. "It looks great. You look great."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha switches angles in the mirror, turning slightly to the side. Her eyes stay fixed on her reflection as she places a hand over her tummy. The small swell reminds her of those first few weeks of pregnancy, when she'd started to show just the tiniest bit. She'd been so happy back then, so excited even though she already knew her body would never be the same. And that was okay. That was normal. It didn't mean she couldn't still be attractive. Some people might even prefer how she looks now. But all the bullshit her mother filled her head with growing up still lingers, and sometimes it's hard not to believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you say so," she mutters, still looking at herself at different angles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda tosses a gray cardigan her way, and Agatha catches it out of reflex. "Wear this," the redhead says. "Wouldn't want you to freeze to death, huh? Now come on, sit down, I'm doing your hair and makeup. There's no way I'm letting you leave the house like that."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's gonna take forever," Agatha groans. "What about Alice and Jen?
    </p>
    <p>
     "They'll wait for us at the bar. And I'm sure they'll be very happy to be alone... together." Wanda grins.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm. Yeah, you're right."
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour later, they're finally ready to go. Agatha's hair is dry now, loosely styled, and she's got just enough makeup on to feel presentable without overdoing it. Even in her everyday life, the teacher has never been a big fan of makeup. She wears some mascara and lip gloss if she feels like it, but that's it. Nothing too heavy or colorful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before leaving her bedroom to follow Wanda downstairs, she snaps a quick mirror photo of her outfit to send to Evil Hag. Obviously, her face is cropped out, but everything else is visible. The tip of her long brown hair, her cleavage, her outfit, even her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opens her conversation with her and clicks on the gallery option. Her fingers hover over her photo for a moment... and she hesitates. Will she find her pretty? It would be the very first time she sends a photo of herself, and even if her face isn't visible, the rest is, and she's scared that woman won't like her. What if she doesn't find her good enough? What if she stops flirting because she doesn't like how she looks?
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few more seconds, Agatha let out a sigh and decides to send it anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
     No fast response this time. She isn't expecting one, anyway. She just hopes Evil Hag will come back to her; she misses talking to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Letting out another sigh, she tucks her phone into her black crossbody bag and looks at herself one last time in the mirror.

      This chapter will have a lot of edging 👀 and I'm not talking about the girls edging each other, I'm talking about me edging you 😈 This chapter was supposed to be a very long one, over 10k words, but I decided to cut it, so you get it early anddd you can make theories of what's gonna happen next. And also because I love edging you all... promise it'll be worth it. Next chapter will be a long one too, and important
     </p>
     <p>
      And for the people who don't have Twitter (you should get it because I'm regularly posting sneak peeks of new chapters and infos), I will write a twin fic from Rio's POV once this one is finished. Meaning you will have her version of this story. It's already planned, so don't worry! 🫶🏻

      Hope you liked this chapter even if Rio isn't really in it. But Agatha's getting closer 👀 Also, the dress Agatha is wearing is the one Kathryn wears in Mrs. Fletcher during the bar scene. And yes, I know I write Agatha as being self-conscious a lot, AND IT WILL BE IMPORTANT LATER. Give y'all more reasons to hate Evanora and this will lead to a very cute scene with Rio. And yes, I know Agatha insists with the fact that Wanda isn't straight, and DON'T WORRY. She's not really pushing but mostly joking AND Nat will make an appearance later on...
