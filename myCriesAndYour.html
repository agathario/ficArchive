     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      On a random, depressing day, in a bar the brokenhearted professor Rio Vidal knows all too well, she sees a woman—or, as she describes her in her head, an ethereal being, the painter Agatha Harkness.
     </p>
     <p>
      A woman whose mere presence sobered Rio up, then made her drunk again for an entirely different reason.
     </p>
     <p>
      Can Rio—a woman who doubts her self-worth, who believes she's undeserving of love—handle holding the door open for someone as delicate and willing as Agatha?
      <br/>
      And if she does, can she handle letting her in afterward?
     </p>

    <h2>
     Chapter One
    </h2>
   </div>
   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     Rain poured down heavily on her while she sat in her garden, surrounded by the plants she put so much effort into growing to soothe her, to reconnect with her own self, held by nature's embrace. As the rain continued to fall down on her, soaking her wet, cleansing her whole being, her mind wouldn't rest; her thoughts were consumed by the woman who left her broken and completely out of control. Tears steamed her face, mixing with the raindrops, and her head was filled with only her: that woman. Her ex–girlfriend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Four months ago, Rio Vidal's world shattered completely after that breakup; the last words her ex–girlfriend said still felt like daggers in Rio's body.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I look at you and I see nothing Rio, I see nothing but a stranger I once knew. I don't even know how I loved you in the first place, you're a monster Rio Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm the monster? You really want to have this conversation with me Jane? I fucking caught you cheating on me with a dude for fuck's sake! On our goddamn bed! While I was gone, planning a vacation for your majesty so we could celebrate our fourth anniversary! But you obviously had better plans in your head.” Rio said while looking at her girlfriend, who refused to meet her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't love you Rio, I'm sorry but I just don't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah don't worry, I figured that out when I saw a dick inside of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm leaving.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You better do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As her girlfriend headed toward the door
    </p>
    <p>
     “I had no regrets till I met you Rio.” and she left.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio never understood how her ex girlfriend managed to play the victim's role in a situation like that, or how she manipulated her into believing that she's the bad person who never deserved love or happiness. How she managed to get into her head and fuck with her life over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her life felt hollow now, empty of any meaning or purpose, nothing could save her. She had experienced breakups before but none came close to this one. Her depression wasn't merely a result of her girlfriend's manipulation or how she cheated on her. It stemmed from how disgusted she is with herself.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The sunlight woke her up; she had left the windows open last night while she was gazing at the clouded moon, thinking about taking her own life while drinking like a maniac.
    </p>
    <p>
     The headache was unbearable, she could feel every nerve in her head pulsating, as if it were a warning that her head would explode at any second.
    </p>
    <p>
     She forced her body out of the bed and walked toward the bathroom, her legs moving on their own. She gripped the bathroom's door for dear life when she felt the nauseous sensation in her stomach. Leaning her head down to the toilet seat and vomiting her soul out. The coldness of the bathroom's floor offered a sense of safety and belonging, as if she belongs here, on the floor while vomiting her feelings out of her body. After a few minutes, she managed to stand on her feet again. Washing her face, she stared into her reflection, she looked like hell, she had been looking like hell for months now. The darkness that circles her eyes had become a part of her face. The pale skin and her chapped lips. She stared for a few more seconds, then turned her face away, unable to handle her own reflection any longer. She hopped into the shower after taking every piece of fabric off her body. Water cascading down her entire body while her mind drowned in thoughts that Rio couldn't contain.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped out, wrapped a towel around her body and headed toward the wardrobe. She pulled out the first thing her eyes landed on, black trousers, a white button–up shirt and her usual jacket. She got into her car and drove to the nearest café to the university. After grabbing her black coffee she made her way to work.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, nice seeing you here. Where have you been?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was literally here yesterday, Alice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I mean where have you been Rio? You either at home or here; you don't even go out with us anymore. It has been months.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I've been busy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Busy mourning an asshole?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her with sharp eyes. She knows she's an asshole but she doesn't want to hear it, she can't hear such a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry. But seriously, Rio, you should go out. You'd get yourself killed like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Out where Alice? Bars? Clubs? Drinking all night and trying to pour my sadness and suffering into any girl's mouth?” Rio said as she opened her office door and stepped inside, placing her things on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't mean that.” Alice said as she sat on the green velvet couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was watering her plant when she looked back at Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you have lectures to attend, professor?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I'm staying here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I do, so I have to go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to grab a drink later? Just talking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, holding back, she wants to go out, see people, and talk, but she also doesn't. What good would that do to her? To talk and force someone to hear her problems? People have enough pain already; why bother them with more?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just the drink without the talking part.” Rio said after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll talk eventually.” Alice said, standing up with a smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     She exited and closed the door behind her. Rio let out a big sigh and leaned back on her chair. Her headache was worsening and this coffee wasn't helping at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     She managed to survive the day and herself. She stepped out of her office, exited the campus and headed to the parking lot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Vidal!” Alice called her from behind. Rio took a breath and turned to face her. “Hey”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Still up for the drinks right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You say that like I have a say in this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly, you don't.” Alice said with amusement in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God Alice, you're insufferable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know. Anyway, going somewhere?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great, so I'll meet you there or should I come and pick you up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, just text me the address and I'll come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright. Don't bail on me though!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish I could.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said as she walked away from Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she got into her car, she took a deep breath, started the engine, heading to her depressing home.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the front door and stepped inside, took off her shoes by the door and nestled into the couch, letting the heavy silence consume her. She closed her eyes for a while, replaying unpleasant memories in her head, things that happened right in this living room. Tears threatened to fall down but she refused to obey, so she opened her eyes, her eyelids heavier than a rock. Rio dragged her feet laggardly toward her bedroom. Took her current clothes off, put on an oversized t–shirt and crashed onto her bed.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Two hours later she woke up to the sound of her phone buzzing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dude are you sleeping?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good, meet me in an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hung up without responding. She stared at the ceiling while regretting her entire life. “Death is not coming to me anytime soon,” She said to herself while getting up. She washed her face while ignoring her own reflection in the mirror. Looked at her wardrobe considering the options then settled on black trousers and a navy blue button–up shirt. She forced herself to look at her reflection just so she could apply her eyeliner and lipstick and didn't glance any longer. She grabbed her bag and keys and stepped out. The night breeze embraced her, she took a deep breath while closing her eyes, feeling present in the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     She parked her car and got out of it, heading to the place Alice had texted her the location of earlier. “Here we are.” she muttered to herself while stepping inside, searching for Alice with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here, Rio!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shouted from the back of the bar and it seemed like she had some company.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio walked toward her and sat on the chair facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio this is Jennifer. Jen this is Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both looked at each other at the same time exchanging polite smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice to finally meet you.” Jen said shaking Rio's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice to meet you Jennifer.” Rio said, forcing a smile on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright guys, I'm going to grab some drinks. Anything in particular.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, the usual Ali.”٠ Rio said while searching the bar for no reason–probably.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Looking for someone?” Jen asked once Alice was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, not really.” Rio responded, looking Jen in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've heard a lot about you, you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Like what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Alice mentions you often.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know what she could possibly say really, but we've known each other since we were kids.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, she told me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good.” Rio said with a smile. “You're her girlfriend right? Don't worry, our times were over years ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I am, and glad to know that.” Jen said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What we're talking about?” Alice asked after returning with the drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How we were high school sweethearts.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We were the sweetest,” Alice said with a laugh as she looked at Jen.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “See, Alice, that's the thing. I cannot mourn in your way; I have my own way to mourn and suffer, it's not fair to force someone into doing what you think is comfortable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know what you're talking about Rio, but for how long? How many years do you plan to mourn someone who doesn't deserve a second from you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not sad because of her, Alice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You keep telling yourself that sweetheart. Look, I've known you for years, and I know how you deal with things like this. You deal with them by shutting yourself off completely, destroying yourself while you need to be held and I still don't unders...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That is my way, Alice. My way. I don't want to pretend like my wounds are not open. If I ignore them, they will still hurt me, you know? Because my pretending won't change the fact that they're still there!” Rio snapped at Alice. She knows what kind of person she turns into when she's drunk, and she always hated that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, I'm sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice said and silence followed, surrounding the three of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that Agatha Harkness?” Jen asked looking at someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who?” Rio asked
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha Harkness. Oh my God, you don't know her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, not really. I've never heard of a name like that. Am I supposed to know her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, technically, yes.” Alice said, looking at Rio then back at the woman, Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who is she? Is she famous or something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not famous as a celebrity but she's one of the greatest painters I've ever met. I went to her gallery last year in Paris and I was stunned by her and her work.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally looked at the woman her friends were talking about;
     <em>
      an ethereal being
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A woman with dark hair, piercing blue eyes, the perfect nose, lips and jaw. She was standing, her white shirt tucked into her purple trousers and wearing a blue trench coat. The sight of the woman sobered Rio up, then made her drunk again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have seen the painting in my office, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice's voice brought Rio back
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which one?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Above the couch.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh yeah, yeah, what about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's hers. I bought it years ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Really? I love that painting.” Rio said looking back at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me too, it has a place in my heart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which one baby?” Jen asked
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Black: My True Love's Heart.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After an hour or so, Rio wasn't keeping track of the time or of the glasses of alcohol she had imbibed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm gonna pee you guys, then we should go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen hummed to her while kissing, and Rio gave them a grossed–out expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get a room, for fuck's sake.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And left, heading to the restroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was washing her hands, looking at her drunken state, her face was red and her eyes were fighting to stay open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then that
     <em>
      ethereal being
     </em>
     stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha's reflection in the mirror, taking her beauty in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was drying her hands, and Rio stood in her place, frozen, staring at the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Gosh you're gorgeous.” Rio spoke inaudibly, yet the sentence echoed somehow in the deserted space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at Rio with a raised eyebrow and a hint of a faint smirk on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, I'm drunk” Rio said, then left immediately.

    <p>
     Rio shifted in her bed, she was exhausted, her body drained of any energy, her eyes burning, and the headache making everything much worse. Yet, her mind refused to shut off, to let her have an hour or two of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goddamn it” she muttered as she sat on the bed, her head in her hands. She pressed on her forehead, trying to put some pressure to calm her head and to find a moment of relief, but to no avail. Nothing was working, the universe had made it clear as crystal that nothing was on her side, not even her mind
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the drawer of the nightstand, searching for some cigarettes or anything. She found none, so she dragged her feet to the wardrobe, hoping there's some weed was left, even though she knew damn well there was none.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gave up, closed the wardrobe and leaned on its door. “That what you get for trying to be healthy: you get shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She dragged her feet again and stood in the middle of the room, took a few minutes to breathe, and then laid her body on the floor. The coldness made her shiver. She opened her hands and laid them freely on the floor. “I feel like Jesus.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Seconds passed then she started laughing hysterically, tears steamed from her eyes as she put her hand on her stomach after laughing so hard. She started drawing messy patterns on the fabric, going up and down, then in a circular motion. She lifted her t–shirt up, and started doing the same on her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was looking at the ceiling, she lowered her hand to the waistband of her shorts, and hesitated, because even the idea of touching herself felt wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     A minute passed and her hands were still resting there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers slipped into her shorts, resting on her underwear. Each movement felt wrong, she kept thinking that it felt wrong, but she refused to back off now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers started moving on her pussy above the piece of fabric, then she pulled it aside and found her clit immediately. She closed her eyes, trying to think of anything, anything that could help her. Memories and images flashed by her eyes, but none were helpful. She squeezed her eyes shut even tighter, replaying some moments, while her digits kept on moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes passed and she still struggled to get off. She almost gave up on having an orgasm, slowing her movements. As she did, the image of Agatha Harkness popped into her head; her movements were faster than ever, almost there. Her hand was tired, God, she's almost there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The image of that dark–haired woman was doing wonders to her body, and suddenly, she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck me. What am I doing?” she said, breathlessly. She covered her face with her hands, “This is so wrong.” she scolded herself, raised her underwear and short up, and stood on her feet almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     She laid in her bed and accepted her fate; sleep was not coming.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The alarm forced her to open her eyes widely, and she buried her face in the pillows “Shut up” she said, reaching for her phone to silence that noise. She stayed like that for a few minutes; her head buried in the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't feel her body right now, everything was replaced by pain. She lifted her head up and looked around the messy room: clothes thrown on the floor, empty cups and glasses, some books resting in the corner, and some exam papers lying beside them with her glasses on top of them. The sight of the mess was painful, because she had always loved being in a clean place, now that room matched the chaos in her head. She looked at the time and she was already late, so she called in and canceled her classes for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     She slept for a few more minutes then got up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Washed her face and headed back to that dump of a room. She tried her best to clean up, and she was satisfied with the final result.
     <em>
      Better than nothing
     </em>
     , she told herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     After taking a shower she went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, and found that basically, nothing was edible in there. She huffed, and closed the fridge, opened the wall cabinets, and she was grateful for any and every divine power for the cereal she found.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the fridge again, took out the milk, and had the breakfast of a five–year–old kid.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Hours passed by, doing nothing, everything was boring, and the idea of getting out of the house tired her, let alone actually doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was watching some dull documentary on some channel about paintings. Though she wasn't really paying attention, until the name Agatha Harkness was mentioned and that made her open her eyes and focus them on the screen in disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     That documentary was old because the woman looked younger; she was discussing one of her paintings, and Rio had never looked more focused in her entire life. The deep voice of the woman relaxed her, she felt safe and comfortable. Then Agatha on the screen looked directly into the camera and Rio felt it, as if she were looking at her, but she wasn't. A minute passed and Agatha disappeared, replaced by an another artist on the screen and things became boring again, unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept her eyes glued on the screen in front of her, hoping the woman would return, but she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's mind replayed the image of that woman in the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Gosh, you're gorgeous.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Excuse me?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Sorry, I'm drunk.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio covered her face in embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You couldn't be more stupid, could you? ‘
     <em>
      Sorry, I'm drunk
     </em>
     ’ Bitch, who the fuck wants to hear such an information? Oh my God.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her scolding of herself didn't last much longer because she was interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing. And of course it's Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, where are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you kidding? Why haven't you responded to my messages then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What messages? I didn't see anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus Christ Rio. I asked you yesterday if you could make it to the party tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hold on, hold on, what party? What messages? What's the occasion? And the answer is no.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you please just shut up? It's a par...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No I won't shut up, I'll hang up now, bye”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll come to your house and drag you from there, and you know I would.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, alright, stay right where you are. What's the party for? Who is getting married.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just shut up and let me talk.” Alice said. Then continued when she didn't hear a response from Rio “Alright, so Jen and I were planning to have a party for a long time now, my friends, her friends, our friends’ friends and others. There's no particular occasion; we just wanted to have some fun. But to be honest, I want to propose to her tonight. I've been thinking about it for a month now, and I think tonight is the night, and I really, really want you to be there. So please say you'll come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're abusing me Alice, because that's a lot, and you know socializing tortures me. But sure, I'll be there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my God, really?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah dude, and I'm really happy for you, I think I'm gonna cry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't,” Alice said with a chuckle. “Be there at 9. Love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Love you too, Ali” She said and hung up.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let out a breath she didn't know she was holding.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     After feeling bad for herself this morning, she decided to at least buy the groceries that she needed the most.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put on her green hoodie and trousers and stepped out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     The weather was great, and the cold breeze was welcoming, pulling her hair to the side and making her nose red. The coldness sent an electric wave traveling through her entire body, and that made her smile; a sudden attack of happiness made her feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
     She walked from section to section, picking up only what she felt was necessary, as if her fridge wasn't crying to be filled for months.
    </p>
    <p>
     She steeped outside, lit a cigarette and took the first puff. The smoke filled her lungs and senses, the burning sensation resting in her throat, and the sudden rush of nicotine in her body made her relax, her muscles loosened. She walked to her car, put the bags in the back and headed home. She was feeling good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Around 7 PM, she sat on the couch looking through photos, trying to waste some time, and there it was: a photo she had forgotten to delete. Her ex–girlfriend kissing her cheek while Rio is looking directly at the camera with a silly grin on her face. Her eyes were full of love and appreciation. Rio looked at herself in the photo for minutes before she deleted it and threw her phone away.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of her sudden panic attacks took control of her entire body. Anxiety coursed through her veins, Rio felt like her heart would break through her rib cage and escape her chest. She started sweating, got up from the couch, and tried to breathe, once, twice. Again and again. Her legs lost the ability to stand, so she lowered her head looking at the ground, trying to put her weight on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dizziness began to take control of her head, making her feel numb and acutely aware of everything at the same time. She remembered how her mother used to hold her during her panic attacks and how her whole body would relax and regain its normal state, but not now, no one is here to hold her now. So, she fell beside the couch onto the ground and tried to hold herself as tightly as she could, embracing her body while trying to steady her breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      It will be fine, Rio. It will be fine, Rio. It will be fine, Rio.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept repeating that sentence until she was able to breathe normally again. Her head was still dizzy and her vision was blurry from the tears that fell from her eyes unconsciously. She sat on the wooden floor for several minutes, trying to get herself back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she got up, wiped her tears with the back of her hand while walking toward the bottle of vodka, poured the first glass and drank it in one swig. The burning in her mouth led her to pour the second. During the third one she realized that she—unfortunately—had somewhere to go in an hour and a half. She abandoned the bottle and went upstairs. Washing her face five times with cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
     By 8:30 PM she was ready: a navy blue blazer, a dress shirt in the same color and a black trousers. Having opened the first three buttons of her shirt to leave a space to show her cleavage and that necklace that she refuses to take off. Red lipstick, black eyeliner, and letting her hair hang down to her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drove to Alice's place, took a few minutes to prepare herself while leaning on her seat, then she got out. Before knocking on the door, it swung open revealing Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio! You're here!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I guess I am.” Rio said, smiling
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, I'm so happy you're here! come on in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice moved aside so Rio could step inside. Many people were there—people she either didn't know or didn't recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look gorgeous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice said with a smile on her lips as she looked at Rio
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks Ali, you look really beautiful too, this color really suits you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, Rio, thank you” Alice said, blushing. “You won't believe who is here, but now come with me, I need to show you something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio followed Alice to one of the empty rooms. Alice took out a small box from her pocket, opened it, and waited for Rio's reaction. Rio looked at the radiant ring inside, then looked at Alice while smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ali, this is so beautiful! Without exaggerating. I think it's one of the prettiest rings I've ever seen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Really? Do you think she'd like it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She would love it. Trust me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both smiled at each other and then left the room to engage with the party's vibes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was laughing at something Alice had said when she looked up to see the dark haired woman with piercing blue eyes. Rio couldn't believe her eyes, so she glanced at Alice who was already looking at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is who I wanted to tell you is here.” Alice said as she met Rio's gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is she doing here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whispered to Alice
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know; I seriously don't know. She came here with a friend of a friend, and I still cannot believe it. I haven't even talked to her yet cause I'm afraid I'll look like an obsessed fangirl.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked once more at the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha met her gaze from across the room, Rio tried to look relaxed but she couldn't, so she looked away, took one of the champagne glasses and attempted to busy herself with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart beat faster then calmed down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come, I want you to meet some of my friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice walked and Rio followed her. Alice introduced her to some of her friends whom Rio knew she'd forget about by tomorrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal!” A voice filled with amusement came from behind her. She turned her face toward the source, her eyes shining and a smile forming on her lips when she saw Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Gosh, Lilia!”
    </p>
    <p>
     They hugged each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I missed you, kid”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So did I,” Rio said sincerely, she had always loved Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you doing?” Lilia asked
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine. Good, doing good”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia knew she's lying and Rio knew she knew, the older woman always had a way of seeing right through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How is your new project?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio asked, changing the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great. So far, I'm really proud of it. I've been working with this amazing artist. You should meet her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia took Rio's hand in hers and walked her through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart beat louder this time as she got closer to the woman Lilia was talking about and realized who she is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha darling, this is Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes sparked upon hearing Rio's name for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha extended her hand, and Rio hesitated for a brief second before shaking it. Rio's hand trembled after the unexpected connection. She felt Agatha's hand in hers. It was soft, Agatha's hand felt right in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was telling Rio about the project we're working on,” Lilia said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes never left Rio's presence even though Rio refused to meet her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     They talked for a few minutes, mostly it was Agatha and Lilia, because for some reason, Rio couldn't find her own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll leave you girls to know each other, I have dozens of people to see.” Lilia patted Rio on the shoulder and left.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze in her place; if she wanted to move her legs she wouldn't be able to do so. It was as if someone had poured cement on her feet and glued her to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Agatha's gaze so she lifted her head to meet her blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio.” Agatha said her name for the second time, as if she were tasting how it sounded. “Where have we met?”
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio was frozen before, then now she had become a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I–I don't really know.” Rio said, she's such a bad liar and she knows it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think it was 3 days ago,” Agatha said, refusing to change the subject, she's enjoying herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her again, taking her in just as how she had in the bar. Looking at her clothes, a dark blue suit, a black high–necked top and a golden necklace. She realized they were wearing similar shades of blue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked back at Agatha who was already looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where?” Rio finally said, still denying it, because the memory was too embarrassing to handle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “At the bar?” Agatha said with a raised eyebrow and an amused smirk. “And I quote, ‘
     <em>
      Gosh, you're gorgeous.
     </em>
     ’” Agatha said Rio's words while looking directly into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's face turned red, hearing her say it did something to her. Embarrassment flooded her whole being but there was something else—something about Agatha's look and smirk. Something about Agatha's presence. Something about Agatha...
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you I was drunk.” Rio said as she looked at the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, the sound came out rich and sweet. Her laughter made Rio look up at her, Rio smiled in return. The sound of the woman in front of her filled her with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know sweetheart, but I have to tell you, you looked adorable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A pet name and a compliment in the same sentence..
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is not doing well.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you do, Rio?” It felt as if Agatha loved how Rio's name sounded in her mouth—the taste of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm an English professor,” Rio said while shaking her head up and down after sipping from her glass of champagne. She's nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you? No wait, I actually know. My friend Alice told me about you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? I'm an artist, I mostly paint.” Agatha said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It suits you,” Rio felt her tongue slip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How?” Agatha asked with an amused tone.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi, I'm Alice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice interrupted the moment by introducing herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice to meet you. Agatha Harkness.” she said while shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't really know if you remember me, but we met last year in Paris.” Alice said with a nervous smile on her face.“I just wanted to tell you it's actually an honor for me to have you here ms. Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you. The honor is truly mine. It's a really great party you have in here.” Agatha said as she looked at Alice, then at Rio, then back at Alice. “And forgive me for not remembering you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no, I completely understand.” Alice said while smiling foolishly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't help but to stare at the woman in front of her as she talked with her friend. And Agatha seemed to notice because she was looking at Rio every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me but I have to steal Rio for a moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice said and then dragged Rio with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dude, I'm nervous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There's too many people, I should have thought about that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, don't worry. Look it's just for a few moments, you know? Once you propose you'd be lost in the bubble that contains only the both of you and you'll forget about everybody else. But if you're not comfortable with it then just do it in a private place where you'd feel completely comfortable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to do it now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then go get it, tiger!” Rio said grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice looked at her for a few seconds then nodded. “Alright, wish me luck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good luck!”
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that Alice walked toward Jen who was standing among people. Alice looked Jen in the eyes, then took the small black box out, knelt on one knee and opened the box while asking Jen to marry her. Jen said yes, then they kissed, with passion and love. Rio was watching them, admiring the sight of the lovebirds and how happy they are. How happy she is for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're beautiful together.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A voice from beside her said, and it was Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their shoulders are almost touching because of how close they are.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, smiling. “They are.”

    <p>
     Rio arrived at work on time, this was the first time in months. She woke up feeling great, nothing bothered her all morning, not even herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was sitting in her office, doing some work she should have completed months ago. Then her mind drifted back to Agatha. The way they felt so close to each other yet too far away. Rio couldn't really understand this strange connection she felt that linked her to Agatha, or why it even exists. At the party two days ago, she momentarily thought Agatha would give her her number, or mention something, or even ask Rio for hers. But Agatha disappeared after a while, and Rio wasn't even able to look at her eyes one last time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, typing Agatha Harkness' name absentmindedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Results appeared once Rio clicked "enter": photos of the woman, limited information, and her artworks.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at the woman, admiring her sharp features and how she looked perfect in every photo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio Read the information that the internet allowed her to access, but there wasn't much—just some articles that barely contained anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scrolled down, viewing the artworks, there were dozens of them. Each one looks like it possesses a piece of Agatha. They looked like her. Rio wasn't practically invested in paintings, but she could see and feel how every painting screamed Agatha's name—her art style, the colors she uses, the details.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio examined each painting closely, trying to figure out how and why each one was Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She noticed the number of portraits of women and the naked bodies. Some paintings felt intimate, filled with emotions—the angles, the poses, the women in the paintings. Rio found herself wondering if those women were Agatha's partners or her muses, and what they meant to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she looked and saw the painting Alice had in her office. She had always loved that painting and felt a connection to it, something she couldn't quite name but still felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     The picture contained three colors: black, red and a dark shade of gray. It's not obvious what the picture truly represents, what it's about, or why it filled Rio's heart with a sense of remorse every time she looked at it. This one doesn't resemble any painting of Agatha's, it's strangely different, it holds something within its strictly limited details, and Rio was curious to discover what is so special about this piece, why it felt
     <em>
      personal
     </em>
     . She tried to collect the information she had found but it was merely useless.
    </p>
    <p>
     The workday had come to an end, Rio gathered her things and stepped outside the office, meeting Alice in the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, you” Alice greeted with a smile
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Rio replied, mirroring Alice's smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     They walked in silence for a few minutes until Rio broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Um, so, I wanted to ask you about something,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice looked at her to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “About that painting in your office—Agatha's.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you know about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not much really. I bought it years ago, because when I looked at it for the first time, I felt like I should have it. The only thing I know is that it's one of Agatha's earliest works, from when she was in college. She hadn't painted much at the time, yet she refused to show her work to the public—epecially this one. But years after her graduation she started publishing her work. I don't really know what it's about; I don't think that I actually understand the true meaning behind the painting, but it kept growing in me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh” was the only response Rio could master.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, you should ask Lilia, she definitely knows something—if not everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then seconds of silence enveloped them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What were you two talking about, anyway?” Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You and Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, nothing really,” Rio paused. “Lilia introduced me to her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Because, I think that woman was looking at you—like really looking at you.” Alice said, enjoyment filling her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared into space, thinking about what Alice's aiming at. Moments of silence followed her words as they reached the parking lot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you mean?” Rio asked after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know, but I felt something there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ali, you're delusional.” Rio replied and got into her car without looking back at Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We'll see about that! See you!” Alice was practically screaming at that point.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only laughed and started the engine, pretending that Alice's conclusions did not matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't go home; instead she stayed outside the walls of her empty, depressing house.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gifted herself a proper meal, considering it a self–date, because she needed that and she had already begun forgetting what real food actually tasted like.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once at home, she collapsed onto the couch after taking off her shoes and jacket. The dimly lit living room was forcing Rio to close her eyes but after a brief second she forced them open. “No, not today Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she stood on her feet and headed to the bathroom, taking the quiet, warm bath that she deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wrapped herself in a towel, went back to her bedroom and grabbed the same oversized t–shirt that she always found comfort in wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat on the bed, “What should I do now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing was in her head to waste the remaining time of the day. She thought about calling Alice and going out for some drinks but it was too early for that, instead she called Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello?” There was some noise in Lilia's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, kid. Nice hearing your voice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed. “Are you busy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not really, do you want something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I thought, do you want to go out?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah sure why not. Are you hungry?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, not really”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay then, just give me an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright.”
    </p>
    <p>
     So she got up, put on some clothes: a t–shirt, a jacket, and trousers, did her hair, applied her makeup on, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drove to the café where she was supposed to meet Lilia, and she was already there.
    </p>
    <p>
     They hugged once Rio approached her, then she sat, facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you doing?” Lilia asked
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine, good. What about you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great. Here, I got you your coffee.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks. And yours?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nope, no caffeine for me darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They talked for a while, talking about their lives recently though there wasn't much to talk about really.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wanted to ask you something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia looked at her “Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “About that painting of Agatha Harkness,
     <em>
      Black: My True Love's Hear
     </em>
     t.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know. I just feel something when I look at it, something strange. I asked Alice about it today but she didn't know much about it.” Rio paused, took a sip from her cup. “She said you probably know something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I maybe do. Well, the painting is really personal to Agatha. When I asked her about it when we first met years ago, her facial expressions changed upon mentioning it. She said the painting was never meant to be left exposed to the public's eyes and opinions, but she was in deep need of money. She didn't talk about the process of painting it or what it means, but she said it's her most spiritual work, and it defines her the most.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio listened to Lilia carefully, afraid of missing a detail.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is she always that mysterious?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, always. She doesn't let anybody in. And her intensity makes her the great artist that she is. Honestly, she's one of the greatest artists I've ever worked with.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, now Rio is left with no answers but more questions, and she needed something to quell her curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     They talked for a while about nothing and everything all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now, you should take me home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn't come in your car?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I took a cab, but since you're here, I'm depending on you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, you're taking advantage of me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly, but I'll cook you dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled and got up from her chair, and Lilia followed her movements.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Once Rio stopped the car in front of Lilia's house, Lilia said, “Agatha is staying with me for a few days until she finds the apartment that she wants, she...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus, Lilia, why are you telling me this now?” Rio said, absolutely stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? I didn't think it would be a problem,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed, “It's not, but you could have told me before.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I forgot,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you didn't. You want me to meet her, again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut up, Sherlock.” Lilia said as she took off her seatbelt. “Anyway, she doesn't live in Los Angeles; she settles in Paris, so she's staying with me for now,” Lilia said and got out of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was absolutely shocked because, damn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia knocked on the window telling Rio to get out, and so she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia opened the door and motioned for Rio to step inside. She was nervous, an anxiety rush traveled through her entire body and settled in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     They got in and Rio sat on the couch, there was no sign of Agatha, which was good—now she could breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want something to drink dear?” Lilia called from the kitchen
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up and followed her there.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh God, yes please!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here,” Lilia said as she handed her a glass of red wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     They returned to the living room and sat opposite each other. They were talking about something but Rio's mind couldn't really focus on the conversation, she's thinking about Agatha who still hadn't shown any sign of showing up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright?” Lilia asked with a concerned tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. Yeah, totally—I just zoned out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the door swung open. Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes immediately found hers once she turned around, and Agatha did the same thing. Seeing Rio, a stunned expression overtook her face for a brief second, but she quickly replaced it with a smile, and Rio noticed that, how could she not?
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just went out to buy something,” Agatha said, speaking with Lilia while looking at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Rio here is staying for dinner,” Lilia said also looking at Rio, too much gazing on her direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio realized that she was also staring, so she sprang to her feet, took a few steps toward Agatha, and extended her hand. Agatha shook it gladly,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice seeing you again, Rio.” Agatha said. This time she wasn't tasting the sound of her name, she was devouring it with great pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Likewise,” Rio replied, then withdraw her hand from Agatha's and sat back down on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me for a few minutes ladies,” Agatha said, glancing at Lilia and then back at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take your time darling,” Lilia replied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Agatha walked away toward what Rio assumed was her room in Lilia's house.
    </p>
    <p>
     And 6 minutes later, she returned, Rio counted the seconds. Of course she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was wearing an oversized earthy green button–up shirt and black sweatpants. Rio found herself looking at her and Agatha seemed to notice that too.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked like she was considering the options, whether to sit beside Rio or Lilia, she ended up choosing Lilia's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you girls want for dinner?” Lilia asked, looking at them both.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anything really,” Rio replied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Chicken Florentine Pasta that you made the other day? I can still taste it, so I'd very much love to eat it again!” Agatha said enthusiastically while looking at Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great, easy and delicious.” Lilia said in approval.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio then looked at Lilia, then her gaze drifted to Agatha and the open buttons of her shirt, and of course Agatha noticed. She threw an unreadable smirk toward Rio. So Rio tried to busy herself with the last sip of wine that was left in her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     A minute later, Agatha got up, went to the kitchen, and came back with two glasses filled with wine. Agatha approached Rio and handed her a glass then took the empty one and set it aside. She looked at Rio then clinked her glass to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cheers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cheers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both looked at each other as they took their first sip, brown met blue and assorted with it for a fleeting moment, then Agatha looked away and sat back down on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia broke the silence that embraced the three of them “Alright girls, I'm going to make us dinner, you rest here,” and with that she left, leaving Rio alone with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence that embraced them seconds ago now started to choke Rio, but Agatha loosened its grip on Rio's throat with that sweet voice of hers, rich with depth. A one–word question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, confused.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You said at the party that what I do suits me. I asked you 'how?' but I didn't get the chance to hear your answer.” Agatha said with a smirk, then took a sip from her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Does this woman always start her conversations with such intensity?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Yeah because you left
     </em>
     .” Rio thought to herself, but of course she didn't say that, that was a forbidden territory.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've got an incredible memory.” Rio said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “One of my blessings.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's mind paused longer than necessary, she can't think of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, how?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's just, you know, it suits you. I can't really imagine you being in a normal job or anything else.” a pause. “Being an artist I mean, it suits you. You, you look artistic. I mean, yeah, like a painting.” The words slipped from her tongue and it's to late. That should have stayed in her head. Rio realized the words that came out of her mouth and drank what was left in her glass, which was the whole glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Easy there.” Agatha said, looking at Rio with intensity and something more—so much more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The empty glass now resting in her hand. Looking back at Agatha, their eyes locked and neither of them looked away, as if they both were daring each other, testing the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt herself stuck here. In this place. With this woman. Part of her wants to stay because it feels so good to be stuck with her. But she also isn't able to handle it, to handle all those unexplainable things—the floating emotions, and the charged atmosphere. The way Agatha is looking at her, the woman's eyes are seductive—an ocean of blue that Rio is willing to be drowned in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm gonna see if Lilia needs anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      An escape.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, she left her spot on the couch and walked toward the kitchen, she could still feel Agatha's eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you need anything?” Rio asked, still feeling awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia looked at her, “No darling, I told you to rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't really need to.” Rio paused, “I'm gonna be outside for a minute.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, no, I'm fine, I just need a smoke.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal, when did you start smoking again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Five days ago, Lilia Calderu.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Kid, don't do that to yourself!” Lilia said, pointing a spoon at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay” Rio said with a chuckle as she left the kitchen. She heard Lilia's sigh
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She was heading to the front door when a voice made her stop,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Going somewhere?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Um, no, I just need a cigarette.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you mind if I join you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They smoked in silence, the sound of burning paper filling their ears. The chill breeze added a layer of intensity. They both wanted to say something to break the silence, but neither did. They only looked at each other, their eyes filled with intensity, unspoken words, and a hanging promise
    </p>
    <p>
     When they went back inside, Lilia saw them, like if she had caught some kids sneaking out,
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just want to know why people don't care about their health.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at Rio and they both laughed without responding.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They were all chatting in the kitchen, helping Lilia, talking about things. Rio found it easy to talk with Agatha if someone else was there with them, things felt less awkward and Rio could find her own voice. But every time their eyes met, Rio remained silent, no matter what the topic was or what they were talking about, and it also didn't matter if she was in the middle of a sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was saying something about some college students when her eyes met Agatha's, and Rio became quiet all of a sudden. It felt as if Agatha's eyes were a maze and she was lost in them, unable to find the entrance or the exit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, are you alright?” Lilia's voice brought her back,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, absolutely.” She paused, and took the plates. “I'm gonna take these.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She placed them on the table, took a deep breathe then turned around to go back to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you okay?” This time it was Agatha. Agatha's voice. Agatha's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, just a, um, just a headache.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia came to join them with a bottle of wine in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat, and of course Agatha would sit facing her;
     <em>
      of course she would.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is so good, Lilia,” Rio said
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly! It's so good.” Agatha said in affirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They ate while talking about things here and there, Rio felt good here, between these two.
    </p>
    <p>
     by the third glass of wine, Rio was completely drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia left to do something—Rio didn't really know what. She wasn't paying attention.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you staring at me?” Rio asked, almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not staring at you.” Agatha said in her normal tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you are. You're staring at me.” Rio insisted, still whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what If I'm really staring at you? Is it a problem?” Agatha replied, matching Rio's tone. She waited for Rio's response with a smirk on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Rio said after a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow at that, and the smirk never left her face. “Yeah? And what is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It makes me drunk, the way you stare at me... I mean, yeah, this is, um, this is my fifth glass, but um, but it's different. It's not the alcohol,” Rio said while leaning in the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're adorable, you know that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Agatha was also drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I know” Rio said, grinning and Agatha laughed at that. She really is adorable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like your painting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Which one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The one that makes me feel guilty and sad.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Guilty and sad? Which one is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know Agatha,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes widened upon hearing her name from Rio for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me which one when we're both sober.” She said after a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will do ma'am”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Lilia came back they were wasted. She tried to make Rio stay the night but Rio refused, so Lilia called a cab for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her jacket and stepped outside; it was a cold night.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, give me your phone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A voice from behind made her open her eyes. She turned around and handed her phone to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put down her number, “There, just in case.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      In case of what?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled at her, and got into the cab, going home.

      Hey guys!
      <br/>
      I want to say something.
      <br/>
      I'm not really used to writing slow burns, and I'm not actually used to writing anything, but I need to get this idea out of my system.
      <br/>
      Well, English isn't my first language so I have to re–read the chapters until I'm sick of them, and everytime I re–read one, I find a mistake or a misspelling, and that makes me feel really weird, but I'd appreciate it if you guys could just ignore them, please bear with me. Also, I don't know where this is going, but I hope I can write what I have in my head and describe it properly, but trust me we'll get there.

     Rio stared at the ringing phone. She had called five times already, and it was midnight. The noisy sound disappeared for a few seconds as her phone remained on the table. She took a deep breath and exhaled through her nose. She was furious. Only seconds later, her phone rang again, illuminating the dark room and disturbing the peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      6 Missed Calls, 3 New Messages
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck do you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Woah, someone's in a bad mood, I see.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gritted her teeth, her blood was boiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you? A child? Do you know what time it is?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I know. I'm also aware that you've never been a good sleeper, so I figured you'd be awake.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's tongue poked the inside of her cheek. Her left hand clenched into a fist by her side, she was ready to kill someone with her bare hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you didn't take a hint when I didn't respond? What the fuck do you want, anyway?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need to talk to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “About what? What is there between you and me that we need to talk about? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh come on, Rio. Don't you miss me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't. To the point that If I saw your corpse lying on the street, I'd fucking dance on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on baby, don't be like that...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not your fucking baby, don't you ever dare call me that. Ever!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, okay, just let me talk to you this once,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you, there's nothing between us to talk about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know. Just meet me this once—just this time, I want to talk to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say it now. What do you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, fuck you.” Rio said and hung up.
    </p>
    <p>
     She ran a hand through her dark hair, frustration running through her entire body. She wetted her lips and stood in her place for a while. Then she drank a glass of water in one swig and went to sit on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That fucking bitch.” Rio muttered, resting her head between her hands. She always disturbed her peace, always dragged her back to the beginning, always found a way to twist a knife in her back. Always.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at the time, just a few hours until sunrise. The evening had gone to waste, and she hadn't gotten a single minute of sleep. It felt like she was trapped in a box—one that fit her perfectly, so tightly that she couldn't even stretch her body, and that box would close and open from time to time, but now, it was shut. No light. No oxygen. Nothing. She couldn't get out. Something—or rather, someone—was choking her for their own pleasure, releasing her throat whenever they pleased. And Rio just couldn't escape, trapped and suffocated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Morning came, and the sun rose. The sound of birds singing—or maybe cursing, the cold morning breeze, the chatter of people, the world filled with life. It irritated Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes burned. Her headache was tearing her apart. She had tried to sleep, but her mind hadn't rested for even a second. Right now, her only wish was to sleep and sleep and sleep. Maybe sleep and never wake up again. She feels like shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got up from the couch with a sigh, an exhausted and a heavy one, and dragged her feet upstairs. She stood in the doorway, looking at the bed. God, it looked so comfortable. She couldn't resist it, so she crashed onto the mattress, burying her face in the pillows. Another day, another canceled classes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't know how many hours had passed when she woke up, confused. She thought she heard a loud knocking at the door. She got up, more irritated than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     She quickly washed her face, then went downstairs, approaching the front door, she opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there she was. Who else would disturb and ruin her night and morning but her? No one. Not a single human being.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck are you doing at my door? Are you fucking kidding me? Seriously?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh fuck off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just let me in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you insane? Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you? Do you want me to call the police?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Rio, what’s wrong with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, hard and loud, shaking her head in mock disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with me? Are you joking?” She said, unable to believe the irony of the situation
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me in. I'm freezing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, say what you want right here because this is the only chance you get.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine.” Jane paused. “I'm pregnant.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? I'm sure it's not mine.” Rio said, smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish it was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you don't, cut the crap, Jane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do.” Jane stepped forward, closer to Rio. “I want to raise it with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stay right where you are,” Rio said pointing at her ex–girlfriend. “Don't you dare playing this shit with me. You want sympathy? Find it elsewhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio. Please.” Her ex–girlfriend begged, stepping closer and closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only looked at her, gritting her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jane leaned closer, trying to touch Rio's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go fuck yourself Jane. I don't want to see your face in my life ever again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your really won't give me an another chance?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To do what? Act like a bitch all over again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her ex–girlfriend didn't say a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, “Leave me alone.” Then she stepped inside, and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned her back against it, trying to steady her breathing. “
     <em>
      You did well, Rio. You had to say that.
     </em>
     ” She reassured herself through inhales and exhales. Rio didn't glance back at the door to see if her ex–girlfriend was gone or not. It didn't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     She went to the kitchen and made herself a cup of coffee, a mixture of feelings running through her, messing with her head. Just yesterday, she was fine—she was great, even—and as if her ex–girlfriend sensed it so she came like a storm to ruin her life all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pregnant.” Rio muttered as she took a sip of her coffee. The bitter taste stung her tongue, but it did wonders to calm her head, even if just for a bit.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Most of the day passed. The sun began to set while Rio lay on the couch. She went from one panic attack to an another, and in between, she regretted her entire life—every decision she had ever made. But worst of them all, falling in love with that woman and letting her ruin her, as if she had been blindfolded the entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She forced herself up from the couch after a battle with her own head.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had to get out from here. This house was holding her captive, making her even more miserable than she already was. She had once lived in love, surrounded by these walls. Now, they mocked her—laughing at how stupid she was. Even the walls knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wore some clothes without putting much thought into it, she was in her casual state now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heading downstairs, she caught sight of the wine bottle resting on the kitchen island. She poured herself a glass, then stared at it. A glass filled with wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha handing her a glass, looking at her mysteriously—with mischief and so much more. From now on, red wine means Agatha. Red wine is Agatha. Agatha's eyes. Agatha's smirk. Agatha's intensity. Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally took a sip. The acidic taste of the wine lingered on her tongue as she stared at the glass for a few more seconds. Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why was that woman in her head? Since when did wine remind her of someone? Since when did she think about someone she knew nothing about? Since when did she miss the way someone looked at her? And the strangest thing of them all—why did she think about Agatha to begin with? Why did she think about her almost everyday since she first saw her?
    </p>
    <p>
     She studied the glass in her hand, looking at it closely. Then she poured the rest of the wine into her mouth, letting the burning sensation take over her senses for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio drove in silence, humming along to the song playing from the car stereo. A cigarette rested between her fingers. She had no idea where she was going, she was just driving, trying to reach any destination that would distract her from herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fifteen minutes later, she found herself parked outside a nightclub.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembered what she had told Alice days ago: “
     <em>
      Out where Alice? Bars? Clubs? Drinking all night and trying to pour my sadness and suffering into any girl's mouth?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Irony of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now.... Now, it felt right. Now, it felt right to pour her sadness and suffering into someone's mouth. Now, was the right time to forget herself. To lose it all. Maybe it wasn't the best decision, maybe it was wrong, and maybe it is wrong. But it also felt right, it felt right to make someone else swallow her misery.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got inside, and the neon lights welcomed her sight. The loud music, the smell of alcohol, sweat, and perfumes. Too many people. Normally, she'd turn around and go rot in her house, but it was already too late for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour passed, and she was two cocktails in. She stared at the ice in her glass when a dark–haired woman sat beside her at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her for a second. “Hi.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “On me,” the woman said as she pushed the cocktail closer to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks” Rio said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing her alone? Someone as beautiful as you...” The woman said as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, Rio only responded with a sidelong smile and took a sip from her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you enjoying your time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not much,” Rio said as she took the woman's hand off her cheek. “Not a fan of too much unnecessary touching.” She said then got up. “Excuse me,” and left.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back to the dance floor, her eyes were wandering around. Then, she saw her—Agatha—at the back of the crowd with a woman younger than her by her side, too close to each other. Agatha's thumb stroking the exposed back of the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sight was agonizing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood still in the middle of the dancing crowd, looking at Agatha. The smirk that appeared on Agatha's lips when the woman whispered something in her ear gave Rio goosebumps. The way Agatha's body swayed with the music, a drink in her hand while the other kept touching that blonde's back... Rio could only stare. She hadn't thought of Agatha as someone who went to clubs and enjoyed loud music and neon lights. But then again, what did she even know about Agatha? Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know nothing about her Rio.” She said, scolding herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she kept looking at her, feeling like a creep, she imagined Agatha instead of that dark–haired woman at the bar, or herself by Agatha's side instead of that blonde woman. Then, as if she sensed it, Agatha found her eyes. From the distance. The lights went out for a brief second, then came back on. Agatha's eyes were still on her. The smirk on her face disappeared and was replaced by a shocked expression. She was stunned by seeing Rio, just as much as Rio was stunned by seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the music stopped, Rio felt Agatha coming closer to her through the crowd. Agatha approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” She said, and that smirk returned to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They looked at each other, then both decided to get away from the noise. Rio was surprised that the blonde woman didn't follow Agatha, good.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat at the bar, and neither of them looked away, as if they were searching each other's eyes for answers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing here?” Rio asked, breaking the silence. Her tone was sharper than she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You gotta try LA clubs when you're here,” Agatha said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, you're right.” Rio said as she mirrored Agatha's smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seconds of silence passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing here...” Agatha paused, taking a sip from her glass. “By your own?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Blowing off some steam.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mmm.” Agatha hummed as she looked at Rio, she looked tired, more than any other time Agatha had seen her before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright?” Agatha asked, trying to sound as casual as possible to avoid scaring Rio off, but there was real concern behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha's lips for a brief moment, then met her blue eyes. She stayed quiet for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't have to answer that.” Agatha said, breaking the uncomfortable silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's okay. It's just some personal issues.... um, relationship issues.” Rio said as her eyes kept roaming over Agatha's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you're not single?” Agatha's tone sounded a bit disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no, I am single.” She said as she looked at Agatha, the glittery mini black dress just above her thigh, the black high heels, her milky skin, the red lipstick, her silver earrings and necklace, her dark wavy hair, and her piercing blue eyes. She stared for a long time, almost lost herself in the woman's face and body.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cleared her throat, when she looked back at Agatha. Agatha's smirk was deeper now, something wicked even.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about you?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your blonde partner back there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, she's not my partner.” A sip. “I'm not into blondes.” She said as she leaned closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to stay still, acting cool, but she could feel her pulse in her ears. Agatha sitting, facing her, so casually, while she looks devastatingly gorgeous. The alcohol had finally gotten into her head, and, gosh she wanted to kiss those lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—I noticed that in the women in your paintings. They were all dark–haired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmm, you noticed?” Agatha said with a low chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed like that for a few minutes. Looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to get out of here?” Agatha asked, looking at Rio, directly into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To my studio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her for a few seconds, then she lowered her voice. “What's in there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seemed to be counting what Rio could possibly find in her studio,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, wine, paintings and.... me” Agatha finished her sentence with a sideways smirk. Rio's eyes were shining in anticipation at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They drove separately to the destination, and Agatha arrived there first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed the door open and stepped inside. It was a large, open space, filled with both finished and unfinished paintings, art supplies scattered everywhere, large windows, wooden floors, and white walls. The dim lighting added the perfect touch to the studio's ambience.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, thank you, it's nothing really, but I'm trying to get used to it for now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio noticed the pillows and blanket thrown on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you stay here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seemed to hesitate before answering the question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not exactly, but I'm trying to not intrude on Lilia, so I stay here some nights. I—I still didn't find the place that I'm looking for.” She said after a few seconds of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took in the space, looked around, and a painting caught her attention—the one Agatha was standing in front of.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me get the wine.” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood in front of it and removed the white sheet, the painting was only half covered. And Rio gasped as she looked at it. It was her, her face, her features. Rio was in that painting. She couldn't believe her eyes, so she turned around to look at Agatha who was pouring them two glasses of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, then walked forward to hand Rio the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, urging her to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just—I couldn't get your face out of my head that night,” Agatha said, looking at Rio, who was still looking at her, seeking the truth behind why Agatha was painting her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That night at the bar. I tried to paint your face out of my memory. I tried to paint what I remembered. Your face just stuck in my head.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was stunned by what she was hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your memory is really incredible, because this looks exactly like me,” Rio said while pointing at the painting. Stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
     She steeped closer to it, touching it, feeling it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry about it though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why? No, I like it, a lot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Absolutely. It's perfect. But see,” Rio said, pointing at her face then at the painting, “My nose is a bit different than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, low and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I could paint you so much better if I could look at you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her while grinning widely.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a sip from her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'd love to pose for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I'd love to paint you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes connected, a connection that felt eternal—nothing could disturb or ruin it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped closer to Agatha, their faces only a few inches apart. Agatha's scent filled her senses, and their eyes were still locked together. Agatha reached for Rio's cheek, stroking it gently with her thumb, as if she couldn't believe the woman in front of her. Rio looked at her lips then back to her eyes—those piercing blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned into the touch and closed her eyes briefly, then opened them to see Agatha's face closer to hers. Then Agatha's lips crashed into hers, kissing her with intensity, as if she had been waiting for Rio for decades. Rio closed her eyes, feeling Agatha's mouth consume her entirely, as her thumb kept stroking her cheekbone. The taste of Agatha lingered in her mouth, sending shivers down Rio's spine. She could feel the heat radiating from Agatha's body, and her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just then, Rio opened her mouth to let Agatha's tongue slide in. Agatha's hand abandoned her face and rested on the back of Rio’s neck, urging her closer—as if it was possible to consume her even more. Their tongues fought inside Rio's mouth, Agatha tilted her head slightly and took Rio's tongue in her mouth entirely, sucking it with hunger and lust, the taste of wine and something else, making Rio's head dizzy. Her body numbed and had begun to lose control, her hand found Agatha's hip, and rested there, depending on it to keep her in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was devouring Rio at this point, eating her mouth out of her face. The intensity of it all, the way Agatha was pouring herself entirely into Rio's mouth, was overwhelming. Rio's body was burning, soon to turn into ashes, desire running through every part of her. Just then, in the middle of it all, Agatha pulled back as she removed her hand from Rio's neck. They were panting, trying to get air inside their lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry.” Agatha said, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, confusion written all over her face as she tried to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For what?” Rio said, looking at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry, for this—I lost myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you apologizing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ran a hand through her hair as her chest rose and fell. Rio looked at her, frustration and hurt flickering across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're both drunk, Rio. I'm sorry, you should leave, we will—we'll talk about this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha. Her jaw clenching.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, cool.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Rio headed toward the door and left.

    <p>
     Rio left Agatha's studio and got into her car, driving as fast as she could despite her drunken state. She almost got into an accident because of her reckless driving—or maybe she wanted to get into an accident, because no physical pain could overpower what she was feeling. The weight of everything had finally caught up to her, the way nothing had ever worked out for her. Tears fell down on her face, blurring her vision even more.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just wants to reach home. That depressing place is where she wants to be right now, her only destination. At least there, she could hate her existence in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lost her way. Her mind was too occupied to think about the right route home. She looked around, reading the signs, but she wasn't even able to focus properly. Her phone lit up beside her—someone was calling. She parked in the closest lot she could find and grabbed her phone, her fingers shaking as they hovered over the screen, trying to enter the password correctly. Lilia called her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, dear, where are you? Are you alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sucked in a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I'm—I'm fine, just on my way home. Do you want anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She said, running a hand through her hair, she sounded drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha told me you're drunk and driving. Tell me where you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cried at the mention of Agatha's name. She covered the phone's speaker while trying to collect herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio? Hello? Where are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm here, I'm fine Lilia, I'm fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She said, crying, unable to hold it inside any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just tell me where you are, I'll come and get you, Rio. Just tell me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know where I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look around you dear. Turn on your GPS.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can't, Lilia. I can't. I just can't do this. I can't see anything. I can't, Lilia.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And there, she lost it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio...
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     That wasn't Lilia. It was Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, do you hear me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was crying, leaning her head on the steering wheel, clutching the phone close to her ear, listening to Agatha's voice laced with concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha... Agatha... Agatha... Agatha...
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She finally opened her mouth to say something, but ended up with whispering the woman's name with a shaky breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not mad at you, you know? I'm just mad. So, excuse me m’lady—I'm gonna hang up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And that she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truth be told, she wasn't mad at Agatha. How could she be? But the fact that her life had been so shitty lately, the way nothing seemed to work out—she couldn't even pour her misery into somebody else's glass. She couldn't do that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone rang several times.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was midnight. She looked around one more time then called Alice, the phone rang for a few seconds before she picked up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello?” She sounded half–asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, Ali, did I wake you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio? No, no. What's up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you come and get me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why? Where are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, just come and get me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She stayed inside the car. The parking lot was empty. She leaned her head against the steering wheel, feeling her heart pounding faster than ever. A throbbing sensation grew in her head, a second heartbeat pulsing in her skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had to get out twice to vomit her soul out, the nausea in her stomach faded for a few seconds, only to return stronger than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour later, Alice arrived there with Jen. Rio was aware that she had disturbed their peace and she made a mental note to apologize about it later.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, hey, I've got you.” Alice said, gently helping Rio into the passenger seat of her own car so Alice could drive them both home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen followed behind in Alice's car.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They got to Alice's house and Rio recognized it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, take me home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shhh, I'll take you there in the morning. You need to rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't have the energy to argue, so she just accepted it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice took her to the guest room, and Rio immediately crashed onto the bed. Alice helped her out of her jacket and shoes while Rio mumbled a ‘Thank you’.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rest now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And her eyes were already closed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She slept most of the day and only woke when she heard Alice calling her name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thank God it was Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes, realizing where she was—and who was standing above her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Alice said with that sweet smile of hers—the one that sparked and brightened everything around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her for a few seconds, trying to piece together last night's events.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Alice, I'm sorry.” Rio said as she leaned against the headboard. Her body ached, and the headache was the worst kind—the kind where she could feel every nerve in her head pulsing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't apologize Rio. Go wash up and come eat.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And she did. She washed her face and went to the dining room, where Alice and Jen were already seated.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at them, “Guys, I'm really sorry about last night, I didn't mean to—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, just get your ass in here. We'll talk about this later.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't eat. Her mind was crowded with thoughts and memories, which turned into a nauseating sensation that settled in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why aren't you eating?” Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her. “I'm not hungry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio..”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not hungry, Alice,” She said, keeping her voice low.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. How are you feeling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good, I guess. I just need coffee.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio noticed the way Alice and Jen exchanged a concerned glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, I'll make you some coffee.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's okay Ali. Seriously, I'm fine, I can make my own coffee.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She got up, taking her full plate with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just wants to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to talk about last night?” Alice asked, sitting on the couch, facing Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Rio said, clapping her hands against her thighs. “I'm sorry about last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Rio, not this. Don't apologize.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to.” Rio looked at Alice. “Where is Jen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's working upstairs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh. Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio... I don't want to push you. I don't want to put pressure on you. I don't want you to get hurt. But, Rio, when I saw you last night, I almost didn't recognize you. What happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, unsure how to respond. She always hated looking vulnerable—it embarrassed her. For a long time she had balanced everything, allowing herself to be vulnerable only when she was alone. Moments like these always caught her off guard, and she knew she had to answer at some point.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know Alice. I just lost myself, that's all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know you were saying Agatha's name the whole time on the way home?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked back up at Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did she do something to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no. I was just stupid. I just acted like a teenager that's all. And I drank too much last night. She has nothing to do with this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, just take care of yourself. Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will, Ali. Don't worry about me. And I'm sorry about yesterday, tell Jen I'm sorry.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     She got home. The moment she stepped inside, the familiar atmosphere wrapped around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She crashed onto the couch immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her phone, reading the same message over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     An unknown number, but she knew who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Hi Rio, did you arrive home yesterday? Are you alright?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had sent it hours ago. Rio stared at it, thinking of a response, then the three dots appeared—then disappeared. Twice.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Yes, I'm home now. Thank you for your concern.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Formal, but it will do.
    </p>
    <p>
     How was she supposed talk to Agatha anyway? As a friend? A stranger? Or as someone who had kissed her senseless the night before, only to send her away when she ‘
     <em>
      lost herself
     </em>
     ’?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Can I call you?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at the message longer than necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes or no? Was it really that simple? Yes or no?
    </p>
    <p>
     What would they even talk about?
    </p>
    <p>
     But oh god, she wanted to hear her voice—that sweet voice of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Yes. It's okay, I don't mind.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, formal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seconds later, her phone rang.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi, Rio.” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sensed something in her voice. It was lower, almost a whisper, like she was afraid of revealing what her voice really sounded like.
    </p>
    <p>
     But her voice is enough to make Rio sit up straight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi.”
    </p>
    <p>
     An uncomfortable silence stretched between them. Rio could hear Agatha breathing—her breaths uneven. She waited for Agatha to say something. Anything. The silence was killing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you okay, Agatha?” Rio found herself asking. She was worried about Agatha—a woman she knew nothing about—yet, she could feel her. She could feel her hesitation, could picture the look in Agatha's eyes right now. She could feel Agatha running through her veins, a strange sensation. Or maybe it was just the hangover.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm fine, are you?” Agatha's voice was deeper now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought about the question. Something inside her urged her to tell Agatha everything, to talk to her for hours and hours, but she couldn't, she just couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm better now. I mean... yes, I'm good. Don't worry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, Rio...
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed her name, and a shiver ran through Rio as the hairs on her body stood on end. She found herself unable to coherent words. Hearing her name laced with exhaustion, wrapped in a sigh, and out of Agatha's mouth did something to her—it sent her heart racing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She placed a hand on her chest. She had felt this kind of heartbeat before—during panic attacks—but she wasn't panicking. She was melting, becoming one with the couch beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it? Goddamn it” Rio muttered to herself, pressing her hand harder against her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to say something to Agatha. Anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like the way you say my name.”
    </p>
    <p>
     No. Goddamn it. That wasn't it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smacked her forehead. Too late.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like how it sounds in my mouth. I like your name, Rio.” Agatha said, breathing through every word.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Her mouth...
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had tasted her mouth yesterday. How sweet it was—the way Agatha's lips had taken hers on a journey she wouldn't forget no matter what. The way Agatha kissed her with heat and hunger, devouring her, leaving her breathless and speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted that mouth on hers again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The memory of the kiss flooded Rio, making her mouth water.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let you leave yesterday like that..” Agatha said, breaking the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No it's not. Please, just let me finish.” Agatha's tone was firm, then she sighed
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry for being a dick. You didn't deserve that. I hope I can make it up to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, it's really okay, I appreciate it, but look—it wasn't your fault. I kinda of rushed into it.” Rio paused for a moment, “I just haven't been myself lately, so... it has nothing to do with you.” She said as she ran a hand through her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither of them spoke for a while, just listening to each other breathing. As if they were afraid of saying something, of stepping inside, of trespassing on each other's space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sitting in silence, knowing Agatha was on the other end of the line, gave Rio a strange sense of safety—of presence. Just the thought that Agatha was actually there, made her heartbeat slow in a way she hadn't experienced before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'd like to see you. I
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to see you,” Agatha finally said, after what felt like an eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'd like to see you too,” Rio responded immediately, without thinking much about it. Her heart pounded faster, sending a delightful sensation through her—one she hadn't felt in ages.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio was nervous. She shouldn't have agreed to see Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing her after last night, after that kiss...
    </p>
    <p>
     And God, her memory had never been kind to her, because now she remembered the nonsense she had mumbled in the car—whispering Agatha's name like a mantra through the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was she that teenager in

      Call Me By Your Name
     </em>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Why was she acting like a lovesick girl with a forbidden crush that will lead to a doomed fate?
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed to pull herself together, she's a grown woman for god's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
     She has kissed women before, plenty of them, whether she was drunk or sober, mourning or rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
     But none of them had felt like Agatha. No pair of lips had tasted like hers—that heated, drunken kiss that lasted for... God, she didn't even know how long. It made her feel alive in a way she couldn't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everytime her mind drifted back to the memory, an electric wave swept through her entire body.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared at her wardrobe for a long time, trying to pick something that feels right—something that wasn't too much, but not too little.
    </p>
    <p>
     She settled on a white button–down blouse with a slightly open neckline, a gray jacket, and a high–waisted gray trousers with a black belt that had a gold buckle. Gold hoop earrings. And
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared at her reflection in the full length mirror, that will do. She told herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio drove to the place where she was supposed to meet Agatha. She parked her car and stayed in it for a while, preparing herself to see Agatha again—meeting her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she got inside, she couldn't see Agatha anywhere, thinking she must have arrived early.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked around, searching for the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have a reservation, ma'am?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at the man, she was about to answer no and leave when—
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Agatha Harkness,” a voice from behind her said. “Sorry for making you wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned to look at her, and there was a smile on Agatha's face—a smile she hadn't seen before. It was stripped of all the usual teasing and intensity. It was beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kept looking at her as she smiled in return. An oversized beige suit, a high–necked top, golden necklace and earrings—she looked gorgeous.
    </p>
    <p>
     They held each other's gaze for a moment before Agatha led them toward their table. As they walked, Agatha's hand briefly rested on Rio's waist before she pulled it away. Rio noticed the rush in the way Agatha had pulled her hand, she looked at her, but Agatha didn't look back.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat, facing each other. Their eyes spoke volumes while their tongues remained tied.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look beautiful,” Agatha said, taking a sip of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you.” Rio felt herself blusing, a detail did not go unnoticed by Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look beautiful. Like, really beautiful.” Rio said, looking into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They spent the evening talking but themselves, sharing fragments of their lives but nothing too personal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt safe in Agatha's presence, as if she were embraced—even though Agatha hadn't touched her at all.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, now I'll ask you a question that you have to answer, and you'll ask me something in return,” Rio said, grinning widely. “Deal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated for a brief second. “Deal.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's that painting about?” Rio asked, watching Agatha's face, her features were so calming to look at. “
     <em>
      Black: My True Love's Heart.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stopped in the middle of taking a sip from her glass as soon as she heard the name of the painting Rio was asking about. And just as Lilia had said, her expressions changed into something unreadable—something Rio hadn't seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha set her glass down, looking at Rio's face, searching for something there. She remained silent for a while, and Rio waited eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That painting is... something personal,” Agatha said, pausing to drink what was left in her glass. “I painted it in college. I was a mess back then. Didn't know what I was doing or why.” She was looking at Rio then looked away, staring at the empty glass in front of her. “I had issues back then—all kinds—but mostly with my... ah, my mother. I stayed the worst version of myself for years because of her. I never knew what I should do. I always aimed to please her because I thought I'd be worth something if I could change her opinion about me—the way she saw me. But it didn't work out. Unfortunately or fortunately... honestly, I don't know.” She let out a chuckle, laced with awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes remained locked on her, breathing slowly, listening to every word that left Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She always said I had a black heart—unloveable, worthless— a sack of shit. That the only person who could ever love me was someone with a heart to match mine—
     <em>
      a black one
     </em>
     . So, the painting... I don't really know how to talk about it. I—I never thought I'd talk about it to anyone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, she looked into Rio's eyes, as if something in them encouraged her to keep talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never even finished it. I was an addict at the time, a complete mess—whatever you want to call it, really. Half the time, I wasn't even aware I was painting it. So, ah... yeah. A few months after that, my mother committed suicide, leaving nothing behind but her will and a letter describing how I made her life a living hell.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled again, and Rio looked at her, an
     <em>
      I am sorry
     </em>
     resting on the tip of her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, so, I completed the painting after her death. I felt guilty, yes, but after she was gone, I was free—like I was breathing for the first time. I don't know if that makes me sound like horrible person.” An awkward laugh followed that as Agatha refilled their glasses. “So, you could say the first half of the painting was me being held captive in a nonexistent cage, and the other half me being free, searching for who I really am.” Agatha's eyes locked onto Rio's again.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio realized she had finished speaking, she placed her hand over Agatha's. “I'm sorry,” she said, gently stroking Agatha's hand with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked down at their hands, then back into Rio's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's okay. It was a long time ago. Sorry for trauma–dumping and ruining the night.” She said with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you didn't ruin the night,” Rio said softly, continuing to stroke Agatha's hand. “I want to hear everything and anything about you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes widened slightly. She remained silent for a few seconds before tilting her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it the painting that makes you feel 'guilty and sad'?” She asked, smirking with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did I really say 'guilty and sad'?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you did.” Agatha said, still smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, my choice of words was really bad.” Rio smiled. “It makes me feel much more than that, everytime I look at it. At some point, I started avoiding Alice's office just so I wouldn't have to see it and get flooded with emotions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice has it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha hummed in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I like it so much,” Rio admitted as she absentmindedly rolled Agatha's ring. It felt natural—until she realized what she was doing and quickly pulled her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My turn,” Agatha said. “How are you Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you, Rio?” Agatha repeated the same question, but this time, her tone was softer than Rio had ever heard. She wanted to tell Agatha to change the question, to ask something else. But she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I honestly don't know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.” Agatha smiled
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was shocked. She had expected her to push for an answer, to dig deeper. But Agatha didn't. And somehow, that—exactly that—made Rio open her mouth again and talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean... what would you do if your ex–girlfriend showed up at your house to tell you that she's pregnant and wants to raise the baby with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, absolutely stunned. She raised her eyebrows, “What?” she said, her tone laced with disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. She did that. Yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yesterday? Is that why you were at the club?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, I'm sorry, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, she's a bitch.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She sounds like one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. I mean, she cheated on me with a dude and then made it seem like I was the 'monster'.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry, Rio.” Agatha said, her tone had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's okay. Really.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. You were already having a bad day, and I only made it worse.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How could you have known? You didn't know, Agatha. And also, you've apologized enough already.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Agatha took Rio's hand in hers and squeezed it gently—an unspoken
     <em>
      I'm sorry
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     They remained silent, looking at each other, savoring every detail and second of their presences.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like your nose.” Rio said out of nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You like what?” Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your nose. I like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well... Thank you.” Agatha blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's perfect. I want to touch it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “May I touch it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio...”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her with the best puppy–dog eyes she could muster.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You–you can touch it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in slightly, and Rio did the same, not caring where they were or who might be watching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes met. Rio lifted a finger and touched Agatha's lips. Agatha's breath hitched. Her lips parted slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not my nose, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Rio said, smiling. “But you wouldn't have let me touch them if I had said I wanted to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her index finger trailed higher, sliding from the bridge of Agatha's nose down to the tip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would,” Agatha mumured.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Rio said, eyes flickering between Agatha's lips and her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would've let you touch them if you had asked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio fell silent, she hadn't expected that.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just looked at Agatha's lips. Then back into her eyes. And Agatha just looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their evening came to an end as they stepped out of the restaurant, the night breeze embracing them both.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you for tonight,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They stood there for a while, as if neither of them wanted to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to... um, come to my place?” Rio asked, fidgeting with an imaginary thread on her jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her blazer tighter around her body and looked at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     They drove separately to Rio's place, arriving at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio unlocked the door and stepped inside and Agatha followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The place was completely dark, so Rio hurried to turn on the lights.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want something to drink?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, anything would be fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, make yourself comfortable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha just walked to the couch and sat down, wandering around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio returned with two glasses of red wine, the bottle in her other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like your garden,” Agatha said, as she took a glass from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you.” Rio grinned as she sat beside Agatha, leaving a small gap between them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They talked about work and other things, as if trying to distract themselves from the fact that they were sitting beside each other—denying the weight of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, Rio had just enough wine to summon the courage to ask,
    </p>
    <p>
     “May I touch your lips now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in, only a few inches between them. She raised her index finger and traced Agatha's lower lip. Agatha's lips parted instantly, her breath hitching, pupils dilating. Rio stroked her bottom lip, then the upper one, noticing the way Agatha held her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I kiss you now?” Rio asked, still tracing her finger over Agatha's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You better do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cupped Rio's face and pulled her closer. Their breaths mingled. The closeness made Rio's mouth water, heat spreading through her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips crashed against Agatha's, and they both moaned at the first taste of each other—a taste Rio could already see herself becoming addicted to.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss started slow and soft, but within seconds, it turned hungry, filled with lust and untamed fire. Agatha bit Rio's bottom lip, and Rio moaned in response, parting her lips slightly. Agatha didn't waste a moment, her tongue slipped into Rio's mouth, deepening the kiss. It was intense and hot, and Rio could feel the desire surging through her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands left Rio's cheeks, settling firmly on her hips. She pulled Rio closer, and closer, until Rio was practically in her lap. They didn't break the kiss for a second; it only grew more feverish, more desperate. Agatha's fingers traced patterns over the fabric of Rio's clothes, while Rio's hands clung to Agatha's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only seconds later, they broke the kiss, when oxygen became a necessity. Their faces remained inches apart, breathless and flushed. Agatha cupped Rio's face again and pressed a kiss to her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so beautiful. Do you know that?” Agatha mumured, still breathless and she kissed Rio's forehead again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only grinned in response, trying to catch her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     She settled back onto the couch, already missing Agatha's mouth on hers. Agatha's hands on her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll be out of town for a few days,” Agatha said. “There's an art gallery I need to attend.” She paused, looking at Rio. “You can call me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in again, kissing Rio softly before brushing their noses together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should go now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't protest, she just leaned forward and kissed Agatha in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     They hugged at the door, holding on for a moment longer. And then Agatha left.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take care.” Rio whispered—long after Agatha was gone.

     The lyrics of the song hit her harder than ever before. She had listened to this song several times, but it felt as if this is was the first time she truly heard the lyrics and realized how much they describe her—how much they mirrored her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had never been a fan of sorrow, of living embraced by soreness and agony.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio Vidal was optimistic by nature, a transport of delight. Even in the hardest moments of her life, which were many, she always managed to remain the same version of herself, always with a smile on her face. But now, it was as if every bit of sadness she had once refused to embrace had caught up to her, making her vulnerable, emotionally and physically. She certainly knew pain and sadness and had experienced them, hell, her whole life's foundation was built on tragedy, but she had always managed to control it—until now.

     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Sitting in her garden, amidst the stillnes of the evening, just as always, with a bottle of vodka by her side, she used the green to cleanse her thoughts, to clear her restless head, to organize the chaos. To breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today was her birthday. The sky was painted with stars, it was midnight and the cold breeze forced tears to form at the edges of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't wish she had never been born— not exactly—but it would have been nice to have good birthday memories. That day had always been a reminder of her misfortune, a reminder of how stupid she was for letting people in. Once someone showed her the slightest bit of attention. Once someone showed that they cared.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't celebrate this day and had always had hatred feelings toward it because, whenever she thought about it, what was there to celebrate?
    </p>
    <p>
     The happiest Birthdays—and the only happy ones—were from her childhood, surrounded by people who gave her unconditional love and care. She didn't care about the world back then, when she used to think about her next birthday during her current birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her teenage years were devoid of something called birthdays, not because she was a moody teenager, but simply because there was no one there to celebrate with. She didn't realize back then that once she blew out the candle on her twelfth birthday, there wouldn't be any happy candles after that. No more innocent wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
     During college, her friends always insisted on throwing parties to her, celebrating the undeserving. She appreciated it and all, but she always felt as if she was being forced into acknowledging it, into accepting it.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the following years, her birthday became the miserable reminder that it is now, something she couldn't bear to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You watch yourself in fragments, amongst the leaves,
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      And you conclude that you never were much more
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Than a reflection in a pool
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her last birthday was a complete disaster. Laying in bed, waiting her ex–girlfriend, who was late and completely wasted as always, not giving a fuck about Rio's existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     It started as a reproach, turned into a loud conversation, developed into a heated argument, escalated into a fight, and ended with her ex's uncontrolled anger and violence issues, while using the victim complex as an armor. Her birthday ended with Rio walking around the city with a scar on her elbow.

     <em>
      Do you still wake up wrapped around an empty space?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Do you only know the good days once they’ve slipped away?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Do you wish that he would call you by another name?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Do you pour another drink out for the same mistakes?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hell yes, I do” Rio said, talking to the song as she reached for the bottle and made a toast with the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking back, she realized she was stupid, wasn't she? An idiot, a total loser, and somehow a bitch with attachment issues. It shouldn't have gone that far. She should have dumped that bitch two years ago, spat on her and walked away. She should have left the city and found a new place. She should have achieved her dreams. She should have lived—only she didn't. And that's why she feels guilty, for ruining herself for nothing, for wasting time she could never get back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking about how things could have been different if she had done things differently. She wouldn't be a mess now if she had refused to get hurt for the sake of herself. She wouldn't be a fragile, depressed little thing if she hadn't put someone above herself, because not a single son of a pimp deserves to be at the top of her priorities.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked up at the sky, and it looked so beautiful. Oh to be a bird. To be a cloud. A star. Or even a bit of smoke rising with no return.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got inside, looked at the place and sighed—a long, low and a spent-out sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     She went upstairs and lay on her back, looking at the ceiling. Rio thought about texting Agatha. She thought about it every minute since Agatha had stepped out of her house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everytime she reached for her phone and looked at the contact, something hit her heart, making it pulse faster than ever. It was sweet at first, but it grew to actually hurt her, the way her heart pounded the moment she looked at Agatha's name was overwhelming by all means.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't supposed to be like that, but it was as if she couldn't do anything about it. Everything in her ached for the woman, longing to hear her voice. The delightful sensation she got from hearing the woman's voice was something she had never experienced before—not once in her four decades of living. And it felt hazardous. Whenever Rio thought about it, it made zero sense—the way she was drawn to the woman was scary, even for a lesbian. It held an unbearable amount of risk, with uncountable layers of emotions she cannot handle.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she closed her eyes, trying to sleep, a dark-haired woman appeared in front of her. Her face was vivid, as if she were standing right in front of Rio. She hung onto the image of the woman and shut her eyes harder. She didn't want to open them, so the woman wouldn't leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, it would have been so good if Agatha were here, if only Agatha were here to kiss her, to call her name, to tell her how delicious it tastes in her mouth, and to tell her that everything was fine, and it would be fine because she was here, but she wasn't and Rio was delusional.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzed beside her but she ignored it—only to open her eyes immediately at the second buzz. As if she had summoned her, Agatha reached for her with a message. Rio's heart pounded harder in her chest, and heat traveled through her body once she saw the woman's name on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hi, Rio.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Are you awake?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at the messages. It maybe didn't mean much, but Agatha had reached for her first. And by the gods, it definitely meant something.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yes, I am.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hit send and stared at the ceiling again. Probably Agatha couldn't sleep either, because it was already 4 am in where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Can I call you?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     God, this woman. Call me, just call me. Let me hear your voice. Let me listen to you breathing for hours and hours. Let me be drowned in the sweet ocean of every word you speak, buried in the depth of every tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, that was too much. She wouldn't say that. She only thought about it, and it ate her from the inside, making her lose her sanity—or what was left of it, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yes, of course.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha called.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat before answering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've missed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Was the first thing Agatha had said, and it made Rio's heart stop for a moment, only to come back again, beating faster, threating to leave her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio remaind silent, her grip on the phone tightening, almost gluing the device to her ear. Her eyes squeezed shut. She could hear Agatha breathing, and she searched everywhere for how to respond to something like that, but nothing appeared. Nothing could even work.
    </p>
    <p>
     How are you supposed to respond to something like that?
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      God, Rio...
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     There it was, her name wrapped in a sigh, laced with sweetness. Her name had never sounded more beautiful, the way this woman called her name. It was almost unbelievable. She wanted her to call her name again and again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was aware that she was silent—not a single word was coming out of her mouth—but, on the other hand? Her physical state was chaotic. Heat radiated from her, she could feel an actual fireball resting in her stomach, a sheen of sweat appearing on her forehead, her eyes were shut, and the only thing she could hear is Agatha's breathing. She could sense the way Agatha was waiting for her to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     , let me hear you voice.” Agatha said and Rio almost passed out from the heat that was only increasing with every word Agatha says.
    </p>
    <p>
     The desperation in Agatha's tone was too much to handle and too good to reject.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you know—do you know what you're doing to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally managed to speak. She probably gathered every bit of courage in her body to form the question and ask it. With the help of the alcohol in her system, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is Agatha really unaware of what she's doing to Rio? Does she really cannot hear how her heart is pounding? How she's torturing Rio? Or has she decided to ignore that and just do whatever she wants?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     know what
     <em>
      you're
     </em>
     doing to
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha repeated Rio's question, sounding even more desperate than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why didn't you call me? You said you would.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha asked, her tone laced with disappointment. Rio could sense it, and god, it did something to her. The way Agatha was talking straightforwardly with her, transparent, saying everything with that intense confidence. Saying what Rio wasn't able of saying.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say something, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know what to say. God, I wanted to call you, but I just....”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed. “I've never heard a sweet voice like yours, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha interrupted Rio's already failed attempt to explain why she hadn't called.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way she ended almost every sentence with Rio's name did something to her. The way she said Rio's name differently each time, but it also held the same similarity, the same taste, the same amount of heat. It made Rio's body ache.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can't sleep?” Agatha asked, interrupting Rio's thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Rio responded with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Something in your pretty little head?” The way she asked it—a mixture of pure concern laced with amusement and something else, something out of reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Plenty of things actually.” Rio said sincerely. Something was pushing her to talk because the safety that Agatha provided couldn't be an illusion. It was real, and Rio could feel it everywhere, even in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to talk about them?” Agatha asked, then she sighed. “You can talk about anything you want, Rio, and I'll listen to you. Or, I could talk until you fall asleep.... Just name it, and I'll do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     , talk to me.” A desperate plea. A dolorous need.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha did as promised, talking with that deep voice of hers, embracing Rio with every word. She tried to make small talks whenever Rio fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
     They talked about a few things. The conversation felt more intimate, more personal than the one they had shared before. Rio learned a few things about Agatha—things she would definitely think about on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like how Agatha liked reading books, the way she had that nerdy hyperfixation on witchcraft, how she liked her coffee, her experience growing up in a religious household, how purple had become her favorite color, and how once she almost died because of a dare challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more Agatha talked, the wider Rio's smile grew, and the heat in her body increased. She was floating, lost in her words, in the way Agatha described things, showed interest in more than a way, and spoke flawlessly with that demanding confidence. Agatha was a goddess of a woman, and Rio was very much aware of that fact.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “When is your birthday?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha asked, and Rio felt her heart sink, thinking about whether she should say that her birthday was last month, or the next one, or even that her birthday was in a thirteenth month that obviously did not exist. It sounded foolish in her head, childish even.
    </p>
    <p>
     What would happen if Agatha knew it was her birthday? She wouldn't care anyway. Why would she? They were still strangers to one another after all—a stranger Rio would kill for.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's... today.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held her breath and squeezed her eyes shut. Damn it, woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Happy birthday, Rio.” Agatha sighed. “Happy birthday you
     <em>
      bewitching
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      captivating
     </em>
     human being.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt the way Agatha was breathing after saying every word, the way her voice sounded so close, in that slutry deep tone. And Rio was aware of how her body reacted to every word. The way she sighed, feeling her heart pounding, her stomach turning into a heat pool, the way the words hit every pulse point in Rio's body. It was insane, even, the way she couldn't breathe once the words reached her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish I was there, with you right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish you were with me. I
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     you here with me, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her intention was to say that as a low murmur to herself, as a soundless thought in her head, but somehow she said it aloud, and she felt the way Agatha's breath hitched.
    </p>
    <p>
     And somehow, the silence stretched between them. Not a single word was spoken, but it felt safe, as if you were sitting with someone you know you could be yourself with—someone who would understand you with just a look, and in their case, with just an intake of breath or a tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you believe in, Rio?” Agatha's voice returned after moments of silence, and the question felt different in a way.
    </p>
    <p>
     What did Rio believe in?
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a deep breath before speaking, as if holding her thoughts inside, afraid they would shatter and she'd be left with nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you had asked me this a while ago, I would have been able to answer it, gladly,” a sigh. “I used to have faith in lots of things, you know? Because I had that kind of hope, the kind that makes me save what I have now in order to have something later. And I lived with that for a long time. But lately, that faith shattered, I feel that I no longer have faith in anything, I no longer believe in something, and I can't even recall what I once believed in. It's as if everything was nothing but an illusion, and it disappeared once I regained my consciousness. But god, I don't even feel conscious.” Rio pressed fingers into her eyes to release some tension. “Does that make any sense?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It actually makes all the sense in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you, do you believe in anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never really believed in anything. I always doubted, always had that sense that something didn't sit right, and it should make sense to me before I could acknowledge it, let alone believe in it. But lately... I'm starting to believe in something that doesn't really make sense. And whenever I try to put sense into it, it remains the same.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? And what is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can't even name it,
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rested her head on the pillow, phone still glued to her ear, listening to everything Agatha was saying. Every little thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did I bore you yet?” Agatha asked, and Rio closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Never.” Rio breathed the word—it was a whisper that held so much weight. “When will you come back?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Probably tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to tell her to hurry up, to come sooner so she could see her. But Rio wasn't in that position, to tell Agatha to come back and embrace her, to feel her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes remained closed. She was so still, relaxed even. She heard Agatha calling her name and managed to mumble a few words. She was drifting between consciousness and unconsciousness when she heard a low, sweet laugh escape from Agatha—and she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sleep well, birthday girl.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When was the last time she had really talked with someone for hours? Never. She had never done that. When was the last time she had falling asleep with a smile on her face? A long time ago, or maybe never. Debatable.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she woke up later, she felt good. It had only been a few hours of sleep but they were peaceful. She hadn't woken up panicking in the middle of her sleep, which had become the norm lately. No, she had actually slept like a human being, for the first time in months.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her smile didn't fade the entire day. Even when someone spilled their coffee on her white shirt, she just looked at them and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe things weren't that bad. Maybe she only needed someone to be truly present— even when they weren't. And that someone was Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because even in her absence, she was still there. In Rio's head all the time. She had glimpsed a bit of her in Alice's office today and smiled—fragments of her everywhere. Or maybe it was Rio who had started to see and sense her everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she got in her car, her phone buzzed, Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, are you still in campus?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm heading home. Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, I'm coming.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And within five minutes, Alice was there.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey. Do you wanna go out? We're having a night out. It's just me, Jen, and Lilia—she's bringing a friend...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A friend? Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no it's someone else. Another artist, I assume. She knows Agatha. Wanda Maximoff.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Neither do I.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A moment of silence and then it clicked in Rio's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice...” Rio looked at her suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is this one of those suprise parties you throw every two years? The ones I always tell you not to throw?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice scratched her neck awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice Wu-Gulliver, you just scratched your neck, and I
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     that means you're about to lie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, yes!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus Christ.” Rio said, a shit–eating grin spreading across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “See? if I told you, you wouldn't come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll come though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know that sounds out of character, but yeah, seriously.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, I love happy Rio!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mean?” Rio chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know what happened, but I
     <em>
      fucking love
     </em>
     seeing that smile back on your face. Dude, it suits you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? I'm just optimistic by nature.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And they both laughed, because it was a fact and they knew it. Maybe Rio doubted it, but Alice knew it by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice hugged her warmly and wished her a happy birthday.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio got ready to meet her friends. She grabbed her keys and stepped outside when her phone buzzed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      How was your day?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And a smile spread across her face, so wide it almost didn't fit into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat on the chair in her garden—the same chair where she had been eating herself alive the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      It was good.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at the message and deleted it
    </p>
    <p>
     Because honestly? Her day wasn't just good, it was the best she'd had in a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      It was great. Thanks to you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And she sent it, because she must show her gratitude to the woman. After all, she was the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Well, actually thanks to you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Are you doing something tonight?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at the message for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yes, I'm going out with my friends.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Okay, have fun xx
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     A silly grin took over her face at that.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She went to the usual bar, and everybody was already there—the ones Alice had mentioned and two other women Rio knew but wasn't particularly close to. Her social bubble was incredibly small after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she approached, they cheered for her, showering her with smiles, happy birthdays, and hugs. A little overwhelming, but sweet nonetheless.
    </p>
    <p>
     The red–haired woman sitting beside Lilia caught her attention—that must be Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman reached out for a handshake, offering a soft smile that Rio found sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The conversations flowed through the air—introductions, a little teasing here and there, warmth wrapping around them like a blanket. And Rio thought... maybe things weren't really that bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So..” Wanda said looking at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, encouraging her to continue. But it seemed Wanda didn't actually have something to say, so Rio spoke instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, you know Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, Rio was a little too curious about how the two knew each other. And she knew something was there when Wanda's eyes widened slightly and also she didn't miss the way Lilia's head turned toward her at the mention of the name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda took a sip of her drink. “Yes, Agatha... I know her.” Wanda met Rio's gaze before adding “Some pages of history have been written between us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? What kind of history.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughed awkwardly, and Rio noticed. How could she not? It was written all over the woman's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Some professional pages... and intimate ones.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There it was. That was what Rio wanted to read—the intimate pages.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you know her?” Wanda asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her for a moment, then nodded as she took a sip of her drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm” Wanda hummed
    </p>
    <p>
     Something was there. Definitely. But Rio couldn't quite place it. It was already inappropriate enough to ask, but she needed to dig deeper—maybe she'd find gold, or bones, who knew?
    </p>
    <p>
     “So... you guys are exes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That was enough. Exes. That's all she needed to know.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The night came to an end. She had fun. Thanked her friends, hugged them warmly and headed out. The cold breeze sobered her up a little. She wasn't really
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     drunk, or was she?
    </p>
    <p>
     When she got home, she stepped out of the car and wobbled slightly as she walked to the door. That's when she noticed a black box sitting on the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio arched a brow in confusion and bent down to pick it up. It looked luxurious, something she wouldn't have ordered or bought herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Opening it, she found a little note inside:
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Happy birthday, Rio.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      I hope you'll wear this when I finally take you out on a date.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      A xx
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart pounded in her chest. She peeked into the box, then hurried inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Inside was a black dress and a perfume bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
     She ran her fingers over the fabric, feeling its softness carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     She picked up the perfume bottle and smelled it—once, twice. Then she sprayed it on her wrist and inhaled again.
    </p>
    <p>
     It smelled like something Rio would wear, it smelled like her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at the label again. It was a perfume she recognized from somewhere, that's why it smelled like nostalgia and something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio set the box on the table and just stared at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared at the little note for so long that the letters started to blur.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heat crept through her body, spreading with every second, she could feel it in every part of her body, traveling like a slow burn until it finally reached its destination, to her core.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That woman.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She took the box upstairs. Once inside her bedroom, she placed it on the bed and started taking off her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took the dress out meticulously, almost afraid it would somehow disappear from her hands, or worse, transform into something else entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she finally put it on, she turned to the full–length mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was insane—the way the dress hugged her body so perfectly, accentuating every curve exhaustively.
    </p>
    <p>
     The V-cut by the thigh... god it looked perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ran her hands over the fabric, feeling every inch of it against her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heat only increased when she thought about how Agatha had known her size after seeing her just a few times—enough to pick out something that fit her flawlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands cupped her breasts over the fabric, and
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     , it was tormenting—the way her body
     <em>
      begged
     </em>
     for a touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept feeling herself, her eyes locked onto her reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
     The air around her was thick, suffocating.
    </p>
    <p>
     And in her head?
    </p>
    <p>
     Only Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     She slid her hand down, tracing along the thigh cut before slipping her fingers beneath the fabric, pushing her underwear aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sharp inhale. Her fingers met an agonizing heat and slickness.
    </p>
    <p>
     She collected the evidence of her arousal and started rubbing her clit roughly, hyperaware of what she was wearing. Of
     <em>
      who
     </em>
     it was from.
    </p>
    <p>
     She moaned a curse at how fast her orgasm was building up.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few more strokes, and she came, pleasure running through her entire body as she cried out Agatha's name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her legs shook, and her breath was heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stumbled back onto the bed, laying there with a dazed smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, fuck
     </em>
     ” she muttered, grinning stupidly.

    <p>
     Lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling, her hands wandered over her body above the fabric, feeling every inch of it. She was in a state that resembled being high—only she wasn't. It was as if she were floating out of her body, like a ghost without its sheet. She didn't know exactly why she felt that way, she didn't even know how she felt. How a piece of fabric had taken over her mind so completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it really about the dress? Absolutely not. It was about that woman, Agatha, who Rio had come to realize, was starting to control her body and mind with the smallest things that held massive weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the moment she first saw her that night at that bar, Rio had felt it—like something striking her heart the moment she saw the woman's eyes. And it only grew, more painful, becoming a pain she couldn't get enough of. Because it hurt—but sweetly. It wounded her, yet the pain was good, like a reminder that she was still alive. That the rotting organ in the left of her chest was still there, still capable of pounding faster for reasons other than a panic attack. And she felt it every time she was with Agatha, every time she thought of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha had asked that unexpected question at Alice's party to start a conversation, a question that embarrassed Rio yet made her heart race, and it became faster and faster each time. When their shoulders brushed for a second. When she saw Agatha's artwork. When Lilia mentioned her name. When Agatha offered her a glass of wine. When she looked at her that day. When they smoked together. When they talked over dinner. When Agatha gave her her number. Or when their eyes met across the crowded club. When they sat and talked, and Agatha asked if she wanted to see her studio. When Rio saw a painting of herself there. When they kissed, a heated and a hungry kiss that went wrong in the end. Then the way Agatha called her name. When Agatha touched her hand. When she kissed her again on the couch. When she hugged her at the doorstep like they'd known eachother forever. Or when Agatha called her and stayed on the phone for hours just so Rio could fall asleep. When she asked about her day later. And now, this birthday present that overwhelmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every single time, Rio's heart pounded in an insane way—so much it felt dangerous. Like her heart might just rip itself out of her chest, grow legs, and run away as a bleeding organ. And it was absurd, the fact that Rio couldn't stop thinking about Agatha, the fact that she wanted her here, by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Was she falling in love? Or was she already in love?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers kept tracing the fabric, sliding up and down with her eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inhaled as much oxygen as her lungs could take, then exhaled after a few seconds. Rising to her feet, she went downstairs, poured herself a glass of wine, grabbed an apple and curled up on the couch, putting on some old show to watch. Ten minutes passed, she was bored, and sleep hadn't found its way to her yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     She scrolled through her phone, no notifications of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then it hit her. Should she text Agatha? Thank her for the gift? Or leave it for the morning? Or the next time she saw her?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart pounded at the thought of seeing Agatha again, she suddenly became aware of what she was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing up and heading toward her bedroom, but a knock on the front door stopped her mid-step. Her eyebrows furrowed in confusion, it was nearly 1 am.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood still for a moment, maybe she hadn't heard it right. Then the knock came again, not urgent, not impatient, it was slow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio walked toward the door and opened it, and the sight before her nearly made her pass away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's inappropriate for me to be here, isn't it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The voice only made it feel more absurd, like this was a dream and nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio...” before Agatha could continue whatever she was about to say, Rio stepped closer and took her lips in a kiss. It wasn't rushed or lustful—it was soft, something honest. As if Rio couldn't believe what was in front of her, as if she needed to make sure this wasn't one of her daydreams.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't pull back and neither did Rio. Instead, Agatha returned the kiss with more heat and fervor, her hands finding Rio's hips. Rio started walking backwards, leading them both inside. The door remained open, letting the cold breeze seep into Rio's warm haven.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed Agatha gently against the nearest wall, their mouths never parting—kissing, tasting, sucking and pouring every feeling and thought they had into each other's mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled back just a few inches, both of them trying to catch their breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just wanted to make sure you're real.” Rio said, her voice uneven as she tried to steady her breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm real. And I'm here with you now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, unable to shake the shock away from her system.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was here. In her house. In the middle of the night. Without a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How... how are you here?” Rio asked, still trying to calm her chaotic state.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I missed you. I wanted to be here before the day ended so I could be here on your birthday, but it didn't work out...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You came here... for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I came her for you.” Agatha murmured, giving Rio's hips a slight squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned and really looked at her—at her tired yet beautiful features, her blue eyes, her lips, and god, that perfect nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, her gaze drifting over what Rio was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you recieved my gift?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't understand the question at first, too lost in the face of the woman before her, the woman pinned against her wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then realization hit her, heat rushed to her face, turning her cheeks pink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Guess I did,” Rio managed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze lingered, studying every feature, every detail, as if she were committing them to memory. They stayed like that for minutes, just looking at each other, making sure they were both really there, lost in each other's faces.
    </p>
    <p>
     A shiver ran through Rio's body as the cold breeze slipped in from the open door. Without thinking, Agatha's hand moved instinctively to her exposed arms, trying to provide some warmth. But Rio's body shivered for a different reason, for the fact that Agatha's palms were on her skin. Their eyes met again, their faces only a few inches apart, both of them hovering on the edge of a kiss but neither making the move.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shouldn't we close that door so you don't get sick?” Agatha asked, squeezing Rio's arms gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and stepped aside to close the door. She motioned for Agatha to come inside, and as she did, Rio's hand hold Agatha's, a hold that felt so natural, like it's the only thing to do. Their fingers intertwined and Agatha tightened the hold slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat on the couch, the almost-empty glass of wine resting on the table and the slow hum of the TV filling the silence. They looked into each other's eyes for a long time, neither speaking, neither moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     The comfort they found in one another was too good to be disturbed, but eventually, it would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their fingers remained intertwined, their eyes locked, searching and finding what they're looking for in each other's faces.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence between them wasn't empty, it was full, full of warmth, disbelief and longing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing here?” Rio finally asked, her voice a low murumr, almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stayed silent for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know.” she admitted. “Since yesterday, the only thing I could think about was how to see you again. The next thing I knew, I was on a plane, and then at your doorstep. I didn't even know if I'd find you awake and you'd be annoyed in any way, or asleep and I'd have to walk away. I didn't know what controlled my mind at the time. I honestly don't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She paused for a brief moment then spoke again. “My intention was to come sooner, but I couldn't.” her gaze remained fixed on Rio. “I should have told you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you were on a plane coming back to LA when you asked about my day?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hand reached up to touch the back of Agatha's neck, her thumb stroking her cheek gently—a touch filled with disbelief. Rio still couldn't quite grasp the absurdity of the situation or how natural it felt, as if Agatha had always come back
     <em>
      home
     </em>
     to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why would I be annoyed?” Rio asked, leaning closer. The fingers that had once been intertwined with Agatha's rested on her face. Both of her hands cupped Agatha's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can't believe it. Can you?” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I can't believe that I'm actually sitting here with you, feeling your touch on my face. It doesn't feel real.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands rested on Rio's wrists. Their faces only a breath apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn't go to Lilia's house?” Agatha shook her head. “Or your studio?” another shake.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And your luggage?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In the car.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you really came straight from the airport... to
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes” Agatha murmured, her thumbs gently stroking Rio's wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still in disbelief, her hands cradling Agatha's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     They leaned even closer, the space between them shrank to the bare minimum. Their eyes locked, their thumbs tracing soft circles against each other's skin. They were certain—undeniably certain—that they were about to kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, an honest, beautiful smile, one that Agatha couldn't ignore, so a similar one found its way on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you tired?” Rio asked, looking directly into the blue ocean in Agatha's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to drink something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said as she leaned even closer—if that was even possible. But she did it. Their bodies touched, their hands never let go, and their eyes never looked away, not even once.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I kiss you?” Agatha asked, her thumbs stilled on Rio's wrists, her eyes drinking in every detail of that beautiful face before her. Rio only smiled and nodded, unable to form a coherent word.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasted no time. The second Rio nodded, Agatha's lips captured hers in a heated journey, pouring every emotion she felt into the kiss. She took Rio's bottom lip between her own, kissing and sucking it softly. But despite all the tenderness, there was the hunger in every movement, something Rio couldn't name but she felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha left her bottom lip and moved higher to treat the upper one the same way. With each press, each suck, each nip and a little bite, Agatha was devouring her. Rio felt her lips going completely numb.
    </p>
    <p>
     A second later, Agatha pulled away. Her gaze flickered to Rio's swollen lips before locking onto her brown eyes with so much love that Rio could barely comprehend it. But she felt it, traveling through the air between them and struck her heart, making it pound relentlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands found the back or Rio's neck and pulled her closer. Their mouths met again. Tongues rolled and intertwined. Agatha's tongue explored every bit it could reach, every corner of Rio's mouth, leaving nothing untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back for a brief second—only to claim and devour Rio's mouth once again in the following second. She sucked on Rio's tongue with an intoxicating mix of heat, hunger and lust.
    </p>
    <p>
     After minutes of desperate devouring of each other's mouths, they pulled back. Their eyes found eace other, chests rising and falling as air rushed into their lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands remained at the back of Rio's neck, while at some point, Rio's had found their way to Agatha's hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in again, brushing Agatha's lips with hers before resting her forehead against hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know if it makes sense,” Rio murmured, her breath still unsteady, “but I've been waiting for you to come back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's left hand moved higher, resting on the back of Rio's head as she stroked her hair gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It makes all the sense in the world,” she whispered, then she kissed Rio's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed like that for a couple of minutes. It felt natural, as if they had been doing this forever. After a moment, Rio's face found its way to the crook of Agatha's neck, to get buried there.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Rio's Hands moved higher, resting on the left side of Agatha's chest, feeling her heart pounding—as if that organ was right between her hands. She closed her eyes and just listened to the beating of the woman's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your heart is pounding really fast,” Rio said, almost a whisper, but the warmth of her breath sent a shiver to ran through Agatha's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The closeness felt so right, the warmth of their bodies pressed together so natural, as if they had done this every single day—only they hadn't. This was the first time. But it felt like... home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled, “It's because of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Even with Rio's face buried in her neck, Agatha could sense the grin spreading across her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And your skin is really toasty.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm. It's because of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hands found their way around Agatha's middle, forming an embrace, and her head replaced her hand on Agatha's chest, now listening to her heartbeat directly in her ear. Agatha's hands instinctively sought Rio's form, pulling her closer, holding her tightly, afraid she might melt away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And your body is trembling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, a breathy laugh, and leaned down to press a tender kiss on Rio's temple.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know. And that's also because of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed like that for a while, lost in the warmth and safety of the embrace, indifferent to time or the sensibility of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt safe, sheltered in this embrace, a safety she had never known —not once in her entire life. She felt seen and understood without speaking a word. She felt alive between Agatha's hands, and whatever she did, it felt nature, it felt raw and real. Every touch, every whisper, every little act. As if this had always been her home—between Agatha's hands, shielded there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her breaths had never been this steady in ages. Her heart had never felt this calm. The chaos in her head had never been this organized. It was as if, for the first time, she truly felt like a living human being.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she stayed like this for an another minute, she'd fall asleep immediately. So Rio lifted her head, looking at Agatha through her eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does it scare you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha showed her a confused expression, encouraging Rio to go on, so she continued. “How natural this feels?” Agatha smiled and began running her fingers gently through Rio's hair. “No. I don't quite understand it but it doesn't scare me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stole a small kiss from Agatha's lips before sitting up straight again, though their hands remained where they were, wrapped around each other's waists.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted one of her hands and traced Agatha's face, especially her nose, moving up and down. It amazed her how Agatha remained silent, just letting her do as she pleased, it was unbelievable, unreal.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want a drink?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whispered, afraid to break the pleasant silence more than necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed in affirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll be right back,” Rio murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed a gentle kiss to the hand that had just been on her face, then another to Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood and took the glass from the table, feeling Agatha's gaze on her as she walked away. And once again, she realized what she was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     A minute later, she returned with two glasses of wine and a bottle—doing the exact same thing for the second time. But this time, it felt different.
    </p>
    <p>
     She handed a glass to Agatha and looked at her. Agatha returned the unreadable look with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does this mean this is our date?” Agatha asked, glancing at Rio from head to toe. “Because you're wearing it.” She gestured at the dress with her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, her skin flushing, before sitting beside Agatha once again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you want it to be, it could be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at that. “So you'd agree to go on a date with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her gaze from the glass resting between her hands and looked at Agatha, finding comfort in those beautiful features.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'd be a fool if I didn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's smirk returned, that mysterious look in her eyes full of mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you... Ahh, the dress fits perfectly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I see that.” Agatha said, taking a sip of wine, her smirk visible even from behind the glass. “Why are you wearing it, though?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's face flushed again, cycling through dozens of shades of red before settling into a deep crimson as her mind replayed the last few hours leading up to Agatha's arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—I just wanted to try it on, that's all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.” Rio said, taking a sip from her glass, then another, and another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned closer and inhaled Rio's neck for a brief second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm. You're wearing it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.” Rio said again as yet another sip of wine found its way to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, Rio, just relax.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her once again,
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't think that's possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I making you nervous?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should I leave?” Agatha, raising an eyebrow, her smirk is playful, she already knew the answer, but she was wicked like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, of course not,” Rio said immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then what? Hmm? Does the space between us make you nervous? Should I come closer?” Agatha asked, and she was already leaning closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's breath hitched, and the next second, she was holding it—just as if they hadn't been embracing, body to body, only ten minutes ago. But this time, it was different. This time, she could see Agatha's eyes, could sense something lurking beneath them—thirst, hunger and something more.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the next moment, Agatha's hand rested on Rio's, the one lying in the space between them. Agatha looked down at their hands, and when she looked back up at Rio, something in her gaze had shifted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're holding your breath.” Agatha said, and Rio exhaled immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. Now, please breathe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha said as she tucked a strand of Rio's hair behind her ear with her other hand and started stroking her cheekbone with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did as she was told, trying to steady her breaths as Agatha's soft touches guided her, melting the tension from her muscles. She closed her eyes as Agatha's thumb drifted lower, wiping away a drop of wine from the edge of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exhaled through her nose, eyes still shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What time is it?” Agatha asked, her hands still moving in a steady rhythm— one stroking Rio's cheek, the other tracing gentle patterns on the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes, meeting the blue ones watching her, then turned to glance at the hanging clock on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Two forty three.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmm” Agatha hummed in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her for a moment, then spoke, her voice barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I won't.” Agatha said, taking Rio's hand and pressing a soft kiss to it. “I won't.” Another kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio walked with Agatha to the door so she could grab her suitcase from the car. As she stood their, her thoughts spiraled—would Agatha sleep in the guest room or... With her, in her bedroom?
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, Agatha would sleep in the guest room. Right? It's common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha returned a couple of minutes later, catching Rio's gaze before stepping inside. Rio turned and led the way upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they walked, they passed the open door of Rio's bedroom on their way to the guest room in the middle of the hall, Agatha noticed the hesitation in Rio's steps but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they reached the room, Rio took Agatha's suitcase and set it inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll get you some towels. The bathroom is here.” Rio said, pointing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you” Agatha said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio left, returning a couple of minutes later with fresh towels and a glass of water.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here,” She said, handing the glass to Agatha who was sitting on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you. I know this is strange.” Agatha said with half a chuckle. “I'll leave in the morning. I really don't want to intrude...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're not intruding, Agatha.” Rio said, sitting beside her and taking her hand in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, yeah, I should go and see the house.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You found the one you've been looking for?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you're settling here in LA?” Rio asked, stroking Agatha's hand with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am,” Agatha said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to talk with Agatha, to just sit with her, feel her, but she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, I'll let you rest now.” Rio said softly, glancing at their hands resting on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave her hand a gentle squeeze. “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For what?” Rio asked, brows furrowing in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't quite grasp what Agatha meant by
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     —because
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     could mean everything or nothing at all. But she didn't push for an explanation, instead, she simply smiled in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got up after gently placing Agatha's hand on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hesitated as she looked at Agatha, at her eyes, at how breathtakingly beautiful she is. Her heart pounded faster the longer she stared, and Agatha was only looking back at her. Rio didn't know if she wanted to kiss Agatha goodnight, embrace her again, or to push her onto the bed and do the next thing that came to mind. None of those options felt appropriate. The longer she stood there, the deeper her hesitation grew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, she had kissed Agatha at the doorstep. She had kissed her again and again on the couch. She embraced her gently, wrapped in intimacy and warmth. But in this moment? She didn't know.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha noticed the unreadable hesitation in Rio's expression once again, so she decided to take matters into her own hands, she stood up and faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want something? Just say it,
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     .” she said, taking both of Rio's hands in hers and looking directly into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The question was so soft, filled with consideration, a question that hit Rio right in the heart. Agatha had said her name earlier this evening, but this time... it was different.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held Agatha's gaze, searching for a way to name what she wanted. What did she want?
    </p>
    <p>
     A few seconds passed, the two of them standing face to face, their fingers intertwined. Agatha squeezed Rio's hand gently, and the feeling overwhelmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Kiss me.” Rio finally said.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the next second, Agatha did. Their lips found each other once again for this evening, but this kiss was different. It was tender and soft, as if they were saying everything they couldn't put into words. Their fingers remained intertwined by their sides, the air around them thick with affection.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they pulled away, Agatha smiled as she looked at Rio, the black fabric still hugging her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good night, Rio.” Agatha whispered, pressing a kiss to the back of her left hand, then her right. She leaned in, brushing a kiss against Rio's forehead, and then, once more, against her soft lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't say anything—not for minutes. Then, finally, she spoke. “Good night, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice was quiet but full of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled, and Rio turned to leave, closing the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned against it for a second, catching her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, what an idiot.” She muttered, closing her eyes, pressing her back against the door, and her chest rising and falling.
    </p>
    <p>
     She walked to her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at herself in the mirror, and something was different, something in her face, something she couldn't quite name, but whatever it was, it looked good on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, for what felt like the hundredth time that evening, she became hyperaware of what she was wearing. The fabric hugged her perfectly, so perfectly that she barely even felt it on her body
    </p>
    <p>
     But she took it off anyway, changing into something different.
    </p>
    <p>
     After brushing her teeth and washing her face, Rio lay on the bed, pulling the blanket over her body. But no warmth, no softness could compare to the comfort she had felt in Agatha's embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes passed as she struggled to sleep. She needed to wake up in a few hours—but first, she had to fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how could she, when she was hyperaware of who was sleeping in the other room?
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought of Agatha, possibly asleep just down the hall, made Rio's heart pound irrationally.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she forced her eyes shut anyway, because what else could she do?
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio was lying on Agatha's bare chest, the widest grin on her face. She could feel Agatha's fingers moving smoothly along her bare back, leaving a trail of warmth. Their bodies were pressed together, heat radiating between them, igniting something deep inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the dream didn't last. Her eyes snapped open to the darkness of her bedroom. She exhaled, rolling onto her back and pressing her fingers to her eyelids. She reached for her phone. Damn, it's still early.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to go back to sleep but couldn't. So, instead, she decided to take the shower she had delayed earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Afterwards, she went downstairs, brewing the coffee her body craved.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat at the table with her laptop open in front of her, replying to the endless flood of emails. Then she heard footsteps approaching, she looked up. Agatha—looking heavenly, as always.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning.” Agatha greeted her, flashing the widest smile Rio had ever seen on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning. Why are you awake?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I couldn't really sleep,” Agatha admitted, standing still.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want some coffee?” Rio asked as she stood—suddenly so hyperaware of how short her shorts were. She tugged at the hem, tried to pull the fabric down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze flickered to the movement of her hands for a brief second before returning to Rio's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, please.” She said, taking a seat in the chair beside the one Rio had been occupying.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Um... do you want breakfast?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you making?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing at the moment, but, I could make some eggs and bacon?” Rio offered with a smile, scratching the back of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That would be lovely, thank you.” Agatha said with a soft smile. “Can I come with you? I have nothing to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blushed at that—for several reasons. The way Agatha was looking at her with those unreadable, mysterious lakes of blue. The way Agatha looked like an ethereal being, her thick brown hair tossed up in a bun, making her face even more captivating, if that was even possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     And also because of those goddamn shorts she was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, of course.” Rio finally managed, turning away, leading the way to the kitchen with Agatha following closely behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was sitting. Watching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Watching every motion Rio made, every sway, every step, every subtle expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sipped her coffee, never breaking her gaze. Rio would catch Agatha staring from time to time, but she was always the first to look away, heat crawling up her neck, while Agatha remained staring brazenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look beautiful.” Agatha murmured, taking another sip of her coffee. Rio's hands froze mid-motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you always look this beautiful at this time of the morning?” Agatha asked, setting her cup down on the counter. She took a step closer, wetting her lips. And Rio? She remained silent, her heart racing violently in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “May I?” Agatha asked, her gaze lowering to Rio's hips, asking for permission.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't entirely sure what she meant—where exactly Agatha was looking—but she nodded anyway after swallowing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands found Rio's hips, and she pulled Rio closer. Their eyes locked, and the air between them grew heavier, charged with something neither of them dared to name.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn't answer me,” Agatha said, gently stroking Rio's cheekbone with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “...What?” Rio asked hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled, her gaze dipping to Rio's lips, lingering there. “Do you always look this beautiful in the morning?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—I don't know,” Rio stammered, as heat only increased.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?” Agatha mused. “I think yes. Because you always look so beautiful. Anytime. Anywhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed once again as Agatha's eyes met hers. Her pulse hammering so hard she was certain Agatha could hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The intensity of the moment became unbearable, so Rio did the only thing she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in and crashed her lips into Agatha's. The kiss was heated, filled with hunger. Agatha's mouth took hers completely, devouring her with a fervor that sent shivers down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's grip on her hips tightened. She walked Rio backward until her back hit the counter, their tongues tangling, their bodies pressed so close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's knee slid between Rio's, pressing firmly against her core. She pulled back slightly, searching Rio's eyes to make sure this what she wanted. Rio didn't hesitate, she only whined at the friction, burying her face in Agatha's shoulder to press the knee harder on her core, chasing more. A filthy moan escaped her lips as she fought the urge to bite down on Agatha's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound sent a spark through Agatha, igniting something deeper. She started moving her knee in a slow, deliberate circles, the pressure hitting just right against Rio's clit, pulling louder, needier moans from her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know I haven't taken you on a date yet, but god, Rio...”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha murmured closely against Rio's ear, her voice low, slutry, so devastatingly seductive that it made Rio's entire body shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck. Please more.” Rio whined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her knee away, and before Rio could protest, Agatha's hands gripped her hips, claiming her mouth in a kiss just as heated as the moment before. This time, Agatha took a few steps back, guiding their bodies toward the kitchen island.
    </p>
    <p>
     With effortless strength, she lifted Rio's body onto the counter. Rio gasped, eyes widening as a moan slipped from her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't give her a chance to recover of whatever the fuck had just happened. She crashed their lips together again, taking Rio on another desperate, hungry ride, making her squirm and moan, pulling out the most heated melodies out of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's legs instinctively wrapped around Agatha's hips, pulling her closer, keeping her there.
    </p>
    <p>
     As their tongues tangled, Agatha's hand slipped beneath Rio's shorts and underwear, fingers disappearing into the heat between her thighs. She groaned onto Rio's mouth at what she found, warmth, wetness and silk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's body trembled as Agatha's fingers stroked her, teasing, exploring.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment her long digits found that sensitive bundle of nerves, Rio let out a cry—almost a scream—her senses drowning in the overwhelming pleasure Agatha's touches provided. Desire resting at the tips of every corner of her body, waiting the right touch to explode and flood her. Rio could sense how close she is, and Agatha seemed to feel it as well. The way Rio's body tensed, the way her breath hitched, she was close.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha didn't stop, she pressed two fingers to Rio's entrance, easing inside, filling her, stretching her. She paused for a second, waiting for Rio to adjust before she began moving, thrusting, each stroke hitting just the right spot, each motion drawing Rio closer to the edge, making her moan louder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'd love to see you naked right on this kitchen island...” Agatha whispered between open-mouthed kisses, her voice a slow burn against Rio's lips. Her fingers moved faster, her thumb circling Rio's clit in rhythm. “But fuck...” She kissed her again, deep and consuming. “I can wait” another kiss. “I can fucking wait to see all of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clung to Agatha's shoulders, her legs locked around her hips, body trembling under the pressure of what was building inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, her release tore through her, she came all over Agatha's fingers, shaking and falling apart in her arms, burying her face in the crook of Agatha's neck as desire consumed her whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my... fuck, Agatha.” Rio gasped, barely able to form any words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't stop, her fingers only slowed, riding out the aftershocks, letting Rio feel every second of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she finally withdrew her fingers, Rio sat back, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha met her gaze, and without breaking the eye contact, she brought her fingers to her mouth and sucked them clean.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's my breakfast.” she said with a smirk before leaning in, capturing Rio's lips once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her for a moment once Agatha pulled away, and smiled. This time, she pulled Agatha closer, her legs tightening around her waist and captured Agatha's lips in a deep heated kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, that was...” She trailed off, words failing her. Instead, she leaned in again, letting the kiss say what she couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she had fully recovered, her feet found the ground, though their lips refused to part for long, so they met again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Rio, what are you doing to me?” Agatha murmured, pressing a soft kiss to Rio's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What am I doing to you?” Rio teased, a smirk playing on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pinned her by the hips once again, their eyes locked. She leaned in, inhaling Rio's scent before pressing a kiss to her neck, sucking the sensitive skin. Rio moaned, tilting her head to the side, offering more.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You drive me crazy,” Agatha admitted, the words landing directly in Rio's ear, sending a shiver down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a fair amount of kissing and sucking, Agatha pulled back and gave Rio's hips a gentle squeeze. Rio's hands flew to cling on Agatha's neck. Their bodies flush against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I?” Rio asked, looking directly into the oceanic depths of Agatha's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What, angel?” Agatha murmured, their noses brushing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Touch you,” Rio said blushing, her voice almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed her body closer, her hips glued to Rio's, and the contact pulled an involuntary moan from Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can... but not now.” Agatha said as she tucked a strand of hair behind Rio's ear, her other hand moving slowly to cup Rio's ass cheek, their hips still locked together
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you wait for me, angel?” Agatha whispered, “hmm?” She hummed as she looked into Rio's eyes, heat radiating from the proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. I can,” Rio said, closing her eyes, feeling Agatha's lingering touches on her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good girl,” Agatha praised, before capturing her lips once more.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They ate the eggs and bacon after all.

    <hr/>
    <p>
     Once Agatha had stepped out of Rio's place after kissing her goodbye, it was as if she had disappeared completely—without a trace, without a phone call, a text, or anything. Four days had passed, and there wasn't a single sign of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who had came to Rio's house in the middle of the night straight from the airport.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who seemed like she couldn't control herself around Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who had promised she'd come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, she just vanished into thin air. As if she had never been there in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     The past four days had been a hell for Rio. Nothing occupied her mind but Agatha. Day and night, awake or asleep, nothing but Agatha, her stupid, beautiful face and that goddamn breathtaking smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was that it? Was that all she wanted? To fuck Rio senseless and make her weak? To crave herself into Rio's heart and then disappear, leaving only the imprint of her touch?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had her fair share of women acting reckless for a while, then suddenly feeling guilty or whatever and disappearing. But Agatha wasn't like that, was she? She wasn't reckless. She didn't even hesitate. She knew exactly what she was doing from the moment she locked eyes with Rio across the room. She wasn't playing games, she wasn't having fun, making Rio squirm every time they were close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or was she?
    </p>
    <p>
     The more Rio thought about it, the worse her headache became, the same headache that plagued her for three damned days.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared at the papers on her desk, but none of it made any sense. She couldn't process a single thing. The only thing in her head is Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Goddamn Agatha and her gorgeous blue eyes. Her fascinating sharp nose. Her cheekbones and jaw, her full, delicious lips. Her slender, long fingers...
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squeezed her eyes shut the moment her mind started drifting to the wrong places. Thinking about the way Agatha's mouth tasted. The way her unapologeitc gaze pierced through Rio. The way she lifted her with ease, placing her exactly where she wanted. The way her fingers felt inside her...
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh no. Not there.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had reached out first, sent messages, called, but no answer. Not a single one. She even considered asking Lilia, but she knew that was a bad idea. She wasn't in that place yet, hell, she didn't even know where the fuck her place was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was desperate. She just wants to hear her voice. That voice could heal the wounds her absence had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was painfully aware of how hard she had fallen for Agatha, and
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     , it was torturous. And she couldn't do a damn thing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was supposed to be past this—past the stupid games her heart wanted to play. Years ago, she had decided she would never fall into its traps again. She would dismiss it every time. If she couldn't control it, she could at least ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But here she was, sitting in her office chair, mind in disarray, heart pounding with fear, not just of what would happen next, but worse, of what wouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let the pen slip from her fingers and tossed it onto the stack of papers in front of her. Leaning back, she covered her face with both hands, trying in vain to suppress the goddamn headache.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing was working. And she is a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't help but feel like a teenage girl with a stupid crush, waiting for a message so she could grin at it like an idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was it with her luck? Something had to be wrong. Was Rio really the kind of person who scared people away? Who made them disappear? But god, Agatha wasn't just people, and Rio knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's why she still have hope. That's why she knows Agatha would come back at some point.
     <em>
      Maybe tomorrow
     </em>
     , and she'd have an excuse, one Rio would accept without question.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because if it was Agatha, she'd accept anything. Honestly, she was down so bad. Down on her knees for that woman. The woman she had only spent time with by chance. The woman she kept meeting in strange coincidences, without any planning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time they met, the world seemed to shrink. As if nothing else existed. No other places. No other people. Just them. And those damn unexplained coincidences.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could feel her head pulsing everywhere, and she was aware that she looked like shit. She hadn't gotten much sleep lately, when did she ever get the rest her body needed?
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed the chair forward, trying to get back to the work in her hands—the work she couldn't even focus on, no matter how hard she tried.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Another day passed, and nothing from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Maybe tomorrow?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And another.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Maybe tomorrow?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been a week.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had spent every
     <em>
      maybe tomorrow
     </em>
     she had in her pockets, none were left.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, when she woke up this morning, she still found herself looking at the messages she had sent to Agatha over the past few days.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hey gorgeous. Are you free tomorrow?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hi, Agatha. Are you alright?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Where are you? Is everything okay?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Did something happen to you?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      God, Agatha, where are you? Please, can you just talk to me?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, she was desperate. She
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that woman, despite her absence, kept growing inside her, kept taking up space, kept living in her, even though Rio wasn't watering her memory. Even though no sunlight reached the depths Agatha had buried herself in.
    </p>
    <p>
     So how? How did she keep growing and growing? And why did Rio still have so much hope that Agatha would return? To the point that hope inside her had already begun creating yet another
     <em>
      maybe tomorrow
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So...
     <em>
      maybe tomorrow
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up. It was Monday again. She had to face the world again, make small talks with people, even though every word left a nauseating sensation in her stomach—one she'd only purge at the end of the day when she'd vomit herself out.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's strange how one cannot control oneself. No matter the effort put into taming a wild heart. Something always comes out of nowhere to shatter it. To leave open wounds that will eventually scar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha never had to speak to Rio in the first place. She shouldn't have. They weren't together, after all. They hadn't even gone on a proper date.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, the question lingered in Rio's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why? Why would someone go through all that effort just to walk away? Without a single word?
    </p>
    <p>
     Did Agatha expect Rio to use her memory, her promises, to fill the space her absence had left?
    </p>
    <p>
     Nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't great at communicating, that much she knew. But she still knew when to talk, what to say and why.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had spent her whole life making sure she never did to others what had been done to her. She had put herself last just to avoid affecting people the way they had affected her. She knew the weight a word could hold. The pain an action could cause. And she never wanted to be the reason of any of it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She washed her face. In the process, she glanced at her reflection, at the dark circles under her eyes. No amount of makeup would hide those properly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got dressed for the long day ahead, grabbed her things, and stepped out.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     As the day came to an end, she gathered her stuff and headed outside. She was expecting a call from Alice, so when her phone vibrated in her pocket, she pulled it out and brought it to her ear without looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Alice, I'm heading home—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio...”
    </p>
    <p>
     The voice made Rio froze mid-step. People passed by her, unaware of what a single voice had just done to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed hard. Her breath turned unsteady. A panic attack was forming inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thought she'd be glad to hear that voice again, but now? Now she was terrified of what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said nothing, not for a solid twenty seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “First of all,” Agatha began, “I'm really sorry, Rio...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want, Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's question wasn't sharp. Wasn't edged. It was soft, barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I see you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?” Rio asked, resuming her walk. “Why do you want to see me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I could explain... if you let me. And if you don't want to, I'd understand.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Explain what, Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Rio, please don't talk to me like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's voice was hurt. It was obvious. And by the gods, it pained Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if she could feel her insides bleeding from the stab Agatha's voice had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like what?” Rio whispered. “I'm just asking, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was silent for a while, and that made Rio walk faster toward her car. She slid in and closed the door, then exhaled a breath she hadn't even realized she'd been holding.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I see you? Please, just say yes or no. I'll answer any question you have.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha said that, a tear ran down Rio's face, resting at the edge of her chin. She wiped it away with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.” Rio said as she started the engine. “Ah—I'm heading home now. Can you come to my place? If that's okay? I don't really have the urge to go out... if that's okay with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, yes, of course. I'll be there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great. See you then.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She ended the call and exhaled a deep shaky breath. Her eyes started producing the tears she despised. She couldn't cry, at least not here.
    </p>
    <p>
     But
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     , that voice. The weight behind Agatha's tone, something hidden, something carefully concealed, yet despite Agatha's efforts of hidding it, Rio heard it, and it hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     A knock on the window jolted her from her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice. She was holding her phone to her ear, pointing at it. Rio glanced at her own phone and saw Alice's name flashing on the screen. She lowered the window.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, why didn't you pick up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was calling someone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice studied her for a moment, and Rio felt exposed. Embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I am. Just tired. Long day.” Rio forced the best smile she could muster.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay... You still up for tonight, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “About that... I don't think I'll be able to come. You guys go ahead without me, I have something to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing, really, Alice. I just have to meet someone, that's all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And that ‘someone’ happens to be Agatha Harkness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes widened. Damn you Alice!
    </p>
    <p>
     “No! Why would you say that?? Why would I meet Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to sound as defensive as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, sweetheart...” Alice looked like she was about to say something else, but at the last second, she changed her mind. Instead, she smiled—that bright, knowing smile of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing. Just take care, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. You too.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio drove home, her mind is a mess. What would she do once she saw Agatha? What would she say? What would Agatha say? What would they do?
    </p>
    <p>
     So many whats, yet nothing was clear. She'd catch an idea, and the next second she'd dismiss it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had no idea how to handle situations like this. And it was stupid—so, so stupid—to ask Agatha to come to her place, to be alone with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have suggested a restaurant. A goddamn bar. Somewhere crowded, somewhere where she could focus on anything other than Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     But honestly... Would she even focus on anything else if Agatha was there? No. That is one of the impossible things in the world. Because even in her absence, Rio hadn't been able to focus on anything else. Who was she kidding? No one but herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She arrived at the discomfort of her depressing house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hung up her coat, kicked off her shoes near the door, then headed straight to the liquor cabinet. A glass of wine would help her relax a little before Agatha's arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lay on the couch, a glass in hand, feeling her muscles loosen slightly as she let herself sink into the cushions. She stared at the ceiling for minutes. Voices in her head whispered. Suggested things. The clothes on her body felt uncomfortable, these jeans weren't made for lounging.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she got up, took a sip of wine, and went upstairs to change into something more comfortable. When she came back, she sat in the same spot on the couch, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Waiting
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes passed. No sign of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     They hadn't agreed on a specific time. Should she send a message? No.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd be here any minute. Or any hour.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour passed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hated waiting. No, she despised it. Especially waiting without knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She rose to her feet and poured herself another glass of wine. Agatha would get here whenever she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio...
    </p>
    <p>
     Had to pretend she wasn't waiting impatiently. Like lava wasn't running through her veins. Like she wasn’t on the verge of erupting.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As she finished the second glass and was about to pour a third, a knock on the door snapped her attention away. She looked up, setting the glass down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried not to hurry her steps, but the anticipation was agonizing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking a deep breath, she placed her hand on the door handle and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first thing she saw was Agatha's blue eyes—then the darkness beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi.” Agatha greeted, her voice was low.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi. Come on in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped aside, and Agatha walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
     No warm embrace. No kiss. No anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio forced herself to stay calm, to suppress the burning inside her, the longing, the ache of seeing that beautiful face after a week, the pain of witnessing the exhaustion in those delicate features.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha walked a few steps then she froze in her motion. Rio closed the door, then walked toward the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't follow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come, sit.” Rio said, eyes fixed on Agatha's face, searching, but finding nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio... I'm sorry.” Agatha finally said, standing still in her place. “I know it's been a week, but I really was busy. With so much. I'm not trying to justify ghosting you. I just... I just want to let you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio remained standing near the couch, neither sitting nor moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You could have said something. Sent a message. Anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice was soft. Her eyes were still on Agatha, who for some reason, refused to meet them. And Rio didn't like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. I couldn't.” Agatha murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You couldn't call me? Reply to one of my messages?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's tone rose slightly, unintended.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha still wasn't looking at her. She looked everywhere but at her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, Look at me.” Rio stepped closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remained still. Frozen, not a single motion, as if something unseen held her in place. She was silent, like she wanted to speak but couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inched forward, putting enough space between them. Space she had forced herself to keep. Because if it were up to her? She would embrace Agatha right here. Hold her as tightly as she could. Shower her with kisses and every feeling she had for the woman standing before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, after what felt like forever, Agatha finally looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And god, her eyes. Something in that gaze struck Rio's heart. Pain. Guilt. Something more, something Rio couldn't even name.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—I wasn't here.” Agatha's voice was barely above a whisper. “I was in Paris this past week. I had something important to do there. I wanted to call you, but I couldn't.” Agatha said, looking directly into Rio's eyes. “It's still not an excuse for disappearing for a week. And I'm sorry Rio, I really am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt panic building inside her with every word. What had kept Agatha so busy? What had made her look so tired?
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to stay calm, even as the panic clawed at her insides, threatening to drag her under.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed hard, ignoring the ache twisting inside her as she cleared her throat. But her heart was pounding too fast and her stomach burning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's okay.” She heard herself, she knew how she sounded, but she tried not to focus on it. Tried not to focus on the pain growing inside her the longer she looked at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, if she were alone, she might have been able to deal with this.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head spun and the room tilted. She squeezed her eyes shut, and the next second she felt fingertips, brushing against her cheekbone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, are you okay?” Agatha's voice laced with concern. Her thumb stroking so gently, so beautifully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes... yes, I am.” Rio said as she opened her eyes, forcing a faint, artificial smile onto her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next second, the overwhelming weight crashed down on her. The pain of the past week caught up all at once. Her breathing turned unsteady, she couldn't get enough oxygen into her lungs, and the next thing she knew, she was on her knees, struggling to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, are you okay? Talk to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha dropped to the floor beside her, panic lacing her voice. But Rio couldn't respond, she couldn't even process what Agatha was saying. Her head spun like a goddamn wheel out of control, her vision blurred, black spots floated in front of her eyes. The lack of oxygen suffocating her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Agatha's hands on her shoulders. She heard her voice, thick with concern, but the words, she couldn't understand them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, can you hear me? Baby, please say something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head hung low, staring at nothing, before she could fall completely, Agatha pulled her close, holding Rio's weak body against her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Trying to soothe her, to chase the panic away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head rested on Agatha's chest while her torso lay against her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha embraced her tightly, one hand stroking Rio's hair gently, the other rubbing slow circles on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Offering warmth and comfort. Offering herself. Agatha whispered words, soft and pleading, but Rio still couldn't hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on Rio, please just breathe with me. You'll be okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This—
    </p>
    <p>
     This was the first sentence Rio was able to make out, she was regaining some consciousness. Some control over her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm here baby. I'm here. Just breathe with me. Please. Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio forced herself to follow Agatha's voice. Slow, deep breaths, one then another. Pulling oxygen into her lungs, to reach her brain and regain some balance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands never stopped moving, never left her. She kept stroking gently. Kept holding her,
     <em>
      grounding
     </em>
     her.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few seconds passed, and Rio's vision returned to normal. Her hearing sharpened. She could hear Agatha's heartbeat, loud and rapid, pounding right against her ear. She could feel Agatha's warmth. Smell her scent. Hear her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you please say something?” Agatha voice trembled, as if a sob was trapped in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to speak, wanted to tell her she was okay, but the words wouldn't come. So she did the only thing she could do. She wrapped her arms around Agatha's waist, held onto her. It had to be uncomfortable for Agatha. Rio thought. Sitting on the floor, nearly lying on it, with Rio's body resting against hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the moment Rio held her, Agatha held her tighter. Pulling her even closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep breathing for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head, burying her face in Agatha's neck, breathing in her scent—Violet and warmth and
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     . Breathing, exhaling warm breaths against her neck, so Agatha could feel her breathing, to make sure Rio was okay with every breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seconds passed, then Rio pulled away slightly, her eyes meeting Agatha's, those exhausted, beautiful blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry about that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Rio managed a real smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifted, sitting on her heels. She reached out, cupping Rio's face in both hands. She tilted her head down, pressing a soft kiss to Rio's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I'm sorry.
     </em>
     ” A kiss to her closed eyes. “
     <em>
      I'm sorry
     </em>
     .” Her nose. “
     <em>
      I'm sorry.
     </em>
     ” Her left cheek. “
     <em>
      I'm sorry.
     </em>
     ” The right one.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally met Rio's gaze, her eyes glistened, tears hanging like glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio reached up, wanting to touch her. Wanting to tell her she didn't have to be sorry, but before she could speak, Agatha leaned in, whispering an “
     <em>
      I'm sorry
     </em>
     ” near Rio's lips making her feel the warmth of it. Then Agatha kissed her. Tender. Sweet. Apologetic. Pouring everything into the kiss, every I'm sorry she couldn't say. Every I'm sorry Rio couldn't hear. The kiss lasted minutes. Maybe hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then breathless, they pulled apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood first and reached her hands out, palms up, silently asking for Rio's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio placed her palm in Agatha's and she pulled her up gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they were face-to-face, Agatha embraced her again—a soft, tender, warm and a safe embrace. Rio remained silent, only feeling the emotions Agatha was trying to make her feel, each one of them. Her head rested on Agatha's shoulder while their hands secured around each other's waists.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a couple of minutes, Rio kissed Agatha's covered shoulder, then pulled back, their hands still resting on each other's hips as their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you wanna sit?” Rio asked, her voice a low murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. But are you okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good,” Agatha said, her thumbs moving up and down on Rio's hips. “Can you tell me what happened? Hmm? It's okay if you don't want to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's nothing, really. Just a panic attack, don't worry”
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Agatha's hands moved up to rest on Rio's face. “
     <em>
      I'm sorry.
     </em>
     ” She whispered, looking into Rio's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you apologizing?” Rio asked, tightening her hold on Agatha's hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why not, angel?” Agatha's thumb stroked her cheek gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes, feeling Agatha's touch on her face and on her hip, even through the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure you're fine?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I'm really fine now.” Rio leaned closer and kissed the apple of Agatha's cheek. “Let's sit?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She took Agatha's hand, and they sat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The situation between them now started to feel familiar, but the heat of it was growing. They gazed at each other for a while, until Agatha broke the silence before it stretched too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, the work never ends.” Rio tried to dismiss, but Agatha clearly wasn't satisfied with that response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You haven't been sleeping, have you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I try to get just enough to get through the day.” Rio said with a smile. “You also look exhausted. Are you alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am, don't worry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes of silence settled between them. They only kept looking at each other—neither knowing what they were searching for in the other's features, neither knowing how to voice the words sitting on the tips of their tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What were you doing in Paris?” Rio asked, trying not to put any pressure on the question. Because she knew something had happened there, even if she didn't know exactly what.
    </p>
    <p>
     And her suspicion was confirmed by the shift in Agatha's expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remained silent, but something flickered in her gaze. Rio stayed quiet too, waiting eagerly for Agatha to say something. But minutes passed, and still, nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened her mouth, then shut it again, only looking at Rio with those tired blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can we talk about this later?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course,” Rio said, tucking a strand of Agatha's dark brown hair behind her ear. “Whenever you want.” She looked into those enchanting blue lakes. “I'm gonna get us some water. Do you want anything else?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, water is fine. Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up to grab two bottles of water, then returned to find Agatha still sitting in the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was worried. This was the first time she had seen her like this—pale and exhausted. She wanted to know what was going on inside Agatha's head, to know what's wrong and try to stitch the wounds. But at the same time, she didn't want to push. She knew what it felt like to be forced into something.
    </p>
    <p>
     But god, it hurt—watching those tired, beautiful features while being helpless to do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     She handed Agatha the bottle and sat beside her, closer than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You should rest.” Rio said, watching as Agatha drank from the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha removed it from her lips and closed it, a smirk appearing as she wiped the corners of her mouth with her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What a sight...
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio forced the thought away, focusing instead on figuring out why Agatha was smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're the one who should rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio narrowed her eyes. Then, her index finger moved slowly under Agatha's right eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your beautiful eyes are tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “You're adorable, you know that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled as she kept moving her fingers gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you don't want to rest, then can I run a bath for you? Then we could eat” Rio said, her gaze drifting to those full lips before returning to Agatha's eyes. “Hmm? I won't take no for an answer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure about that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure about what? Running you a bath so you can relax a little, then finally getting the chance to eat with you? Yes, I'm sure about that, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seemed to hesitate, but Rio didn't let her. “Please don't overthink it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled—a smile that reached her eyes, and it was one of the best things Rio had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha said, and that smile didn't leave her beautiful face. Rio wanted to see it every day.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She got up to prepare the bath while Agatha stood in the doorway. Rio could feel Agatha's eyes on her—how could she not?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, so you have everything you need here. I'll put some clothes in the guest room, and if you need anything, just call me. I'll be in the room by the stairs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as Rio finished speaking, Agatha leaned in, their faces mere inches apart. She rested a hand on the back of Rio's neck, then kissed her soothingly, tasting her with tenderness, pouring so much love and gratitude into that kiss. And Rio felt it all, it was consuming her in the sweetest way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back slightly, “Thank you,” she whispered. Rio only smiled, kissed Agatha's lips again briefly, then stepped outside and closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed one of her bands t-shirts, a pair of sweatpants and some decent shorts, leaving the decision to Agatha, along with a pair of new underwear. She placed them on the bed in the guest room and went to her indoor garden.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat among her plants, letting the quiet settle around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fifteen minutes passed, and a knock on the door made her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped inside, and god—seeing Agatha in her t-shirt and shorts did something to her stomach. Agatha's hair was tied up in a damp bun, and she looked relaxed, just as Rio had hoped. She stared at her for so long that she almost missed the amazed look on Agatha's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which one is the main one?” Agatha asked, her gaze sweeping over the white-colored room. Green plants stretched from the ceiling to the floor, vases overflowing with greenery, floor-to-ceiling windows letting in streams of sunlight. Two small windows in the ceiling allowed some plants to spill through, creating a dreamy, living view. In the center sat a velvet green couch with a small table in front of it, a stack of books beside a bottle of wine and two glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled as she stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know, really. Both spaces are dear to me, so I can't decide.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and kept wandering, her expression filled with wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes landed on the guitar leaning against the couch, and Rio noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you play?” Agatha asked as she approached.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You could say that. I haven't played in a long time.” Rio admitted, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled as they sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Aren't you full of surprises? Can you play something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you want me to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course I do!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed—Agatha was far too alluring.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, but give me a minute to remember something I can play.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, looking at Rio adoringly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The last time I actually played was when I was a freshman in college.” Rio said, setting the guitar on her lap and holding it close to her body with both hands. “I used to be in a band with my friends in high school,” She chuckled as she tested the strings. “Now I only play for my plants.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her face to look at Agatha, and was completely flabbergasted by the way Agatha was looking at her. Her eyes were full of something Rio couldn't name or recognize, but she felt. It wrapped around her warmly. The way Agatha was smiling at her—completely dumbstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A band?” Agatha said. “Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't help but smile as warmth spread through her entire body. Agatha was paying attention to everything, looking at her as if she were something precious.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, a band. In highschool—me, Alice and two other lesbians.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, and the sound warmed Rio from the inside out. It was one of the sweetest sounds she had ever heard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was the band's name? Lesbians in High School?” Agatha teased, laughter still visible in her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Close. It was The Scissors.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No way!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, and if the school had known what it meant at the time, they wouldn't have let us play. But we were safe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their laughter blended together, warm and full. Rio looked at Agatha adoringly—she would never get enough of that sound, those melodies of joy spilling from Agatha's throat, making Rio weak every single time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat and looked at Agatha once more before letting her gaze settle on the guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a song called Who's Your Baby Now by Mark Knopfler. I used to sing this song a lot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're going to sing too?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only smiled before she started playing, the rhythms flowing effortlessly from her fingers, the lyrics coming from a place deep inside her—one she knew by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      The rock you stood upon, is broken up and gone
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hey baby, who's your baby now?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      On the slipway of your dream, stands someone else's scheme
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hey baby, who's your baby now?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Your baby now, baby now
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Your baby now, baby now
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     As she finished playing, she set the guitar aside and looked at Agatha—who was already looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say a word, as if no words could capture what was in her mind. Instead she leaned in, cupping Rio's face with both hands before crashing their lips together. The kiss was heated, urgent and necessary. Rio returned it with just as much fire, just as much fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was the first to pull away, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't think I'll ever get enough of this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled and kissed Agatha again—not as heated as before, but just as sweet as the moment itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few minutes passed before Rio spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should we order something to eat? Do you want anything in particular?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not really, I'll get whatever you get.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I know a place that makes the best pizza around here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pizza it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They went downstairs to wait for the food. Rio couldn't help but notice the slight distance in Agatha's expression, something was going on inside her head, and Rio just wanted to steal her from her thoughts, even if just for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached out, placed her hand on Agatha's, and looked at her. That seemed to pull Agatha back, and their eyes met for what felt like the hundredth time in the past few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, have you finished that painting?” Rio asked, smirking with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Actually, yes,” Agatha replied with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Have you changed my nose, though?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, that smile was back again on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did,” She said, her index finger tracing the bridge of Rio's nose down to the tip. Her gaze dropped to Rio's mouth for a second before returning to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smirk on Rio's face didn't fade—if anything, it only grew wider. She started leaning in but a knock on the door made her pause.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the brightest grin, Rio got up to grab their food. She brought the boxes inside and set them on the dining table, then went to call Agatha—who was standing in front of a painting hanging above the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't say anything, she only watched her in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha studied the painting intently, looking at it closely. Rio couldn't help but smile the moment Agatha stood on the tip of her toes, her fingers touched it gently, feeling it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped closer, and Agatha straightened up, turning to face her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is the only painting in your house.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The only one with a spot on a wall.” Rio corrected with a small smile, standing beside Agatha and looking at the painting. “It's my mother's.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's head snapped toward her so fast that Rio felt it before she saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your mother? Who is she?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held Agatha's gaze for a second before looking back at the painting, her arms instinctively folding closer to her middle
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lucía Vidal. She wasn't famous or anything—she only painted in her free time. It was just a hobby, a way to connect with herself.” Rio smiled softly as she resumed. “She once told me ‘Not everything should be out and shared with the world mija. Some things must remain hidden inside so we can enjoy them fully, for the reasons we created them, without any disturbance from the outside.’ Even though my father always tried convincing her to sell her artwork, she never did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's voice softened as she recalled her mother's words the bright smile was still on her face, but despite that, a tear betrayed her, slipping silently down her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, neither of them spoke. Then Rio felt the back of Agatha's hand brushing against her face gently, wiping away the stray tear resting on her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's good.” Agatha murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, she was.” Rio said, still smiling as she turned to look at Agatha. “Come on, let's eat.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They ate as they made small talks, sharing little details here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was finishing what was left in her glass when Agatha spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should go now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes widened instantly as she lifted her head up to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you shouldn't. You could stay here,” she said, trying to mask the disappointment creeping into her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled as she rose from her chair. “Rio, you've done enough already.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't say anything for a moment. She just stared at the glass on the table, fighting the urge to say something she might regret later. Instead, she mirrored Agatha's movement and stood up as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, I'll get your stuff,” Rio said, struggling to meet Agatha's gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     But before she could take a step, she felt Agatha's fingers wrap around her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned to look at her, searching her face, but Rio couldn't quite place the look in Agatha's eyes—like she wanted to say something but couldn't. Rio waited, a full three minutes passed in silence, but Agatha didn't speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, gently, Rio removed Agatha's grip from her wrist and forced a smile onto her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll get them for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She went upstairs, sitting on the bed in the guest room for a moment. Agatha's clothes in her hands. But before she could fully process her thoughts, she heard footsteps. Agatha was standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up immediately and handed her the clothes, but the moment Agatha took them, she let them slip from her grasp, dropping them onto the floor. Then she reached for Rio's hand—the same hand that had just given her the clothes—and pulled her closer. Their lips crashed together, and the taste of wine lingered between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was completely lost in the kiss, but then, suddenly, she pulled back, needing to see Agatha—needing to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared at her for a long, quiet moment, and god, the silence was unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as Rio parted her lips to speak, Agatha guided Rio's hand to her hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You wanted to touch me. Then touch me.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's voice was low, thick with need and hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     For another second, Rio simply just stared at Agatha, then her other hand rested on her other hip. She pulled her in, pressing their bodies together, and kissed her again—fervently, hungrily.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha's lips parted slightly, Rio's tongue slipped inside, deepening the kiss. She tilted her head, desperate to taste more, to feel more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moan that escaped Agatha's throat made Rio dig her fingers deeper into her hips, pulling her impossibly closer, their bodies flush against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     They broke apart briefly—ten seconds to catch their breath—then their lips met again, their tongues tangling with renewed urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started moving them backward. Once they stepped outside the room, their lips parted again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bedroom,” Rio said, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, then kissed her lips. They kept kissing, touching, pressing into each other until they reached the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed the door open with her back, then maneuvered Agatha's body by her hips, guiding her onto the king sized-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their lips parted for the fourth time. Rio stood straight, peeling off her t-shirt. Once it was over her head she looked at Agatha—who was propped up on her elbows, her chest rising and falling rapidly. The blueness of her eyes was almost entirely swallowed by the darkness of lust. Rio leaned in and kissed her briefly before straightening again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she unclasped her bra, sliding the straps off her shoulders, letting the fabric fall somewhere onto the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped closer, capturing Agatha's lips once more as she motioned for her to lie her body completely on the bed. Agatha obeyed, resting her head on Rio's pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was on top of her, kissing every part of Agatha's face she could plant a kiss on, savoring the warmth of her skin beneath her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she whispered in Agatha's ear, her voice thick with desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't tell you how goddamn beautiful you look wearing my clothes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed and sucked her neck, and the whimpers escaping Agatha's lips made Rio's body burn with arousal.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Agatha's palms cupped Rio's breast, and Rio moaned against Agatha's neck at the contact. Agatha traced slow, invisible circles around her nipple, sending shivers cascading through Rio's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back to look at Agatha before gripping the hem of the t-shirt, lifting it above her body. She leaned in again, kissing her throat, her collarbones and the exposed skin of her heaving chest. Rio cupped Agatha's breasts over the piece of fabric that was still there, sucking and kissing, leaving hickeys on that milky skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a moment, Rio reached to unclasp Agatha's bra. As she pulled the straps off, she was met with a breathtaking sight—those gorgeous, perfect breasts. Rio looked at Agatha who was already watching her. She cupped both breasts in her hands, her thumbs teasing each nipple, pressing firmly, then gently, then firmly again. Her eyes were locked onto Agatha's face, studying every expression that flickered across it.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few seconds, she lowered her mouth, enveloping one hardned nipple, sucking, kissing and circling it with her tongue while her hand continued teasing the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled back, admiring her work—the glistening trail of her saliva on Agatha's pink nipple—before leaning in to give the other one the same attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, put that mouth where I need it,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pleaded, her voice thick with need. Rio only smirked and continued her work on Agatha's breasts, worshipping them properly. Then She sat up, leaning closer to Agatha's face, their lips a breath apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Patience” Rio murmured before placing a soft kiss on Agatha's swollen lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed her way down Agatha's abdomen, gripping the waistband of her shorts and underwear and sliding them down in one smooth motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's gaze lingered on that C–section scar just above Agatha's pubic bone. She stared at it for a second too long then leaned in and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She placed both hands on the inside of Agatha's thighs and gently spread them, positioning herself between Agatha's legs. The sight of Agatha's dripping core sent a shiver through her as she felt herself getting more wet every passing second. She pressed soft kisses to the inside of Agatha's thigh as her index and middle fingers slid up and down her slit, drawing a low, heated moan from Agatha's throat that made Rio's breath hitch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Applying just enough pressure, Rio pressed her thumb against Agatha's clit, making her entire body tremble. She took one of Agatha's legs and draped it over her shoulder to give herself better access. As she did, two of her fingers slipped inside Agatha's heated core.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Ah, fuck, Rio—
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started thrusting, her fingers moving in and out, finding the spot that made Agatha moan the most delicious sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     A second later, her mouth replaced her thumb, her lips and tongue lavishing attention on Agatha's clit while her fingers continued their rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh my fucking god
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped, her hand flying to Rio's head, pushing her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     At that, Rio slid a third finger inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, fuck, fuck—keep going, keep going—oh my fucking god...
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned, each word breaking apart with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could feel how close Agatha was, so she maintained the same relentless pace—thrusting, sucking, consuming her completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's orgasm crashed her over only a few seconds later, her walls clenching around Rio's fingers as her muscular thighs trapped Rio's head. But even with the limited space, Rio kept going.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's body trembled, her hips jerking as she tried to pull Rio away from between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuckfuckfuck
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio didn't stop—not until she had wrung out every last aftershock of pleasure from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha's muscles loosened. Rio sat up, slipping her fingers out gently and sucking them clean.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come here, you,” Agatha murmured, still trying to steady her breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled and moved up, her hands resting on the sides of Agatha's body. She studied her for a second, then crashed their lips together in a deep, lingering kiss, their mouths sharing the taste of Agatha's pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of their bodies, regained their calmness. Agatha sat straight, her back against the headboard, while Rio sat on her heels in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take those off,” Agatha said, eyeing Rio's sweatpants. Rio quickly removed both, her sweatpants and underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled Rio closer, their eyes locking for a moment before their lips met in another kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled back slightly, and Agatha's gaze dropped, trailing down from Rio's breasts to her abs before returning to her darkened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on. Sit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tapped her thigh. Rio looked at her for a moment before straddling Agatha's leg. The moment her dripping core made contact with the flesh of Agatha's thigh, Rio's throat produced a sound foreign even to her—a mix between a moan, a cry, and a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     She began moving her hips, but Agatha was quick to stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me look at you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whined in protest, but Agatha's grip on her hips was firm. She glanced down at Agatha, who was staring at her with awe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, you're perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Agatha's hands cupped Rio's breast, making Rio even more impatient. But she didn't move, she couldn't interrupt the look of pure reverence on Agatha's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Move for me, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Baby...
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started rocking her hips against Agatha's thigh. The sight she had witnessed minutes ago had already pushed her close to the edge, and her orgasm was building at an insane speed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's fingers teased and pulled at her nipple, sending even more pleasure through her. Her hips moved faster, chasing that orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I'm close. Fuck
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Mhmm
     </em>
     , come for me baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Seconds later, her orgasm tore through, flooding her body with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could recover, Agatha swiftly lifted her and sat her down on the bed. She straightened her position against the headboard and motioned for Rio to sit between her legs, parting them to make space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's back rested against Agatha's front, her legs spread wide on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Agatha's fingers gliding up and down her pussy, teasing her as soft kisses landed on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha's finger made contact with her clit, Rio's legs twitched, and a low moan escaped her involuntarily. She was still sensitive from her previous orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's lips moved higher, sucking gently on that sweet, sensitive spot just below her ear. Another moan slipped from Rio's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard,” Agatha murmured against her ear, her warm breath making Rio shiver, shutting her eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's right thumb circled her clit while her left hand slid down, fingers dipping inside her. The moment Agatha pushed two fingers into her, Rio let out a deep, rich moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh fuck Agatha.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha started with a slow, teasing rhythm, but within seconds, she was thrusting into her tight, dripping pussy with relentless speed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Jesus fucking christ. Fuck I'm gonna—
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hold it for me, angel,” Agatha whispered, pressing another kiss to Rio's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I can't. God, I can't.
     </em>
     ” Rio breath was ragged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Yeah?
     </em>
     ” Agatha's pace quickened—something Rio hadn't even thought was possible. Her head dropped back, and a loud moan ripped from her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      HolyfuckAgatha.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I want to hear you moaning my name every fucking day, angel.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's fingers curled just right, hitting that spot Rio knew all too well, applying more and more pressure. She felt her walls clench so tight, and before she could say anything, her body reacted on its own. Her hands gripped Agatha's thighs for dear life as a forceful gush of her orgasm splashed out, soaking the mattress wet with her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was practically screaming at this point, her orgasm exploding through her—she had never felt this amount of pleasure at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is...” Agatha murmured after pressing a kiss to Rio's shoulder. “
     <em>
      So goddamn beautiful.
     </em>
     ” Another kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, Agatha,
     </em>
     ” Rio panted, her breath still shallow from her loud moans.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once her body recovered, her grip on Agatha's thighs loosened. She had held on so tightly that the skin was flushed red. Turning to face Agatha, she rested her head against her chest, securing herself in a tight embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to the top of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're staying,” Rio said, her hold tightening. It was somewhere between a question and a statement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They held each other in silence for some time, wrapped in warmth, their bodies pressed together as the scent of sex and sweat filled the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt it—the way Agatha was taking deep breaths, one after another, as if preparing herself to speak, only to stop herself for minutes at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I...I went to Paris because it was...” Agatha hesitated. “It's been ten years since I lost my son. Nicholas.” She took another breath before continuing, “Every year, I hold a memorial for him in the house we once lived in. Just me and the memory of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt Agatha's grip tighten around her arm, felt the way her chest rose and fell heavily, heard the pain-laced tone of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I decided this year that I should move on from that past—to leave that house and those memories behind, and just come back here.” Agatha sighed. “But I... I couldn't. I couldn't leave everything behind. I couldn't just pretend that I moved on, that I was okay with all of this. So, I booked my flight and went there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted Rio's face so their eyes could meet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It wasn't that I wanted to ignore you... God, Rio, you don't know how much you mean to me. But I just couldn't, I'm sor—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't apologize. Don't even think of saying that word,” Rio interrupted, cupping Agatha's face. “I'm the one who's sorry. I shouldn't have made this all about me. I'm sorry about your son, Agatha... I'm truly sorry.” At that, Rio's eyes welled up against her will, tears slipping down her cheeks, landing on Agatha's bare skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know what to say. Hell, I don't even know what to do. But what I do know is that I want to make you feel okay. I want you to be sure that I'll be right next to you whenever you want or need me. I'll make sure I'm worthy of your trust, to let you know that you can always come back to me. And whatever you're feeling, I will be there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's gaze never wavered from Agatha's as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seeing your exhausted, beautiful face, seeing how tired you are... I just wanted to—
     <em>
      God
     </em>
     , I'm sorry, Agatha. Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't even sure she was speaking coherently—her words trumbled from her lips, raw and unfiltered. But they still felt like they weren't enough. She would have this conversation again when she is sober, when she could properly express what she felt and what she truly wanted to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just let me hold you for now. I don't want anything else.” Agatha whispered as she stroked Rio's back gently. She kissed her forehead, then held her close to her chest again, embracing her as tightly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     They lay there, wrapped in each other's arms, their bodies molding into one. Their fingers traced feather-light touches over bare skin, memorizing, soothing. Rio listened to the steadying rhythm of Agatha's heartbeat, the storm within her finally settling into peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't long before Agatha's breath evened out in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head slightly to look at her—at how peaceful, soft and heartbreakingly beautiful she looked like this. Rio pressed a tender kiss to Agatha's cheek, before laying her head back down against her chest, letting the warmth of Agatha's body and the steady beat of her heart lull her into sleep.

    <p>
     The first thing Rio felt as she regained consciousness in the morning was fingertips on her bare back. Touches so calculated, so delicate, so warm and precise, touching her skin softly and tenderly. Fingertips tracing the brown moles on her toned skin, as if committing their placement to memory. Tender fingertips moving carefully from spot to a spot, as if their owner was afraid of waking her up, as if those fingertips feared pressing a little too hard, shattering the stars scattered across her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt it—the warmth of the touch drifting, fingers moving softly from the top of her spine down to her pelvic bone, stopping just above the duvet that's covering her lower body. Then, the fingers would travel up again, following the same path, leaving behind the same warmth and lingering effect.
    </p>
    <p>
     The touches are featherlight, too caring, too soft and gentle, forcing Rio's eyes to remain closed so she could feel them fully on her skin, staying in the present moment for as long as possible. It felt a little selfish, to consume all the safety these touches provided.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her cheek was pressed against the pillow, arms tucked beneath it. After a heartbeat, Rio moved her head closer to where that heavenly, soothing scent lingered. The moment her face rested against the soft skin, the scent filled her nose, rushed to her brain, and made her open her eyes slightly. The first thing she saw was Agatha's navel. Rio smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     The luminous skin that was glowing, warmed her more than the sunbeams sneaking through the slightly parted curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lifting her head slightly, Rio looked at Agatha through her eyelashes. Agatha seemed focused, her gaze trailing over every inch of Rio's bare back—every mole, every freckle, every fading scar, every neglected spot that had gone unnoticed for years.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio just watched her and felt her touches, the smile on her lips not fading only growing wider. Waking up to such a sight filled her with pure happiness. Looking at Agatha first thing in the morning warmed her heart, made it pound in her chest, beating an upbeat melody with every thrum.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning,” Rio said, her voice still thick with sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment those two words left her lips, Agatha's movements stilled on her skin, as if she had been caught doing something wrong, something forbidden, something she shouldn't be doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio waited for Agatha to look back at her, and when she finally did, Rio moved her hand from her side and placed it over Agatha's, resting just above her back, as if encouraging her to continue the quiet masterpiece she had been painting with her fingertips. But Agatha didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A second or two passed before Agatha finally spoke, her beautiful smile gracing her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat beside Rio's laying body, her wild dark hair cascading over both shoulders, trailing down to her chest. Those ocean-like blue eyes gazed down at Rio. That beautiful, delicious mouth curved into a smile. That sharp, perfect nose—one that Rio found herself growing addicted to looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned and simply stared at Agatha for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What time is it? Why are you up already?” Rio asked, warmth and softness lacing her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ten in the morning,” Agatha answered, still looking at her. Their gaze held steady, stretching time between them, until Rio finally blinked, disrupting the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio buried her face in Agatha's abdomen, her smile is still visible, imprinted on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why? What's wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha asked, her other hand moving to land gently on Rio's hair, stroking it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have a lecture in half an hour,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio mumbled, her face still pressed against that soft skin. “I could cancel it, though.” She lifted her head, her gaze returning to Agatha. To that ethereal being sitting by her side, on her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You shouldn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's okay. I was already planning on canceling it anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence wrapped around them for a few moments as their eyes remained locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something flickered in Agatha's gaze, something undefined, something so out of reach and beyond explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio...”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha whispered her name, as if the two syllables had slipped past her lips without permission.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmm?” Rio hummed, her dark brown eyes still locked onto the blue ones, sailing in them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's fingers resumed their soft touches on Rio's skin, but something had shifted. The touches now felt anxious, unsure. Her fingertips transferring their uncertainty to Rio's body. As if Agatha wasn't sure of something, something Rio was desperate to uncover, eager to lift the weight of it onto her own shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze abandoned Rio's and settled on her own hand, traveling across Rio's back, which only made Rio even more curious about the reason behind the hesitation radiating from Agatha's whole being.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a heartbeat or so, “Nothing.” Agatha said with a smile, still watching the journey of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt a flicker of disappointment. She had expected something else to come out, something more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind drifted to last night, replaying the sounds and images in her head. Agatha had shared something personal with her, and how Rio had reacted?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind spiraled, dissecting every word, every action, scolding herself in the depths of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did her reaction lack empathy?
    </p>
    <p>
     Were her words not enough?
    </p>
    <p>
     Had she made it about herself again?
    </p>
    <p>
     Had she said too much without an honest meaning behind?
    </p>
    <p>
     One thing was certain—her reaction hadn't been enough. Her words hadn't been enough. And now, it felt too late to fix it, too late to say what she really wanted to say, to actually lift the weight of the burden instead of just saying she would.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thoughts and voices inside her gnawed at her, bite after bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Agatha was thinking the same. Maybe her hesitation came from knowing and expecting how Rio would react once she spoke her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart pounded in her chest, loud, rapid and uneasy. The soothing touches on her back did nothing to calm her. Tears began forming in her eyes. She wanted to avoid the embarrassment of being too weak, of having her own mind turn against her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her gaze from Agatha's face and buried her face in the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt those fingertips leaving flames in their wake, the warmth they had once provided now turning into something scalding.
    </p>
    <p>
     She managed to hold back her tears, maybe one or two escaped, soaking into the pillow, but she managed holding the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     After forcing a smile onto her face, she lifted her head again. And the sight before her was unreal. Looking at Agatha like this felt like witnessing something divine. Forbidden. Out of this world. Something out of her league. Something she didn't deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you turn around?” Agatha asked, her voice low, ringing in Rio's ears, sending waves of electricity through her entire body, only to settle into a slow-burning blaze in her stomach, making it clench.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked despite the heat rising within her as she looked at Agatha and turned around to lay on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard it—the way Agatha's breath hitched, trapping itself in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio looked at Agatha, something struck her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha was looking at her exposed skin... no one had ever looked at her like that before. And that realization ignited a fire within her, wild and untamed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her chest heaved as Agatha continued to look at her with that gaze. And it was obvious, obvious to them both, the way Rio's chest rose and fell, the way the air between them thickened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite Agatha's lingering stare at her breasts, despite the way she swallowed so hard Rio could hear it, despite the heat radiating off her, sending shivers coursing through her body—Agatha didn't touch her. She didn't run her slender fingers across the exposed skin before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just
     <em>
      looked
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you—will you remove this, please?” Agatha asked, pointing a finger toward the earthy green duvet covering Rio's lower body, though her eyes remained fixed on Rio's upper half.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked as she kicked the duvet off with her legs, letting it fall to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     propping herself up on her elbows, she turned her head to the side, Agatha was still looking at her. Wetting her dry lips over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nearly moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because that look in Agatha's eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was too hot. Undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something that couldn't be ignored. Something that made her stomach clench.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha was only looking...
    </p>
    <p>
     Drifting her eyes up and down. Taking in Rio's face, then down to her toes, repeatedly. Letting her gaze linger in certain places, wetting her lips when her eyes landed on particular curves. And it was too much. Too much to handle, because Rio could feel herself getting more turned on with every passing second, just from a look. A look that wasn't normal, from a goddess of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed down her whimpers, feeling them echo inside her. She licked her lips more than once, but to no avail, she needed Agatha's lips to water hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next second, Rio felt Agatha moving off the bed, standing at the edge of it in all the glory of her naked body. It made it impossible for Rio to focus on anything, even more impossible when Agatha locked eyes with her. Rio felt her heart drop into her stomach. It was all too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn't speaking, only the combined heavy breaths of them both filling the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was
     <em>
      looking
     </em>
     , as if studying something, memorizing the position, feeling it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lift your leg up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words nearly sent Rio over the edge. It wasn't a question. It was much like, an order?
    </p>
    <p>
     The tone of Agatha's voice and the look in her eyes were making everything much harder. And the fact that Rio was so painfully aware of how wet she was made her hesitate. It would be embarrassing. Because Agatha had literally done nothing. She had only looked at her...
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio bent her knee up anyway, ignoring the embarrassment curling in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't miss the way Agatha's eyes widened, the way she licked her lips the moment Rio moved.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze met Rio's for only a brief second before it dropped again, taking in the position Rio was in—laying before her, as if offering herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet Rio didn't feel exposed. She didn't feel embarrassed. She felt overwhelmed. The silence of Agatha was overwhelming. The way she was looking at her was consuming. Making her feel vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood there, in silence, examining Rio's body—every part her eyes could reach, every spot, every bit of skin and hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt herself dripping, and she clenched her eyes shut. The idea of being almost fully open like this. Being looked at like this. Being studied like this, it excited her in a way she had never experienced before. And she was so goddamn aware that the reason wasn't the act, wasn't the position, wasn't the fact that she was laying on her bed, helpless, as those blue eyes devoured her. The reason was who those blue eyes belonged to. Who was standing at the edge of her bed, looking at her like she's a goddamn goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha Harkness.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Holy fuck
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     ...”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes. The way Agatha said her name made her body twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     After looking at her for a few more seconds, Agatha climbed onto the bed as Rio sat back against the headboard. Agatha leaned in, crashing their lips together. Her hand grabbed Rio's neck, pulling her closer, deepening the kiss as much as possible. Their lips parted only for a second, just long enough to breathe, before finding each other again, the heat between them growing intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     Foreheads pressing together, breaths mingling, Rio's hand resting on Agatha's forearm as she looked into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you....
     <em>
      Fuck
     </em>
     ... Can you touch me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio panted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's pupils dilated. She kissed Rio again, her hand drifting lower. The moment her fingers found the hot silk, they both moaned into each other's mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my fucking god, Rio... You're soaked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     , just fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned at that.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They tangled in bed yet again. Bodies pressing together, heat consuming them. The safety of Agatha's embrace was terrifying. How normal it felt was abnormal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to push the thoughts away, tried to live in the moment instead. In the present. Which was being held in Agatha's arms. Being able to fill her senses with her scent. Feeling her completely. Because a voice in the back of her head kept whispering that this warmth won't last. She held Agatha's middle tighter, pulling her as close as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should shower,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio murmured against Agatha's skin, and Agatha hummed in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     Should she add the word
     <em>
      together
     </em>
     ? Or would that make her sound too needy? God, if only she knew what Agatha was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Together, you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart stopped for a beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed a kiss to her temple.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I really need to go afterward.” Another kiss. “I'll come back another time. I promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head slightly to look at Agatha's face. Sincerity was written all over it, reassuring in every way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed in bed a few minutes longer, wrapped in the warmth of embracing one another. Feeling the kisses on their skins. Filling each other's ears with whispered words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, hand in hand, they stepped into the shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned the water on, and as it began cascading down, soaking her body, she felt Agatha's arms wrap around her waist, pressing their bodies together. Agatha's lips met her shoulder, again and again, before trailing soft kisses all the way down her spine. Nothing was rushed, every kiss was slow, deliberate, calming.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands held Rio's hips securely, her thumbs stroking the skin gently as the warm water streamed over them both.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How did you get that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's voice was soft as her thumb brushed over a fading scar on Rio's lower back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes for a moment, leaning back against Agatha, pressing her body into hers. Agatha tightened her hold, pulling Rio to her front even closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A stab from the back. Quite literally.” Rio chuckled awkwardly. “Four years ago, my ex—she wasn't my girlfriend at the time, was being attacked by some guy at a bar. I stepped in, pushed him away, and he fell to the ground. I was facing her, checking if she was okay, and the next thing I knew, I felt a goddamn knife go into my body.” Rio chuckled again, but Agatha's grip around her middle only tightened. “And...” Rio let out a breathy laugh before continuing. “It was the same fucking guy she'd been cheating on me with for months. I didn't even recognize him at first, the thought only hit me two months ago.” Rio laughed. Saying it out loud felt unreal. Hearing her own voice make sense of how fucked up the whole thing was—God, she must look so goddamn dumb right now.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment her laughter faded, after laughing like a hysterical fool, Agatha turned her around by the hips and locked eyes with her. Rio's smile disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cupped her face with both hands and leaned in, whispering, “
     <em>
      I'm sorry
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she kissed her lips—softly, deeply, pouring into the kiss what words couldn't say. And Rio felt it. She felt everything Agatha's lips and tongue were trying to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes burned. She shut them tightly, but hot, stinging tears spilled down her cheeks, landing on Agatha's hands. Agatha's thumbs moved up, gently wiping the tears away as she continued kissing Rio, tender, slow, reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
     When their lips parted, their faces remained close, a breath apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes, looking into Agatha's. She smiled, despite the tears Agatha's thumbs kept brushing away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked...
     <em>
      breathtaking
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Her dark hair, wet, clinging to both sides of her face. Water droplets resting on her lashes. Others sliding down the tip of her nose and her chin. Her wet lips looking more delicious, more kissable than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't resist, she leaned in, pressing her lips against Agatha's, her hands traveling to Agatha's hips, smoothing up and down them. When she pulled back again, she was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I really want to wash this goddamn beautiful hair of yours.” She bit her bottom lip, looking straight into Agatha's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then do it,” Agatha murmured with a smirk, her thumbs still stroking Rio's wet cheeks—soaked from both water and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed the rosemary-scented shampoo bottle. She placed a hand on Agatha's hip, squeezing it gently to signal her to turn around. When Agatha did, Rio poured shampoo into her hands and smoothed it into her hair, lathering it slowly, carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a soft moan. Barely audible, but Rio froze mid-motion. Her breath hitched. The sound-so faint, yet so intoxicating—sent a shiver through her. A second passed, then another. She forced herself to keep moving, her fingers gently massaging Agatha's scalp, though her heart pounded with a calm, steady intensity. Because the intimacy wrapping around them wasn't just heat, it was something more, something about how natural it felt to do such an act. And that, more than anything else, made Rio's chest tighten.
    </p>
    <p>
     After completing the task at hand, Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha's waist and rested the side of her face against Agatha's back. Something inside her urged her to not let go, to stay as close to Agatha as possible, to soak in every second with her. She craved the warmth of her body pressed against hers. And it was terrifying. Because she still didn't know what was coming. Agatha had been gone for a week, and Rio had felt weak, mentally and physically.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then what? Every time she thought about it, It made no sense. She still didn't know who Agatha really was. The only thing she did know was that she wanted her near, and more than anything, she wanted to know and understand her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They dried off and stepped out of the shower, after a few more minutes of embracing each other's wet figures, exchanging slow, sloppy kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat on the bed, wrapped in a robe, watching Agatha slip into her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure you don't want some breakfast? Coffee at least?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha zipped her trousers and looked at Rio with a small smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed her hair back and walked toward Rio, leaning down to press a brief kiss to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Another time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, but can I at least...” Rio hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha asked, tucking a strand of hair behind Rio's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, say it.” Agatha whispered, her warm breath brushing Rio's lips, making them part instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know... Can I—Can I drive you to where you need to go? I mean, I know you didn't come in your car yesterday, and I really have nothing better to do, so...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and kissed her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio threw on a sweater and jeans which Agatha described as “charming.” and then they both headed downstairs, stepping outside into the crisp air before sliding into Rio's car.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     They were talking, five minutes away from their destination when Agatha suddenly patted her pockets and hissed, “Shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's wrong?” Rio glanced at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I forgot my phone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, I'll go back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned the car around and drove back to her place. She got out, Agatha following behind her. As Rio approached the door, she reached to open it only to find it already open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her brows knitted in confusion. She was sure she had locked the door before going, twenty minutes ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes flickered to Agatha before she pushed the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what she saw was a fucking haunting nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've got to be kidding me!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's jaw clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How the fuck did you get in here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I know where you keep the spare key.” Jane stood up from the chair and started walking toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get the fuck out, Jane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why don't you answer my calls? I feel like a dog barking just to get your attention, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said, get the fuck out.” Rio's voice came through clenched teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried not to lose her temper. Tried not to yell. Tried not to snap. But who was she kidding? Seeing that bitch standing in front of her made her sick. That woman has some serious fucked-up problems, and she loved dragging Rio into the mud with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just want to talk to you. Also, I did live in this house for three years, so relax. Don't make a big deal out of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I fucking regret the moment you ever stepped foot into this house.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jane laughed. That fucking
     <em>
      annoying
     </em>
     laugh
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her wrist forcefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is the last time I'll say this. Get the fuck out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oof. Bold.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, you heard her. Get out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words came from behind Rio. She turned her head slightly, glancing at Agatha, because that was the first thing she had said in minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's grip loosened at the distraction, so Jane yanked her wrist free.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Jane's gaze flicked to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And... who are you?” She asked, pointing a finger at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was calm, her hands in her pockets, looking straight into Jane's face with that smirk on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Lower that finger down, unless you want it broken .
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice was smooth, steady.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a small step closer to Rio, removing one hand from her pocket and resting it on Rio's back—a silent reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jane cackled. But she did lower her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good for you, Rio. You got yourself a bodyguard.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly.” Agatha's smirk deepened. “Now get lost.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jane looked at them both, then walked past Agatha, bumping her shoulder on the way. As she reached the door and opened it, she said, “I'll see you,” and left, leaving the door open behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood in her place, annoyed and frustrated. The warmth of Agatha's hand resting on her back helped her steady her breaths. After a minute, without looking at Agatha, she walked toward the chair, feeling embarrassment creeping in.
    </p>
    <p>
     That? That was humiliating. Her toxic, creepy ex breaking into her house like that. Not being able to handle it herself. Letting Agatha to deal with it instead. It was all too much to process. She had come back to her house to do one thing, and now she was dealing with something else entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio remained silent for a few agonizing couple of minutes, and so did Agatha, who stood close by.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I could have dealt with her on my own, you know?” Rio finally said, still not looking at Agatha, only staring at the nearest object, which was beginning to blur.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Agatha replied, her voice soft and knowing. “Sorry if I crossed a line.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What line?” Rio finally looked up, but Agatha's features blurred together, she couldn't recognize them, not after seconds. “No, no. I'm sorry you had to see that.” Rio ran a hand through her hair, her irritation growing inside her. The way Jane had spoken to her in front of Agatha... What must Agatha think of her now? Someone who couldn't even handle their own ex? Great!
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Agatha, please. Can we not talk about this? Just—just forget it,” Rio said as she got up, her voice sounding so small, so broken. “Let's find your phone, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only nodded, saying nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed her phone from the table in the living room, checked it, then tossed it into her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should get going now. You should rest, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't,” Agatha said softly, extending her hand to touch Rio's face, but stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned at that. Instead of questioning it, she reached for Agatha's hand and held it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll call you later,” Agatha added, squeezing Rio's hand. Their eyes locked, and Rio was painfully aware of the goddamn tears threatening to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
     She only looked at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, she wanted to kiss her. Yes, she wanted to hug her. Yes, she wanted to talk to her. Yes, she wanted Agatha to tell her everything was going to be fine. Yes, she wanted to cry in Agatha's arms. Yes, she wanted to let everything out.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just stood there, looking into those blue eyes, not saying a goddamn word.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a really long minute. Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll call you,” She whispered. Then, this time, she did touch Rio's face—cupping it with one hand.“Take care.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, she left.
    </p>
    <p>
     The touch lingered on Rio's skin, just like everything else. Agatha's scent still filled her senses. She could still feel her presence somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it wasn't the only one. She could feel her ex's presence too, the second she looked at the chair in the dining room. Jane's voice rang in her head, sharp and irritating, triggering a dull ache behind her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a heavy sigh, Rio threw herself onto the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here she was again. The same situation she had found herself in dozens of times. Helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed to do something about it. Because she was done. Done being dragged into her ex's sick games.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the first thing?
    </p>
    <p>
     Change the goddamn lock. So that creepy bitch wouldn't be creeping around anymore.

     Perhaps Rio wasn't who she thought she was. The thoughts she had about herself—about how she acts—perhaps were only that: thoughts. Ideas that lived in her head but never materialized into action. They were just... thoughts. In her head. Things she believed she was acting upon.
    </p>
    <p>
     One might proclaim certain ideas, thoughts and principles, but actually following them? That's another story. Because proclaiming them is one thing, but living them, making the effort to embody them every day? That's something else entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or at least, that's what Rio was thinking as she stared at her phone, the screen flashing with Agatha's name for the second time in ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't pick up. She couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't find it in herself to respond, to prepare herself to talk to Agatha, to hear the woman's voice after what happened this morning. Not even the alcohol in her system helped.
    </p>
    <p>
     It perhaps seemed silly. Answering a call is one of the easiest and simplest things in today's world. But was it? Not when considering who was on the other end of the line. Not when it was Agatha's voice she would be hearing. Not when there were a dozen of other things tangled together in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     No. Answering a call wasn't simple. It wasn't easy. In fact, it was one of the most overwhelming things.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched as the screen dimmed, Agatha's name disappeared. Now there were no options left. Even if she wanted to answer or decline, she couldn't. She had her chance—twice.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have made a choice, but she didn't. She just sat there, staring, instead of doing anything. She didn't know what she wanted, and she hadn't made anything clear to the other party.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was lost, confused, and in her confusion, she was dragging everyone else into the chaotic chaos her life had become.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part of her turmoil came from her uncertainty about everything. Especially about Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew almost nothing about the woman— just a few threads, not enough to weave into anything. They were just threads. And though Rio had tried to tie their ends together, hoping to grasp onto something, she hadn't caught anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she blamed herself for that. Because it wasn't as if she had asked for more. She had just sat there, willing to take whatever Agatha was ready to offer, which, as it turned out, wasn't much.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had so many questions, but they remained locked up in her head. She couldn't bring herself to set them free. Somehow, they made more sense that way. Or at least, that's what she convinced herself with.
    </p>
    <p>
     For nearly thirteen minutes, Rio sat on that couch, doing absolutely nothing—just overthinking her entire life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her legs were spread apart, her back hunched forward, fingers absently cracking as she stared at the phone laying on the table beside a half-empty bottle of vodka.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wished for something, some divine force to intervene, to unlock the situation she trapped herself in. She needed something, anything, to give her the key to break free.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, after five more minutes—an eternity in Rio's mind—her phone vibrated again.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed the phone quickly and just... stared at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hesitation was eating her alive, and it was ridiculous—especially considering that Agatha had been wrist-deep inside her only nine hours ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck it,” Rio muttered to herself. She cleared her throat and swiped to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she did, she was met with silence. No breath, no sound from the other end. Just dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she forced herself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey.” Her voice came out almost a whisper, softer than what she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     After fifteen seconds that Rio counted on her left hand's fingers, five after five, Agatha finally spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey there. Are you alright, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's voice was laced with concern. Real concern, something Rio could both hear and feel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's fingers stilled as absentmindedly counted another five seconds. She stared ahead, not looking at anything in particular—more lost in thought than focused on what was in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't fine. Not really. And she wanted Agatha to know. But why?
    </p>
    <p>
     Why did she want Agatha to know?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew she was a bad liar—possibly the worst—but that never stopped her from lying every time someone asked, whether she was okay or not. Yet now, even those bad lies refused to form. She couldn't bring herself to throw them at Agatha, whether she believed them or not. As if, with Agatha, she wanted to be nothing but honest. Transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's okay. It's okay.” Agatha said, and Rio's heart clenched. “What are you doing now?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart spiked—so hard it was terrifying. She pressed a palm to her chest, rubbing it as her breaths turned unsteady. She leaned forward, grapped the bottle of alcohol with her hand, and chugged until the burn scorched her throat and stomach. Then, she set the nearly empty bottle on the floor beside her foot and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio? Are you there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said as she leaned back into the couch, her chest heaving, breaths uneven.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you talking to me?” she asked as she closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mean?” Agatha asked, her voice held uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean, why are you talking to me?” Rio repeated. “You could be doing literally anything else with your time.” Rio chuckled. “Instead of trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me. Because, I can assure you, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, are you drunk?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I drunk? Yes, I am. That? I can answer gladly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, look—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You could like, have whoever you want. Seriously. Have you seen yourself? Absolutely fucking drop-dead gorgeous.” Rio interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know when I knew I was out of your league? When I saw that redhead, Wanda-something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? When did you see Wanda? How do you know her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled, stretching her arm to reach the bottle without shifting her posture.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Believe it or not...” A sip. “She was at my birthday... The funny thing is—or it's not really funny, anyway, I never saw a painting of her while I was looking at your artwork. I was totally convinced that your type was dark–haired losers until I saw her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, Rio, honey, slow down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look, I'm just saying...” Rio tightened her grip on the neck of the bottle. “You shouldn't be wasting your time with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How and why did you come to this conclusion, Rio?” Agatha sighed. “Look, it's not what you think. You're getting it wrong—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed again but kept speaking, pushing past Rio's constant interruptions.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you are. You're reading it wrong. You're overthinking it. I'm interested in... Look, I'll have this conversation with you when you're sober. I want to hear what you're feeling and thinking while you're sober, Rio. Not like this. Not over a phone call I didn't even think you'd answer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I can't do life sober.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We'll see about that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about that blonde? At the club. Who is she? I saw her, you know. She's a model.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, she is,” Agatha sighed, sounding helpless.“What about her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know. Is she... with you now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, she's not, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you sleep with her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, just listen to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, just answer me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both fell silent, for a few minutes silence stretched between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “...Okay, I got my answer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pressed the phone harder against her ear, almost hurting herself. Before Agatha could respond, she hung up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The phone hit the couch as she threw it aside, stretching her arms out, though her grip on the now empty bottle remained tight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where had that come from? All that jealousy. All that possessiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't the jealous type. Not at all. She hadn't even realized she was jealous of both women until now. Until she said it out loud—until the alcohol forced it to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those weren't the questions Rio wanted to ask. Not the information she wanted to know. And definitely not the side of Agatha she was interested in knowing first. But the damage is done.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she hadn't scared Agatha away before, she sure had now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood up, went upstairs and headed to her room. She paused in the doorway, staring at the dimly lit space. Then, she stepped inside and turned the light on. Her eyes swept over the room until they landed on the silver ring she found earlier—Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had spotted it on the floor near the bed when cleaning up, or pretended to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had stared at it for a solid ten minutes before placing it on the nightstand. It was the one Agatha wore on her thumb. The same one she had forgotten to take off, the one Rio had felt, cold against her skin when Agatha fucked her in the kitchen a week ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at it for a few seconds, then walked toward the wardrobe to do what she came here to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stripped off her black tank top and replaced it with an oversized black button-up shirt, leaving only one or two buttons fastened in the middle. Next, she slid off her shorts and pulled on a pair of black jeans. The act was difficult in her drunken state, but she managed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her discarded clothes remained on the floor, the wardrobe door left open as she dragged herself to the full-length mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     She studied her reflection, though nothing was really clear. She had been thinking about cutting her hair for a long time. A really long time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tonight was the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it wasn't just about cutting her hair. There was something else. A hidden agenda buried somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     The masc hairdresser with short hair, muscular body and cool t-shirts. The twenty- or thirty-something lesbian who had been flirting with Rio for nearly two years—whether they accidentally met on the street, the salon, the nearby bar, or even the supermarket.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted a haircut. And that woman worked there. If she still worked there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was she a bad person for thinking this way?
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell. Who the fuck gives a fuck?
    </p>
    <p>
     She was drunk. Not a single clear thought floated through her mind. Nothing seemed right or wrong. Everything felt possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at herself for a few more seconds, then grapped a pack of cigarettes, slipping one between her lips before shoving the pack into her pocket. Her wallet went into the other pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     Downstairs, she lit the cigarette in the kitchen and put the lighter in her pocket as well. Pulled on her trainers, and grapped the new door keys before stepping outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before the door fully closed behind her, she hesitated. Stepping back inside, she grapped her phone from the couch, then walked out again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She walked—more like dragged herself—to the salon. Her mind was a chaos. Nothing was clear. Her vision was blurred, and she stumbled into a few people along the way. But somehow, she made it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ten-minute walk and the night air sobered her. Just a little.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once inside, the strak white lighting attacked her eyes, almost burning them.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had no appointment, so she prepared to wait. But before she could even sit down, that woman approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam, if Rio remembered correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice seeing you here.” Miriam said with a smile, and Rio straightened up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Need a haircut, or did you come here to see me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio managed a laugh that didn't sound too drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe both?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, careful there. I might believe you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then believe me.” Rio whispered, a smirk forming on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam raised an eyebrow. “Did you finally recieve my signals, then?” She motioned for Rio to take a seat. “Come here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Rio sat, she looked at their reflection in the mirror. Focusing mostly on herself, not the woman standing behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I recieved them a while ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam chuckled at that.
    </p>
    <p>
     She picked up a comb and started running it through Rio's dark hair. Rio's eyes remained locked on the mirror, her vision growing blurrier with every passing second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you want it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just cut it short.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How short are we thinking?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shoulder-length.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam slid her fingers through Rio's hair, stroking it gently before leaning in, her mouth close to Rio's ear, “My shift ends in fifteen minutes, which means by the time I'm done with your hair—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned her head to look at the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They locked eyes for a few seconds before Rio turned back to her reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, let's wash your hair then.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do it without the washing. Just cut it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Miriam did as she was told.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cut Rio's hair, and by the time she was done she asked if Rio liked it. Rio managed a feigned, toothy smile and mumbled a few words—lies. Because she wasn't really aware of what was happening around her. She didn't even know if her hair had been cut or if it was still the same. She'd probably like it or regret it in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio stood up from the chair, her legs almost gave out beneath her, but Miriam caught her by the forearm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Totally. Just a little dizzy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, I'll go grab my jacket.”
    </p>
    <p>
     While waiting, Rio paid at the counter, leaving a decent tip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Miriam returned. They stepped outside into the busy, noisy street, packed with people and layered with sounds that made Rio's headache worsen by the second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My apartment's a few blocks away, or do you—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Your place.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And they walked, silent. Not a single word exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What made you change your mind?” The woman asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were hitting on me while I had a girlfriend, Miriam.” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Saying the word girlfriend while referring to Jane made her sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh?” Miriam chuckled. “So you're single now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where's your apartment? We've been walking for an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's been seven minutes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Feels like an hour to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're almost there.” She chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they climbed the stairs and stood in front Miriam's apartment, Rio stared at nothing while Miriam unlocked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was she doing? Why was she doing this? Who actually does this? Was she trying to forget something or someone? Agatha? Jane? Was fucking another woman really the only solution? Was she really that stupid?
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam stepped inside and Rio followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The place is kind of a mess.” Miriam said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio remained silent. Not like she could tell if the place was messy or not. Everything looked the same to her right now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want something to drink?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, just...”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a few steps forward, closing the space between them. Then she kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was rough—too rough. She almost bit the woman's lip hard enough to make her bleed. Almost.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam tasted like whisky and tobacco. And she also tasted like—blood?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck. I'm sorry.” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're the one who's bleeding.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio touched her lips with her fingers then looked at them. Two fingertips, dark with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and leaned in again, crashing her lips against Miriam's, not caring about the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me take the lead, yeah? Where's the bedroom?” Rio asked, breathless. And Miriam only pointed with her hand, still catching her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shoved the woman onto the queen-sized bed. Climbed on top of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stripped off Miriam's jacket. Then her t-shirt. Then her sport bra.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she didn't pause to admire her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without kissing her way down or even worshipping the sight before her eyes properly—something Rio loved to do, to worship a woman's body, but she didn't. Not this time. She didn't take in the tattoos covering the woman's body. Didn't give her nipple piercing a second glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled Miriam's pants and boxers off in one swift motion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she fucked her. Three fingers and a mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She barely registered the sounds Miriam made, how she called her name, what she said—if she said anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing mattered except the rough pace she set. The steady rhythm of her fingers pumping in and out. Her tongue on the woman's clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only looked up when Miriam's body tensed, her orgasm tearing through her. But Rio didn't stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kept going. Kept thrusting and sucking. Until she gave her another orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't until Rio sat back on her heels, wiping her fingers on her black shirt, that she realized she was still fully clothed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam looked at Rio with a smile, sweat glistening on her forehead and her eyes half-lidded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus christ, that was...” She chuckled. “Holy fuck, Rio.” Her smile was evident in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time, Rio really looked at the woman's features, and panic began clawing at her chest. Her heartbeat turned erratic, her breaths shortened.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman lying beneath her propped herself up on her arms, still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it my turn now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      blinked
     </em>
     . Then blinked again. What was she doing here?
    </p>
    <p>
     But she took her shirt off anyway, exposing her chest—she hadn't worn a bra. Then she climbed onto the bed. As Miriam sat up, Rio leaned in and whispered in her ear, “
     <em>
      Make it quick.
     </em>
     ” Then, she stripped off the rest of her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart clenched tighter the moment Miriam's fingers made contact with her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I shouldn't be doing this.
     </em>
     ” It was the only thought looping in Rio's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt like she was cheating on someone, crossing a line she shouldn't. Then her mind drifted to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck! Agatha!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She shouldn't have said all that shit. Mentioning Wanda and that other woman. Acting like Agatha owed her something. She didn't. And what Rio was doing right now—it wasn't any better. If she thought that was bad, somehow, then she was just as bad, if not worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     She barely registered the moment Miriam's fingers entered her—foreign, unfamiliar to her body. But she did feel the tears slipping down her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miriam seemed to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head, eyes unfocused.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no, it's not you. Fuck, I need to go.” Rio pulled Miriam's fingers out by herself and immediately stood, her movements frantic. “I'm so fucking sorry. You don't deserve this, but I really need to go.” She threw on her clothes in a hurry, not bothering to button a single button. Then she left, shutting the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she stepped onto the street and the night air hit her face, the tears came—furious, relentless.
    </p>
    <p>
     She buttoned half of her shirt with shaky hands, then pulled a cigarette out from her pocket, lit it, and inhaled deeply as she walked, heading home.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Two streets away, a black car rolled up beside her, moving slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced at it, then kept walking.
    </p>
    <p>
     The window lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio...”
    </p>
    <p>
     She froze mid-step. That voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she moved—hurried steps, desperate to escape. She couldn't face her. Not like this. Probably never. She couldn't look into Agatha's gorgeous blue eyes. she can't look at her—
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, please, just listen to me. Come on!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't answer. Didn't look. But her heart pounded violently in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The car stopped abruptly. Then the door slammed open. Rio flinched as Agatha got out, slamming it shut behind her. She grabbed Rio's wrist, not tightly, just enough to pull her closer. Close enough to rest a hand on her hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look at me,” Agatha pleaded. “Please, Rio. Just look at me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kept her gaze on Agatha's shoes, unable to meet her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed, releasing her wrist only to tilt Rio's face up by the chin.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she saw the tears, her thumbs brushed them away.“I'm here, okay?” Agatha murmured. “I'm here, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That was it. That was all it took for the dam to break.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sobbed. Tears blurred everything, her breath hitching, her chest rising and falling too fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I fucked this up, didn't I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. No, you didn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her into a hug, resting Rio's head against her chest, holding her securely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry.” Rio gasped between sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shhh. It's okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes passed.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio finally pulled back, she looked down at the tear stains on Agatha's light gray jacket before hesitantly lifting her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's blue eyes, framed with her glasses, held nothing but concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm really sorry, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she said it, fresh tears threatened to spill.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha cupped her face with both hands, steadying her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I heard you the first time, Rio. And it's okay. We'll talk about this later. But not now, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha extended her hand. Asking for Rio's hold. “Now come with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio did, she held Agatha's hand in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like your hair,” Agatha said as she tucked a strand behind Rio's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't immediately understand what Agatha meant until she reached up to touch her hair with the other hand—only to find it much shorter than it had been earlier. A stunned expression took over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They got into the car. Agatha leaned in to fasten Rio's seatbelt herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inhaled deeply, taking in Agatha's heavenly scent, filling her lungs and senses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha could pull away, Rio pressed a kiss to her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned back into her seat, offering Rio a soft smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Gosh, her lips looked beautiful. She looked beautiful.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That white tank top under her jacket. Her milky skin. Her exposed cleavage. And fuck—glasses? Agatha was wearing glasses!
    </p>
    <p>
     It hit her then—she hadn't quite registered the object minutes ago, but now? Fuck. Rio felt hot. Agatha was hot. She was really hot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're wearing glasses.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced at her after starting the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. I do, when I'm driving at night,” she said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They make you look even hotter.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed. “You're adorable, you know that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, remembering when Agatha had said the same exact words, at Lilia's house. “Yes, I know.” Rio said, then shut her eyes as her eyelids grew heavy and her eyes started to burn.
    </p>
    <p>
     The safety wrapping her wasn't foreign anymore; it was something she always felt with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't know how many minutes had passed when she opened her eyes again and looked around. She was shocked to see Agatha still driving. They should have been at home by now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced at her, smiling. “Hey there. I'm taking you to my place.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So... are you kidnapping me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “No, I'm not. I can drive us back if you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head. “
     <em>
      No. Take me with you.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     And she closed her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt it when the car stopped. Felt it when Agatha got out and shut the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, stillness. For a few seconds, or maybe minutes. The next thing she felt was strong arms lifting her with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closed the car door with her foot and headed inside. Apparently, she had unlocked the door when the everything stilled a few minutes ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio buried her face in Agatha's neck. The feeling too good to be ignored. To not take advantage of.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can walk, you know,” she mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, baby. Just rest now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio felt it—the steady rhythm of Agatha climbing the stairs, carrying her as if she weighed nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't open her eyes once, too caught up in the warmth, the breathtaking scent. And exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha placed her gently on the bed, then moved to take off Rio's shoes and socks. She held her hip with one hand and tugged at Rio's shoulder with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a sleepy “
     <em>
      hmmm?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I take your clothes off?” Agatha whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands roamed over the fabric before she slipped Rio's shirt off. She hadn't expected to be met with bare tone skin. She looked for a second but her gaze didn't linger. She moved forward, unbuttoning and removing Rio's jeans.
    </p>
    <p>
     A minute or two passed. Then Agatha returned, dressing Rio in one of her oversized t-shirts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was awake—not entirely. Her eyes remained closed, too heavy to open. She hovered between consciousness and unconsciousness, but she felt every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Agatha pulled the soft duvet over her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stillness again. No sound at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes passed before Rio felt Agatha climb into bed beside her. Without hesitation, she rolled to the side, pressing against Agatha, resting her head on her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her head. Once. Twice. Again. And pulled her even closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't understand what Agatha murmured before pressing another kiss to her hair as the sound of Agatha's heartbeat lulled her to sleep.

     Chapter Notes
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      I know I'm turning this into a typical lesbian drama, but I won't justify or explain anything Rio or Agatha did. That is just who they are, at least in my head. They're messy, they don't communicate in a healthy way, they're not straightforward, they won't just say what they actually want to say.
      <br/>
      This is how I see them, whether they are the original characters from the show or the ones I'm mischaracterizing in this. They will figure it out eventually though.
     </p>
     <p>
      Do I know what I'm doing? No, I don't.
     </p>
     <p>
      As I said before, I'm not used to writing at all, I don't even know how I managed to write eleven chapters.
      <br/>
      But, this is going to have a happy ending, even tho I'm a fan of angst and like heavy emotions and sad shit but I'm definitely not a fan of sad endings, at all. So I won't give this a sad ending, if I actually completed it lol. Because honestly? I still don't know exactly what's happening in here. But in the meantime, bear with me.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also, I fucking love it when you guys share your thoughts about the fic, it seriously makes my day. And I'll try my best to make this a satisfying read for most of y'all. Thank you.

    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart raced, cold sweat creeping in. A ringing sound filled her ears, making her dizzier, creating a nauseating sensation in her stomach, the urge to vomit her soul out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound grew louder and louder, weakening her, making it impossible to comprehend a single thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her breaths were heavy and uneven, as if someone was choking her. She opened her eyes in fear and pain because not a single part of her body was functioning, as if she had lost all control over herself. Her eyes were open but everything was black—nothing but darkness surrounding her. She blinked, then blinked again but to no avail. She was completely frozen, unable to move a finger. Her body shut down, and she was laying somewhere. Was she? Maybe she was floating, or drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, hey. Follow my voice, yeah? Just breathe. Try to breathe. I've got you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard the voice. Tried to make sense of the words passing through the ringing. Some of them mixed with it, almost making her ears bleed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't quite grasp whose voice it was. Who was holding her? Who's cold touch she could feel little of on her numb body?
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's okay. You're okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The ringing gradually grew quieter, and her vision started to clear. There was light on her side, blurry and almost too bright, but far better than the baleful darkness that had overwhelmed her eyesight moments ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if someone had removed the weight from her chest, she could inhale properly again. The moment she breathed in, a scent filled her half-working senses and her entire body, Agatha's. That thought was the only clear one in her mind, and it warmed her. Knowing that her head had been resting on Agatha's chest almost the entire time. Knowing that Agatha's arm was supporting her, securing her at the waist. Knowing that the touches she'd felt seconds ago weren't cold, but warm and soothing—warming her chilled skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're doing really well. Just keep breathing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And she did. Rio tried to breathe as Agatha's voice counted softly. With each number, her voice held certainty and reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's fingers began stroking her hair gently as she held her, as if she were the most precious thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio regained control over her body and could move her muscles, she lifted her arms higher, reaching for Agatha's middle, holding her tightly as she pressed her head into Agatha's chest. She needed to feel her. To ensure that Agatha was really there, and that whatever had gone wrong could be fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There you go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hand, once on her waist, moved higher, drawing invisible soothing patterns on Rio's back above the fabric. Her other hand continued to stroke her hair gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inhaled deeply through her nose, the air flavored with Agatha, making Rio more awake and aware of everything around her. She pulled back slightly as she exhaled, and was met with Agatha's shining eyes, the light beside her making them glimmer, as if actual stars were in there—making her beautiful eyes even more mesmerizing. Looking into her eyes felt like gazing at the blue ocean on a starry night. A night you knew would stick with you forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha locked eyes with Rio as she extended her hand to reach for the glass of water, not breaking the eye contact. Then she held it up for Rio to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn't had a panic attack in her sleep for a long time. She thought she had gotten rid of them by doing absolutely nothing. But thinking about it, it was actually that she hadn't slept enough to have one. She always woke up before it could even happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought of having it now, of all times, made her feel an uneasy sensation growing inside her. Because why?
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could overthink the entire situation, Agatha's thumb brushed Rio's lips slightly, as they kept looking at each other while she cupped Rio's cheek. Rio moved her hand and rested it above Agatha's as she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry.” Her whisper broke the stillness of the night for a brief second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't apologize.” Agatha's voice was warm and deep as she continued brushing Rio's soft lips, touching them tenderly, which caused Rio's lips to part instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you feeling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm good now.” Rio answered, still whispering, her eyes remaining fixed on Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to talk about it?” Agatha said as her fingers moved to hold the back of Rio's neck, brushing the little hairs there, as Rio's hand dropped slightly to rest on Agatha's wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can we do that later?” Rio said, her other hand holding Agatha's hip tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whenever you want.” Agatha took Rio's hand and pressed a kiss to the back of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let's get back to sleep?” Agatha suggested, and Rio nodded in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     For minutes, they just kept looking at each other's faces, without moving an inch to actually lie back down. They felt the tender touches as each of their hands rested in different places, soothing the skin beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they finally lay down. Bodies pressed against each other. Arms secured around each other's middles. As they tried to be as close as possible, leaving no space between them. Their legs tangled together, as if they were puzzle pieces, fitting perfectly in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their senses were filled with each other's scents. They found peace in the proximity between them. It felt like home, as if this was the only natural and right thing to do—a place where Rio felt she belonged. In Agatha's presence. In being held by her like this. Almost feeling her running with her blood, in her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio managed to close her eyes, but sleep didn't find its way to her. Minutes passed. Then more minutes, but she couldn't fall asleep. Despite the headache that felt like a time bomb ticking in her skull. Despite how her eyes burned. Despite the peace Agatha's embrace and her steady breaths and heartbeats provided, she couldn't. She felt exhausted, and the only thing she could do was bury her face deeper into Agatha's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't hold your breath.” Agatha said as her hold around Rio's middle tightened. Rio's heart jumped; she thought Agatha had fallen back asleep because of how quiet she was. Rio let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding against Agatha's skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's better,” Agatha whispered as her fingers moved higher, running through Rio's hair.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's the happiest memory from your childhood?” Rio asked out of nowhere, as her fingers began to wander on Agatha's t-shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled softly, and Rio smiled at the sound. She lifted her head slightly to be able to look at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I have a favorite one.” Agatha said after a few seconds as she resumed stroking Rio's hair. “I was seven. My family's house used to be near the woods, and I was allowed to go in there for an hour every weekend. The rule was not to go too deep—there was a mark I wasn't supposed to cross. My mother tied a blue ribbon on one of the trees. But I actually broke that rule every time.” Agatha chuckled, and so did Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, one day, I was there singing to our mother nature, pretending to have an audience. I always dreamed of having an audience to watch me, whatever I was doing—even doing the simplest things. So yeah, I was singing, almost certain no one was there. And a woman walked toward me, and I froze in my place. Almost had a heart attack. Then I recognized her, she was our neighbor. So she approached me and asked how I knew this song and said I had a lovely voice with the biggest smile on her face, a basket filled with mushrooms in her hand. I told her my mother sang it, and she was so happy. She told me her mother used to sing the same exact song to her. Then I sang on our way back, I'm sure I gave her a headache but she didn't seem to mind in the slightest. She was my only audience. This memory is the first thing I think of when I hear the words childhood and happiness together.” She took a breath, kept it in her lungs for a while, then exhaled. “The woman, she changed my life in a way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head to look directly into Agatha's eyes. The expression she found there was indescribable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You wanted to be a singer?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, not really. I probably did when I was a kid, back when I had a hundred dream jobs,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha said, gazing at Rio's face with softness and care as her hand continued running through her hair, offering tenderness and warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's yours?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled as she started replaying the memory in her head. It was a little blurry, so she tried to enhance the images without mixing them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My father and I were fishing. I mostly used to sit and watch him, but that time, I decided to try it myself, and I caught my first fish ever. It wasn't big, but I was really happy, The moment I felt the rod move in my hands as the fish pulled, I lost my control over it, pulled too hard, and I fell into the water. My father hurried to pull me up, but I was only laughing. I ran toward the rod and looked at the fish, it felt like my biggest victory. I held it in my hands the entire time, just staring at it. When we got home, I lifted it up for my mother to see, soaking wet. I didn't even realize I was shivering until she wrapped me in a blanket.” Rio lowered her gaze to Agatha's lips for a brief second before returning to her eyes. “She cooked it for dinner, and it really was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled—a wide, genuine smile—as she kept reliving the memory in her head. The voices, the images, the feelings. It had been many years, but it lingered, alive and growing inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled in return—a bright smile that could illuminate and warm the whole world, but Rio's heart took it all, felt it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm trying to picture a younger you. Did you have short hair?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, still smiling. “It was long. I inherited my mother's hair.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes stayed locked. Their smiles didn't fade; they only grew wider. The silence was comforting, the air thick with serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the urge surged. The urge to kiss Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart pounded as she leaned in, their lips almost touching. A mixture of emotions rushed through her body, dozens of memories flashing in her mind—the highs and lows of yesterday. Vivid and clear, every sound and image. She wasn't even sure if what she did had been real. It felt unreal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart raced, her thoughts and feelings colliding. Instead of placing a hand on her chest to calm herself, she crashed her lips into Agatha's. Took her lips softly at first but then it heated. The kiss was everything. It was an apology. An explanation. A promise. But it was also hurt, guilt, and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand moved higher, to the back of Agatha's neck, as Agatha kissed her back with the same intensity. Rio pulled her even closer, deepening the kiss, exploring the depths of Agatha's mouth with her tongue. It was intense, each passing second making her burn hotter. Her stomach clenched every time she sucked on Agatha's tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shifted, moving on top of Agatha, hands roaming on her body, unable to find a place to land—she wanted it all. To touch every part of Agatha at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha pulled back the next second, her breaths rapid and heavy. “
     <em>
      Rio...
     </em>
     ” She panted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, trying to catch her own breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Hmm?
     </em>
     ” She hummed in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We need to talk.” Agatha whispered, her eyes stayed locked on Rio's, her hands moving up and down her hips. Their faces were too close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, they needed to talk. She wandered why had Agatha even let her kiss her in the first place?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, then lowered herself, sitting back against the headboard. Agatha propped herself up on her elbows, looking at Rio beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio found herself looking around Agatha's room for the first time. She knew she was here, but it had only just hit her. There wasn't much light, but she could make out details here and there. The windows were covered with Russian Velvet curtains, allowing little to no moonlight to seep into the room
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes wandered, landing on a dark-colored chaise longue at the foot of the bed, beside which sat a small wooden table. Two mugs rested on it, along with some scattered papers and a pencil. Despite the room's spaciousness, it wasn't filled with much. An antique Victorian vanity stood against the wall, feeling somewhat out of place. A few boxes sat stacked in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     A dim light flickered from what Rio assumed was the walk-in wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She wandered the room for quite some time, feeling Agatha's eyes on her. Finally, Rio turned and met her gaze. A second later, Agatha sat beside her, taking Rio's hand in hers and looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you hungry?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Some coffee would be really great. And I really need to go to the bathroom.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, come on then,” Agatha said, pressing a kiss to the back of Rio's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio stood, she suddenly became aware of what she was wearing—Agatha's t-shirt. She lowered her gaze. It was black, falling just above her knees, with the cover of Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret by Soft Cell printed across the front. Smiling, she looked at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing.” Rio's smile turned into a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, come on! I can have band t-shirts!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't say anything.” Rio chuckled, throwing up her hands in defense.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? And I also said nothing when you gave me that Siouxsie and the Banshees t-shirt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     At that, Rio burst into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I really tried to give you the least weird t-shirt I had.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at her, and then they walked out of the room. She showed Rio where the bathroom was and the place of everything she might need and told her to find her in the kitchen afterward.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Once stepped out and closed the door behind her, she made her way down the hallway toward the stairs. She was surprised by how empty the walls were. For some reason, she had expected paintings to be hanging everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     A half-opened door caught her attention. She walked past it, then instinctively took a few steps back. Standing in the doorway, she peered inside, only able to see what the angle of the door allowed. Agatha's studio.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped inside without pushing the door open further.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes scanned the finished paintings—faces she didn't recognize, abstracts she couldn't analyze properly with her headache. Empty canvases filled most of the space, alongside boxes overflowing with supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took it all in for a second longer before stepping back. Stunned. Agatha was really good.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she turned to leave, her gaze landed on a painting she knew all too well.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hers
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It leaned against the white wall, her features captured in oil paint, every detail perfectly placed, as if she were looking into a mirror. Rio stepped closer. Looking closer. Her neck and collarbone were exposed, her skin tone matched precisely, and her dark hair cascaded down her back. She hadn't notice those details the first time she saw the painting—because they hadn't been there before. The rest of the painting remained unfinished, or perhaps it was meant to be that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers traced over the brushstrokes of her face as she stared in quiet awe.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took slow steps backward, still looking at the painting, when her then back hit something wooden—a table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned her entire body to look at the object. Her eyes landed on an opened sketchbook, a pencil and a black pen resting in its center. Her name was written at the top of the page, and beneath it, a sketch of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's mouth ran dry.
    </p>
    <p>
     She recognized the pose immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yesterday morning, when Agatha had asked her to lift her leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed hard, her eyes lingering on the careful attention given to the curves of her body in the sketch. Every time she looked at it, she found a new calculated detail—things Rio hadn't even noticed on her own body before. She turned to the previous page, only to find her name again and a sketch of her back. That must have been what Agatha was looking at yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
     A thrill ran through Rio's entire body, leaving flames in its wake. Her stomach was nothing but a mixture of burns, and her head was a mess. The thought someone looking at her so closely, memorizing her, and drawing her with such precision filled her with exhilaration. It made her heart pound with intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh. God.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed the sketchebook and set it back on the table after several long seconds of staring and wetting her lips. She shut her eyes and took a deep breath. The air that entered her lungs smelled like paint, making her dizzy for a moment. Without a second glance, she stepped outside and closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hurried toward the stairs, feeling her heart pound in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was that something she wasn't supposed to see? Too late. She had seen it, and now she felt like she might pass out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Descending the stairs, she searched for the kitchen—only to find Agatha sitting there, waiting for her, two mugs of coffee in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's face was flushed. Seeing Agatha only made her heart race faster. She swallowed hard, eyes lingering on Agatha's face—her ocean-blue eyes, that beautiful,
     <em>
      beautiful
     </em>
     smile resting on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha motioned for her to sit in the chair beside her. Rio obeyed, walking over as she tried to calm her racing heart, steadying her breaths with each step. Then she sat down, wrapping her hands around the warm brown ceramic mug as she felt Agatha's gaze on her, watching her profile.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat in silence for minutes, simply existing in each other's presence. Only the soft sipping sounds broke the quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
     But inside Rio? There was a conflict she had no solution for.
    </p>
    <p>
     She set her mug down, staring at it. She hoped Agatha would speak—ask something, say something, anything to break the tension. But she knew Agatha was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waiting for her to be ready to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could overthink it, the words slipped from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Were you coming to my house yesterday?” Rio asked, as she kept her eyes glued to the mug in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.” Agatha's gaze never wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. I mean why? After everything I did and said?” Rio finally looked up at Agatha, meeting her eyes. “It's not fair to you. I was out of my mind really. I'm not trying to make excuses... I said all that to you, and then I went and just did...”
    </p>
    <p>
     She broke eye contact, shifting her gaze back to the mug in her hands, overwhelmed by Agatha's steady stare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's grip on the handle tightened. Her mind flooded with blurred footages and flashes of last night—when she acted like the reckless, drunk loser she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her other hand ran through her hair as if searching for something, anything, to ground her. To ease the nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—I was really drunk. I wasn't thinking.” She closed her eyes briefly. “I don't even know how I left the house or how I made it to where I wanted to go.” She inhaled through her nose, then sighed.“I got my hair cut. Then I found myself fucking the hairdresser on her bed...” The words barely escaped her lips. Shame and guilt burned in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When I finally became aware of it... I just left. I left her sitting there without a second glance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence stretched between them once she finished talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's leg bounced wildly under the table. She was waiting—for a comment, a reaction, anything. She was ready to be judged. Ready for someone to point out her recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when Agatha finally spoke, it wasn't what Rio expected.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you feeling about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head snapped up, the moment she heard Agatha's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had she even heard what Rio just said?
    </p>
    <p>
     “About what?” Rio asked, her voice came out small, barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reached out, resting a hand on Rio's thigh, stilling the frantic movement of her leg. At this point, Rio wasn't just bouncing her leg, her entire body was trembling, shaking the wooden table as if warning of an impending earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
     “About it all. How are you feeling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her bottom lip as she looked into Agatha's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I shouldn't have done it. What I said to you, what I did afterward. It just felt so wrong. It didn't at the time, god, but when I became aware of it, I just... I hated myself for it. And I know it wasn't me. I mean, it was—I did it. But in a way, I didn't. I don't know.” She sighed, shaking her head. “And I'm really not making up excuses. I know that even the idea of it is fucked up enough, and I know I probably look like a fool right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't, Rio.” Agatha's voice was firm yet gentle. “You don't look like a fool. I know what you're talking about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. I understand why you did it, and I'm not judging you for it, Rio. I know it makes you feel like you're the worst, but it's okay. Because you're not. You're not the worst, and everything is totally okay.” Agatha's fingers traced gentle strokes along Rio's exposed thigh absentmindedly as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice softened even more.
     <em>
      “I just want you to let me in. Will you let me in?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, unsure of what exactly Agatha was asking, but at the same time, she did know. Because the same question was hanging on the tip of her own tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.” She answered, her eyes tracing Agatha's calm beautiful features. Then, before she could stop herself, she asked.“
     <em>
      But will you?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     A rush ran through her body the moment she voiced the question out loud. Her heart pounded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled slightly. “
     <em>
      You're already in, Rio.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand moved higher, brushing Rio's cheek with the back of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then why didn't you answer me yesterday?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because I told you, I wanted to talk to you while you were sober and in front of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She did? Oh. Yes, she actually did say that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood up from her chair, looking down at Rio. “Come on. This chair will hurt your back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced up at her, then drank what was left in her mug before standing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They walked through the hallway, heading toward the living room. It was by far the biggest space with much more furniture than what Rio had already seen. Most of it was plain white, but the dark-colored and wooden pieces balanced the space, making it look effortlessly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     A large bookshelf lined one of the walls, filled with books. Just from a glance, Rio recognized a title or two. Next to it, a display cabinet held DVDs and vinyl records, with a stereo sitting on top. A white stone fireplace stood against another wall, sculptures resting on the shelf above it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The seating area featured a dark charcoal couch set and vintage wooden coffee tables.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two paintings hung on different walls—none Rio recognized, but the larger one caught her attention. She made a mental note to take a closer look at it later. A single plant stood in the room—a large philodendrons in a dark brown ceramic vase. The only touch of greenery she had seen so far.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat beside each other. Agatha tucked her legs under herself. Rio's leg were cold, causing her to shiver slightly—almost unnoticeably, but Agatha noticed. Without a word, she grabbed the wool blanket draped over the couch arm and placed it over Rio's legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want me to get you something else to wear?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, that's okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They looked at each other for a few silent seconds before Agatha finally spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, you said you saw Wanda at your birthday. I don't know why she was there or what she told you, but I think you should hear it from me.” Rio listened intently as Agatha continued.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It wasn't pleasant. We broke up on bad terms. We hadn't been a real couple for two years—we were just pretending. Until last year, when we finally ended it for good.” Agatha tucked a strand of her dark hair behind her ear. “And the other woman, Vic...” She paused briefly. “Yes, I slept with her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “were you...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.” Agatha shook her head. “We weren't a thing, if that's what you're asking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio intertwined her fingers in her lap, locking them together so tightly that her knuckles turned slightly white.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When was the last time you saw her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't help herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reached over, gently taking one of Rio's hands and securing it between her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Before I went to Paris. I told her I wouldn't be seeing her anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exhaled slowly. Her body visibly relaxed, tension draining from her muscles. She could finally breathe properly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked into Agatha's eyes, and what she found there made her feel safe. Certain. As if she were staring directly into the ocean—calm waves stretching infinitely before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha squeezed her hand gently before asking,
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about your ex? What's her problem?” She intertwined their fingers, waiting for Rio's answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's insane. That's her problem,” Rio said as she leaned closer to Agatha, desperate to feel her warmth. She wanted to be held but couldn't find it in herself to ask. Just the mention of her ex made her feel sick. The reminder that she existed filled her with nausea.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, she is.” Agatha placed a hand on the back of Rio's neck. “Whatever she said to you, Rio. It's not true.” She whispered, their faces drawing even closer. Rio closed her eyes. The sound of Agatha's voice was so calm, soft and soothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Kiss me,
     </em>
     ” Rio said, her voice barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha met her gaze before leaning in and capturing Rio's lips in a kiss. It was soft and gentle. A kiss that made Rio's heart dance in her chest. Agatha kissed her deliberately, both hands cradling the back of Rio's neck, pulling her closer as she deepened the kiss. Rio let out a whimper when Agatha's tongue entered her mouth, intensifying the heat between them, sharing the lingering taste of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     A moan escaped Rio as Agatha gently pushed her down, guiding her to lie back against the couch, head resting on the armrest. Their lips never parted—the kiss only grew more intense. Their hands roamed each other's bodies, desperate to touch, to hold, to grasp onto something tangible.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled back slightly when breathing became a necessity. Agatha's hand continued exploring Rio's body over the fabric of her clothes, her chest rising and falling as she struggled to steady her breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her, utterly mesmerized. Agatha looked breathtaking—her flushed skin, the way her chest heaved, the sheer intensity in her gaze. Rio wanted to worship her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She placed both hands on Agatha's hips, sliding them up and down as she gazed into her eyes. But Agatha stilled her movements, placing her hands over Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Let me take care of you,
     </em>
     ” Agatha murmured as she lowered her hands, cupping Rio's breasts. Rio let out a soft moan, her nipples already hard beneath the material. She nodded eagerly, because, god, she wanted Agatha to take care of her. In every way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in again, crashing their lips together as her hands squeezed Rio's breasts. Waves of heat pulsed through her body, one after one, pooling in her stomach and between her legs. She moaned into Agatha's mouth as she felt a hand traveling lower, cupping her heated cunt through the thin fabric of her underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, fuck.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's index and middle fingers moved up and down her slit, teasing, torturing. Rio could feel herself dripping with every passing second. The slow, deliberate movements of Agatha's long fingers against her soaked underwear made her body shudder, her stomach clench, her head grow dizzy. And she loved it. She loved the teasing, the way Agatha's fingers mapped her desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back slightly, watching Rio intently as she withdrawn her hands. Then she kissed Rio's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio barely had time to whine at the loss of contact before Agatha reached for the hem of her own t-shirt. Pulling it over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's breath hitched.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pale skin, the curve of her waist, the way her breasts were cradled by a deep purple bra, her hardened nipples visible through the fabric. The sight made Rio moan, it was too good to not be appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked slightly before reaching for the hem of Rio's shirt, lifting it over her head and tossing it aside. Now, Rio was left in only her black underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, placing a soft kiss on her lips before trailing her mouth down to her neck. She kissed, nipped and sucked at the sensitive skin, leaving Rio a moaning mess beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of Agatha's hands cupped Rio's bare breasts, rolling the nipples with her fingers, drawing out even more sounds of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed her way down, giving every inch of exposed skin the attention it deserved. As if Rio's body were a canvas and Agatha was painting on it, not with a brush, but with her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha reached the waistband of Rio's underwear, she hooked her fingers around it and pulled it down south. Slowly revealing the dark curls beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pressed a final kiss to Rio's abdomen before settling herself between her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened Rio's legs wide enough for herself. Agatha looked at Rio who was already watching her, one arm resting behind her head, her armpit hair peeking out, her face flushed, chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. Agatha smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You look so fucking beautiful. So goddamn beautiful it drives me insane.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She traced a finger along Rio's slit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Since the first I saw you... God, you looked so beautiful.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     The same finger slipped inside with ease, gliding in effortlessly with how wet Rio was. Agatha thrust in and out, marveling at how Rio's pussy swallowed her finger so perfectly, coating it with more silky wetness every time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned loudly as a second finger joined the first, pumping inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh my fucking god.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You're taking my fingers so well,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha murmured, her gaze never leaving Rio's. She started to thrust faster, deeper, hitting Rio's G-spot with every stroke, feeling her walls clench around her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes for a brief second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      No, no, angel. Look at me. Keep looking at me while I fuck you like this. You're taking me so well.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, Agatha—
     </em>
     ” Rio moaned in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept thrusting as her thumb found Rio's swollen clit, circling it, pushing her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pleasure built at an unbearable speed. With a few more thrusts of Agatha's slender perfect fingers, and Rio shattered, moaning Agatha's name as if it was salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed the inside of her thigh, sending a shiver to run through Rio's sensitive body. Then she moved up, slipping her fingers into Rio's mouth. Rio groaned around them, sucking them clean.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, kissing Rio's lips, tasting the sweetness of her. She moaned. “
     <em>
      I need to taste that directly from the source.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Settling between Rio's legs, she lifted them both and placed them on her shoulders. She inhaled deeply, drowning in Rio's scent. It was strong and intoxicating. Without wasting any second, she devoured.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of Agatha's mouth sucking against the wetness of Rio's cunt mixed with the moans and curses spilling from Rio's lips sweetly, filled the space and their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sucked on her clit for a few more times and Rio came all over her face. Her orgasm tearing through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite how Rio's body was trembling, Agatha didn't stop, she kept sucking, drinking in every drop, making Rio's pussy feel as if it had never been wet in the first place. Only when she was fully satisfied did she lift her head, a smirk curling her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mouth and chin glistened with Rio's pleasure. She ran her tongue along her lips, the length of it reaching the last traces of Rio on her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned at the sight, eyes fluttering close.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Jesus, Agatha
     </em>
     .” Her chest rose and fell, still trying to catch her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, smug.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think you can sleep now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh?” Rio blinked, still lost in the haze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is your body exhausted enough to finally let you fall asleep?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think so.” Her eyelids felt impossibly heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I haven't tasted you yet,” She whined.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When you wake up, angel. Please, you need to sleep.” Agatha said as she cupped Rio's face with one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven't even seen you,” Rio pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, when you wake up, you can do whatever you want, I promise.” Agatha leaned in, kissing her pouted lips. “Do you have to work today?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. Let's get you upstairs.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha helped her up, guided her upstairs, gave her fresh clothes and dressed her with gentle hands. Then she lay beside her, wrapping Rio in a warm embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the sun began to rise. Rio finally fell asleep.

     <em>
      “Yes but I don't know. Things have been really weird between us lately. I don't know how to describe it, but she isn't the same. She's been eating her nails.”

    <p>
     <em>
      “Yeah, yeah, I noticed that too. Her nails are getting shorter, something's a bit off about her. Is she sick?”

      “I'm not sure. I'm not sure about anything, Alice. But anyway, do you want a sandwich from the The Beast Feast?”

      “Hell yes!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Extra tongues?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes instantly and was met with an unfamiliar ceiling, golden lines tracing its edges. She blinked several times, trying to pull herself from sleep. Then she heard it—her phone buzzing nearby.
     <em>
      Alice
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh yeah, that explains whatever the fuck she'd been dreaming about a few minutes ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked to the other side, where Agatha was supposed to be, but she wasn't there. Her laptop was open, sitting on the bed, illuminating the room with the faint glow of its screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rubbed her eyes in an attempt to erase the burning in them and sat back against the headboard, grabbing her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” she greeted, her voice thick with sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, dude. Where have you been?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I took the day off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And also the day before. Rio, what's going on?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing is going on. What do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God. I've sent you like ten messages this morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven't seen them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, that much is obvious. Are you at home? I want to talk to you about something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I'm not home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are you then?” Alice said, the sound of keys jangling on the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced around Agatha's room and smiled. Well, where is she? She's
     <em>
      here
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “With a friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A friend? Vidal, I know all your friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No you don't!” Rio said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, her eyes drifted to the doorframe—she felt eyes on her. Agatha entered the room with a bright smile, walking toward the bed and mouthing, “Hey,” before sitting beside Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her and smiled, her heart starting to beat a little faster. God, this woman...
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey! Vidal! Are you with me?” Alice said, as the sound of a fridge opening and closing filled Rio's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm with you. I'll see you tonight, and then we'll talk.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mean tonight? It's already ten pm. Where the fuck are you, Vidal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? Ten pm?” Rio said. Agatha chuckled beside her and nodded in affirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes! Did someone kidnap you or something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, shut up. I was asleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, are you coming to work tomorrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That ‘sure’ does not sound convincing at all, but I need to talk to you tomorrow, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, I'll see you. Good night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good night, Alice.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held her phone in her hand and looked at Agatha with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why didn't you wake me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I couldn't find it in myself to do so.” Agatha said softly. After a beat of silence, she continued, “You looked... Peaceful. So I couldn't disturb that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blushed instantly, her cheeks turning a soft pink as a delightful wave of heat ran through her body. There was something about hearing those words come out of Agatha's mouth. It was the way she said them, the tone she used, it made Rio's heart dance.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiled fondly as she looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I hadn't been dreaming about adding extra tongues to my sandwich, I wouldn't have woken up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha asked, chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, that's what I was doing. I was about to order that,” Rio said, still in disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed—the sound was so beautiful, the most melodic thing to grace the human ear. It was rich and soft and so goddamn beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think it's probably because you haven't eaten anything today?” Agatha asked, her smile audible in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, come on, let's eat,” Agatha said, taking hold of Rio's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You haven't eaten yet?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Now come on.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up from the bed that wasn't hers—the bed that let her sleep peacefully because it was so full of Agatha. Full of warmth and safety, things she couldn't even feel in her own bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She went to the bathroom washed her face, and brushed her teeth with the extra toothbrush Agatha had given her in the morning. Then she slipped on the black shorts Agatha had handed her, and together they went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha told her to sit down and wait a few minutes, but she didn't listen, she followed her into the kitchen, curious about what Agatha had cooked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It smells delicious. What is it?” Rio said from behind, as Agatha checked on the chicken in the oven.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you to sit down,” Agatha said with a smile, turning around to face Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't want to,” Rio replied, matching her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt a rush of energy pulsing through her body—like a kid on a sugar high, with nothing to do but run and jump and babble. Or maybe it wasn't that. Maybe it was the sense of freedom she felt in Agatha's house. The sense of safety, familiarity, belonging. It felt strange, but in a good way. Peaceful.
    </p>
    <p>
     These walls didn't feel depressed or heavy with melancholy. They weren't laughing at her, mocking her, or watching her with strange eyes. They weren't hunting. They were just... walls.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched as Agatha moved around the kitchen, preparing everything, adding the last touches.
    </p>
    <p>
     She fought the urge to rest her hands on Agatha's hips. Fought the urge to lean her chin on Agatha's shoulder and watch her adding this and that. But the hardest battle of all was fighting the urge to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Purple really was Agatha's color. She looked like a goddess. Somehow, that shade made her eyes even bluer, made Rio want to drown in them. Her lips pink and more delicious. And fuck, why did the ropy veins darken so much under her pale skin? In simple words, Agatha looked delicious, and Rio was struggling not to take a bite of the sweet treat her body craved.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was aware of their kisses—of the many heated moments they'd shared, each one awakening something inside her. She remembered every time they'd had sex. Rio was keeping a count of them in her head. She thought about the way Agatha called her baby, called her angel.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now... it felt different. Rio didn't know if Agatha wanted to be kissed, to be touched. These were just thoughts swirling in Rio's mind—urges she was keeping locked inside. Because in her head, there was no reasonable excuse to jump and crash her lips against Agatha's, even if every cell in her body begged for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hesitation had roots. Rio had been kissed and touched against her will—by strangers, by past girlfriends. She knew what it was like to be forced to engage when she wasn't fully invested. To please someone else at the cost of herself. It felt awful every time. She hated herself every time. So being on the other end of that—being the one who takes—wasn't an option, even if she knew Agatha was different.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that also made her think about last night. About what she had done to that poor woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     In her mind, everything was linked, connected. And everything made her feel bad about the kind of person she was. A war waging in her head, blades made of words and actions instead of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally sat down after Agatha told her what she made for dinner, like a stubborn child finally satisfied after getting what he wanted. And it was adorable—the softness in Agatha's blue eyes, the sweet smile blooming on her lips as she motioned for Rio to sit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was grining when Agatha brought out the last piece of china: a jug of orange juice. Then she sat down, facing Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at it. Well... wouldn't wine be much better? She had never liked orange juice since she was a kid. In her head, it tastes like toothpaste.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why juice and not wine?” Rio asked, watching Agatha pour a glass for each of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha set the jug on the wooden table and looked at her for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know why.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I don't.” Rio said innocently, as if she truly didn't know.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look, I know it's none of my business, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? I'm not an alcoholic,” Rio interrupted, taking her first bite of the perfectly cooked chicken breast. “Mmm. This is really good,” she said after letting the taste linger for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” Agatha said with a smile, clearly dismissing Rio's other comment.
    </p>
    <p>
     They ate in silence for a few minutes, only the soft sounds of chewing and sipping filling the space between them. But their eyes didn't follow suit—their gazes met across the table now and then, speaking in glances and stares instead of words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha. She wanted to say something. Anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Should she mention the sketches she saw earlier? No, she wasn't even supposed to see them. What would Agatha think of her?
    </p>
    <p>
     Should she say that wine reminded her of Agatha? No, she had just said she wasn't an alcoholic. She shouldn't bring up anything alcohol related right now.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the end of the inner fight, she settled on a question—one that slipped out without much thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you speak French?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do,” Agatha replied, looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed, thinking of what to say next to keep the conversation alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, say something in French,” she said, locking eyes with Agatha. There was something in Agatha's gaze trying to reach out—something distant, but present.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Je vois l’amour m’attendre dans tes yeux comme un nuage d’orage pris à l’horizon lointain,
     </em>
     ” Agatha said after a few seconds. She delivered the words as if setting them gently upon Rio's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, it sounds so beautiful, but I have absolutely no idea what you're saying,” Rio replied, tossing a forkful of lettuce into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a way, she felt the weight of the words, even if she couldn't grasp their meaning. She didn't know what Agatha had said, but she definitely felt the way she'd said it. And for reasons she couldn't quite explain, she didn't want to understand. Hell, Agatha could've been cursing her, and Rio wouldn't have cared.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only smiled at her—that beautiful,
     <em>
      beautiful
     </em>
     smile of hers. Her blue eyes gleamed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't really like the language,” Agatha said, lowering her gaze to her plate, “but I have so many fond memories because of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched her for a few seconds. She felt the shift in Agatha, and she wanted to know why.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's living in Paris like?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her gaze, that sweet smile still gracing her lips. She took a moment to respond, studying Rio's face as memories played out in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was peaceful at first. When I first got there, it was a hopeful place for me. I liked the way my feet landed there. I— I lived in many places, but nowhere really held my heart the way Paris did.” She paused just long enough to sigh. “But it changed. In a really harsh way. It became haunting. Hopeless.” Agatha set her fork down on her plate and looked directly at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You remind me of every beautiful memory I had there. I don't know why, but I see them in your eyes, shining—and that not a metaphor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's heart tightened in her chest. Her eyes stayed locked on Agatha. The way she said those words made her want to cry. She didn't know what it felt like to live in Paris. She didn't know what memories Agatha was referring to. But she felt those words move through her body like heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed, trying to find a response. But nothing came.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You remind me of wine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't hold it any longer. It was like she'd just climbed out of one hole only to fall into another. Idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “How so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Intoxicating,” Rio said, her gaze dropping for a second, then rising again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed her tongue against the inside of her cheek, smiling with mild amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm. I'll take that as a compliment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is a compliment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.” Agatha said. “Do I make you intoxicated then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You do,” Rio answered, heat creeping into her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Describe that for me. I'm not sure I get it. How does it feel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her without even blinking. How the fuck was she supposed to describe that? Yes, she had a PhD in English, but that wasn't helping.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Addictive
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     She said the only three syllables she could find in her head, then reached for the glass of juice she hadn’t touched all evening. She chugged it down, and God, it really did taste like toothpaste.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only hummed in response, and Rio felt relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now she won't complain about the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They finished eating. They talked about a few things, here and there, but didn't dig deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, Rio washed the dishes, despite Agatha's protest. She did it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was rinsing a glass when she felt arms wrap around her waist from behind. Her movements froze when Agatha pressed a kiss to her neck. Rio's breath hitched, and warmth flared in her chest. She didn't move. Water kept falling onto her hands as Agatha continued pressing soft kisses along her skin. Agatha's hold tightened around her middle, and she pressed a kiss to Rio's shoulder blade, just above the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to show you something.” Agatha whispered near her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her warm breath against Rio's skin made her close her eyes and exhale softly.
     <em>
      God
     </em>
     , she would give anything to stay in this moment, right here, without moving an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally resumed her task.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Leave them,” Agatha said, resting her chin on Rio's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm almost finished,” Rio said, her voice barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're stubborn,” Agatha murmured, pressing another soft kiss to her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled. “I've been told."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few more seconds, Rio got used to the embrace. She felt the warmth of intimacy wrapping her like a blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wondered if Agatha had hesitated before holding her. Wondered what she'd thought about before doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she finished, she turned off the water and spun around to face Agatha. Agatha's hands settled on her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were close, so close that if Agatha pushed Rio even an inch, her back would hit the counter. If Agatha moved herself forward an inch, their hips would be flush together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha's face. Those beautiful features—she found so much comfort in them. Agatha smiled and leaned in to press a soft kiss to the apple of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     —
    </p>
    <p>
     They went upstairs, heading to Agatha's studio. Rio's heart pounded in her chest—loud and rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
     They entered the white-painted space, and her heartbeat only grew louder and faster. The studio looked a bit different from what she'd seen earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was tidier, the mess contained. Canvases and supplies were placed where Rio assumed they belonged. Some artworks were hung on the walls; others were stacked in neat lines.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to speak. To admit that she'd already seen the place, because she was nosy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze fell on the sketchbook, and her heart pounded even harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't mind the chaos,” Agatha said as she walked toward a painting that stood facing the windows, turned backward.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this was what Rio thought it was... God, she suddenly felt like the worst person alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha turned that painting around and revealed it to Rio as a surprise—
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought about running. Because her curiosity had ruined it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there's nothing worse than ruining a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha approached the object in question and turned it to face Rio—and what Rio saw in front of her nearly made her pass out.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, before her eyes, stood a 24×36 painting she had never seen. It wasn't the first one she'd seen a couple of weeks ago, nor the second she'd glanced earlier. This one was different.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was her.
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Wearing a white satin dress that clung to her body in a way that almost made her heart ache. It hugged every curve—too perfectly. Her navel contour was visible through the silky fabric, her nipples slightly erect, peaking through. The dress had a high slit that revealed one toned, bare thigh. And she was barefoot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Rio's eyes drifted up. Around her painted neck hung that necklace—the one she never took off unless she absolutely had to, and only left behind when she forgot. Her comfort piece. Its green sapphire gleamed on her collarbone, and the way Agatha had painted it made Rio's entire body twitch. Her cleavage was rendered in such exquisite detail, it may have even looked better than the real thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn't looked at Agatha once, not since the reveal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her movements were slow, her steps small, shaken by awe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze traveled upward, tracing her own features. The shape of her face, the placement of every detail... it all looked surreal. Dreamlike.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips were slightly parted, just enough to reveal her front teeth. Her nose was painted perfectly. And her eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      God
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha had painted her eyes made Rio feel as if her painted self was staring straight into her soul. Penetrating her. Her hair flowed long, cascading down her back like silk.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last thing Rio looked at was the background.
    </p>
    <p>
     Earthy greens. Shades of brown. Dashes of yellow and blue swirling together. It framed her painted figure like a shrine. She looked like a goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at Agatha for a split second, not even able to register the look on her face or comprehend the smile on her lips, because Rio's gaze snapped back to the painting like a magnet. She kept looking. She couldn't stop. Unaware of time. Unaware of breathing. Just... stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hum broke through the silence and made Rio turn her face to the side to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, what?” Rio asked, her eyes wandering across Agatha's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said, do you like it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's gaze slid back to the painting for a few lingering seconds, then returned to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—I don't know what to say, Agatha. I—” she began, her fingertips reaching out to touch the canvas. “I don't think I have words to describe this.” Her fingers stroked the surface gently, deliberately gliding up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do I like it? I love it.” Rio said, her voice a low murmure. “I just can't believe what I'm looking at. This is... it's a masterpiece. Not because it's a full-body portrait of me. It's because...” Her breath caught. “Because
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     painted it, Agatha. God. I don't know what I'm supposed to say. I've never been this stunned in my entire life. This is—this is perfection. Not a single word I've leaned and memorized could do it justice. It's phenomenal. Astonishing. So goddamn stunning it makes my heart pound in my chest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't notice the few tears slipping down her cheeks. Didn't notice how Agatha was watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Every little detail I see makes me feel seen. Because I am. You, saw me. This...” Her voice faltered. “God. You really looked at every goddamn part of my face and body, didn't you? Because how else would you have painted that little mole on my ankle?” Rio choked out a soft chuckle in disbelief. “You saw everything. And it's... fuck me, it's so impressive because you painted this from memory. Oh, Lord.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept mumbling, her fingers still gliding across the painted version of herself. Then, finally, she reached up to brush away the tear tickling her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned to Agatha, the look in her eyes made a few more tears fall. Agatha was seeing her. Literally.
    </p>
    <p>
     And after a beat, Agatha smiled. A gentle curl of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, and couldn't really help herself anymore. She threw her body into Agatha's arms and held her. She held her tightly—tight enough to feel the bones beneath the layers of flesh and skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha held her back. The embrace was so warm. Peaceful. Like home.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio became aware of how tightly she was holding Agatha, she eased her grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my entire life, and I'm not exaggerating,” Rio said, her face buried in the crook of Agatha's neck. The words came out strangled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Glad you like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love it, Agatha. I don't just like it—I fucking adore it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled softly as one hand moved up to stroke Rio's hair gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's yours to have.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze in her place for a few seconds. Not even breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled back slightly, her hands still resting around Agatha's waist, and she looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously?” she asked, flabbergasted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. It's your birthday gift.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? You gave me a birthday gift?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled. “I don't know how to tell you this, but... that black dress was kind of an excuse. I just wanted to see you wearing it because I couldn't get the image of you out of my mind after I saw it. So I had to buy it and send it to you.” She laughed, a soft, breathy laugh. “This is your real birthday gift.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. Then whispered, “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The next second, she leaned in and crashed her lips against Agatha's, hungry for the taste of her. Rio wasn't sure if Agatha actually tasted like red wine or if she was hallucinating—but fuck, it was intoxcating and delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
     They broke apart briefly, desperate for air to fill their emptied lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's chest rose and fell, and then she leaned in again to press a softer kiss to Agatha's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A few minutes passed. They remained close. Eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to tell you something.” Rio said and Agatha only looked at her, encouraging her silently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—I saw your studio earlier this morning. I invaded your space. I looked at things I wasn't supposed to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's okay—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I saw your sketchbook.” they both said at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio noticed the way Agatha's face changed color the moment she mentioned it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh God. Fuck.” Agatha let out an awkward chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have done that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Rio. It's okay, I understand. I just... feel a little embarrassed knowing you saw the way I drew you. I'm surprised you're not mad about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mad? Why would I be mad?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because of the way you
     <em>
      drew
     </em>
     me? That goddamn precise pose? The way you drew every detail and curve of me? If I were mad about something like that I'd be an idiot. The only thing I felt while looking at them was my heart pounding in my chest, so hard I was worried it might actually stop.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, wetting her lips. And this time, she was the one who crashed her lips into Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if words were useless. A heated, feverish kiss consumed them as their tongues danced and tangled.
    </p>
    <p>
     —
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed in Agatha's studio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wandered the place, this time more freely, while Agatha went about tidying up the space.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio offered help, Agatha refused and waved her off with: “I need to do it myself, otherwise I'd go feral.” Then she kissed Rio one last time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes kept drifting toward the portrait of herself every few seconds. She couldn't help it. It was striking. Pulling her in like gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
     As her gaze roamed between paintings, Rio tried to quiet her heart, especially when it thudded a little harder each time she saw a painting of a woman. In their nude forms, posing intimately.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to ignore the twinges of jealousy. Tried to stay composed, casual, chill.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she wasn't. Not even close.
    </p>
    <p>
     —
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a 24×36 painting of a little boy hanging on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first, Rio thought he was a girl—but looking closer, she realized he was a little boy. His brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail, a few strands falling behind his ear. He was gazing off to the side. Rio couldn't quite tell what he was looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned around to glance at Agatha—organizing boxes—then looked back to the boy in the painting.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked like Agatha—not in the shape, but in a way Rio couldn't quite place. But that boy looked like her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was about to move away and look at something else when she felt Agatha standing beside her. Rio heard the deep breath Agatha exhaled before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is Nicholas. My baby boy.” Agatha extended her hand to brush the boy's cheek with the back of her fingers, as if he were really there.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few long seconds passed in complete silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He... we were on our way to a basketball game, his favorite team. He was sitting beside me, singing his favorite song when a drunk driver crashed into us on a one-way road. It happened in the blink of an eye. And my baby... he died immediately.” Agatha's eyes remained fixed on Nicky's portrait. “I try to paint him every now and then... because
     <em>
      I'm afraid of forgetting his face.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio heard the way Agatha sniffled, chocking back tears. So she placed a gentle hand on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt the way her heart sank. Hearing this broke her. Agatha's grief was woven in every word she spoke—every sob she tried to swallow. And it was heartbreaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to look at Rio. Her eyes were glassy, her nose tinged with pink, but no tears fell.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm so sorry about your loss Agatha.” Their eyes met. “I won't tell you that it's okay, or that it will pass, or that it'll get easier with time. Because it won't. You'll probably never figure out how to deal with something like that. Because once it happens, you feel lost. Like you're running through a maze.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took Agatha's hand and enclosed it between both of hers, her gaze dropping to them as she continued: “When people leave, their seats remain empty. And nothing in the world can fill them. We shouldn't even try to fill them. They're
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     meant to be filled. They should stay that way, as remainders—as memories to the beauty of remembering who once sat there. The people we still love so dearly... but who had to leave.” Rio looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was staring down at their hands while listening to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it's heavy. It doesn't get lighter. But I guess... we just get used to the weight. It becomes something familiar. Not necessarily easy, or good. Just...
     <em>
      known
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. Guess you're right.” Was the only response Agatha offered. Her eyes stayed locked on Rio's hands wrapped around hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few seconds, she looked up and met Rio's gaze. She smiled—a soft smile that didn't reach her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll stay here. I've got a lot to do. Make yourself at home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I stay here? If that's okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course.” Agatha leaned in and stole a soft kiss from Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed at the studio for about an hour. They didn't talk much, just little comments, here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
     But their eyes met constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would glance at Agatha only to find her already looking. And every time, her heart clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She wandered the studio, feeling as if she were in an art gallery. Each piece was beautiful in its own way—different, yet all sharing something in common.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept returning to that portrait. The one that filled her with too many emotions at once. Every time she looked at it, she noticed something new—little details, nearly invisible. But they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When they finally left the studio, Rio changed back into her previous outfit: the black button-up shirt and black jeans. This time, she buttoned everything expect the top two ones. She grabbed her phone, checked it, then slipped it into her pocket with the rest of her things
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha made tea for them both, and they headed to the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     —
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've got a lot of interesting films in here. Queer and witchy stuff.” Rio pointed out with a chuckle. “
     <em>
      Fascination
     </em>
     1979? That's some heavy stuff.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've seen it?” Agatha asked from her spot on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned around, holding the copy of the film in her hand. “Yeah, a few years ago.” She continued looking through the collection. “I like this one,” she added, holding up
     <em>
      The City of The Dead (1960)
     </em>
     to show it to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled. “One of my favourites.” She took a sip of her green tea, then continued, “Looks like I'm not the only one interested in witchcraft,” she said with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled. “I watch everything, really—so long as it interests me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She closed the glass cabinet door, slid her hands into her pockets, and walked toward Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will you go on a date with me?” She asked, standing in front of the wooden coffee table, eyes looking at Agatha, who was already watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was about time, Rio thought. She wanted to go on a date with Agatha—a real one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked as she set her cup down, her gaze never leaving Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Rio. I'd love to.” The smirk didn't fade, it only deepened and grew more intense, making Rio's heart tighten in her chest. Whatever Agatha was thinking, Rio wanted to know.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's that look?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What look?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     look, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed. “It's nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio narrowed her eyes. “It's wicked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.” Agatha laughed again, softer this time. It was so sweet, it sparked a heated flutter in Rio's stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll pick the right place for us,” Agatha stood up to face Rio. “You just have to wear that dress for me.” Her hand reached out to Rio's jaw, only the small table between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her heart plummet to her stomach, right alongside all the heat pooling there.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?” Agatha tilted Rio's face up by the jaw and stared into her eyes. She wet her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was certain their lips were about to crash, but Agatha's next words made her eyes widen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was planning to give you your reward. The one I promised before you fell asleep, remember? But now I can't, unfortunately. We should go on an official date first. Don't you think?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not fair.” Rio pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I know, angel.” Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     She walked around the table, her fingers still hooked on Rio's jaw, and then she kissed her, hot and deep. A soft moan slipped from Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's all you get. For now.” Agatha said, brushing Rio's lips with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're being mean.” Rio whispered, her voice low, eyes darting between Agatha's dilated pupils and her tempting mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only laughed, a breathy sound. As she leaned even closer. “Let's get you home,” she murmured, brushing her lips along Rio's earlobe. Her words burned against Rio's skin. “I don't know why you insist on going home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes. The teasing was overwhelming—but
     <em>
      oh god
     </em>
     , how it made her shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way it made her feel the blood racing through her vines. The way it made her heart pound. The heated waves that pooled down between her thighs. Agatha's warm breath. Her words against her skin. The wicked promises beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     It all made her feel
     <em>
      alive
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can get a cab. I don't want to trouble you,” Rio said, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gently bit her earlobe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tsk tsk. You're not troubling me, angel. And it's not about the car—it's about you leaving my sight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words scorched Rio's skin, made her knees slightly tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      God. Fuck. Agatha... are you going to do something?
     </em>
     ” Rio asked, voice low and trembling. Pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back to look at her smirking sinisterly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry about that. I'm just going to get my jacket.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned and walked away, hips swaying with lethal precision. If it lasted any longer, Rio thought, it could've killed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She collapsed onto the couch with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha returned, wearing a black jacket and those goddamn glasses, Rio melted. She just stared at Agatha, who smirked—fully aware of the effect she had on poor Rio. But Rio didn't give her the satisfaction. She kept all the inappropriate comments to herself and settled for just looking hungerily, trying to dismiss the fact that she wanted to be fed so badly.
    </p>
    <p>
     —
    </p>
    <p>
     They arrived at Rio's house.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was around Four in the morning. The sky still cloaked in darkness, only the streetlights illuminating the roads.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio unfastned her seatbelt and looked at Agatha. “Thank you,” she said sincerely, her hand reaching for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha's soft grip on her wrist stopped her. Rio turned—and Agatha leaned in to kiss her, pouring every drop of tenderness into it. It was sweet. Soft. Gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they pulled back, Agatha stroked Rio's cheek with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take care Rio. And please call me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will. You take care too,” Rio replied, then got out.
    </p>
    <p>
     She waved her goodbye, her eyes following Agatha's car until it disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, from her back pocket, she pulled out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lit one and smoked it to the butt as the cold morning breeze tousled her hair.

    <p>
     Rio put her stuff on the desk, breathless and face flushed red, trying to ignore the way the students looked at her with different expressions on their faces. Aside from being fifteen minutes late, she looked like she had just ran a marathon, thanks to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Earlier, while was dressing for the day ahead, her phone buzzed on her bed. She hurried to check it, and her face lit up upon seeing a message from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Have a good day xx.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled foolishly. She just knew her day was going to be good.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When she arrived at her office and was about to leave to start her class, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out and a message from Agatha was waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Are you at work?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio replied, and the moment she wrote “
     <em>
      Yes, I am.
     </em>
     ” and sent it, Agatha followed up with a photo. A photo that made Rio weak in the knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh fuck me!” Rio muttered to herself, dropping her stuff on the couch and sitting down. Agatha's chest and cleavage were right in front of her. The photo was cropped so that Agatha's face and nipples were out of frame, but that didn't stop Rio from drooling over her exposed skin—over the fading hickey marks Rio had left the other day. She thought about sucking on them all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha’s throat begged for attention, her damn collarbones, her wild dark hair cascading down her back…
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat there, legs spreading, just staring at the screen for god knows how long. She definitely thought about touching herself right there in the office, but that wouldn't be very “professional” would it? Or maybe fuck professionalism, because she had never been in a situation like this before to know what the hell to do. Maybe she should have thrown her thoughts and hesitation to the wall and just fucked herself while looking at that goddamn photo.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I would've told you to not touch yourself, but I know you wouldn't (;
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was the message Rio saw in the notification bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     The heat inside her only increased and she was so goddamn helpless. She stayed like that, sitting and staring without doing anything, hoping things would calm down eventually. Spoiler: they didn't. Because her fantasies were stronger than her will.
    </p>
    <p>
     So yeah, being breathless and flushed red early in the morning has a reason. She wouldn't be panting in a classroom out of nowhere. Would she now?
    </p>
    <p>
     The two-hour lecture was kind of a hell. Her mind kept drifting back to that photo. She paused mid-speech constantly, but somehow, that didn't stop her from being the good teacher she is and delivering the material as intended. Despite her negligence over the past five months, Rio was pretty damn good at her job. Her reputation was built on being someone who filled the gaps, honed the daggers, and remained the knowledgeable prof with the strong voice. Which were the things that made her gain her respect, and also were the things her personal life lacked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As she locked her office and was about to leave, trying to escape as fast as possible, she stopped mid-step as she remembered that she owed Alice a visit, onc she decided would be as fast as possible. So she turned on her heel and headed to Alice's office down the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knocked “Rio's knock”—two fast taps with the middle phalanges of her index and middle fingers, followed by a third one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on in,” came Alice's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed the door open, glanced at Alice, then her eyes drifted up to look at Agatha's painting hanging above the maroon couch. It made her smile this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, you wanted to talk to me about something,” Rio said as she took a seat and crossed her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice looked at her, peering over her glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Last time I checked, people say ‘how are you’ to their friends and they wait for an invention to sit down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio poked the inside of her cheek with her tongue, shooting Alice a “go on, lay it all” look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You fucking bitch,” Alice said, placing the papers she'd been holding on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Woah, hold on!” Rio said with half a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Cause I thought you were dead!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't be dramatic! Oh my god, I just took the day off!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You “
     <em>
      just took the day off
     </em>
     ”? Seriously? Every week I think you're fucking dead Rio. You don't see anyone, you don't talk to anyone, and literally no one knows anything about you or where you are. So excuse me for thinking that you're dead after calling you dozens of fucking times in the span of twenty-four hours until you finally picked up late at night not even knowing what the fucking time it was!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, okay, fair enough,” Rio said with a smile, throwing her hands in the air, gladly offering her defeat. “But I told you I was asleep didn't I? And here I am, alive and breathing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I can see that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Then how are you, Alice?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “None of your business, Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What a hypocrite.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice laughed, clearly cooling off. “I'm fine. Great, even.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great. How's Jen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's fine. But god, I haven't seen her in a week. I'm kind of on the edge of sanity.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where is she? Also, you're already insane, so I won't worry about that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's in Greece, doing some work. Also, shut the fuck up, will you?” Alice said as she got up and sat beside Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, so you're suffering
     <em>
      suffering
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you wanted to talk with me about something. What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yeah, I want the photo albums you have. Technically, all of them.” Alice continued speaking as Rio shot her a death stare. “I won't ruin them I promise! I just want to do something and I'll return them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, but I swear if you—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I won't!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. That's all?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No... I, uh, I saw Jane here yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's expressions changed immediately upon hearing that name. Because holy fucking shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? That fucking bitch...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. And the Irony of it all, she literally asked me if I knew where you were.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did you tell her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I obviously pretended she doesn't exist. Like hello?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio went silent for a few minutes. Jane had always been creepy, but she’d never dared come to Rio's work or ask her friends anything. Clearly Rio had underestimated her. Once a creep, always a creep.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Has she been approaching you?” Alice asked, watching Rio zone out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Rio dismissed immediately. And Alice didn't push any further. Either she sounded too convincing or too dismissive, one of them did the job.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They drove to Rio's house separately, as Rio's head was bouncing from one thing to another during the ride, but the main event was Agatha's photo. She couldn't get it out of her head, and every time it crossed her mind, a renewed heat would pool between her legs and settle in her stomach. As much as it felt unpleasant and she wanted to hurry up and get rid of it, it also gave her a strange sense of being alive in a way. Of being present in the moment. Of being able to feel something
     <em>
      oh
     </em>
     so delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because she couldn't even recall when was the last time a goddamn photo made her feel that way. When was the last time she got that much pleasure from burning from the inside, and down there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they arrived, Rio opened the door and stepped inside, with Alice following behind, with her phone glued to her ear and a bright smile lighting up her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm with Rio now, I'll call you later,” Alice said as Rio handed her a cold beer from the fridge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you too, babe. Take care.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled at her as she took the first sip from the bottle, eyes gleaming with a shit-eating grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Alice asked, tossing her phone into her pocket. The smile stayed on her face, pushing her cheeks all the way up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I gotta go see my dentist, ‘cause you guys are sickly sweet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That sounded cheesy as fuck, Rio.” Alice said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only grinned as she took another sip. There were only a few things that truly made her happy—seeing Alice like that was definitely one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anyway, have you changed anything here? It looks different.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I took the Christmas tree to the basement.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You haven't had a Christmas tree in three years.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Guess nothing changed then.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Asshole.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio went to the living room to grab the few photo albums she kept there. Then she headed to her bedroom, where a few smaller ones sat in a box alongside some stuff from her high school and early college years, such as a little ceramic dragonfly, a worn-out journal, a golden cup that -
     <strong>
      She gives A head!
     </strong>
     - written under it (a silly birthday gift from Alice that Rio loved way too much), and a lyric notebook plastered with punk stickers on its cover and scribbled
     <strong>
      THE SCISSORS
     </strong>
     in bold letters across the front.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she headed down to the basement, where Alice was digging like it was a thrift shop.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You still keep all those energy drink cans?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm a collector, Alice.” Rio said, laughing, like she didn't believe it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why do you even keep the albums down here ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nostalgia is a beast darling,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Guess I should keep them with me then.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? What would you do with my parents' photos?” Rio said with a chuckle, but the look on Alice’s face was one of someone who caught off guard and left speechless. So Alice kept looking through the boxes until she found the ones she'd been looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the albums was black, its cover decorated with polaroid photos of their old band members, their shirts lifted up and tongues out, on their chests were glued handmade stickers which were badly drawn boobs and their signatures were scrawled beneath each one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice let out a weird sound that should’ve been a laugh, and it made Rio laugh in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, we were fucking wild!” Alice let out a chuckle, as the look in her eyes screamed nostalgia!
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you miss these two?” She asked, referring to Ella and Chris.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not really.” Rio said as she set her beer down and leaned closer to take a better look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean high school them, not when they turned out to be bitches,” Alice clarified.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah… well, kinda. I don't really think about them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me neither. Anyway, I can't wait to show these to Jen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Put a shirt on me first.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You should’ve put it on yourself, perv.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They looked through more photos and talked for a few more minutes, mostly Rio throwing in rotten mom jokes or dirty one-liners whenever she had the chance. Typical Rio behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice told her to stop disappearing. Told her to call or text because it won't kill her. Then they hugged goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Alice didn't know it because Rio didn't show it, but her presence always brought joy to Rio. The way their relationship only seemed to bond, no matter how much distance got between them. No matter how distant Rio got. Because Alice was truly the only person Rio ever called a friend. For almost three decades, they’d understood each other. Been there during all the highs and the lows. Protecting each other’s backs.
    </p>
    <p>
     So maybe Rio didn't express it much, but she was thankful for Alice. For being in her life and for staying in it despite everything.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     She threw herself on the couch and lay there as the second bottle of beer found its way into her hand. She took her phone out, and the second she unlocked it, she was met with Agatha’s photo.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      God, Agatha…
     </em>
     ” She whispered in a low, breathy murmur. She set the bottle down and in the next second her thumb and index fingers zoomed in. She took the photo with her eyes. Quite literally.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wetted her lips, once then twice, before swallowing hard when she scrolled down to see the message Agatha had sent earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I would've told you to not touch yourself, but I know you wouldn't (;
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew Agatha could be really daring in such contexts, that much was obvious, and it thrilled Rio. But for some reason, she didn't think she'd go there. --There in the sense of asking if she was at work so she could send a photo of herself and make sure that Rio couldn't do a thing with that goddamn winky face because Agatha knew exactly what she was doing and how much effect she has on Rio--
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hand drifted down to the button of her pants. She opened it and pulled the zipper down. The first moan that escaped her lips was one of awe, a reaction to how fucking soaked she was. She started touching herself while staring at that photo with hunger in her eyes. She shut her eyes, and her mind began to drift to kissing that throat. To kissing and sucking that skin, leaving her marks all over it again. To feeling Agatha’s fingers instead of her own…
    </p>
    <p>
     She threw the phone to the side to lie beside her on the couch as she felt her orgasm building, ready to tear through her and flood her body with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as she was on the verge of receiving the reward she so desperately wanted and deserved, her phone buzzed beside her, making her snap her eyes open immediately. Irritated. Her hand stilled but remained in place. She cursed under her breath, grabbed her phone and looked at the name on the screen. Her mouth went dry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha. And it wasn't just a call, Agatha was video calling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat up immediately, blinked at the screen, then hurried to her feet. She drank some water, trying to steady her breathing and calm herself down. After a moment, she sat back down, took off her blazer, closed the first two buttons of her shirt, then unbuttoned them again with a bonus one. She tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear. When she grabbed her phone and was about to swipe to answer, it fell silent between her hands. The screen was filled once more with Agatha’s photo.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goddamn it,” She muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
     She considered calling back, and the moment the thought gained momentum, Agatha’s message came through:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Sorry about that.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Then another one.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Would you believe me if I told you my phone fell down and decided to call you on its own?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, because yeah, that was believable. It happened to her once when she was mid-watching
     <em>
      Angels in America
     </em>
     in the bath, and her phone fell down and called the group chat she was in. Alice had answered in the same exact second. Thank god it was Alice and not someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yes, I'd believe it. But was that the only reason?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio waited a few minutes for Agatha’s response while finishing the last of her beer. But Agatha didn't reply. So, Rio just got up, changed her clothes, and crashed into bed, resuming what had been interrupted.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      This piece was inspired by my own journey of excavation. My own grave digging to see if the mothers were truly dead.
     </em>
     ” Agatha responded to the reporter’s question. “
     <em>
      ...I can say that it's layered, and it needs its own excavation.
     </em>
     ” She said with a soft, honest smile before she answered another question and the video ended.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Excavation of the Dying Mothers (2005).
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The painting Agatha was talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Four female figures sat around a wide table. They shared the same clothes and hair, but their faces lacked features. They seemed like they were arguing or discussing something. The way each one held a cross in her hand and pointed it at the other suggested they weren’t having a casual conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dominant colors were dark browns and blacks, with deep, shadowy hues filling most of the canvas. Muted greens and grays were visible in the depiction of the figures' bodies and the table they sat at. Pale yellows and whites were used for the faint, eerie light that emanated from shattered candles, illuminating the old women's blurry faces, making them look even more haunting. The Chiaroscuro effect heightened the focus on the faceless figures. Making them the clear focal point of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was… allusive. Evocative. Haunting.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio found the four-minute-long YouTube video as she struggled to fall asleep. Agatha was sitting, and that painting hung on a dark wall behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The video looked much older than 11 years ago, the publishing date. It looked older, like the mid-2000s or so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lying on her side, phone almost glued to her eyes, Rio watched that video five times or maybe more, who's counting? Every time the screen faded to darkness, she would go back to the beginning and rewatch it all over again. She paused several times to look at Agatha. And just… look at her, listen to her. And each time Rio gazed at her, something stirred inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why hadn’t Agatha responded yet? It had been seven hours, and Rio’s mind was beginning to drift.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     So, with sleep eluding her and Agatha not responding, Rio got to her feet and headed downstairs. She grabbed the bottle of vodka and shuffled her “
     <em>
      i love pomegranates
     </em>
     ” playlist. “
     <em>

     started playing, making Rio tap her foot to the first beat and sway her body immediately.

     came on, a cigarette found its way between her lips. Each puff of smoke was followed by a gulp of alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept dancing and drinking as the music kept playing in the background. Mixed rhythms, mixed lyrics.

     and other songs she knew by heart. The vodka bottle lost more than half of its content, and the third cigarette rested unlit between her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this is how her night went. Ended with her sleeping on the couch in the dimly lit space as the music faded from her ears.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     She crashed out, completely wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When she woke up, she felt out of place, unaware of anything except the headache that was about to explode her head off. She spent half an hour sitting on the couch, trying to make sense of whatever the fuck had happened hours ago. She looked around the space. Two bottles of vodka lay on the floor, one of them drained and dead, and the other was standing still. Her t-shirt was discarded on the floor. When did that happen? She scanned the room with her burning eyes, as the hammering in her head became even more relentless.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her gaze to the side and found her phone lying on the edge of the coffee table. It was 3 pm, thank god it was Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
     A message from Alice, and two from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart beat a little harder, a little faster. She closed her eyes briefly and tried to make sense of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had a date with Agatha today. A real fucking date with the woman who had been living in her head. They had discussed it on the drive home and agreed on Saturday night.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was the one who brought it up and asked, yet she felt an anxious rush flood through her, making her overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
     A date. Huh.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last date she'd decided on go on had mentally and emotionally imprisoned her for four fucking years. It had abused her in different ways, and crippled her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yeah, it was sweet at first, for about nine months, but things started getting haunting and weird afterwards. She couldn't blame the date itself though. She was the one to blame. She was the one who chose to go on a date with a fucking psychopath. Maybe she didn't know at first, but she stayed for years even after she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Five months ago, she broke up with Jane. And now, here she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     So going on a date was a big deal. A really big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe things would go wrong, what would happen next?
    </p>
    <p>
     If there's something Rio doesn't want to fuck up, with all the honesty and the sincerity in the world, it's this. The thing she has with Agatha. The undefined relationship. The strange connection. She doesn't want to fuck this up.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared at the screen for so long without even unlocking it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She read Alice’s message:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Do you plan on isolating yourself today or do you want to go out?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      isolating myself is always the right option Alice dear but i actually have plans today so maybe tomorrow?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Then her heart pounded in her chest as she clicked on Agatha’s chat.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hey, sorry, something urgent came up and I was busy. But to answer your question, no, it wasn't the only reason, I wanted to call you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had sent this message hours ago when Rio was busy drinking and fighting her demons.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Good morning. You're still up for tonight, yeah? I'll pick you up at 7:30, if that's okay with you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at the screen, a soft smile finding its way to her lips. But the way her heart was still pounding made her anxious, why was it beating so loudly over a text?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Good afternoon. Yeah that's okay with me. Looking forward for tonight (:
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She typed -Good morning- three times in a row and it made her frustrated, until but she finally managed writing the -Good afternoon-
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     With the few hours she had, Rio managed to tidy up the place, eat something to silence her empty stomach, take a shower, and stare into nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her anticipation toward the night made her feel a whirlwind of emotions swirling through her body. But the overwhelming sensation was taking the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time it was nearing 6 pm, she left her phone on the night stand and got up to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took the black dress out and just looked at it. Felt it with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha disappeared the past week, Rio tried to avoid looking at the piece of fabric every time, until she tucked it in the back of the closet so she wouldn't have to look at it again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished dressing. The black dress, black heels, her necklace, earnings, and a few rings on. Agatha’s ring went on her thumb so she could return it later.
    </p>
    <p>
     She applied red lipstick on, and went with a smokey eye makeup look.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned around to look at herself in the full-length mirror, and something was so goddamn striking about the way she looked. Rio knew she was a beautiful, hot woman, but god, the way this dress made her feel about herself? It was indescribable. She felt sexy in her own skin. She felt hot. She felt like she could have absolutely anything she wanted. The way it hugged her body perfectly was insane. She moved her hand over her body, feeling the curves above the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't about the dress. She knew it was about who gave it to her. Who told her to wear it tonight. When Agatha had told her “
     <em>
      You just have to wear that dress for me.
     </em>
     ” it wasn't a suggestion, it wasn't a question, it was something that
     <em>
      must
     </em>
     be done. And will be done, because how could she possibly disobey that? Not when it thrilled her that much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio melted at the thought that Agatha would certainly look at her. Agatha would stare at her with those gorgeous blue eyes. Agatha would possibly compliment the way she looked. And fuck, Rio felt herself getting aroused just from the thought of being looked at, of being praised.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As she waited downstairs, a knock on the door made her look up. She stood, slipped on her long black coat, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sight of Agatha was something Rio knew she wouldn't be able to handle, but it seemed she had underestimated the situation and should have prepared herself better.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was standing there, a smirk on her lips as she looked Rio up and down. Her dark hair cascaded down her back. She wore a brown suit with nothing underneath it. The faint hickeys that took the shade of a soft yellow on her cleavage weren't visible, but Rio could spot them, because she knew they were there, and that made her mouth water. Agatha’s piercing blue eyes were locked on her, looking at her in a way that made her shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Rio finally found her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, gorgeous,” Agatha said, and that smirk, that look, was doing things to Rio. Weakening her.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she smiled gently in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shall we?” Agatha offered her palm to Rio to hold, and Rio obliged immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she felt Agatha’s palm in hers and stepped closer to her, Rio inhaled Agatha’s sweet scent. She hadn’t realized before how much she missed it. How much her body craved it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look so beautiful,” Agatha said near Rio’s ear as her other hand found Rio’s waist beneath her coat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So do you,” Rio whispered, her voice barely audible, but it landed just right.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they walked toward Agatha’s car, Agatha opened the door for Rio. Rio noticed the slight limp Agatha’s step, it wasn't noticeable at all, but it made her worry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got into the car and fastened her seatbelt. Her blazer exposed her skin a little more and Rio found herself staring. When she lifted her gaze, Agatha was already looking at her with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ride was sweet. All the overwhelming anxiety Rio had felt before melted away in Agatha’s presence, replaced by peacefulness. And heat, because that's what Rio felt most of the time, and every time she glanced at Agatha beside her. Or when she felt the way Agatha’s hand twitched, hesitant as she tried to not place her hand on Rio’s thigh. Because Agatha was determined to make this feel like a first date.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got out after parking the car and opened the door for Rio. Her hand rested on Rio’s waist, and the touch warmed her in the cold night’s breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they walked and entered the restaurant, Rio noticed that slight limp again. So she leaned closer, whispering in Agatha’s ear, “Are you okay?” Agatha turned her face slightly to look at her. “I am, don't worry.” She said with a soft smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't push further, even though she wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they were about to sit down and Rio took her coat off, she saw the look Agatha gave her. How could she not?
    </p>
    <p>
     The way she bit her bottom lip, looked at Rio’s body up and down. It was a look of appreciation but it was more like a look of thirst and craving.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat down facing each other, and when Agatha unbuttoned her blazer as she sat down? Rio felt every bit of her self-respect drain away. Because,
     <em>
      jesus fucking christ.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She just looked, she didn't even have the desire to eat anymore, not when what she was yearning for was literally in front of her. Not when Agatha looked
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so fucking beautiful,” The words were on the tip of Rio’s tongue when the waiter came in with a fancy bottle of wine. He filled their glasses, and Agatha told him to leave the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh yes, wine will be really useful.
    </p>
    <p>
     They looked at each other as both of them took the first sip of the night. Their eyes locked when they put their glasses down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look beautiful, really fucking beautiful.” Rio said, finally letting the words out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” Agatha replied, taking a sip of wine, her smirk visible from behind the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You really had to wear that suit, didn't you?” Rio said, as she wet her lips, her eyes roaming over Agatha’s skin, then lingering for a few long seconds on her lips and how they curved into a smile then back to her beautiful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took her glass and gulped the wine down, then again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I gotta tell you, I can't wait to see it off.” Her voice was low, barely audible, but of course, Agatha heard her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It won't be off tonight. I don't sleep with someone on the first date,” Agatha leaned back in her chair, staring at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio met her gaze with the same daring look, because she knew this blazer would be off within a few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     , or am I?” Rio asked, and Agatha’s expression shifted for a moment, but that smirk was back, masking it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you're not someone, Rio.” Agatha said, and the instant those words left her mouth, Rio felt the heel of Agatha’s shoe graze the exposed skin of her leg under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cursed inwardly, because she was so turned on, and she was so goddamn stupid for not wearing underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heel slowly went higher, reaching that slit on her thigh, then went back down again. The way Agatha looked at her didn't help at all. She was daring Rio to go on with her eyes and movements.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s response was to bring her thighs together as tightly as possible as she finished the wine in her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha’s smirk only grew wider.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she put her foot down the moment she realized Rio was holding her breath, and that always seemed to trigger something inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Breathe, Rio.” She said her voice almost a plea, before resting her hand on Rio's, a silent reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio did, she exhaled the carbon dioxide that had been held captive inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time their food arrived, Rio was already three glasses in, which made her head buzz a little.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is there a story behind your necklace? It's really enticing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took the piece in question between her fingers, looking at it, then back at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was my mother’s. I—” Rio swallowed down the strange sensation. “I took it from her corpse.” She looked down at the plate in front of her, then back at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn’t meant for it to sound strange, but it kind of did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s movements stilled as she looked up at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no, it's totally okay, don't worry.” a sip. “I can finally talk about them. So don't worry about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Totally.” She paused. “But it will ruin the vibes, especially the appetite. Not first-date material.” She chuckled, but apparently Agatha didn't seem to find it funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha, her gut telling her to go on with it, to just talk about it. But something inside her warned to back off, knowing death was a sensitive topic for Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They were killed,” She said, testing the waters with those three words. When she saw Agatha put her fork down and turn her full attention to her, Rio took it as her cue to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
     She paused for a long moment, the haunting memory from twenty-seven years ago playing vividly in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was thirteen. We were camping. Just a family thing we’d done for years.” As Rio spoke hesitantly, their eyes staying locked. “I was mad at them because they forgot to bring the kind of marshmallows I really wanted, a kid you know.” She kept checking if Agatha was still willing to listen, knowing the reactions she could get from a story like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on, Rio, I won't tell you to stop unless you want to.” Agatha said,her hand resting on Rio’s for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her and continued. “So, I was upset,lying inside the tent. When a man came up and talked to my parents. I didn't really hear what he said, but apparently they thought he was lost or something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio refilled her glass, her hand shaking slightly as she put the bottle down. “I peeked through the tent ten minutes later to see what was going on, and… he just… killed them with a knife. My father first, then my mom.” She paused. Remembering. “He was turned around, looking at something, I don't quite remember what. I got my chance, I crawled my way out, and grabbed my father’s shotgun. Then, I don't really know how I did it, but I did."/”
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished talking quickly, the panic already rising within her. There was much more to the story, but she just wanted to be done with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was looking at her, and there were tears in her eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ruined the night, didn't I?” Rio said with an awkward chuckle. She never knew when to shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's okay,” Rio said as she looked down at her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Rio. Look at me.” Agatha said, gently squeezing her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No seriously, it's okay. Can we not talk about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence enveloped them. Heavy and raw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded after a few seconds, and Rio smiled softly, trying to ease the pressure and awkwardness she brought to the table with that smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They tried to finish eating, but obviously they couldn't. They tried filling the space with small talks about different things. Rio noticed how Agatha would change the subject immediately if the conversation veered into harsh or intense topics. And noticed the way she touched her hand gently, or looked at her with that sweet look of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back on the chair, her cheeks were slightly pink and her eyes were locked with Agatha’s. Her tongue poked the wall of her cheek as she smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     look?” She asked. Feeling smug for no reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it?” Agatha asked in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know. It looks really beautiful on you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's because I'm looking at you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew it wasn't the wine. She'd been turned on since she saw that photo yesterday, and nothing seemed to help her. Nothing could turn off the goddamn fire that only seemed to burn hotter with every passing second. And the fact that Agatha was in front of her didn't help at all. She looked really good, it hurt. It struck Rio’s heart, and made it pound rapidly in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked down at Agatha’s lips, and she so desperately wanted them on hers. She wanted to feel Agatha close to her. She wanted Agatha. She didn't care if this was a first date and she was supposed to act like it was, she just wanted the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was so aroused, so full of lust that the slightest brush of Agatha’s shoe against her skin made her body twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Be back in a few minutes,” Agatha said with a smile, getting up from her chair. She walked closer to Rio and pressed a soft kiss to her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that soft gesture only made Rio’s stomach clench. She won't be exaggerating if she said she had never been this aroused in her entire life, and it was driving her insane.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched Agatha walk toward the restroom. And Rio definitely noticed the way she tried to walk normally, but her mind was too fuzzy to acknowledge it, especially after Agatha had told her not to worry earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     After only three minutes, Rio got up and followed Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was washing her hands when Rio stood behind her. Agatha smiled as she looked at her reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Missed me already?” she said as she turned around to face Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      So much,
     </em>
     ” Rio replied, grabbing Agatha’s wrist and shoving her into the nearest wall. She didn't care about the woman who looked at them as she exited. Rio crashed her lips into Agatha’s with desperation, with need, hunger and lust.
    </p>
    <p>
     She started the kiss but wanted Agatha to take the lead of it, she wanted Agatha to shove her tongue down her throat. She wanted to feel Agatha taking her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha did. She kissed her back with urgency and heat. Once Rio surrendered, melting in Agatha’s hold, Agatha took the lead and kissed Rio like she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands found Rio’s hips, and Rio pressed her body closer,
     <em>
      closer
     </em>
     to Agatha’s, needing the feeling of her so badly. It physically hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled back slightly, their faces a few inches apart as they tried to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Please just fuck me.
     </em>
     ” She pleaded near Agatha’s neck. Her breath was hot against her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Please, Agatha. Please just fucking fuck me. I need you,
     </em>
     ” she said, desperately trying to hold onto Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She rested her hands on Agatha’s hips, her mouth pressing ghosts of kisses on her face, down to her neck and cleavage, filling her senses with Agatha’s scent all the way down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will. I will. Let's get home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head up “
     <em>
      No. Want you to fuck me right now, you can ruin me later.
     </em>
     ” She said, looking directly into Agatha’s piercing blue eyes, and she noticed the shift in them. “
     <em>
      I need you. So please just give me what I want.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She took one of Agatha’s hands and moved it to the exposed skin of her thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, making sure of it. The way Rio was looking at her. Pleading and begging to be fucked by Agatha, it was too much, and Agatha knew she couldn't refuse it. She couldn't deny Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were in a public place. Anyone could walk in and see them. So Agatha had to be quick. She had to make Rio feel good physically, even though she knew Rio was hurting because of the conversation earlier. She knew it triggered her trauma. Because Agatha knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she couldn't deny Rio now, not when she begged like this, when she was turned on like this. Agatha wanted to give her whatever she desired.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand went inside the slit of Rio’s dress and when her fingers met Rio’s bare sex “Oh, god, Rio…” She moaned softly into Rio’s open mouth. She felt the warm silk with her fingers, Rio was
     <em>
      drenched
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers separated the lips and Rio lifted her leg up to give Agatha better access. But Agatha put it down the next second, then she turned Rio’s body around to pin her against the wall, supporting her body in case it gave out. She took Rio’s leg, putting it around her waist , and secured it by keeping a strong hold on Rio’s thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers found Rio’s clit, rubbing it quickly, trying to give Rio the orgasm she so desperately wanted, but also needing to be quick. She kept rubbing on the bundle of nerves and Rio moaned loudly, so loudly for where they were. So Agatha leaned in and took Rio’s mouth in hers to make sure she kept quiet, to swallow her moans and whimpers even if she needed to hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two of Agatha’s fingers entered Rio with ease because of how wet she was. And she thrusted, pumping in and out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was panting, breathing so heavily. She buried her face on Agatha’s shoulder, when their mouths separated and tried really hard to not moan, to suppress every sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was certain the sound of Agatha’s fingers pumping in and out of her drenched pussy were audible to anyone behind the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two more thrusts, and Rio came, her orgasm tearing through her. Pleasure filled her entirely. Her entire body trembled in Agatha’s hold. Weakened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed the side of her head as she gradually slowed her pace, then withdrawing her fingers after kissing Rio’s temple. She kept her hold on Rio’s thigh for a few more seconds until she felt that Rio’s body was stabilized and able to hold her weight again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in and kissed Rio’s lips tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she took hold of Rio’s hand after adjusting her dress, and led them out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s cum coldened on her fingers, she wouldn't have wasted it like that if she wasn't in a goddamn hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hurried to pay the check, grab her phone and Rio’s jacket. Then they stepped out, the night’s breeze embracing their burning bodies.

    <p>
     They got into Agatha’s car, both of them fastened their seatbelts, and not a single word was shared between them. Only their heavy breaths, that didn't seem like they wanted to calm down, filled the stretching loud silence. But their eyes spoke volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned her face to the side to look at Rio, who was already looking at her with hooded, shining eyes. Her cheeks were slightly pink, and her chest was still rising and falling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze was hungry, waiting to devour, it was filled with lust but also a great amount of concern that concerned Rio in return once she locked eyes with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze was thirsty, and nothing could possibly fill her except Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, cupped Rio’s face, and crashed their lips in a kiss filled with affection and warmth. Pouring their needs into each other’s mouths and finding the fulfillment in the tip of each other’s tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s heart was pounding rapidly in her chest as their kiss became charged and intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio’s hand traveled up to rest on Agatha’s chest and to sense her heartbeat, Rio felt her own heart stop when she was met with warm skin instead of fabric. She froze completely for a few moments until she melted back.
    </p>
    <p>
     The feeling of Agatha’s skin underneath her touch sparked something in Rio’s stomach, and the way her heartbeats were fast and unsteady made Rio moan softly, for which Agatha hummed in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their mouths parted, and their foreheads leaned against each other as their heavy breaths mingled and shared the unsteadiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took hold of Agatha’s hand and rested it on her chest, making Agatha feel her heartbeat. To feel what she's doing to Rio’s poor and weak heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes as she felt her heartbeat racing, and felt Agatha’s too, which, in a way, were sharing the same insane, threatening speed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I need you Agatha. In every way, I need you.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said, pushing Agatha’s palm closer to her chest, as if she wanted Agatha to penetrate her chest and feel Rio’s heart in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     When those words left Rio’s mouth, Agatha’s breath hitched as she swallowed so hard that Rio was able to hear it, but she didn't offer a verbal response. She took Rio’s hand from her chest and kissed the back of it several times, with tenderness and warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few minutes passed with them sitting in the car in the parking lot, pressing their foreheads, feeling each other’s heartbeats, and listening to every inhale and exhale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes and looked at Agatha. The moment she did, her heart tightened in her chest, a sudden strike made her breaths heavier. Looking at Agatha like this filled her body and soul with feelings she's afraid to put a name to.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled away, sitting in their seats. Agatha started the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at Rio, and a soft smile was painted on her lips, not like her usual smirks. But her eyes were still full of hunger, it grew even sharper.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drove them. Rio wasn't sure if she was going to take them to her house or Agatha’s, or if she wouldn't even take them anywhere and just fuck Rio in the back of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand didn't hesitate this time. She put her hand on Rio’s thigh, brushing above the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio now realized that not wearing her coat back—because her body was burning and she only tossed it in the back seat—was a wrong move, because Agatha’s fingers were drifting to the slit of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     But every time Agatha brushed her fingers, she moved them higher or lower, passing her path to the burning exposed skin. Never touching it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio managed to stay silent, swallowing every little sound. But Agatha didn't seem fond of that. She'd look to the side and see Rio squirming and breathing heavily, and she'd smirk, but she still needed to hear Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     So this time, her fingers had a purpose, she moved them up and down the slit, while her eyes stayed on the road in front of her. She pushed the fabric aside (the fabric that Rio tried so hard to pull together so her thigh would stay covered since she got into the car), and Agatha’s chill fingertips met Rio’s hot skin. At that Rio let out a whimper, unable to hold it back, and that seemed to satisfy Agatha, but she didn't stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers went higher, she even moved her body slightly so she could extend her hand more. Rio forced her eyes closed at the torturing yet delightful sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers touched the wet curly hair between Rio’s thighs and she closed her eyes. She probably forgot that Rio wasn't wearing underwear, or maybe she
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to savour it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes opened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Eyes on the road, Agatha.
     </em>
     ” Rio said, her voice small and breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened her eyes and looked at Rio, then back to the road.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to ruin the seats, Rio?” Agatha said with her sultry voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      No,
     </em>
     ” Rio whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh? Because you're
     <em>
      dripping
     </em>
     all over them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I'm—I'm aware of that,
     </em>
     ” Rio said, breathless, as she felt Agatha’s long fingers spreading her folds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are?” Agatha looked at her. “You should’ve thought about it before coming without your underwear on.” Her gaze flicked to the road. The tone Agatha used was deep and low, as she was trying to mask how affected she is by all this, as if she could cover anything, really.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You should’ve thought about wearing a bra, because I can see your hard nipples from here,
     </em>
     ” Rio said as she rested her head on the seat and a moan escaped her throat when Agatha’s fingers started rubbing her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't able to see Agatha’s ‘hard nipples’, but she wanted to comment something about them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, that's because you drive even my nipples to go insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing that made Rio’s body twitch in response as a shiver ran down her spine all the way to her cunt and made it clench around nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept the steady, slow pace on Rio’s clit, the pace that was driving Rio insane in the most pleasurable way, and she was close to her climax. She felt Agatha’s fingers slow even more, threatening to leave, because Agatha had to make a turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      No please.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to,” and she withdrew her silk-coated fingers and put them on the steering wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I was so close,
     </em>
     ” Rio whined at the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I know” Agatha bit her bottom lip slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After making the turn, Agatha’s fingers didn't move back to resume their work. Even when Rio tried so hard to make Agatha do something. By ‘so hard’ she was only looking at Agatha while remaining silent, her face flushed red from the alcohol in her system, from how turned on she was, and because Agatha had denied her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, smirking wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” She said, looking at how Rio was looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't say a thing, she only pouted slightly and kept looking at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We'll be home soon, try to manage it,” Agatha said. Still, Rio only looked at Agatha’s side profile while staying completely silent, her breaths the only sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s fingers moved on her dress, entered the slit, and reached her heat. She moved one of her legs slightly higher to have more space, while keeping her eyes locked on Agatha and how her jacket was fucking open, and the side of her boob was visible to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breath hitched slightly, and at the same time, Agatha looked at her. Her eyes widened and darkened at the same time, the blue in her eyes got completely swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What…” A lick of her dry lips, “What are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You told me to manage it,
     </em>
     ” Rio said as she gathered her juices and spread them, starting to rub her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, keep going,” Agatha said, and her hand flew to land a rough hold on Rio’s thigh, spreading her legs even wider, and Rio was fucking grateful for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Touch yourself, come on, Rio,” and Rio did, the encouragement from Agatha did wonders for her. It made her fingers move insanely, as if she lost control of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thank god they were on a highway.
    </p>
    <p>
     A moan escaped Rio’s throat, high and lustful. Agatha looked at her, and their eyes locked. Both of their irises were completely swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I bet you've done that before. Touch yourself while wearing this,” Agatha said, looking at Rio’s black dress, as the sounds of Rio’s fingers moving on her drenched pussy, the rubbing sounds on her clit, her heavy breaths and soft moans filled the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I did
     </em>
     ,” Rio responded with a moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course you did,” Agatha remarked, her voice low and heavy. Her eyes dropped down to Rio’s hands, then up to her hooded eyes. She licked her lips, then her gaze shifted to the road ahead of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio continued touching herself, it didn't matter how absurd the situation looked, fucking herself in Agatha’s car in front of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though she was close to her orgasm, so fucking close, it seemed like she couldn't reach it. Because those weren’t Agatha’s fingers, and she
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     desperately and eagerly needed them. She knew if Agatha would only move her fingers slightly, Rio would come undone immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha…
     </em>
     ” She called her, Agatha’s name wrapped in a breathy moan made Agatha’s head snap to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmmm?” She hummed in question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I’m so close… Please just touch me?
     </em>
     ” Rio pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was too engaged in this, so invested in the way that she was at Agatha’s mercy. All of the teasing was making her burn in arousal and need.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, baby.
     </em>
     ” Agatha said with a mocking pout. “You've done it before, so do it now. My hands are occupied.” Agatha said, intending to sound mean, and her voice did the job. But her eyes? The way she twitched slightly after hearing Rio beg her and ask her to touch her? Those betrayed her. Her body showed it all, despite how hard she was trying to mask it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, you're a big girl, I know you can manage it,” Agatha said, wetting her dry lips for the hundredth time that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     The praise did something to Rio’s system. She felt herself getting wetter and felt the way the dress under her started to get moist. But that didn't help her to reach the orgasm she so desperately needed. Instead, it worsened the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She resumed touching herself, and it felt like she was doing it from the start. But the way she was drenched and how her body twitched once she touched her clit said otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thought about adding her fingers, but the space was tight for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She unbuckled her seatbelt and lifted her body, about to move to the backseat to get the space she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Absolutely not.
     <em>
      Sit down.
     </em>
     ” Agatha said, the command in her voice made Rio sit right back, any brattiness she was about to use wouldn't have worked anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so mean.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, but maybe you should learn some self-control.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha mentioned self-control, and Rio’s hand started moving on her clit once again, as if Agatha were talking to a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled, absolutely affected by the act.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Just talk to me then, please? I need to cum, please, Agatha.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want me to say? That I will fuck you senseless tonight? Fuck you until you can't say your name again? Make your beautiful pussy swollen? Make you beg me to stop? Hmm? That's what you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh fuck, oh fuck,
     </em>
     ” Rio moaned
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'd like me to ruin you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Yes, yes, I do, yes,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmmm. Come on, you can cum for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I want to, but I can't. I need you.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. She moved her fingers and replaced Rio’s on her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio threw her head back as she closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt it, there, she just needed one more touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     And fuck, Rio opened her eyes as she felt Agatha’s hand move away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Why, why?
     </em>
     ” Rio whined. She was on the edge of crying because Agatha was being so fucking intolerable, and she kept denying her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Put your legs down, we're almost home.” Agatha said as if it were nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I was so close,
     <em>
      so close.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say anything. She just kept driving. And Rio felt herself on the edge of exploding.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They arrived at Agatha's house. Agatha unfastened her seatbelt calmly, while Rio did it in a hurry. She got out of the car before Agatha did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha walked to open the door and Rio was behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she unlocked the door, she grabbed Rio’s wrist from behind, pushed the door open, and stormed inside while pulling Rio with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shoved Rio to the wall next to the door and crashed her lips into Rio’s. Kissing her with obvious lust and hunger. Agatha needed to be fed, because she was just as affected as Rio was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pinned Rio’s hips to the wall while holding them tightly, in a way that was absolutely maddening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed Rio like there's no tomorrow. Like her mouth won't be meeting Rio’s anytime soon. But the truth is, that kiss was the beginning of too many others that will be uncountable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio surrendered completely to Agatha’s mouth and hold the moment she felt Agatha’s hips become flush with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gave up to Agatha’s tongue, letting it consume her, taking what it wanted and needed. She only let out soft moans that would have been walls-crushing if Agatha’s mouth wasn't devouring hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if Rio didn't surrender to Agatha, she knew Agatha would take the control either way, Agatha made that clear from the first time her fingers rewarded Rio with an orgasm on that kitchen island.
    </p>
    <p>
     When air became a necessity, Agatha pulled back slightly. Their faces so close, they shared the same air.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next second, Agatha took hold of both of Rio’s hands with one of hers and pinned them above Rio’s head on the wall. Agatha’s other hand rested on the small of Rio’s back through the small space between Rio’s body and the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed Rio’s body forward just slightly, then she held some amount of fabric from Rio’s dress and pulled it back, making the dress tighter,
     <em>
      tighter
     </em>
     on Rio’s body. Making her curves more visible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her navel, her hip bones, her nipples were hard and visible even through the two layers of fabric covering them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha did that, she didn't even look up at Rio. Her gaze traveled down to Rio’s body, and Agatha’s breath hitched. She looked and kept looking, wetting her lips every few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was too far gone, because the way Agatha was looking at her made her burn. Made her stomach clench, as a shiver ran down her spine and made her body twitch slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pleasure and the amount of arousal Rio got from every time Agatha looked at her were indescribable. Things that absolutely cannot be put into words, things she can only feel.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pleasure of being looked at. Of being absorbed with eyes. Examined. Studied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her eyes up and locked them with Rio’s. What Rio saw there alarmed her of what's coming, because Agatha was looking with fucking famishment! As if mouths and fangs grew in her eyes, devouring Rio with just a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Do you know how fucking beautiful you look right now? Do you know how you drive me fucking insane? Are you aware of that, Rio?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't provide answers, because those weren’t questions, those were statements.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled the dress back even more, making it shorter from how much fabric she fisted. And more pressure was applied to the hold she had on Rio’s wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha directed her leg to the slit and pulled the fabric of it to the side with her leg to make space for it to enter through it. She lifted her knee up and immediately pushed on Rio’s bare sex.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned, a hot breathy moan left her throat the moment Agatha started putting more pressure in a circular motion. At the same time, she pushed Rio’s legs wider, so her clothed knee was directly under Rio’s pussy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes were fixed on Rio’s body, looking at it as she continued pushing, pulling and pinning.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her gaze up once again, and another moan escaped Rio’s throat, this one louder as she felt Agatha’s knee directly on her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      This body is mine, Rio. And nobody else’s. Nobody gets to see this perfection, this masterpiece of a body. Nobody gets to worship your body but me. Nobody gets to appreciate every curve and detail of it but me. It's mine, Rio. Your body is mine.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I’m yours.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You are.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crashed their mouths together. Sucking and nipping on Rio’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled back again, and Agatha’s knee didn't slow down. She was determined on making Rio cum on her pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     A couple of seconds passed and Rio came with a loud cry, her body shivered as her orgasm tore through her. Her orgasm was explosive and hot. After being denied in a harsh-pleasurable way, it was fucking worth it.  Her orgasm was long, it felt like it wouldn't even end.
    </p>
    <p>
     And before she knew it, another orgasm tore through her, making her body shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha…
     </em>
     ” She moaned Agatha’s name, which at this point wasn't just a name. It was her salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept her knee there as she slowed the pace, waited for Rio to calm down and her body to be steady, then she put her leg down on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     She locked eyes with Rio, and kissed her again, with more fever and heat, the tender kisses were too far gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled away, Agatha released the fabric of Rio’s dress and set her wrists free. Then her eyes lowered down to her pants and a circular-shaped silky wetness was on her knee. Rio looked down at where she was looking and then their eyes met. Rio was looking with some embarrassment in her gaze, but Agatha? Agatha was fucking delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she pushed her fingers to Rio’s pussy, and collected a great amount of her juices.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was sensitive, and her body seemed to recognize Agatha’s fingers, so it warned her with a shiver to run through her entire body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha withdrew her fingers. She looked at her now wet, glistening fingers, and she shoved them into Rio’s mouth the next second, which Rio was glad to suck them clean.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio was able to complete the task and suck her mess, Agatha took her fingers out of Rio’s mouth. She put them in her own, and sucked her now silva-coated fingers, with the great smell and taste of Rio’s pussy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers were all Rio, from the smell to the taste.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed around her own fingers in pleasure, as she locked eyes with Rio. Then she leaned in after taking her fingers out of her mouth and pressed a kiss to Rio’s lips. Then she drifted lower, kissing her neck and sucking on her pulse point, pulling loud moans from Rio’s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Agatha started going even lower, she put both of her hands on the wall, technically caging Rio, and she started kissing Rio’s breasts above the fabric. Lower to Rio’s clothed abdomen. Her contoured navel. With the way Agatha’s body and mouth were going down, Rio felt herself floating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha continued her kisses that weren’t only kisses, they were prayers of worship.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed both of Rio’s hip bones, and she kissed Rio’s sex from above the fabric. She continued her act of praying, kissing Rio’s thighs, knees, shins, and ankles, until she reached her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kneeled on one knee, as she looked up at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked dizzy with lust, with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took one of Rio’s legs and put it on her knee, then she took Rio’s heel off and kissed her shin once again before putting the leg down and repeating the act with the other one.
    </p>
    <p>
     This act of worshipping was something sacred for Rio. Something she'd never experienced before. To feel like a goddess underneath the touches and kisses of a woman like Agatha was something unbelievable, because Rio literally felt herself being worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
     And at the same time, she felt undeserving of it all, and there her mind started drifting.
    </p>
    <p>
     But before she could get lost in the maze of her thoughts, Agatha spoke as she kissed Rio’s body all the way up until she stood on her feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Never in my life have I seen a woman like you, Rio.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha said then she pressed a kiss to one of Rio’s collarbones
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      And trust me, I've never said that to any other woman but you
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the other one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio understood why she felt like a goddess being worshipped, but to feel as a
     <em>
      shrine
     </em>
     herself while she stood there? That she couldn't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took hold of Rio’s palm and held it tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go upstairs,” Rio nodded, “If you're thinking about taking the dress off, then don't do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she leaned in and kissed Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got upstairs. She stepped into Agatha’s bedroom, and the room this time had more lights on, and it was more occupied, other stuff and pieces of furniture were added.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked around the room as she sat down on the edge of the bed intertwining her fingers on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Agatha stepped inside with two bottles of water in her hands, and her face glistened from the water that remained on her face from washing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took the bottle from her hand and drank more than half of it in one gulp.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned on her back afterward, then rolled to the side, looking at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you okay?” Agatha asked as she sat on the bed next to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, and a soft smile was painted on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “More than okay. But I need to see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said, her fingers reached out, playing with the button of Agatha’s jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go ahead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the permission was granted, Rio sat on her heels next to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the two buttons on the jacket, and instead of pulling the jacket off Agatha's shoulders, Rio rested her palm in the valley between Agatha’s breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hot skin met hot skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked as Rio started massaging the skin, going up and down softly. Then she took the jacket off, and was met with a blessing of a view. Agatha’s chest was a perfection. Her milky skin, the way her boobs looked perfect and delicious, and the rosy, hard nipples made Rio’s mouth water. She kept looking, as she lifted one of her hands up and took a nipple between her thumb and index finger, rolling it and squeezing it moderately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth was slightly open, but no sound was coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took the other nipple with her fingers, giving it the same amount of attention, as her other hand drifted lower to unbutton and unzip Agatha’s pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her body up, and Rio managed to pull the piece of garment off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha’s knee that was wrapped in a bandage, and a sense of panic rushed to her system.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, it's nothing really, just a mild sprain.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How—What happened?” Rio said as she stretched Agatha’s injured leg to lay down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was moving some furniture, and it just happened. Probably because I turned my body too fast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you go see a doctor?” Rio asked, as she so tenderly and gently started moving her hands on the bandage. Not even literally on it, just a ghost of contact, afraid she'd hurt Agatha in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No I didn't, because it's nothing, Rio.” Agatha said. “Honestly it's nothing, don't look at me like that.” Agatha chuckled as she saw the look on Rio’s face. She leaned in and cupped Rio’s face with both of her hands. “I'm fine.” Then she leaned even closer and took Rio’s pouted lips in a tenderly sweet kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they pulled back, Rio still looked unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want me to do to prove that it's not serious?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha asked, brushing her thumb on Rio’s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go see a doctor, for example.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, I will.” Agatha said and then stole a sweet peek from Rio’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The atmosphere changed instantly and became charged and thick again once Agatha took Rio’s hand and guided it to her clothed sex.
    </p>
    <p>
     She used Rio’s hand, moving it up and down, Agatha didn't moan at the contact, but Rio did. Feeling the heat of Agatha radiating through the thin fabric made her heart race.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few seconds Agatha stopped the movements but kept her hold on Rio’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take it off,” Agatha said, looking Rio directly in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio understood what was being asked, so she got up from the bed and stood on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took hold of the fabric and looked at Agatha for guidance on how to do it. Because she knew Agatha needed a show, and she was willing to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go slowly,” Agatha licked her lips, and Rio obliged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Making a show of taking the dress off, gradually showing more and more skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha propped on her arms, looking at Rio in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You're ravishing
     </em>
     .” Another lip-lick. Agatha was getting hungrier and hungrier, needing to devour.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, come here gorgeous let me take it off myself,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obliged once again, and got back to bed. Agatha sat straight, and took the dress off herself, much quicker than Rio had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the garment fell off of her and got thrown somewhere, Agatha looked at her body, then back to her eyes and she took Rio’s lips in a hungry kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they kissed, Agatha managed to guide Rio’s body to sit against the headboard during it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled back and Rio’s body started trembling. Her body was clearly affected, as if this was the first kiss they shared. As if this was her first kiss ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned back in, and took her swollen lips in another heated kiss as her hands roamed on Rio’s body, touching it with precision.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of her hands went behind Rio’s back and unclipped her black bra within a second. Once it fell down and Rio was completely bare for the second time in front of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand cupped both of her breasts, and started massaging them with a circular motion of her palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Majestueuse,
     </em>
     ” she whispered near Rio’s mouth and continued kissing her, as her palms continued their movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s leg went between Rio’s, putting pressure on her most sensitive part in her body—the part that despite its sensitivity, still begged to be touched and ruined by leaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment their mouths parted, a thin string of saliva connected their lips, Rio let out a loud moan at the attention she was getting on her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     A moan she was most likely holding the entire night. Or maybe since she saw Agatha the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because it was loud, it was crushing, charging the room with her pleasure. It was more like a scream, a heated, lustful one
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn’t been given this attention, hadn’t been touched like this, looked at like this in years. Or maybe never. She'd never been this touched. She'd never felt touches on her body like Agatha’s, because there weren’t any.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      It terrifies me how much I need you, Agatha,
     </em>
     ” Rio said, breathless, as Agatha added more and more pressure using her leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Don't be terrified, angel, because I need you just as much
     </em>
     ,” Agatha said, leaning in to kiss Rio’s exposed throat. “
     <em>
      Even more.
     </em>
     ” She added.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laid Rio’s body, her head resting on the soft, dark purple velvet pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her leg stopped and was replaced by her hand. She rubbed on Rio’s clit slightly with her thumb. Rio’s legs parted widely, instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s index and middle fingers moved on her slit, up and down, until one of them entered Rio, and Rio moaned a breathy moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stretched the tight hole deliberately, and as she was about to add another finger, Rio voiced “
     <em>
      More, please,
     </em>
     ” and Agatha did, adding a second one. Then a third.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha started thrusting with the three fingers, as her thumb kept rubbing on Rio’s swollen clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     A low moan escaped Agatha’s throat, as she felt the way Rio was swallowing her fingers completely and looked at how flushed and breathless Rio was. Her chest was rising and falling heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Relax your body for me,” Agatha said, and their eyes connected.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I can't, not when I'm so…full of you,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s other thumb brushed Rio’s bottom lip slightly, making her mouth part instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Relax for me, baby,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, then she closed her eyes, as she inhaled through her nose and exhaled through her mouth. The warm breath hit the tip of Agatha’s thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do it again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio did, several times. Her body relaxed under Agatha’s supervision and encouragement. Her muscles loosened.
    </p>
    <p>
     The slow pace Agatha used while Rio was breathing was too far gone now, she started thrusting with three of her fingers at a fast speed, penetrating Rio completely. Her fingers hit Rio’s g-spot with every thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cried out. Cursing and moaning Agatha’s name, as the thrusting became even faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands were gripping the sheets tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     A shin of sweat glistened her forehead. She closed her eyes, the sounds of Agatha’s fingers pumping inside her filled her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I'm—I'm close,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I know, cum for me. Come on, baby,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I'm gonna cum…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Do it. Come on, ruin those sheets for me, I know you can do it,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     And she did. She came all over Agatha’s fingers, her orgasm exploded through her. Warm liquids managed to gush out between Agatha’s fingers, ruining the sheets exactly as she had been asked to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, oh my… fuck.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her orgasm continuing, her body still trembling, Agatha’s fingers continued thrusting, as the warm liquid kept gushing out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved her fingers and looked down at Rio’s pussy, the way it continued to clench even after Agatha had removed her fingers, and the short waves of juices were still cutting through.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, Agatha…
     </em>
     ” Rio said, trembling as she tried to gasp for air.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So fucking beautiful and
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     goddamn impressive. Jesus… Do you think you can do that again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha asked, looking at Rio with affection and pure delight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't respond, she took her time to regain her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I didn't even know I could do that… like this, this much, I mean…
     </em>
     ” Rio said, still breathless, as her grip on the sheets loosened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved her fingers on Rio’s slit again, and her body twitched, as her thigh muscles tensed. “
     <em>
      I think I can…
     </em>
     ” Rio answered the question with a moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good.” Agatha said. Then she sat down, took Rio’s legs and put them on her shoulders, then she leaned in, her warm mouth making a connection with Rio’s sensitive heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her long tongue went over and over Rio’s pussy, licking and sucking it, not wasting a drop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hips jerked up, a little overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want me to stop?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      No… just—can you wait please?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course. Do you need anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmmm? What is it?” Agatha sat on her heels, Rio’s legs still on her shoulders. “Anything, just say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Can you take this off and come sit on my face?
     </em>
     ” Rio asked, pointing at how Agatha was still wearing her underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha did, she took her leopard thong off, and came to straddle Rio’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said as she sat down. “Let me look at you first?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s tongue moved left and right on her bottom lip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she crawled up the bed until she sat against the headboard where Rio sat before. Without Rio saying anything, Agatha spread her legs and gave Rio the view she so fucking desperately wanted to see.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breath quickened rapidly, her eyes darkened, if Rio was drenched then what is Agatha? She was
     <em>
      fucking submerged
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     To the point that once she spread her legs, the smell of her flooded Rio’s senses. She inhaled the intoxicating, strong scent. Her eyes traveled to meet Agatha’s, then she sat on her fours and crawled her way to Agatha’s pussy.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the scent was strong before, now it's
     <em>
      saturating
     </em>
     , making Rio’s heady dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat on her heels and started moving her fingers on Agatha’s slit, testing the texture of it, the feeling of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched noticeably, her eyes half-opened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put the tip of her middle finger on Agatha’s entrance, and pushed half of it inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You've been this wet the whole night?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Yes, Rio. Every time I looked at you, I felt myself getting more and more soaked.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh God.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Mhmmm. Now, will you let me ruin your pretty face?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Please, fucking use me,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lay down on her back after looking at Agatha for minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat on her face, both of her hands using the headboard for balance.
    </p>
    <p>
     She rode Rio’s face, used her tongue and nose to bring her closer and closer to the edge. She kept riding and moving her pussy on Rio’s tongue and Rio was fucking happy to be used for Agatha’s pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     The taste of Agatha, the smell of her, the weight of her, the feeling of her, those what mattered. Those things filled Rio’s head entirely, leaving no space for anything else. She was floating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha came with a loud scream. Her orgasm tore through her, making her tremble while sitting on Rio’s face.
     <em>
      Her seat of relief
     </em>
     . Her orgasm was a kind of an explosion, a compensation for the ones she held inside all night.
    </p>
    <p>
     After her body calmed down. She sat on the bed again, and started kissing Rio while embracing her, holding her body tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     —
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few more orgasms, they were drained and exhausted. The sheets were completely ruined. Their voices were hoarse; they’d lost them to the screams of pleasure. The room was filled with the smell of sweat and sex. The atmosphere was thick with satisfaction and heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their sweaty, tired bodies were flush against each other, embracing with peace and safety, kissing each other’s salty and warm skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio buried her face in the crook of Agatha’s neck, feeling her chest raising and falling steadily against hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let's take a shower,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha said after a few minutes of silence, squeezing Rio’s arm gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her then leaned in to kiss her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How’s your knee?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine. I wasn't feeling it most of the time. Too lost, I guess,” Agatha said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does it hurt?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A little, yes, but nothing I'm not used to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you get hurt when your phone fell down and called me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said with a smile of amusement as she remembered the memory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed a breathy laugh, a sound that is so intoxicating and addictive.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, it was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled widely.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they got up. Agatha helped Rio to stand on her feet because her body was sore and too weak to hold her weight. They got into the bathroom, and Agatha turned on the water to run a bath for them both.
    </p>
    <p>
     She helped Rio get in gently and made sure she sat down without any sign of hurting, even if it was simple.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Rio’s temple.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll be right back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and Agatha kissed her again then she stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence of the bathroom and the feeling of the warm water on her body made her relax and close her eyes without moving.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't open her eyes until she felt Agatha come in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at her, that soft, tender, sweet smile that makes Rio feel like she won the entire world by looking at it. And Rio smiled at her in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you by any chance keep some cigarettes in here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio asked as she looked at the tall white cabinet, joking about how it was full of stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Actually…” she said after opening the lower door of it. “I do. Because I like smoking while I'm sitting in the bath. Does wonders to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened slightly, because she only said it as a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabbed the pack of cigarettes and a lighter as well, and put them near them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she joined Rio after taking the bandage off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s back was on Agatha’s front, sitting between her legs. Agatha washed Rio’s body tenderly. She apologized with a whispered “
     <em>
      I'm sorry,
     </em>
     ” and a soft kiss every time Rio’s body twitched as a reaction to how sensitive she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the sweat on their bodies and the juicy evidence of their long, pleasurable night got washed out, but their scents and touches on each other’s body lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat there, in the warm water facing each other, looking at each other’s eyes and finding a safe home in there. Nothing matters but this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reached out for the cigarettes, handed one to Rio and put one between her lips. She leaned in and lit Rio’s, then hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Second time we smoke together, huh?” Rio said as she laid Agatha’s injured leg in the water and started massaging her knee gently. Moving her hand on it, tender fingertips touching with care.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Agatha smiled and blew a cloud of grey smoke into the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their smoking break came to an end. Agatha took the cigarette butts and threw them in the garbage.Then they dried off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they brushed their teeth together, the feeling of domesticity hit Rio right in the chest. Because it was a simple act, but it was genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stepped inside the bedroom again, new sheets were laid out and adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave Rio two options, a sky-blue robe or a long t-shirt and underwear. And Rio obviously picked the second option. She put them on and Agatha wore her silky purple robe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave her a bottle of water, which Rio drank it all without a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have some kind of cream or something to put on your knee?” Rio asked and Agatha nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She handed it to Rio, who told her she wanted to do it. Rio applied the cream to the injured knee, the sharp minty scent of it filled their noses. She applied it gently while massaging the injury with practiced hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she wrapped it with a new, clean bandage and gave Agatha’s knee a gentle kiss, and Agatha reacted with that beautiful smile of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     They lay down on the bed again, Agatha holding Rio’s body securely, wrapping her with warmth and peacefulness. Rio’s head rested on Agatha’s chest, and their legs tangled underneath the soft duvet.
    </p>
    <p>
     And they slept, lulled by the sound of their heartbeats and steady breaths.

    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     What Rio felt as she opened her eyes and sensed a head buried in her neck was the real definition of happiness, and when she looked down and saw who it was, she sure as hell felt something undefined yet, and probably always will be.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio fell asleep hours earlier, her head was buried in Agatha’s neck. Agatha’s calming scent, her warm skin, her gentle fingertips brushing Rio’s arm, her embrace, and Agatha’s last words when she whispered, “
     <em>
      Good night,
     </em>
     ” as she kissed the top of Rio’s head before Rio’s eyes grew irresistibly heavy, those were the things that Rio fell asleep to.
    </p>
    <p>
     So to wake up to such a sight was something she didn't think of. She didn't think it was even possible. The way Agatha’s nose was literally resting on Rio’s pulse point, one of her arms embracing Rio's waist softly, but it was a really tight hold for someone asleep. Agatha’s upper body was flush on Rio’s, not a single inch between them, and one of her legs was resting between Rio’s, which was the main reason that Rio woke up in the first place, aside from the warm sigh that Agatha sighed on Rio’s skin. The stimulation Rio was feeling every time Agatha moved slightly caused her to shiver or to take a breath in helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want to move. Rio wanted to live in this moment forever, and just replay it and replay it all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't think Agatha was a cuddling person. Every time they did, Rio thought it was because she was asking for it without saying the actual words, and Agatha always acted upon it without saying a thing. But now? After seeing her like this? After feeling her like this? Rio felt herself melting, becoming one with the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moved her arm and embraced half of Agatha’s body with it, feeling the silky fabric on her skin, and her other hand went up and rested on the back of Agatha’s head, pulling her forward gently. Then she pressed a soft kiss on her hair, burying her face in those dark strands in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Being next to Agatha felt like rebirth. It was a rebirth.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Right at that moment, Rio was able to feel the blood running in her body. Feeling her lungs being filled with air that feels and smells like Agatha. Feeling the warmth of Agatha’s body embracing her. Listening to Agatha’s soft breaths, and feeling them hit her skin gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Probably that's what being alive feels like. It feels like being next to Agatha.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced up at the curtains. She was able to see the sun rising through the little gap there, then she looked back at Agatha. A smile found its way to grow on Rio’s face immediately. She put a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, her fingers lingered, touching her earlobe softly, debating whether she should wake her or try to go back to sleep. But god, she knows such a sight shouldn't be disturbed. This is holy. But the urge to see those blue eyes looking at her, to hear Agatha’s voice, to feel her fingers on her skin, and
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     to see her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio closed her eyes despite the urges, trying to bring sleep back to her, and she'll wait for Agatha’s blue oceans to drown her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The sweetest “
     <em>
      Hey,
     </em>
     ” landed on Rio’s ears. Then she opened her eyes to see the shiniest smile on Agatha’s face, it was so shiny and illuminating it could light a universe. But Rio took the light of it all, and she felt the seeds inside her grow, feeling a morning glory open inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning.” Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio’s forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning,” Rio replied. The smile on her face was a reflection of Agatha’s, just like when the sunlight reflects on the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her fingers up and started brushing Rio’s hair gently, and just like a little kitten, Rio closed her eyes as the warmth of the touch spread inside her. Feeling Agatha’s fingers moving gently on her scalp sent a wave after wave of warm shivers to run through her, making her bring her legs closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to go out somewhere today?” Agatha said after pressing a kiss to Rio’s hair beside where her fingers were still moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's the other option?” She opened her eyes again, looking at those electric blue irises looking back at her, sending electric waves to run with her blood, making her heart pound.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We can just stay here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, that sounds tempting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and leaned her face closer. “Are you hungry? I made pancakes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned as she put her hand under her head and kept looking to her side, to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing, you're just so beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted her lips, the smile still visible in her features, in the way her cheeks were pushing up her eyes, leaving her eyelashes to blink on each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll bring you breakfast.” Then she leaned in again, kissing Rio’s forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha left to the kitchen, and even though the bed was tempting to stretch and stay lying on, she had to get up. So she did, went to the bathroom, washed her face and brushed her teeth then she sat against the headboard after adjusting the bed and checking her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     A minute later, Agatha got in with breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Honeyed pancakes, a mug of coffee, boiled eggs, and peeled tangerine on the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just need to do some work, then we can do anything you want,” Agatha said as she sat against the headboard on her side of the bed and put her ceramic mug on the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took Agatha’s hand, traced it gently, then she lifted it up to her lips and kissed the back of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Rio's smiling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio was about to take the first bite, Agatha put her glasses on. And Rio melted, like an ice cube. Feeling the melting water running down between her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, she said she only wears them when she drives at night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't pull herself together when she was drunk,
     <em>
      of course
     </em>
     she won't when she's sober and nothing occupies her head but Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked fetching. Magnetic, pulling Rio in her magnetic field as if she's nothing but a small piece of metal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her and Rio almost passed out when she peered at her over the glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why aren’t you eating?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The way her nose looked right now, the way the tip of it would feel like in…
    </p>
    <p>
     Nope, Rio, focus.
    </p>
    <p>
     She held the cup of coffee in her hand, her eyes never looking away, afraid if she blinked she'd waste a moment of this holiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm eating.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Eat, Rio. Don't look at me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not allowed to?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're allowed,” Agatha chuckled. “Just eat your food, you haven't eaten anything yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Actually I ate,
     <em>
      twice
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head slightly, then looked back at the screen in front of her. The tip of her tongue moved from side to side, wetting her upper lip, her smirk was visible on her mouth as her tongue rested on the tip of her lip. And Rio’s eyes were lost there the entire time, lingering there. Fucking living there.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a sip of her coffee, studying Agatha’s side profile. The way her glasses rested on her nose, looking like
     <em>
      an ethereal being
     </em>
     . The way her mouth pouted forward in focus as her long fingers moved over the keyboard. She put the mug down, and while her gaze stayed in place, she reached for the tangerine.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at Agatha’s neck as she moved her hand up to scratch the skin there in thought, and despite the tender scratching, her pale skin turned pink immediately. Rio's eyes drifted even lower. The way Agatha’s robe shifted slightly to the side allowed Rio’s devouring eyes to feast on the exposed skin. Absent-mindedly, Rio felt her fingers digging into the tangerine, making drops of its juice fall down into her coffee. But she paid no attention, she was still looking at Agatha and how purple was literally her fucking color.
    </p>
    <p>
     A strand of hair fell on Agatha’s face, and Rio’s eyes drifted upward at the same time, following the movement of Agatha’s hand as she tucked the strand behind her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licked her lips, and Rio’s eyes dropped to them as she put a segment of tangerine in her mouth. The fruit tasted so sweet. Almost like Agatha. Even though, nothing tastes as sweet as her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha called as she kept looking in front of her and typing. The way she called her name was enough for Rio to know what she was asking her to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmmm?” Rio hummed in response. Still staring at Agatha. Lost in her maze with no intention of finding her way out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her glasses off and looked at Rio, but before she could say anything, Rio’s hand reached for hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep them on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wear your glasses back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked as she looked into Rio's eyes. She lifted her thumb up, and brushed Rio’s bottom lip with the tip of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that why you're distracted? The glasses? Really?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled as she continued moving her thumb, her eyes locked on Rio. Their hands touched, but she made no move to put the glasses back. “See? You're almost drooling over them. I shouldn't put them back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed her moan. She wouldn't give up this easily, even if she was on the edge of kneeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her other hand moved, taking the glasses from Agatha’s hold. She lifted them up and put them on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, god,” she moaned, unable to hold it any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her hand and placed it on the back of Agatha’s head, pulling her forward. Their mouths connected in a soft kiss that tasted like the sweetness of that tangerine segment. But Rio immediately deepened it, tilting her head slightly to the side, sharing the bitterness of their morning coffee as their tongues tangled and sucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved the laptop from her lap and placed it on the nightstand without breaking the kiss. One of Rio’s hands pulled Agatha closer and closer, even though there wasn't any ‘
     <em>
      closer
     </em>
     ’. Her other hand was softly clenching the rest of the tangerine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Agatha’s lap was empty, Rio straddled her, sitting on her thighs, making sure she didn't hit her knee as the kiss grew hungrier, more desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands rested on Rio’s hips, while Rio’s free hand moved deliberately, up and down across the exposed skin of Agatha’s cleavage.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lowered her hand down and opened the loose tie of the rope belt. Once it was undone, her hand moved again, palming the now more exposed skin, feeling its softness under her touch. Rio pulled back for a gasp of air, then kissed Agatha again a second later.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her body up, her hand moving the silky fabric aside, letting it hang on Agatha’s shoulders, baring her front entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio broke the kiss after a few seconds. Before she could drop her gaze to look down at Agatha’s body, Agatha bit her bottom lip slightly and pulled her back into another kiss, her short nails digging deeper into Rio’s hips. Rio moaned, and Agatha swallowed the sound, letting it vibrate into both of their mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha’s glasses bumped into her forehead fueled Rio’s body even more, it was maddening.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled back again, gasping for air to fill their lungs. Rio’s eyes drifted down, gazing at Agatha’s chest, her abdomen, her navel, her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     She started palming one of Agatha’s breasts while her other hand squeezed the tangerine onto the other, making its juice drip onto her rosy nipple.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing… it'll be sticky later.” Agatha looked down at Rio as she licked her lips. She was breathless, still catching her breaths, but still smirking knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And is that a problem?” Rio asked, then wrapped her mouth around the nipple, sucking, tasting.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Agatha’s hands flew to the back of Rio’s head, pushing her forward.“
     <em>
      No,
     </em>
     ” she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kept sucking and licking, running the full length of her tongue across Agatha’s breast, as she rolled the other nipple with her thumb and index finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     She moved her head up after biting the the skin slightly, making Agatha whimper faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at Agatha. The way her eyes were framed with those glasses made Rio drip down every time she looked at them as hot waves kept rushing through her entire body, settling in her stomach and between her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She squeezed the rest of the fruit, letting the juice drip from Agatha’s collarbones. A few drops slipped lower, resting on the right side of Agatha’s upper abdomen, leaving a soft yellowish trail on her pale skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s tongue licked from Agatha’s collarbone down to where those drops rested, tracing their path, then repeated it again. The sound of her tongue gliding along the wet trail of saliva mixed with sweet juice and skin was loud in their ears, given how close they were.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand, now sticky with fruit, reached out to place the limp segments back on the tray. She licked Agatha's skin once more, then looked at Agatha's chest. It was rising and falling, slightly pink and glistening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at Agatha for a few long seconds, not doing anything, just looking and appreciating the sight in front of her. Until Agatha broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmmm?” She hummed, adjusting her glasses with her middle finger. “Won't you finish what you started?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      God, she was doing it on purpose.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand slipped under Rio’s t-shirt, and Rio felt her composure slipping. Agatha cupped both of Rio’s breasts and Rio just looked at her. When Agatha touched both of her nipples and started rolling them between her fingers, Rio started grinding instinctively on Agatha’s thigh, her hips jerking forward, seeking the fastest friction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look so beautiful like this.” She pulled a nipple, making Rio moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Come on. Put your juicy fingers in my mouth. Don't hesitate.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, swallowing down her sounds. She moved her hand up and pushed three fingers into Agatha’s open mouth after processing the command in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed in approval immediately, sucking on them, tasting their sweet flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then one of her hands left Rio’s breast and she moved it up, wrapping it around Rio’s wrist, pumping Rio’s fingers in and out her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck
     </em>
     …” Rio moaned as she grinded again on Agatha’s thigh, and Agatha nodded in encouragement to go on as she pinched her nipple. So Rio started rubbing her pussy on the length of Agatha’s thigh, she felt the fabric of her underwear sticking into her slit from how wet she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling her fingers inside Agatha’s mouth, being sucked on like that, being used like that,
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     , it felt heavenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha continued sucking. The sound of her mouth taking Rio’s fingers in and out was making Rio dizzy, and so goddamn desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took Rio’s fingers out of her mouth as her other hand left Rio’s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take your clothes off,” Agatha said, but Rio felt something running into her, electric and fiery, as Agatha’s touches left her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s half-lidded eyes widened, and she stopped the movement of her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her saliva-coated fingers started moving on Agatha’s clothed cunt. She moved them on her slit from the limited space she had from how Agatha’s legs were separated slightly, moved her middle finger on it, making the fabric almost get pushed into Agatha’s hole alongside with the tip of her middle finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmmm?” Rio hummed without even looking at Agatha, her eyes busy focusing down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled through her nose as Rio’s finger continued moving on her slit over the drenched fabric, pushing it in slightly. She held the front of the thong with two of her fingers, making it a thin line of drenched fabric, exposing the dark curls of hair. Then she started moving the line of fabric up and down Agatha’s slit, making sure it hit her clit every time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked back up at Agatha and her heart started beating quickly in her chest, to see that Agatha, despite the way she was breathing heavily, her chest red, her eyes half-lidded, her pussy dripping constantly, she was clearly affected by it all. Despite all that, she was only looking at Rio with an unreadable look.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s heart dropped into her stomach, as her fingers stilled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did she do something wrong? God, did she do something she wasn't supposed to do? Was it too much? Did she drift away? Why was Agatha looking at her like this?
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can still do that when your clothes are off.” Agatha said as her glasses almost slipped down, and she adjusted them back with both of her middle fingers. Rio looked at her. She understood what was being said, yes, and that's why she peeled her t-shirt off immediately. But why was she panicking right now?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat down on bed and before she could continue what she was doing or ask further questions to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come here,” Agatha said as she offered her hand to Rio, and she took it, Agatha tapped on her thighs after adjusting her position against the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her for a second, hesitating as if she wasn't sitting there a second ago. Yeah, she'd never had panic symptoms in the middle of a situation like this before.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, she really ruins everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     After swallowing her thoughts away, she obliged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha intertwined their fingers together once Rio sat back down. Despite the fact she was sitting there, on Agatha’s thighs, she felt herself afar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her glasses off and their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the moment she looked directly into Agatha’s blue eyes, she realized she wasn't far away, she, in fact, was close.
     <em>
      Too
     </em>
     close…
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was that look?” Agatha asked as the back of her hand started stroking Rio’s cheek softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What look? No, I'm sorry, I just…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes softened, and the smirk on her face earlier was nowhere to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you just look at me? Look at me, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her and Agatha’s hands rested on her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't make any other move, they just sat there looking into each other’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now was the only time Rio felt herself exposed in front of Agatha, and it wasn't pleasant. It was quiet in the loudest way. Rio swallowed down a sob, because why on earth was she feeling like this right now? Did she do something wrong? She can't afford mistakes. Not now. Not with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look…” Agatha broke the silence. “If there's something I don't want, I will tell you.” The back of Agatha’s hand started moving higher, stroking the soft skin of Rio’s waist. “You don't need to overthink everything you do for me, Rio. I want this. I need it.” Up on the side of her breast . “And trust me, if there's anything wrong I will tell you,” she said, as her hand lingered a beat too long on Rio’s heart, feeling her unsteady and loud heartbeat. “I’m not trying to analyze you...” her hand started caressing her collarbones. “But
     <em>
      please
     </em>
     , Rio, can you try to stop thinking that everything you do is wrong and a mistake? Because everything you do is crafted gently. Everything you say is measured bewitchingly. And I want it all, Rio. The good and the bad. Show it all to me. Give it all to me. I will take it, as long as you're willing to give it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand rested on the back of Rio’s neck, brushing the small hairs there. Then she lifted it up and started stroking Rio’s cheek with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes were fixed on Agatha’s. She was looking at how her pupils dilated every time she said Rio’s name out loud. Rio noticed that, and it made her heart tighten in her chest every time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breath got trapped in her throat. She couldn't inhale properly. She squeezed Agatha’s hand absentmindedly, the one that was intertwining with hers. Not saying a word, because can she afford being vulnerable?
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if what I have to give is so little and not enough?” Rio asked. Her tone was sharp and clear, but the tears started falling down from her eyes, fast, hot and transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her fingers up and brushed the tear away, and Rio’s hand wrapped around her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if I showed you what I've got, then you realized it's nothing?... I'm sure I have nothing to offer you, Agatha. What's then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in as her hand rested on the back of Rio’s head. She gently pushed Rio’s head forward, their faces a few inches apart as their fingers remained intertwined by Rio’s tight hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want that little, Rio. I
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     wretchedly need it.” Agatha leaned closer, her forehead almost resting on Rio’s. Their warm breaths hit each other’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      So… if you want me right now? Then take me, Rio. I want you to take me.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha whispered close to Rio’s mouth as the tears continued to fall down.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there sat Rio on Agatha’s lap, amongst her cries and Agatha’s whispers. Feeling her heart beat in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put her hand on the back of Agatha’s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I want you
     </em>
     .” The words were so faint and they barely left her mouth. She pulled Agatha in for a kiss, a kiss that was so tender, so mellow, with a hint of salt from Rio’s tears that managed to fall on her lips earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needs the kiss to land right, because if her mouth can't form the words, maybe it can kiss them. Make Agatha feel them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled back and looked into Agatha’s eyes. All the softness of the world was lying in her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took Agatha’s other hand and intertwined their fingers together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at their hands on both sides, then she looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if I hurt you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You won't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As their fingers remained intertwined, Rio suddenly felt the silver around her thumb. Agatha’s ring, the one she didn't take off because she didn't even feel it there. But now she was aware of its weight wrapping around her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled her hand gently, took the ring off and looked at it, then put it on Agatha’s thumb. Her eyes drifted back to her eyes. She took both of Agatha’s hands and put them on her hips, then she pulled the remains of the fabric off Agatha’s shoulders and Agatha leaned back against the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in, her mouth a breath away from Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Open for me then. If you want me to take you.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licked her lips, looking at Rio’s mouth then her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got off bed and took her shorts and underwear off, then she took the breakfast away from the bed, putting the tray on the nearest surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got in bed again, leaned in and kissed Agatha as she sat on her heels between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you want me, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In the way you want me to take you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in and kissed Agatha again as her hand started palming Agatha’s pussy through the very thin line of drenched fabric. Agatha moaned into her mouth when she felt Rio pulling the fabric aside, and two of her fingers entered her. Rio broke the kiss as she took her fingers out and spread the juices on agatha’s slit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I want all of you, and I feel selfish for wanting you this much, for craving you this much.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She maintained the slow movements of her fingers, running them up and down, making sure she hit Agatha’s clit every time. Then she pushed her fingers inside again, started pumping them deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't aiming at making this an agony to Agatha, she just wanted to feel her. Feel the warmth of her walls. The way her tight hole swallows Rio’s fingers. The way Agatha’s body shivers noticeably. Her hands struggled to stay still. She wanted to touch Rio and even guide her, but at the same time she's offering herself and wants Rio to consume her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened her mouth, about to say something, but it got replaced by a high-pitched moan when Rio started thrusting faster, and even faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Can you… Fuck…you feel good, so good, baby… But let me… shit.
     </em>
     ” Moaning each syllable breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took Agatha’s hand and guided it to her clit as she continued thrusting, and Agatha started rubbing her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, tap on it. And tell me what you want, I'll get it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licked her lips as she looked at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes were half-lidded and full of lust. As the movement of Rio and her own fingers continued, Agatha moved her other hand up and held her hair in a ponytail, holding on to it for dear life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put her other hand on the shin of Agatha’s non-injured leg and bent it up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmmm?” Rio hummed in question as she added a third finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, Rio… my phone, jesus. I should get this call… fuck me!
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio now realized what that buzzing was, it wasn't in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smirked as she leaned in and kissed Agatha’s bottom lip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it something important?” She took Agatha’s hand away and her middle finger replaced it on her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio continued thrusting as she started rubbing, but she slowed her pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take it then… or cum for me right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of Agatha’s hands took hold of Rio’s hair, pulling it up roughly. She pulled Rio’s head in and kissed her, it was messy and desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back, her forehead resting on Rio’s as she exhaled heavy breaths through her nose, and she kept pushing Rio’s head forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me cum and stop doing that.” She said through gritted teeth. Her orgasm was resting on the edge and it needed to get pushed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Doing what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, Rio, just let me cum.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you do better than that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The phone probably buzzed for the fifth time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Please.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     God, even pleading in her voice was a fucking symphony.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started thrusting her three fingers faster into Agatha, and it wasn't only a few seconds later that her body tensed, her walls clenched around Rio’s fingers, and her eyes rolled back as her orgasm tore through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cried out, and Rio kept fucking her through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio waited a few seconds, then she took her fingers out and sucked them clean. She leaned in and kissed Agatha. Before Agatha could even protest, Rio took hold of both of her shins and made her slide down into the bed, making only her upper body lie on it, and making sure that her head landed on the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took both of Agatha’s legs and put them on her shoulders, making sure not to hurt the injured knee. As she remained sitting on her heels, making Agatha’s bottom body lifted up for her. Her pussy waiting for Rio to devour it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     …”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha called, her voice soft and pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you comfortable?” Rio asked from between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. Goddamn it, go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lowered her mouth and started sucking, entering her tongue into Agatha’s hole and listening to her breathy curses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s body started trembling immediately, so Rio tightened her hold on her legs and pushed her body forward, burying her head in Agatha’s pussy as she started eating her out.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she got closer to her orgasm, Agatha’s hips started jerking up, making Rio’s mouth change its direction every time. So she tightened her hold and lifted Agatha’s body up, making only her head rest on the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stretched her upper body up, leaned her head down, and wrapped her lips around Agatha’s clit. Bit the bundle of nerves slightly, then started sucking on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cried out, her body started shuddering, her hips jerking up as she lifted her hands up to reach for Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio continued what she was doing. She took Agatha’s whole pussy into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few seconds passed and Agatha’s body crashed. Her orgasm was eruptive and hot. She tried to put her hips down, but Rio was keeping her up with her hold on her legs. And she kept sucking, until Agatha came for the third time and the muscles in her legs tensed more than any time before, her thighs were hard as rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head up but Agatha’s body continued trembling. She took Agatha’s legs off her shoulders gently and put them on the bed one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even after putting them down, Agatha’s hips were still jerking up, as her chest was red and heaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put her palm under Agatha’s body, and her other one rested on her hip. She pushed her down gently, until she felt Agatha’s back lying on her palm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she moved up and adjusted the pillows under her head. And she felt Agatha’s eyes following every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio dropped the duvet over Agatha’s body as it continued to shiver slightly from the sudden rush of coldness in her system.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in and kissed Agatha’s chin, her lips, her nose, her cheeks, between her eyebrows, her forehead, her sweaty hair and she rested her face there.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe you should pick up that one,” Rio said with a chuckle after the phone buzzed for… who’s counting?
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're wild.” Agatha said as she closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can be.” She kissed Agatha’s scalp again. “Want me to run a bath for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, just lie beside me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio did.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     They lay there, Rio staring at the ceiling as she felt heat radiating from Agatha’s body beside her, thinking about the fact that she was lying beside Agatha and she wasn't freaking out.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt… normal. Not the standard definition of normality. Not in the sense that this is typical and expected and empty of new emotions. It was normal in the sense of making Rio’s entire body dance, and she isn't minding it or scared of it, and even not being scared of it didn't feel scary. It felt domestic and serene.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like, this is it. This is what she wants, Agatha by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, Agatha had fallen asleep, so Rio removed the cover off her body, got out of bed and stood up, stretching her arms up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned her head back to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thought you were sleeping.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you whispering?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat. “I thought you were asleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmmm.” Agatha sat against the headboard, not bothering to lift the covers up her body. She stretched her arms up, and Rio was just standing there, dumbstruck, looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm gonna take a shower, and you can join me only if you promise you won't make me late because I have an important call that I should’ve been done with two hours ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips. “I can't promise anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, then just find something else to do until I finish, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's so unfair.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, can you behave for half an hour or not?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let's say not, what are the consequences?” She poked her cheeks with her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put a few strands of hair behind her ears, then she got out of bed, walking toward Rio, completely bare. Looking glorious. Looking godly and so out of reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because everything Agatha does seems to be sublime, every simple act and gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way her hip bones look when she sways them slightly as she walks? God, that's her place of worship. That's what Rio wants to look at while she's kneeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her mouth water, craving who's approaching her. Because she cannot get enough of Agatha. Rio wants to give what she has to Agatha, and she
     <em>
      yearns
     </em>
     to take what Agatha has to offer her. All of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood in front of her, and Rio lifted her hands up to rest them on Agatha’s hips, but Agatha was quick to stop the act by taking both of Rio’s hands, holding them by their sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't want to know the consequences, so behave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio’s lip softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her when they pulled back slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like, you'd punish me?” Rio asked, the urge to test the limits flooded her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slid her leg with ease between Rio’s, and Rio moaned the same moment it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Behave.” Her sultry voice was laced with so much amusement and promising.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded eagerly. She wants to behave for Agatha, god, she wants to satisfy her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha loosened her tight hold on Rio’s hands, then she flicked her exposed nipple. The sudden mixed rush of pleasure made Rio moan, and she jerked her hips forward, making Agatha’s thigh add some stimulation on her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good, now go to the kitchen and eat something, don't starve yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and crashed their lips together, which made her knee get pushed in even more, adding more pressure on Rio’s cunt as her other hand grabbed her ass. Rio’s body twitched, and she leaned in, trying to grind on Agatha’s thigh muscle, to chase that fraction again on her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha pulled back, landed a light slap on Rio’s ass, then she walked away. Put her robe on and headed to the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood there for a few long seconds, looking at nothing in particular as she continued running her fingers on her lips in disbelief, in heat and arousal.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needs to change that goddamn underwear. But she didn't even come here in underwear in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio walked around the room, found her t-shirt and put it on. She took the tray of food next and stepped out of the room, hearing a faint sound of running water through the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat on the couch after eating the breakfast that she was supposed to eat, chugged down her cold coffee, washed the dishes, and picked a book to read from Agatha’s library.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened the book and looked at the first page. There was a short note written with a pencil in French on the corner of the page, which Rio knew was Agatha’s handwriting, but she couldn't read what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She read a few pages of the book. When she flicked to the next page, a few scraps of paper fell into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pencil sketches of a woman that had to be Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew it from the hair cut and not something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of them was the redhead wearing a skirt and a sweater, while the other was a sketch of her face and body with great details, from her head down to her pubic bone, and the rest remained undrawn. The third one was just a ghost of a body, no details or features.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Wanda’s naked body sketch, not to admire the body but to admire the work. Admire the way Agatha’s eyes captured the details and how her hands drew them. Aside from her appreciation of Agatha's great talent, Rio felt herself burn inside. The fact that Agatha’s eyes and hands had looked and touched and appreciated and drawn a body other than hers made her feel sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if she was aware that she didn't know Agatha for a long time, her body still reacted to the nausea that formed in her stomach. Her entire body got diseased with jealousy she wasn't fond of, and the worst of it all, she didn't know how to deal with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned the paper around, and there was something written there, long note written in French.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried her best to read it, to understand what was written there. The only thing she was able to understand was the ‘
     <em>
      Je suis
     </em>
     ’ that was written three times in different places. So she picked the other piece of paper and turned it around.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      We could slip away, wouldn't that be better?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Me with nothing to say, and you in your autumn sweater.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio just kept looking at the sketches, unaware of Agatha’s arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of all the books, you picked
     <em>
      The Bell Jar
     </em>
     ?” Agatha said with a smirk, as she pointed at the book beside Rio with her eyes. Rio looked up at her and Agatha stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put the papers back in their place and smiled back at Agatha. “Nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood beside her, leaned down and picked the book up and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Those are… they're old.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I know,” Rio said, trying to sound as optimistic as possible even if she wasn't that composed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put the book down, took Rio’s hand in hers, then she walked to be in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cupped Rio’s face with her other hand, brushing her thumb on her skin gently while her other thumb was brushing Rio’s knuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking down at Rio’s face, while Rio looked up at her, her legs widened slightly which made a space for Agatha to step forward and stand between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're old, three years ago, even older.” Agatha’s voice was incredibly soft and reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “I know they're old,” she said as a soft smile found its way to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then their eyes connected when she pulled back slightly. She lifted both of her hands up and cupped Rio’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her touches were so tender, her eyes were so soft, making Rio’s heart sing in her chest, and her silence was so comforting, it was peaceful and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know if her emotions were so obvious and easy to read or if Agatha was that good at knowing her. Knowing what she was feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she could sense Rio’s distress that fast, could she also sense how helpless Rio was for her? Could she hear how her heart pounds in her chest every time she gets close to her? Every time she does the simplest things ever? If she was able to notice the way Rio’s breath got unstable more than once, did she notice it every time? Did she notice it when Rio kissed her, touched her or even just inhaled her scent?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hands were moving up and down Agatha’s legs as Agatha continued brushing her thumbs soothingly on Rio’s skin, looking into her eyes, seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her eyes water, because, all that softness… It was overwhelming. Rio isn't used to that. To be treated like this, held and touched gently. Rio knows the rough side of it, the loud and messy. She spent her whole life over-explaining herself and yet remained misunderstood, then Agatha comes and shows her that she can see her and hear her without even voicing it out loud. Showing her that she deserves the tender side of it, she deserves an explanation to comfort her, and her emotions aren’t too much, because Agatha can feel them just as well as her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked the tears away, then she closed her eyes briefly as she inhaled a deep breath. It smelled like Agatha’s perfume, the one she puts on her pulse points.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips as she opened her eyes. “Did you finish your work?” Her hands continued moving up and down the side length of Agatha’s legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled as her fingers moved up to trace the bridge of Rio’s nose. “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled back, that toothy bright smile of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And did you wrap your knee back?” Both of her hands started moving up and down the sides of the injured leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands rested on the back of Rio’s neck, and both of her thumbs stretched to their lengths, resting on Rio’s pulse points.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted Rio’s head up, looking down at her, and Rio felt herself floating in her headspace as her hands stopped moving and stilled on the back of Agatha’s thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes were half-lidded and her mouth slightly parted as Agatha continued drawing invisible circles on Rio’s pulse point with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You're so beautiful,
     </em>
     ” Agatha whispered, and Rio felt her heart being ripped out from her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had called her beautiful several times before, but this time, Rio felt it in her bones. To be called beautiful from a goddess like her. It's a lot to carry and feel.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You're so beautiful,
     </em>
     ” Rio whispered back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned down and kissed her parted lips gently.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     A few hours passed. They tangled on the couch, embraced by the heat of their bodies and the soft whispers. Rio walked around the living room looking here and there while she felt Agatha’s eyes following her. Then she took care of Agatha’s leg just like the night before. Then she moved a few pieces of furniture and changed their places because she didn't want Agatha to do it herself. Even though Agatha protested and tried to make her sit down in
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     many different ways, Rio didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Agatha when she opened her mouth to protest or she just grinned like an idiot and did what she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two times she moved the wrong stuff on purpose so Agatha would call her and tell her which one was the right one.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she finished, Agatha was in the kitchen, cooking them lunch. Rio didn't hesitate this time to wrap her arms around Agatha’s waist and rest her head on her shoulder. She didn't hesitate to inhale deeply and fill her senses with Agatha’s scent. She didn't hesitate to kiss her skin or roll Agatha’s sleeve up when it fell down two times.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't hesitate not because she was used to it, but because Agatha made it feel natural. As if Agatha was pulling Rio in to act on her desires. Encouraging her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio certainly felt that pull before, but she didn't act upon it. She didn't dare to.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whispered near Agatha’s ear something that landed the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands stilled. She turned around, pinned Rio on the counter by the hips, and pushed her thigh between Rio’s as she started talking about the most casual things. Rio moaned an involuntary moan, she was already so aroused since the morning, that the slightest bit of stimulation made her body shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha kept adding more pressure, kept talking, as Rio buried her face in Agatha’s shoulder despite the fact that Agatha demanded her attention. Rio couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the potatoes on the stove were boiling next to them, Rio was boiling on the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned a high-pitched moan into Agatha’s shoulder, as she put both of her hands on her back, holding on Agatha for dear life. But Agatha, the goddamn wicked menace that she is, she pulled her leg away while Rio kept her head buried there.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, she loved to deny her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood there panting, aroused, denied and dripping.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the rawest need of them all, was the fact that Rio wanted this. She wanted both, to be touched and denied. She wanted whatever Agatha was willing to offer her.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few long seconds passed, and she had to ask Agatha to give her some new clothes or just show her where to.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to act so casual about asking it, but the way Agatha smirked as she continued cutting the vegetables? That woman was so goddamn tormentous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put the knife down, turned around and moved to the sink. Washed her hands then dried them as she just kept looking at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?” Agatha asked, trying to sound ignorant about it. Rio saw the way Agatha's pupils dilated when she pushed her knee and felt how soaked Rio was through the layers of fabric. So she knows damn well why.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mean why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think you look beautiful in those.” She stepped forward and Rio felt her heart drop down into her stomach. If Agatha tried to edge her again, she'd lose it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I know…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stretched her hand out, acting like she wanted to grab something from beside Rio. So Rio felt threatened immediately and pulled her legs together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, I need to change my underwear, Agatha. Why are you doing this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did I do now?” Agatha said with a chuckle as she grabbed a pot and put it down again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her. “Can you please just give me clothes?” she tried again, and Agatha seemed like she appreciated that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, facing Rio. “If you want me to touch you right now, just say it and I will do it.” Her gaze drifted to look at Rio’s lips. “Do you?” Her eyes drifted up again. Her pupils dilated and hungry. “I can smell how fucking soaked you are from here…” She leaned closer, making Rio move back, her hands grabbing the counter, while her spine hitting it. “So why don't you ask for it? Hmmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—” Rio tried. She'd jump on that goddamn counter if she had the space.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're what?” Agatha looked down at Rio’s parted lips that she kept licking to wet them, then Agatha’s gaze drifted lower, to Rio’s heaving chest. “Go upstairs and pick what you want to wear, Rio.” Her thumb brushed Rio’s bottom lip for less than a moment then she pulled away. Giving Rio the space to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio breathed in and out as she kept looking at Agatha. It was there on the tip of her tongue, the question, the reason, all of it. But she swallowed them down. No alcohol in her system to make her voice what she wanted at this moment. So she just went upstairs, picked the clothes, and headed to take a quick shower to cool her body down.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She put the shirt on (the oversized earthy green button–up shirt that she saw Agatha wearing at Lilia’s house. She picked it up immediately the moment she glanced at it.) It smelled like Agatha, a piece of clothes that was so full of her. So Rio just stood there in the bathroom, hair wet, water dripping down from her body, grabbing the shirt by its collar and sniffing it like an addict.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she turned around to the mirror, looking at the marks Agatha had left on her skin last night.
    </p>
    <p>
     She traced them with her fingers through the open buttons of the shirt. And as she did, she remembered the way she pleaded and begged Agatha to take her the night before, in the middle of their date. How driven she was, how she pumped into a woman’s shoulder just so she could get into the restroom as fast as possible. And how Agatha fucked her, she didn't just fuck her, she took care of her after she asked, even if Agatha doubted it, considering the place they were in and the state Rio was in.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I need you. So please just give me what I want.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha didn't hesitate a second after that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked away from her reflection, took her necklace, and put it back. She whipped her hair back and forth, then she stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She went downstairs. Agatha was looking at something on her phone, propping her head on her arm on the counter. Her body was slightly stretched, back arched, and
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     how her butt was looking right now.
    </p>
    <p>
     That shower Rio used to cool down? It absolutely didn't work, her body started heating up again, making the drops of water on her body evaporate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha adjusted her posture as she looked at Rio. She looked at her from head to toes. “Couldn't really find where the shorts are,” Rio admitted as she stepped forward, looking down at the shirt that was covering half of her thighs. And it was clinging to her wet body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're in the…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think it looks good like this,” Rio interrupted with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood in silence for a second, then she found her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It does look good like this.
     <em>
      You
     </em>
     look good.” Agatha licked her lips. She was basically drooling. Her eyes kept drifting to Rio’s cleavage.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     They sat down, facing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze was mostly on Rio. Rio would lift her eyes up only to see her already looking. Rio smiled, and Agatha would smile too. She searched Rio’s face with her eyes every time Rio talked. Her eyes landed on her mouth as she spoke, then she'd lift them up and lock them with Rio. Both of them would sit still when their eyes connected, as if the whole world froze around them while they're melted in their seats across from one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt herself being filled up with happiness every single time Agatha laughed or reacted to something with a sound. And she did that a lot, which meant that Rio was full of happiness while sitting across from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who knew that a good meal is good because of the company? Definitely not Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just know you were a wild kid,” Rio said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, definitely, the worst.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Really?” Rio put her spoon down as she grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Really.” Agatha chuckled. “My mother once told me that rules were invented because of me, and I kinda made that my whole personality.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, what's the worst thing you've done?” Rio said, her voice laced with great amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked as she ran the tip of her tongue over her upper lip. “Burned the house down. And on purpose.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No way. Did someone get hurt? Like, did you get caught?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed again. “Nope, it was empty, that was the purpose. And my mother didn't report me because she wouldn't be able to handle the shame and the way people would look at her. But she did bring it up every time she had an episode of yelling.” Agatha lowered her gaze to her plate. “But I'm not a pyromaniac, it was a once-in-life thing, and that house was suffocating anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why did you do it?” Rio propped her head on her arm, looking at Agatha’s face, spotting every micro-expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was something stupid, I was a…coward.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kept her eyes on her, demanding more. And Agatha remained silent for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was the only way we could live somewhere else. Because… I was fifteen, and got caught with a girl from my school. I got blackmailed for months…” Agatha chuckled awkwardly. “And the worst thing at the time wasn't going to a correctional facility, it was my mother finding out that I'm a… a lesbian.” She said the last sentence with a gesture of her hand, dismissing the subject as if it's nothing. “That bitch would’ve dragged my life into a lower layer of hell at the time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was looking at her, lost in the images she was picturing in her head, teenager Agatha. But she was pulled back from her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I bet you were a polite-looking troublemaker.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked as she processed what was being said, then she grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “More like a rude-looking troublemaker.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? What's the wildest thing teenager Rio has done, aside from naming her punk band The Scissors?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio narrowed her eyes as she poked the walls of her cheeks with her tongue. “Well, do you consider fucking your girlfriend in your aunt’s office while she was talking with someone on the door a wild or an average behavior?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You did not! How old were you?” Agatha chuckled in disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sixteen. And she found out because Alice didn't shut up about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, so you and Alice were…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.” Rio laughed. “And my aunt, aunt Teresa, she was my guardian
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     a therapist. You do the math of it.” Rio was giggling after saying each word as the memories of her rebellious years flooded her.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     After they finished eating, Rio insisted on washing the dishes once again. So Agatha let her, as she sat close by, looking at Rio’s every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact that Agatha hadn't touched Rio in any way since she got out of the shower made Rio’s heart beat in her chest. Agatha only kept looking at her from a distance. Even though her eyes were devouring and her gaze was burning, she didn't do anything. And the restraint Agatha was showing was driving Rio crazy. Even without being touched, she was turned on. She felt herself getting more and more aroused every time she glanced at Agatha. Which is crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened a bottle of wine for them after Rio suggested they have a movie “afternoon” since they don't have any other plans, and Agatha only nodded with a smile, even though Rio was almost clinging onto her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why don't you have a TV?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't need one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you absolutely do. Or we should start having movie afternoons at my place.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha chuckled as she shook her head. “This is the first time we do this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not an excuse,” Rio responded as she picked the movie on Agatha’s laptop, Antonia’s Line (1995).
    </p>
    <p>
     “I once saw you on TV, you know?” She said, looking at the screen in front of her as Agatha placed the wine and the snacks that Rio picked on the coffee table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You saw me? When?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head up and looked at her. “It was an old documentary about artists and you were in it… it was the day after I saw you at the bar.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't remember it. How old was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I couldn't tell,” Rio lowered her gaze down, “but you looked beautiful in it.” Lowered her voice as she said that.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They began watching the movie while sitting side by side, but half hour in, Agatha was lying on the couch and the laptop resting on her abdomen, and Rio was clinging to her side while resting her head on Agatha’s chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then another thirteen minutes passed, after Rio’s second glass of wine. Her leg was on Agatha’s, her shirt lifted up, not caring about it. Rio looked up at Agatha for a few seconds, hoping that Agatha would look down at her, but she didn't. So Rio pouted her lips slightly as she looked down at the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've always wanted to have a tattoo,” Rio said out of nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed for her to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So… I want you to draw on my body.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked down at her. “You want me to draw on your body?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused the movie then she lifted Rio’s face up by her jaw, and their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want me to draw?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know. Anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.” And she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got up to bring the supplies she needed. Brushes and paints and all. Then she came back and opened the nearby windows.
    </p>
    <p>
     She assured Rio three times that the paints are usable on skin and the brushes are new and clean, and she made sure that Rio knows that the paints have a strong smell. She also kept asking if Rio was sure she doesn't have any skin problems or allergies and if her body isn't sensitive to chemicals. And Rio assured her every time that it's totally okay.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Turn around,” Agatha said after Rio took off her shirt and remained only in her underwear, which made Agatha’s mouth water constantly, noticeably.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I want to look at you,” Rio said as she leaned against the couch armrest. “It won't ruin the couch though?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't worry about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was standing away from Rio. She kept looking at the body in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped forward, brush in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other stuff was set on a small table nearby that Agatha dragged from her studio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bent one of her knees up, making room for Agatha to sit between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes connected. Agatha lifted her hand up and started palming one of Rio's breasts. The shiver that ran through her body felt like an electric wave. It made her tremble immediately, as her half-lidded eyes kept looking at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ran the brush on Rio’s skin, and she shivered again as she struggled not to jerk her hips up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It tickles,” she said, her voice no louder than a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled as she repeated the movement of the brush, testing it on Rio’s skin, moving it on the valley between her breasts. Rio was looking at Agatha, she was already feeling dizzy. She felt her body heaten up every passing second.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha started moving the brush around her nipples, making them erect and sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Agatha’s hands started moving up and down Rio’s body. Starting with her cleavage and resting on her hips. Then she put the brush in her hair bun and started massaging Rio’s body with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt as if Agatha was doing a series of rituals on her body. Praying and blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you done this before?” Rio whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at her, holding Rio’s hips with both hands as she started drawing invisible circles around the edges of Rio’s navel with her thumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.” She slid one of her hands to move lower. From Rio’s pelvic bone down to her shin. Her thumb teased the inside of Rio’s thigh on the way down, making Rio whimper, so Agatha repeated the movement on the way up, and as anticipated, Rio whimpered even louder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked to the side and pulled the small table toward her. Rio kept looking at her as she opened the paints, took the brush from her hair, wet it with alcohol, then she used it to mix blue and purple on the wooden palette.
    </p>
    <p>
     She moved the brush gently on Rio’s skin. Starting right under her left breast. And Rio felt herself getting lost in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched as Agatha repeated the same movements time after time, her fingers working fast, because, as she explained to Rio, that the paints dry fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt herself getting used to the feeling of the brush on her skin, but she didn't get used to the way Agatha tried really hard not to place her hand on the wrong place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you drawing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bluebells. Saw them in your garden.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled as she bit her bottom lip.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Who knew that feeling like a canvas would also feel like being worshipped?
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha changed the color to green, Rio felt the brush starting from her fifth rib down to her pelvis, feeling its gentle brushes as Agatha’s other hand was resting on her other hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked so beautiful while she was focusing. The way she kept her eyes on the place she was working on. How precise every movement she did and how it landed gently every time. Rio noticed that if Agatha was fully focusing on something, she wouldn't speak unless spoken to. She'd nod with her head, hum, or even offer a look, but the verbal responses were only when Rio asked her something or spoke to her first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved slightly between Rio’s legs as she leaned in to draw something on Rio’s abdomen.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't realize her knee was putting pressure on Rio’s pussy until she felt Rio’s body shivering under her touch. She looked up at Rio and saw how dilated her pupils were and how her chest was rising and falling rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She moved her knee immediately. “Fuck, I’m sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked down to see the patch of wetness on Rio’s underwear as her body continued trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at her, “Did you…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, I’m sorry. Fuck, this is…” Rio covered her face with her hands out of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, she said she'd lose it all, didn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, hey, why are you apologizing?” Agatha asked her as she removed Rio’s hand gently and looked into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m gonna wash my hands.” Agatha said, her eyes wide and dark.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she leaned in and captured Rio’s lips in a heated kiss that left Rio’s bones aching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back then she got up, walking in rushed steps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked down at her body, tracing down the paint delicately, afraid she'd ruin Agatha’s work, so she touched it with ghosts of touches as her heart kept beating rapidly in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her body didn't betray her that often. She wasn't used of losing her control of it like this, Rio always felt it when it was coming. But around Agatha? She felt herself losing control of her body every time she was with her, to the point that a simple touch would make her tremble. Would turn her into a mess of desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was gone for a few minutes, and Rio was lying there, waiting her, and her body never cooled down.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio sat straight, she poured another glass of wine and chugged it down, then she grabbed the phone that was on the coffe table, Agatha’s, because she couldn't find hers nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a few photos of the mesmerising flowers painted on her skin, capturing their beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she moved the camera lower, her thighs and that goddamn dark patch of wetness on her underwear filled the frame. She hesitated as she looked at it, shivers kept running through her body as she felt flames burning under her. To see her desire visible and exposed. But she took the photo anyway, then she set the phone down. Biting on her lips in arousal and anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha came back and Rio’s mouth watered instinctively. She looked at her hips swaying as she approached her, Agatha’s eyes were dark with lust.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood beside Rio’s lying body. Agatha leaned down slightly and crashed their mouths together, sharing the lingering taste of wine once again. Her hand on the back of Rio’s neck, pushing her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the kiss grew more and more heated, and Agatha kept sucking on Rio’s tongue, she sat in her place between Rio’s legs. She leaned in, on top of Rio and their mouths didn't part.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lowered her hands down to take off Agatha’s sweatpants and she felt it, the hard object between her legs. Rio broke the kiss and pulled her head back slightly, looking up at Agatha as she felt the length of it once again. “
     <em>
      Fuck
     </em>
     ,” she moaned, feeling herself drip down on the couch. “
     <em>
      Oh, god. I need you to fuck me.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in again and took her mouth in another heated kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled back and took her t-shirt off the next second. Then she stood up and took her sweatpants off, making Rio’s mouth water and run dry at the exact same second.
    </p>
    <p>
     The purple silicon standing between her legs made Rio feel more empty than what she was feeling before.
    </p>
    <p>
     She touched it for a good measure, tracing the length of it. It had been a really long time since she let someone fuck her with a strap-on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned her hips in, making Rio wrap her hand around it. She started stroking it, drawing circles on the tip of it with her thumb, while looking up at Agatha who looked dazed and feral.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat between her legs once again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She ran her fingers on Rio’s underwear, feeling how wet she was and how her pussy was radiating heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moving her fingers up and down Rio’s slit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, Agatha, please,
     </em>
     ” she begged as she felt herself unable to take it anymore. Unable to hold it in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her underwear down slowly as the strong smell of Rio’s arousal hit their noses, it was stronger than the lingering smell of paints.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the fabric was out of her legs, Agatha clenched it with her hand tightly, she wasn't saying anything, but god, every movement of hers was screaming louder than any sound could ever scream.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha spread Rio's legs wider and her breath hitched in her throat as Rio started swallowing down hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha started palming Rio’s pussy, taking it all in with the movement. Going up and down, feeling her palm getting drenched immediately. She entered two of her fingers inside and Rio started moaning loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh god, please fill me up, please
     </em>
     .” she pleaded again and Agatha started thrusting her two fingers inside. Then added a third.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cried out, feeling Agatha filling her was the closest she could get to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her drenched fingers out and Rio whined at the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha started stroking the strap, spreading Rio’s juices all over it, making it glistening with her silk.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked up at Rio as she put the tip on her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me when you're ready.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I am. I’m ready, please, please fill me.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed the length in gradually and Rio felt the way her walls kept clenching around it. Her breaths were unsteady and heavy as Agatha kept pushing in while looking at her to check in. The stretch she was feeling was delightful but god, she didn't think she'd be so tight around it.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha pushed all the length in, making it disappear into Rio’s hole, her movements stilled.
    </p>
    <p>
     She extended her hand for Rio to hold, intertwining their fingers together as Agatha’s other hand kept stroking Rio's inner thigh gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me when you'll get used to it, and tell me when to move. Don't rush yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes briefly. “
     <em>
      I didn't think it would be so…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      So tight? Mhmm, I figured that out. But it's okay, don't worry, can you breathe for me?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exhaled as her eyes were glued on Agatha’s nose, looking at how gorgeous it was. Sculptured perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm ready,” Rio voiced and Agatha obliged. She started thrusting inside her deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gradually speeding up, thrusting in, until Rio started digging her short nails into Agatha’s back. Their hips met with every thrust as the sounds of their connection filled the atmosphere around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You're taking me so well baby, so well.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh holy fuck…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept thrusting, praising Rio on how well she was taking her, how perfect she looked, like a fucking goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few more thrusts and Rio came with a loud cry as Agatha guided their intertwined hands and laid them on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s muscles tensed, her knuckles turned white from how hard she was holding Agatha’s hand as her other hand kept clinging onto Agatha’s back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her moans grew louder and louder. Her entire body shivering underneath Agatha’s as if she was striked by lightning. Feeling her body trembling uncontrollably as Agatha’s thrusts continued and the waves of pleasure kept hitting Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then her hold loosened and Agatha’s pace slowed down. But Rio kept trembling, her breaths unsteady and heavy, she was gasping for air.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed Agatha’s body closer to her by her hold on her back, making her moan as the strap moved inside her, sending an unanticipated wave of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio buried her face in Agatha’s shoulder, smelling her and feeling how soft and warm her skin is.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hips moved again and was about to pull out of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Stay
     </em>
     ,” Was the only word Rio could master.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her face away slightly and she nodded. Their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in and kissed Rio tenderly, it was so tender Rio felt her heart would explode.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat straight on her heels, took both of Rio’s legs, and put them on her hips, then she put one of her hands on the small of Rio’s back and the other one below it and she lifted Rio’s body up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was quick to secure her legs around Agatha’s hips and cling to her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't want you to hurt your back,” Agatha said with a smirk then she leaned in and kissed Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     She adjusted her body on the couch immediately while keeping her hold on Rio’s sweating body, not making a move to pull the length out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she sat down, her back hitting the couch, Rio filled up sitting on her lab, legs spread widely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put both of her hands on Rio’s hips, squeezing the flesh tightly, looking down at the bluebells filling the side of Rio’s body, then she leaned in and wrapped her mouth around Rio’s nipple, sucking on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes as her hips jerked involuntarily, making her moan. Then Agatha’s hands started guiding her hips, encouraging her to move, to take it all if she wanted it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the moment Agatha pulled back, Rio lifted her body up then sat down on the length, swallowing it all inside her as she cried out in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on, baby.” Agatha encouraged again and Rio repeated the movement, until she was used to the pace that she set.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You feel so…fucking good inside me. God…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s thumb went lower and started rubbing on Rio’s clit, making her body twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh fuck…Agatha…I'm close
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rubbed faster on the bundle of nerves as she kept biting her bottom lip and looking up at Rio’s flushed state.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You have no idea how fucking beautiful you look right now.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s body twitched again, feeling herself on the edge, waiting to get pushed. She continued taking the length of Agatha, hitting that spot that made her unable to even distinguish what she was looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was a mess of sweat, parted lips, curses and moans, heavy breaths, and the sound of her taking Agatha in entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few more thrusts and she came again, her hands fisting Agatha’s hair as she came with a loud cry.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh god, Agatha. Oh my god, Agatha.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her moans continued and her orgasm kept going until Agatha moved her thumb away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio breathed in and out, her eyes half-lidded, her cheeks pink and her body was glistened with sweat. She leaned in and took Agatha’s lips in a kiss as her hold in her hair loosened.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A few long minutes passed, and they were tangled on the couch, bodies embracing and flush on each other . The atmosphere was filled with the smell of sex, sweat, pleasure and paint.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes were heavy, her body ready to give up to sleep, Agatha leaned in and kissed her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you walk?” Agatha whispered near her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can't we just lie here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you'll regret it when you wake up. Come on, I'll carry you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can walk,“ Rio smiled. “But can you please bring me the coldest water you have in your house?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled back. “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They got up, and apparently, Rio couldn't really walk, unless walking meant pausing after every step she took.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Agatha helped walk her until they were in bed. She put Rio in bed, then she went and brought a wet cloth and started wiping between Rio’s legs as carefully as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she used another one to wipe the sweat away, being careful around the paint on Rio’s body because she whined a spent-out “Noooo!” when Agatha touched it and wiped a little of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Agatha kissed her,covered her body, and kissed her again. Then she went and brought the ice-cold water as requested. And she was a little stunned to see Rio drink it in big gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your teeth don't hurt you?” She wondered, and Rio grinned. “Sometimes, yeah.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they tangled in bed again, whispering into each other's ears, and feeling their bodies pressed together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her heavy eyes, and gave up immediately to sleep, while Agatha kept brushing her skin with gentle fingertips.

    <p>
     A week that felt visionary had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
     A week filled with peacefulness Rio had never felt before. So much warmth she was wrapped with, warmth Rio was still feeling on her body as she sat down on her desk working. A week passed with softness. With
     <em>
      love
     </em>
     . With touches and colored marks that lingered on her skin. Whispered sweet words and promises made out loud in different places, whether lying side by side on the bed or being fucked on the kitchen island. With meals cooked from hands she began to worship, meals that tasted better than any time before because they were shared with the person that made Rio’s heart race in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     A week filled with things Rio saw in herself for the first time. With unsteady breaths and heartbeats the reason of which wasn't a panic attack, but a great amount of feelings. With orgasms that made her arch her back forward and moan Agatha’s name over and over and over again. With texts and photos and small notes on scrapped papers that made her days full.
    </p>
    <p>
     With going to Agatha’s place almost every day just because she missed her presence and scent—even though Agatha was lying next to her, covered with her green duvet the night before. With smiling mid-lectures as she remembered her. With dates that started outdoors with the delicious warm smell of a cinnamon roll surrounding them, and ended indoors, with hot heavy breaths and the smell of pleasure filling the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a week filled with everything Rio hadn’t even dared to dream of, because these things were so out of reach that she forgot they even existed. Then, with a flick of her fingers, Agatha was there, handing them to Rio with a smile, asking her not to dream but to take because she deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a week that somehow, in a way, the days of it felt longer. As if the illusion of time itself was giving Rio the opportunity to linger in the moments. To live and feel them fully.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio found herself wondering, since when waking up started to be a thing she looks forward to? And she would look to her side and see the answer lying there, an answer shaped as a woman, as
     <em>
      an ethereal being.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Since Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just like after a storm the night before, Rio opened the windows to look at the ruins the sky caused, only to be met with the sun shining and illuminating the world. Apologizing and trying to fix something it wasn't the one who broke.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     It has been half a day since Agatha had gone to Paris for some art galleries she had to attend. When Rio insisted on driving her to the airport. When they kissed each other with warmth and a promise. A kiss that both of them used to say ‘
     <em>
      Even for a few days I can't be apart from you.
     </em>
     ’ Pouring their feelings into each other’s mouths. And as they pulled back to look into each other’s eyes, Rio tried her best not to show how saddened she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't look at me like that, you know I can't resist it.” Agatha said, as she gently brushed Rio’s cheek with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good, because I don't want you to resist me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and kissed her again. A shorter kiss in time, but no less intense and warm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait for me, hmmm? Just a few days.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A third kiss. Then their intertwined fingers parted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes met briefly before Agatha turned around to walk away from her. Rio felt her heart pound in her chest, she grabbed Agatha’s wrist gently and made her turn around to face her again, to look into her eyes and get pulled into them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in this time and embraced Agatha tightly, burying her face in her shoulder, inhaling her. Feeling her warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You will come back to me.
     </em>
     ” Rio said. It wasn't a question, it was a hope. It was the alternative to what was on the tip of her tongue. It was the way she used to show a little bit of what was happening inside her. It was a way to try not to think about the last time Agatha had gone. To reassure herself that now? Now it's different.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will. I promise.” Agatha brushed her hair gently, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Rio’s hair. When they pulled back, there was a smile on Agatha’s face, a smile that made Rio’s heart tighten in her chest in the softest way. Agatha lifted her hand up and cupped Rio’s face, brushing the skin softly with her fingertips as their eyes locked. “Trust me, there's no better place I'd like to be other than with you, Rio. So I'll be back as soon as I can.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And they parted. Again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this time, Rio knew the destination. Knew where Agatha was heading. She has a promise of coming back to count on, replacing the maybe tomorrow’s in her pocket with a new currency. Agatha didn't casually disappear into thin air and leave Rio hanging like a nail waiting to get hammered, Agatha, this time, walked away and Rio saw her as she did. Counted her steps until she disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt absurd even to herself, the fact that she missed Agatha even when she was still within her eyesight to reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she missed her even more when she wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt absurd because it felt real. Because Rio felt her heart racing in her chest. Because she stood there, frozen, as people walked past her, as noise surrounded her, as the world continued to spin, while the only urge she had was to run and follow Agatha. Just like how they do in those stupid rom-coms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio loathes waiting. She despises longing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Look at me, just look at me.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I pine for you even when you're within my reach.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I crave your eyes, just so they’d glance at me in the stillness of your sleep.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      So tell me, then
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What am I to do
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      When the distance stretches beyond my reach?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When she got back to her home that day, the discomfort of it was nowhere to be sensed. Because Rio’s haven was filled with Agatha now. Her touches lingered everywhere. Glimpses of her changed the place down from its foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her scent filled the air. That purple clay mug she made herself and gave to Rio set on the coffee table. The sketch of Rio’s smiling face on a scrap of paper was stuck on the fridge with an olive magnet, and beside it was a note that made Rio’s heart tighten in her chest when she woke on a random Wednesday and found it: “

      I love your golden eyes, Rio
     </em>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Opening the fridge to see the groceries Agatha bought on Thursday after scolding her about not eating well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s silver rings sitting on the nightstand. Her t-shirt on Rio’s bed waiting for her to put on. And that painting that Agatha had called
     <em>
      Río Vidal
     </em>
     sitting in the corner waiting to be hung. The painting Agatha brought in the middle of the night, saying Rio had forgot it, as an excuse she used to fuck Rio senseless that night.
    </p>
    <p>
     So yeah, Agatha was everywhere. Feeling her inside. Sensing her in the air. Seeing her in the little details.
    </p>
    <p>
     But still, she wasn't within her reach to hold. To feel the warmth of her body. To taste her fully.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Agatha’s absence, Rio found herself spiraling in her head. Going back in time. Digging the graves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Separating with someone. Separating with her loved ones. She experienced that, too many times to be counted. And it never ended well for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether the separation was on good terms or the opposite of that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether it was lying in a tent and the distance only a few steps, or continents away.
    </p>
    <p>
     It never ended well, and that's why her heart was pounding, and her entire body and mind were plagued with paranoia mixed with panic and traumatic memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     The what if’s flooded her whole being. Even if Agatha would be gone only for a few days. Even after thinking of it with sense, she found herself being childish.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't stop thinking as she lay in bed, wearing Agatha’s t-shirt, sensing and smelling her.
    </p>
    <p>
     What if Agatha won't come back?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if something happens there?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if she finds herself more comfortable there than in Rio’s embrace?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if the peace Rio was feeling in Agatha’s presence was one-sided?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     But it can't be.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the devotion that Rio felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     All that tenderness and understanding that Agatha showed and offered.
    </p>
    <p>
     The promises. The whispers. The affection.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Rio felt about herself because of Agatha. The way Rio started to feel Agatha fully inside her. Growing. Consuming. Living.
    </p>
    <p>
     That didn't just feel real. It was real.
    </p>
    <p>
     It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     real.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I just want you to let me in. Will you let me in?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Yes. But will you?
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You're already in, Rio.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing Agatha had ever said felt hollow or meaningless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything she said hit Rio exactly in the right place. Right in her core. Assuring her in every way possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Nowhere really held my heart the way Paris did. You remind me of every beautiful memory I had there. I don't know why, but I see them in your eyes, shining—and that isn't a metaphor.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha will think of her there. She will.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio reminded her of Paris, then Paris will remind her of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she saw the beautiful memories shining in Rio’s golden eyes, then she'll look at the starry Parisian sky and find Rio there.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that was the thought she slept thinking of the night Agatha was gone. She trusted Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stirred in her sleep as the sound of messages arriving echoed in the stillness of her dark room. She half opened her eyes as she grabbed her phone and looked at it, the bright light of the screen burned her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I just arrived at the hotel. I'll try to get some sleep for a few hours, then I'll meet my friend for dinner.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Don't worry at all and sleep well, angel.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      And call me when you can please.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her phone, its light illuminating her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     She read the messages over and over again while smiling. Feeling something still inside her. Something that was moving way too much in the past few hours. She felt peace washing over her. All the negative thoughts she had been thinking of earlier had vanished and got replaced with certainty and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't reply, she just fell back to sleep. Sinking into the mattress. Her eyes closed peacefully on their own.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzed on her desk, and Rio’s face lit up immediately as a soft smile found its way to her lips the moment she looked down at it. She picked it up and swiped to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, beautiful,” her grin was visible in her greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, gorgeous,” Agatha’s voice was deep, as if she were breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thought you were out. Didn't you go with your friend
     <em>
      Augustine
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish my name was Augustine so I'd hear you say it like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh god, shut up.” Rio chuckled as a blush crept to her face. “What are you doing then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Thinking of you, angel.
     </em>
     ” Agatha’s voice grew lower, deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exhaled through her nose. Her foolish grin was still visible on her face as she got up from her chair and sat on the couch, holding her coffee in the other hand, feeling her heart pound in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard Agatha sigh heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is there something wrong? You sound… Are you sick?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio crossed her legs and took a sip of her drink as she waited for Agatha to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      No.
     </em>
     ” Was the only thing she said after a few long seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha? What's going on?” Her brow frowned in confusion and worry as she leaned to put her coffee on the table in front of her, uncrossing her legs and leaning back on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I miss you,
     </em>
     ” Agatha said breathlessly, as a soft whimper followed her confession.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened immediately. Agatha’s words made a shiver run down her spine, making her chest rise and fall with heavy breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god. What are you doing?” She asked in awe, even though it wasn't really a question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When did you take that photo? Hmmm?” Agatha asked, her tone so low she sounded numb. And Rio already started imagining Agatha’s half-lidded eyes, her parted lips, lying somewhere and touching herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up in a hurry, almost out of her mind, and closed her office door. The sound of shutting it was louder than she intended, making it echo in the hallway. Its sound blending with her rapid heartbeats.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned against the door and squeezed her eyes shut as she clenched the phone closer to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What photo?” She asked, as her own breaths started to get heavier only from picturing Agatha and listening to her heavy breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned, and Rio clenched the phone tighter, making the veins on her hand darker as she felt her knees grow weaker—as if she couldn't even hold her own weight. And the cause was a moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, what photo?” She asked again, almost whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The one after you came through my underwear, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Trust me, it's the only thing in my head right now.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck. I'm at work.” Rio ran a hand through her hair as she walked back to the couch. “I told that kid I will look into…” Another moan. “Fuck it. God… please tell me what exactly you are doing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fucking myself because I can't fuck you
     </em>
     . Touching myself while looking at your photo, Rio, wishing you were here. Missing my dinner with my friend because you're the only thing I'm thinking of. Missing you so much it feels like it has been months since I last saw you. I feel my self-control is thrown into a wall because I can't resist even the thought of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus Christ, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want me to cum, Rio? While looking at your photo? Or should I wait a few days so you can handle me yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck. Fuck. I want you to wait for me, so I can take care of you myself. But god, I don't want to torture you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, honey. I want you to torture me.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then remove your fingers and wait for me to pleasure you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmmm. I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     In the following few seconds, Rio heard the sound of Agatha licking her own fingers. Tasting herself and making Rio dizzy with lust and need, biting her bottom lip harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzed in her hand, and she looked down at it, a photo from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now you have yours,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha said through the open line into Rio’s ear, and Rio’s mouth hung wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was lying on the beige couch in her hotel room, lying in the same position as Rio was in that photo. Wearing the same fucking sky blue underwear with the little bow on the waistband that Rio wore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s patch of wetness was even darker, and there weren’t any bluebells drawn on her captivating pale skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breath hitched, and she was swallowing really hard as she continued observing the photo, looking at every detail and sighing constantly, feeling herself dripping down. Turned on and helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      This is all from thinking of you.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is so unfair. You know I'm at work,” Rio said in helplessness, her eyes never left that photo, looking at how Agatha’s hand cupped one of her breasts and the other was available for Rio’s eyes to devour.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, you know it wasn't intentional.” Agatha laughed. The sound was low and intoxicating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was fighting to stay sober at this time of the day, and here she was, drunk because of a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. Right. It wasn't intentional to wear the same fucking underwear.” Rio zoomed in. Staring. “Can you… Fuck. Send me another one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are we getting greedy, baby?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, please. You started this. Let me see your face.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You
     </em>
     started it. Now do your work so you can call me when you get home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? I don't want to distract you.” Agatha chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can't seriously be saying that
     <em>
      now
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Awww, why is that? Are you distracted?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The office door swung open and Rio immediately pulled her legs closer together, feeling the uncomfortable wetness between her thighs as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice! Goddamn it, knock!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut up.” She closed the door behind her and turned around, facing Rio. “Stop acting like you could possibly be giving head in here. Honey, you're dry as a desert.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if I was really giving head?!” Rio said, and she heard Agatha’s low laugh through the phone. Making her pupils dilate widely. Feeling her control slipping.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then I'd fucking cheer you up, but obviously you aren’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't know if I'm giving head or not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I wish you were giving me head right now,
     </em>
     ” Agatha said into Rio’s ear, making her freeze in her place. “
     <em>
      It would feel so good to have your mouth on me right now
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clenched the phone tighter. She felt like she might break it as Alice walked forward, talking about something—Rio didn't even hear a thing of.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Ah, Rio,
     </em>
     ” Agatha moaned, and Rio felt herself on the verge of breaking down. “
     <em>
      I need you, baby.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, don't do that. Please,” Rio pleaded with a whisper, making sure Alice didn't hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled into her ear. “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anyway,” Alice said as she sat down, “that bitch called me yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What bitch?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your ex. The psycho one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? What the fuck?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know dude. She said something about a miscarriage. And about how she can't reach you and all. Was she pregnant? I don't remember that plot twist happening. Did you impregnate her? Don't gatekeep the secret, Rio. How did that happen?” Alice laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it, Rio? Is everything okay?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, yeah, it's nothing, I will call you later, okay?” Rio said and hung up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not funny, Alice. That bitch got pregnant when that fucker knocked her out, I guess. But why the fuck she told you that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know. Her victim complex is insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did you tell her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She just kept rambling. She gave me a headache. I said okay, then blocked her number,” Alice chuckled and so did Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, how I want to punch her stupid face.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I second this. Anyway, who was that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That woman who got you blushing like that. Who is she?” Alice smirked, teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Alice’s eyes. She felt herself being caught off guard. Was it that obvious?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That woman who got her blushing?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's…” Rio leaned in to get her cup. “A woman I met a while ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Who is she? Does she have a name?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Alice. “Agatha,” She said, busying herself with drinking her coffee, trying not to meet Alice’s gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I knew it! Oh my god, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're not a thing yet. We're just getting to know each other!” Rio said immediately, trying to dismiss it, though her smile betrayed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha Harkness. Damn. I need to know everything. Like, absolutely everything. Why the hell didn't you tell me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've been busy, and there's nothing to talk about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're a terrible liar, you know that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god, just shut up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I won't. We should definitely go on a double date.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Double date my ass, Alice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? I want to know her. Because I know she's a good artist and I'm such a fan of her work, but… I heard she could be a bitch. Hard to deal with and...”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, don't. Don't talk about her like that, ever.” Rio pointed a finger at her. “And heard from whom exactly?” Her voice rose uncontrollably.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, that's what her ex told me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Her ex? The redhead?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I've hang out with her a few times since your birthday. And… we just talked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So the topic was Agatha? What did she tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A lot, honestly. She talks a lot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, wow. What that '
     <em>
      a lot
     </em>
     ' was?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, calm down. She just told me about their relationship and how toxic it was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, Alice. Say it. What did she tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice crossed her legs and leaned back on the couch, looking Rio in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She talked about Agatha’s constant cheating. How irresponsible she was. She didn't say Agatha’s name explicitly, but I did ask whether that ex was Agatha or not and she confirmed it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great. Well, you don't know her, Alice. But I do. Agatha?
     <em>
      My
     </em>
     Agatha? God, she's the best human being I've ever met, and I mean it. That woman? She makes me feel alive, Alice. To the point that she's away from me right now and I feel like I could run through the continents between us just to reach her.
     <em>
      Just to kiss her
     </em>
     .” She lowered her voice when she said the last few words. She inhaled deeply. “You of all people should know damn well how exes say bullshit all the time, Alice. Take Jane as an example, she makes herself the victim while she's nothing but a psycho bitch. So, no. Whatever the fuck Wanda had said, it's not the truth. It's bullshit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Rio Vidal. Are you in love?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I? Do I love her? I don't know. But do I feel that woman living inside me? Yes, I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, I'm sorry I talked about her like that. But I still would like to meet her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You will. But not now.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After talking for a few more minutes, Rio kicked Alice out with a grin, telling her to go see her life or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Alice was out of her door, Rio exhaled a deep breath she didn't know she was holding. She ran a hand through her hair, feeling her heart pound in her chest. Her head was full with thoughts and images. Paranoia crept into her system.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her phone, seeing a message from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What happened, Rio? Talk to me.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at the message for a long time, the letters started to blend together. What once was a coherent question now didn't make any sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     She exhaled deeply, took her blazer off, then sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
     She called Agatha and waited as the phone rang in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi. Sorry I hung up on you like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's okay. What happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mean ‘nothing’? And your ex?” Agatha's voice filled with furiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had never heard Agatha speak with that tone before now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? We hardly talked about her, Agatha. Why are you talking to me like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like what, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like I'm lying to you. I'm not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence stretched between them for a long agonizing seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry. I just… I'm sorry, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There's something I want to talk about with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it? Tell me. Anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, not like that. Not over a phone call. Not while you're away from me like that. So when you come back, we will talk about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. When I come back. When will you go home?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In a few minutes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. And if that bitch tried to reach you, you tell me immediately. Understood?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She won't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said understood, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. Understood.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio drove back home, her mind spiraling. Thinking and thinking. Running in a maze she found herself inside, with no exit to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she could wait. She
     <em>
      must
     </em>
     wait.
    </p>
    <p>
     She won't let her thoughts control her. She will wait for Agatha to come back. She will ask her, and she'll get the answers she's looking for. It's just a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just three days. Three days are nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When she stepped inside, she inhaled deeply as she looked around the space. She took her shoes off by the door, then went upstairs to take a shower, to organize the chaos in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     But instead, she sat on the toilet seat, naked, smoking her second cigarette as she looked into nothing. Thinking about everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she was greedy for asking the universe to give her another week of stillness and now she's getting punished with chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got out after taking that shower, her body and hair dripping water, not even caring about drying off.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put on one of her oversized t-shirts and went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cooked herself the pasta Agatha had taught her how to make a few days ago. When Agatha stood behind her, wrapped her arms around her waist, her head resting on Rio’s shoulder as she told her what to do and what not.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed her phone and took a photo of the meal, then sent it to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She left the plate on the table and got up to bring the bottle of vodka from the freezer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She held a glass in one hand to pour the liquid into, but then she put it back on the counter, opened the bottle, and drank straight from it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood there for a few minutes, leaning against the counter as she sipped, feeling the burn of the alcohol filling her whole. Tasteless and unforgiving, but works like a fucking healer. Taking her head elsewhere, even if it was temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she walked back to her waiting dish. She took a forkful of pasta, followed by a sip or a gulp of alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was 2PM
    </p>
    <p>
     Why does she drink? She doesn't know.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she also doesn't know why she shouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's a grey area. You push it to black or white whenever you want. Or that's what she had convinced herself with.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few bites, the taste became unbearable. The meal felt tasteless because Agatha wasn't there to flavor it with her glances. With her playful remarks. Or her legs touching Rio’s under the table, making her squirm in her place.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put the plate on the sink, grabbed her bottle, and went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She lay in her bed, looking at Agatha’s photo, the one she sent earlier. Zooming in and staring as she carried on drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt herself dripping but she didn't do anything about it. She intended on working herself up, putting herself on the edge of exploding.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she couldn't edge herself any longer, she grabbed her laptop. Took her shirt off and remained in her black sport bra and green boxers. Then she video-called Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     It rang for a few long seconds, Rio was beginning to think about canceling the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she answered. She was wearing a white robe, her hair wet and falling by her sides, a glass of scotch in hand. She was sitting on a wooden lounge in the balcony, surrounded by the darkness of the night and stillness of the Parisian neighborhood she was in. Only the moonlight illuminating her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say a word at first, she just looked at Rio through the screen, from her face down to her abdomen, from how Rio laid her laptop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licked her lips, and Rio noticed the glim in her eyes and the faint smirk on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does the starry sky of Paris remind you of me?” Rio said as she brought the laptop closer to her. Her eyes were half-lidded. Her cheeks slightly pink from the alcohol and her arousal.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Everything reminds me of you, Rio. Not only the sky,” Agatha said, then she sipped her drink. “You look tired. You didn't sleep well?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's not the sleep. The sleep is fine. It's… I was thinking and I'm a little drunk and
     <em>
      sooo
     </em>
     turned on and I miss you so much. You look so beautiful right now. It's making me ache. It's so heavy. All of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What happened, Rio? Are you okay?” Agatha said as she put her drink aside and took her laptop, placing it on her lap. Her face is closer to Rio’s eyes now, but still not within reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat against the headboard, then she took her bra off.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed the half-empty bottle of Vodka from the nightstand and gulped, then she put it back down. Wiped her mouth with the back of her hand as she cupped one of her breasts. Then both of them. Palming them roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take your robe off, let me see you.
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a loud sigh that turned into a soft whimper. She didn't hesitate a second. She took her robe off and threw it somewhere. She was completely bare. The moonlight falling down on her. Making her look holy and so out of reach. The cold breeze playing with her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her glass and swirled the ice in it as she looked at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breath hitched as she felt the unsettling sensations burn her lower abdomen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me what to do,” Rio said as she started feeling herself. “Tell me what I should do to myself. Tell me how to please you.” She continued, her fingers brushing the skin between her breasts. “Tell me how to make you feel me while you're away. Just tell me. Give me instructions. Guide me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, god. Just touch yourself,
     <em>
      for me
     </em>
     ,” Agatha breathed out. And Rio started moving her fingers lower. She straightened up and started rubbing hard on her clit as she continued pinching her nipples.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Go slower. Gently. Don't hurt what's mine,” she commanded, and Rio obeyed, watching Agatha move her hands to her own heat, making her eyes widen in lust.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me hear you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't moan. She entered two of her fingers inside and let Agatha hear the sound of her fingers pumping in and out of her. Making her hear how drenched she is instead of showing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh baby. What got you so worked up? Hmmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You Agatha. It's only you. It's always you.” Rio confessed as she closed her eyes, breathing heavily, her chest rising and falling. “I trust you with my life, Agatha.” she said as she felt her orgasm approaching. Building faster than she anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm gonna—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let go for me. Go on,” Agatha said as her fingers started moving faster on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      God, how I want to kiss you right now
     </em>
     ,” Rio said, breathless. And a second later she came with a loud moan, letting it echo in the room. And Agatha followed her a few seconds later, her orgasmic moan soft and low, blending with the breeze as her chest rose and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes the moment Agatha did. Their eyes locked through the screens.
    </p>
    <p>
     “

      Somebody good shouldn't feel so bad

    <p>
     <em>
      Well, I must've done something to deserve to feel this sad
     </em>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it jealousy or her fear of being cheated on again?
    </p>
    <p>
     The fear of someone finding out that she's unworthy. Undeserving. And below it all. The fear of repeating it all again. The fear of seeing someone leaving. Walking out. Against her will. And she'd be sitting, like always, expected to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't even distinguish that. The lines blurred, and so did her ability to be coherent. To know.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of it is real.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's just in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything she's thinking about right now is nothing but her rotting mind’s way to get her. To push her sanity to the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio? She knows that.
    </p>
    <p>
     But does she?
    </p>
    <p>
     Does she know, as she lays on her front. Naked, drunk, her head thudding, floating with no destination to reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still feeling like she's getting away from everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling herself as nothing but plaguing thoughts glued together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lying on Agatha’s side of the bed. Letting the sheets consume her body whole. Burying her face in the pillow and inhaling Agatha’s lingering scent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Blurry images befogged her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha on that beige hotel room couch. She's lying one second, and the next, sitting straight.  Visualization Agatha being touched by a woman. A woman that wasn't her. A woman that didn't have a face Rio could even recognize. It was a mix of every painting Agatha’s hands had crafted. Every face Rio saw in them. And they were haunting.
    </p>
    <p>
     The faces blended and blurred together. The features moved constantly, just like how the fingers constantly brushed Agatha’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     The images were a melting wax dripping down onto Rio’s head, scorching and merciless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head was ticking like a time bomb. Feeling like her skull might just explode at any moment. And there wasn't any right wire to cut. They were all black and would explode, whether they were cut or not.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to get up and just bang her head into a wall and make it all stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time it would tick-tock, she would bang it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she wasn't even able to move her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't aware of anything around her. She couldn't even feel her body lying there. Hot and sweating constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the dizziness was sharp and agonizing, making her spin in her place as the blurred images continued to fuck her up.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she knows.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's not real.
    </p>
    <p>
     It can't be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was talking with her two hours ago. She was there. Until she wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Until Rio was staring at the screen and Agatha was nowhere to be seen. Only the picture of her. The thought of her floating in Rio’s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiled at her, that beautiful smile of hers. The smile that illuminated what was around, even in the pitch darkness of night.
    </p>
    <p>
     They looked into each other’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their chests were heavy. Rising and falling constantly. Lungs rushing to be filled with air.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I love your golden eyes, Rio.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her heart fall down into her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     And suddenly, all the things she wanted to say minutes ago were pulled down into the void, and her head went blank. Swept completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just sat there against the headboard, with her flushed face and heavy breaths. Staring at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She Looked into her eyes, they were glinting, just like the stars in the sky above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the silence that hung between them, Rio’s head was anything but. Her ears were filled with the sound of her heart racing inside her chest. Knocking. Banging forcefully, as if it were begging to get out. Unable to handle all of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as the minutes passed and the silence stretched, Rio felt herself getting filled with emotions as she kept staring into Agatha’s eyes through the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Emotions she didn't dare think about when she was sober and alone, let alone feel them. Say them out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither of them uttered a single word. Just… staring.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sunlight cut through the slightly pulled curtains, she wasn't even able to adjust it. Illuminating half of her face in the middle of the hush. Making her irises lighter, surrounding her dilated dark pupils. The bright afternoon sunlight reflected the flower shapes sewn into the curtain. Their shadows painted on Rio’s tanned skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     A faint one stamped on the side of her jaw. Another resting lower on her pulse point. Two others scattered, one on her breast and a fading one lying lower.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other end, the moonlight was falling down on Agatha. Making her glow as she sat on that wooden lounge. As if all the earth’s spotlight poured down on her bare body. Her collarbones were as sharp as her lethal jaw. The night breeze helped dry her wet hair, making a few of its dark locks curl into each other, into waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she was staring at Rio, with her glinting eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the sun reflected its light on Rio’s body, the moon reflected the sun’s light on Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha whispered hesitantly. Softly breaking the tranquility of the night, the hush of Rio’s room, and the silence that begun to stretch between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did something happen, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt herself being pulled into the planet again after she was floating in space. After she was holding her breath and floating in the universe Agatha’s eyes held inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     She exhaled, and just stared.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in to grab the bottle of alcohol from beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby, can you put that down and talk to me? Tell me what's wrong?” Agatha said the moment the mouth of the bottle touched Rio’s lips. Her voice was still soft, almost pleading, and yet it commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio didn't listen. She closed her eyes and gulped, twice, then placed the bottle down.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wiped her lips with her thumb as she looked into Agatha’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Did something happen?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she possibly know and talk about it with Agatha when she herself didn't know?
    </p>
    <p>
     When she was struggling to hang on to one single thought in the middle of all this?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing. Nothing wrong. I just wanted to get fucked by you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She mumbled the words as she bent her legs up closer to her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe ruined. Maybe fixed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A single blink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is there something wrong with wanting you so much?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not that I don't trust you, god, of course I do.” A hand ran through her hair. “But what's my position in all of this? Where am I standing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked into Agatha’s eyes. Tears started falling down her face. Transparent and fast. As if they weren’t falling in the first place. But Rio’s eyes got red and burned her immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm weak for you. So weak, Agatha. I swear I don't know what's happening.
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     . Just come back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A knock on Agatha’s room door made Rio blink her tears away, making them fall faster and in doubles.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at the door behind Agatha from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha didn't, she was just looking at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment her lips parted, about to say something, the knock came again. A little louder. Someone said something in French. A woman's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't hear properly, and even if she did, she wouldn't have understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then a third knock.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she heard Agatha’s name, called through a whine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart sank deeper, her brow frowned under the disgusting, heavy weight of it all. The sudden rush inside her body made her feel pathetic. vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who’s knocking at your door at this time?” She wiped the edges of her eyes, her fingertips glistening with her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Won't you go see who it is?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's just my friend,”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And the door swung open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Revealing a drunk brunette. A cigarette between her lips, key card in her hand, and a smile hanging off her flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Another ex.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio saw her from across the room, and it plagued her. Rio was drunk, unable of coherenting words, and yet she recognized her immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had seen that woman once. In Agatha’s studio. A portrait of her, lying against a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha quickly got up, searching for her white robe and putting it on immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry baby. I'll just go and see what she wants, I'll be right back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman walked forward, mumbling in French.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't understand the language on its own, let alone when it was drunk French.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt dizzy. Spinning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling too many emotions at the same time and none of them was pleasant. They were all nauseating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha mouthed something, but the woman only smiled. She tied Agatha’s robe as she looked into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or did she untie it?
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio kept looking at them. Feeling herself slip away from it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     From Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The brunette placed her palms on Agatha’s shoulders and started swaying her body to the sound of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     The annoying car horns beeping. The night wind hitting the speaker. And the sound of the drunken chuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
     They all filled Rio’s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     It hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed the woman back slightly, making her take a step backward. And that's when Rio leaned in and ended the call.
    </p>
    <p>
     Staring at the screen in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She fisted her hand and placed it over her heart. It was pounding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because it hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as she lay there, burying her face, trying to calm the voices, to erase the images that assaulted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to believe it. To believe that what happened in front of her eyes, what she saw, wasn't what she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how?
    </p>
    <p>
     How, when it hurts like that?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s phone kept vibrating on the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     The buzzing blended with her thoughts. As if it wasn't already chaotic enough in her head, she needed a cherry on top to decorate the fucking mess.
    </p>
    <p>
     She only looked at it two hours ago, when Agatha called the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared at the screen until Agatha’s name disappeared. And the screen got filled with the photo Agatha had sent this morning. The photo Rio had been looking at earlier. The photo that made her heart race this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's when she hurried to lock it and put it face down on. Ignoring the buzz of two messages arriving at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And as the two hours passed, the buzzing continued.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached with her hand, to her side, expecting her fingers to touch her phone but she knocked over the bottle of vodka instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     It fell and shattered into pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound made her flinch and gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes flew open as her heart pounded in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     She propped herself up. The room spun and her head throbbed brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
     She struggled to lift her weight, but managed to roll and lay on her back eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
     Staring at the ceiling constantly moving. Spinning.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A buzz.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, she reached her phone. Tried to look at the time but the numbers blurred. She powered it off and set it beside her lying body on the mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
     What's there to be said?
    </p>
    <p>
     Though it pained her...
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought of Agatha struggling to sleep because of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought of Agatha waiting for her to respond. Expecting her to.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She closed her eyes, and gave in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Allowed herself to get pulled. To sink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Allowed herself not to think. Just for a few hours.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     She gasped for air and her eyes flew open. Feeling her heart tighten in her chest. The headache was plaguing her and every time she inhaled she felt the weight of the air inside her lungs. Heavy and suffocating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio placed her palms on the bed, leaned on them for support and lifted her upper body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she sat up she heard her bones cracking, as if all of her pain had multiplied like bacteria.
    </p>
    <p>
     What infected her mentally now infected her whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     She blinked through the dark room expecting to see something, but what was dark remained as it is.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her body was radiating heat, sweating constantly. Feeling how sore her throat is. Dry as a desert. But the worst of it all, was her heart and its pounding.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she started recalling again, tears threatened to fall. And they dared to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hot and wretched. Falling down from her eyes, resting on her jaw or dripping onto the sheets. Leaving flames in their wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt pathetic. She felt like she didn't even deserve pity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling hollow, unable to even swallow her gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fist rested on her chest feeling how hard her heart was beating in her hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     And honest to god, she doesn't even know why she was feeling that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it something specific or all of it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it what she saw or the fact that she was already thinking of pretending it didn't happen?
    </p>
    <p>
     But what she was supposed to pretend didn't happen?
    </p>
    <p>
     The few hours ago?
    </p>
    <p>
     Or Agatha?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Like she could either.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't even bother wiping her tears away. She placed her feet on the floor and stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she took a step forward, a piece of glass pierced her foot. The puzzle of pain now got complete.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt it faintly, her brow furrowed as a reaction and her tears were already falling down, but she didn't really care.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat back down on the bed, pulled the piece of glass out and threw it with the others. It clinked through the darkness as it striked another shard. Making Rio flinch again.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she got up and walked to the bathroom, drops of blood fell on the floor every time she lifted her feet up to take a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of water dripping from the faucet down to the sink got louder and more irritating with every step she took. Joining the ticking sound in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two drops fell down as she opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Drip
     </em>
     .
     <em>
      Drip
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The bright light was a lot for her eyes to handle, so she narrowed them and stepped inside. The place was whirling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her warm feet touched the cold grey and white ceramic tile.
    </p>
    <p>
     A half-smoked cigarette sat on the toilet seat, waiting to be smoked to the butt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another step, and the dripping never stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing in front of the mirror and staring at herself. Her eyelashes were still glistening with remains of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed the sink with both of her hands. Her knuckles started to turn white as she widened her eyes and just stared forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a woeful drama movie protagonist in a piteous and cliché scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have your life and your job, stick to those. You don't deserve her, Rio. She's way too good and that's why you can't have her.” She whispered to her reflection, but the sound echoed, as if it was repeating the words for her to hang on, to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Did Agatha put her robe on without tying it, or did she tie it as she adjusted it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Did that brunette tie it up for her or untied it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Did she cling onto Agatha’s shoulders or hang on her for support?
    </p>
    <p>
     The thoughts gnawed at her again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn't even know what she saw. What happened and what didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she can't trust her own eyes, then what the fuck could she trust?
    </p>
    <p>
     Another drip. And she lost it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, just fucking shut up!”
    </p>
    <p>
     It's the scene when she should be breaking the mirror with her fist now out of desperation. Out of feeling pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio only reached and turned the water on, letting it fall down. The sound of the cascading was more soothing than the dripping. Because it was the whole thing and not just a little piece of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put her hand under the water as it got warmer and warmer every passing second.
    </p>
    <p>
     She filled her palm and started splashing it on her face several times.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood straight and looked at her reflection again. Water dripped down from her face down onto the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned the water off tightly, and stood there for a few seconds until she made sure it was closed and no dripping was there to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took the half-smoked cigarette and turned on her heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     She almost slipped and fell down, but her grip on the sink helped her not to collapse. She looked down, and bright red blood was taking a path from the threshold to where she was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She put the cigarette between her lips and lifted her leg up. Her foot was still bleeding.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she saw it with her eyes, she felt the sharpness of the pain immediately. As if it wasn't there, and her eyes summoned it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her leg on the sink and started washing the blood away, watching it as it mixed with the water and its color got lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put her leg down on the floor, took out some band-aids, and stuck two of them down. Then got going with washing the blood away from the bathroom floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she finished, she lit the cigarette and got out. Smoking it while walking, still bare from head to toes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hallway was dark, no source of light was there but the light from the almost spent-out cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the door of the indoor garden, stood in the threshold, and just stared at the space. The moonlight was taking its turn to illuminate the place through the ceiling-to-floor windows. Rio leaned in as she stubbed the cigarette in the jamb and flipped the switch on. A few white light bulbs came to life, designed on the walls to hang above some selected plants.
    </p>
    <p>
     She dimmed the light and stood there, looking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Inhaling in the clean, fresh air. Looking at how beautiful and healing all of this is. Her sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Until the memory of being kissed and devoured by Agatha’s mouth right here took over her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When they were too drunk as they got back from one of their dates.  When they kissed all the way up as they stumbled up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were too deep in to even open the right door. To realize what room they were in. To even remember why they got upstairs in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     And they didn't care when they knew and realized and remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed Rio inside as she
     <em>
      frenched
     </em>
     her. She shoved her tongue inside Rio’s mouth and didn't even give her a moment to breathe. Agatha stopped Rio’s hands before they rested on her hips and intertwined their hands by their sides as she swallowed Rio’s mouth down.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled back slightly and looked into Rio’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      That's why I didn't finish my dessert, baby.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She said, the alcohol lingering in her breath hit Rio’s already parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her hands from Rio’s hold and rested them on her hips. She lifted her up and sat her down on the dresser filled with several pots of plants. She didn't even wait to lay her down on the couch a few steps away, let alone going to the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You looked so good all night,” she leaned in and planted an open-mouthed kiss to Rio’s swollen lips. “
     <em>
      Holy fucking shit.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their breaths were hot against each other. And Rio felt like her heart would explode right then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha stood between her legs, she felt hands drifting under her red dress, palming her thighs with intention.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You drive me fucking wild, you know? I don't even know how I managed not to fuck you on that table.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands went higher as she pulled down Rio’s ruined underwear deliberately. She kept kissing her until the piece of fabric was out of Rio’s legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her face back slightly as her finger started massaging her clit softly. And Rio arched her back forward as a shiver ran down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You kept looking at me like that all the fucking night. Teasing me on purpose by swaying your hips and bending your perfect ass in front of me like that.
     <em>
      Uh mon cœur
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Two of her fingers slid inside Rio’s drenched heat, and she thrusted them slowly and deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hand went to the side of the dresser as she tried to find the edges of it to hold onto. She closed her eyes, Agatha’s fingers maintained the slow-deep pace, their chests were heaving, and her hands were still searching.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of a clay pot breaking into pieces filled her ears, but the reason why she opened her eyes again was Agatha’s commanding voice landing straight on her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Open your eyes. I want you to keep your eyes open when you cum on my fingers. Look at me, Rio, and
     <em>
      nothing but me
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked several times in an attempt to chase the memory away, but a shiver ran down her spine and she was affected by it all immediately. But she dismissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped outside and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Resting her back on it as she tried calming her heart down.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She got downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The house was still. Not a sound at all except the ticking of the clock hanging on the wall in the living room and the hum of the fridge in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     And almost all the lights were off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio walked forward, opened the fridge, and stared at the cans and bottles of beers lining up, the light inside illuminating her exhausted features as its cold air sent shivers down her spine, making her regret not putting some clothes on.
    </p>
    <p>
     She passed everything in there and only picked the chocolate milk that she told Agatha to buy a few days ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the container and gulped as she closed the fridge with her foot and walked to the living room. She picked up the blanket that was draping on the armrest and wrapped her body with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lay down, staring at the ceiling that she wasn't able to see anything of because of the darkness. Drinking the milk and letting its sweet taste linger. As the ticking of the clock continued.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound held nostalgia.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if the clock itself held Rio’s childhood inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     That same clock that was hanging on the wall of the living room she spent her best memories in. The same sound that ticked in her ears as she went back to the empty house to gather the stuff she considered as extremely important. The same old clock that she didn't know how its battery stayed alive for a long time. The clock she used to go down to the basement in her aunt’s house only to listen to its ticking because it was soothing. And it's one of the few things she took with her to the first apartment she had ever rented with Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back then, her future looked way different than the present now. The potential everyone saw in her faded as the years went by, and the ticking stayed as it is.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stared and kept on doing so, until the sound lulled her to sleep. Pulled her into an orbit of a ticking nostalgia.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
     </em>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “Rio, hey,” she heard her name being called softly, almost a whisper melting into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you wake up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She stirred and rolled to her other side, her hands tucked under her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A hand gently touched her forehead. It was so soft on her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, you're burning. Can you just open your eyes for me? Please. Look at me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled again, clenching the blanket tightly around her body. Rio inhaled deeply, Agatha’s scent hit her senses instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiled briefly as she felt a strange sensation of comfort, until she realized and opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was sitting on her knees by the couch, looking at her. Her hand reached up and tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     The touch was so soft and gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s cold palm resting on her burning skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes again as the overwhelming sensation took over her. Tears threatened to fall, because the sight of Agatha made her heart pound in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she knew this wasn't a dream, because nothing, nothing, could make her heart tighten in her chest like the real sight of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her tired features. Her beautiful blue eyes staring at Rio, holding the world for her to take.
    </p>
    <p>
     The back of her hand brushed Rio’s face softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled, and god, those beautiful smile lines.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Hi.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice landed on Rio’s ears, and how she wished to be one with the couch she was lying on.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt helpless, unable to move. So she just opened her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked as a single tear fell down, and Agatha brushed it immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing here?” She asked, her voice barely above a whisper. But it was a whisper shared between them, sounding louder than what it actually was from how close their faces were.
    </p>
    <p>
     How it ached her to see those beautiful eyes tired like this. Thinking that she might be the reason behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand continued to brush her skin soothingly. The touches were so delicate, tracing her face with care.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought something bad happened to you,” Agatha whispered, as if she was still in disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you here, Agatha?” Her voice was still thick with sleep, blending with the soft hum of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     The headache was killing her. Feeling nerves pounding in her head as thoughts struggled to find a place to settle. Her head was already filled and would soon overflow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You told me to come back, didn't you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes remained locked. And Rio was leaning into the touch. Feeling her body melting under it. Feeling her body getting colder because of Agatha’s touch, or Agatha was getting warmer because of her fever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Either way, she felt as if Agatha’s fingers were always there brushing her skin. Always there to soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn't answer any of my calls or messages, Rio. I was terrified.” Agatha’s eyes left hers, her gaze drifted down to Rio’s parted lips for a second. “Baby, I don't know what you saw. But it's not what you think it is.” She looked back at Rio's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     And another tear fell down, tickling her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inhaled deeply, taking Agatha’s scent in again. And god, how she smelled like home.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I swear to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat up, clenching the blanket tightly from the middle and letting it drape on her shoulders. Agatha stayed there on her knees, looking up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was she doing with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's my friend. I told you about her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Agatha’s hands rested on Rio’s knee. A shiver ran down her spine as she looked down at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though her sense wasn't in her head, and her jealousy was almost taking over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A friend you fuck, apparently.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. No. Don't talk like that. She was drunk and happy because she got engaged. I didn't even know she had the key to the room,” Agatha said. Although her voice rose slightly, it remained soft and her thumb continued brushing Rio’s knee above the fabric. “And I've never slept with her if that's what you're thinking about. I don't fuck every woman around me. Though I know why you might have this idea, but I really don't, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head now inundated with thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     She saw it all wrong didn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
     She got sensitive again. Ruined everything with her vulnerability and weakness, didn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
     She fucked things up because she was drunk, again. Just like the uncountable times before over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why…” Rio swallowed, blinking a tear away. “Did you…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say anything you want. Anything. Please. Just don't keep it inside. Tell me, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears fell down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fast, hot, and exposing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because why the hell Agatha was so tender? Does she not feel how fast Rio’s heart was racing? Can't she hear it? Isn't it loud and disturbing all the morning’s stillness?
    </p>
    <p>
     Isn't she mad because Rio treated her awfully?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rested her other hand on Rio’s other knee, encouraging her to go on, still looking up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted one of her hands and brushed the tears away with the back of her hand, then rested it on one of Agatha’s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the words got out. Although she knew she shouldn't talk about this. Not like this. Not now. But the thoughts were plaguing her since yesterday. Since what Alice had told her. The words that caused all of this internal havoc, dragging Agatha in with her because she was too weak to even deal with it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When… you were with Wanda…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closed her eyes briefly as she squeezed Rio’s knee. Then she opened them and nodded for Rio to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     And god how awful Rio felt at that moment. Looking at Agatha’s eyes made her feel guilty. And she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she treat such tenderness with cruelty?
    </p>
    <p>
     Why would she stab someone else when she was the one who caused herself to bleed?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why is she walking around talking shit about you? Did you really... cheat on her?
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did. Yes.” Agatha’s hold tightened. “With many women, and I admit that, Rio. Because I did it, and it's true. Nothing would ever change that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She squeezed Rio’s knee gently one more time then got up on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     She ran a hand through her hair and chose to sit on the couch facing Rio and not on the same one beside her. Which made Rio look at her with the slightest hint of a pout on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     She clenched the blanket again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat down with a loud sigh. As if her body collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat, spreading her feet and putting her hands together in front of her.  Her hair falling down on her face as she leaned forward slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wearing that white sheer shirt, her cleavage on display. A hint of her pale skin and the black bra she was wearing were obvious through the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The difference between us is that she cheated with the same woman over and over again, and now they're together. She still doesn't know that I know, that's why she can walk around and act like a victim. Till now she acts like I was the only troubled bitch. Like I'm some kind of a monster. I was bad, yes. Hell, I was even the goddamn worst. But I wasn't the only one in that relationship, Rio.” She ran a hand through her hair and straightened her posture.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it sounds awful. I know it makes me look small in your eyes. But it's true, and that's why that relationship didn't work out. It was never going to work out. Wanda was fucking miserable. She had an art block for years, and couldn't do anything at all. So what did she do? She started acting like a housewife, even though I never asked her to. I always wanted her to at least push herself. To find something that would truly help her, but she didn't. Christ, how she insisted on playing that role, until she turned it out on me. Like I was the one who forced her.” Agatha chuckled mockingly, then she exhaled a deep breath. “As much as I hate to admit that to you, Rio—but yes, I did. I slept with many women when I was with her. And I didn't even act secretive about it. I wanted her to find out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     And silence stretched between them for a long minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've been thinking about that while I was gone? Thinking that I would cheat? On you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up from her place. The fabric only hung on her body, she didn't bother adjusting it this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh god…” Agatha sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though Rio didn't know if it was because of her admitting, or because of how she was walking toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not that I don't trust you… it's really not. It's just… me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked her up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I trust you with my life, Agatha,” She said as she approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio deliberately sat down, putting her knees on the floor one by one while looking at Agatha’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was kneeling in front of her, looking up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She whispered. Her hands moving up and down Agatha’s legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry 'cause I acted like that. 'Cause I ignored you and terrified you. Because I forced you to come back here and acted like a child. I'm sorry I didn't even trust you. Because I was stupid and too weak to even control myself and see. I couldn't even see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't talk about yourself like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cupped her face, her thumb brushing her skin softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're too good to me. I don't deserve you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s thumb drifted to Rio’s bottom lip as she leaned in closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course you deserve me, Rio. How can I make you see yourself in my eyes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Brushing it softly. Rio’s lips parted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you to take, didn't I? Because you deserve the whole world, and not just me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're the whole world to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked as she leaned her face even closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She parted Rio’s lips widely with her thumb, and their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. Because I want you to see only me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed a warm hum against Agatha’s thumb as it entered her mouth. She kept moving her hands up and down Agatha’s legs. Feeling her body getting warmer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heat was only increasing as Agatha kept looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you hurt yourself?” She asked, looking Rio in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head as she felt Agatha’s thumb teasing her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then why was there glass and blood in your room, hmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't say a thing, but her hands stilled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to promise me to quit drinking like that. I don't want you to hurt yourself. I can't allow you to do that to yourself, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, her head was foggy. Filled with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her thumb out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The faint sound of a
     <em>
      pop
     </em>
     filled the few inches between thier faces.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and finally kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their mouths crashed. Their tongues collided and intertwined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her hands up and grabbed the collar of Agatha’s shirt, making her lean in closer, as Agatha moved the blanket off Rio’s shoulders and let it fall down behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tilted her head slightly to the side, deepening the kiss as deep as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of their sucking filled the space. Ringing in the ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I missed you. I missed your mouth. I missed you.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whispered between kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put her hand in Rio’s hair and pulled her head back, breaking the kiss, and exposing her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to breathe, but she didn't have the time. Agatha started licking and sucking her pulse point. Her moans got louder and her sighs became warmer and warmer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nipped her earlobe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Get up,
     </em>
     ” she said into her ear, and Rio obliged immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood between Agatha’s spread legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand flew and landed on both of Rio’s ass cheeks, and she grabbed them as she pulled Rio more toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their pupils were dilated with lust, and their chests rising and falling from the lack of air.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to trust me. I need you to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do. I trust you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because you're all I think about, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're all I want to think about, Agatha. So make me forget it all. I want only you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her bottom lip as she looked down at Agatha looking up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes drifted down to take Rio’s body in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every curve. Every freckle. Every mole. Every stretch mark. Every scar. Taking all of it in. Looking at her body and seeing her through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked up at her face again and slowly got up, brushing Rio’s body with the back of her hands as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were standing, facing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Devouring each other with their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rested her hands on Rio’s hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll fuck it all out of your head if you let me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in and kissed her collarbones. Rio moaned softly into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Don't ask my permission to do that.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned their bodies, making them take each other’s places.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mouth crushed into Rio’s again, kissing her deeply as she walked forward. When the back of Rio's legs hit the couch, she pushed her slowly on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled back and took her shirt off, followed by her bra, and remained in her oversized black sweatpants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed as Agatha leaned in again and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kissing every inch of her neck as her hand found Rio’s heat. Rio’s face reddened as a loud uncontrolled moan escaped her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back slightly, pulling Rio’s bottom lip with her teeth, thrusting two of her fingers slowly inside, as her other hand played with Rio’s hard nipple.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good fuck, how I love it when you get this wet for me. Dripping for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I only get this wet for you,” Rio breathed out as she closed her eyes, feeling Agatha’s fingers inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good girl,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh,
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Open your mouth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her half-lidded eyes as she obliged. Opening her mouth and sticking her tongue out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, spitting on her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Swallow
     </em>
     ,” She pinched Rio’s nipple.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obliged with a broken moan. Swallowing Agatha in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look so beautiful like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She increased her pace. Started pumping in and out, making Rio scream her lungs out every time her fingers hit her g-spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh god. Oh god. Oh god.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     She clung into Agatha’s hips. Her hands resting on the waistband of her sweatpants.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck me like you've never fucked anyone before me. Fuck.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     A third joined the other two, and she started rubbing Rio’s clit with her other hand. Rio’s hips started jerking upward desperately, her moans turned into hot, deep groans.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s teeth were biting on her bottom lip so hard, blood was threatening to drip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You're mine.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her orgasm tore through her as she came on Agatha’s fingers. Screaming out her name as pleasure flooded her whole. Arching her back forward and digging her nails into Agatha’s hips with all her might.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Yours.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned her face again and took Rio’s lips between her teeth as she continued fucking her through the aftershocks, triggering another orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I only think of you, Rio Vidal. I want you to keep that in your mind and never forget it, the same way you can't forget how my fingers feel inside you. The same way you crave kissing me. The same way you keep staring at my fucking nose. I want you to know that I only think of you, no matter who the hell is around me
     <em>
      .
     </em>
     ” She said the words in Rio's mouth. Their hot unsteady breaths mingling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s body shuddered as Agatha pulled another orgasm out of it. Hot and intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha kept thrusting,
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Ohh fuck it. Fuck, Agatha I'm gonna cum again, please, baby.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on, do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha said as she stood straight.
    </p>
    <p>
     She then sat on her knees, as she took her fingers out momentarily, and pulled Rio’s body toward the edge of the couch by the hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     She spread her legs widely and looked down at Rio’s glistening pussy. Drenched and swollen and still clenching constantly, though Agatha’s fingers left her heat seconds ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can give me a few more, right, angel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s chest rose and fell heavily. Her face was flushed red, her eyes half-lidded, her pupils blown wide, and she was constantly swallowing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. God, anything for you. Take me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. She put her palms on Rio’s thighs and lifted her body up, bringing Rio in with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Attagirl,” She pressed a soft peck and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha’s warm breath hit her heat, Rio jerked her hips upward. So Agatha took her legs and rested them on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Grab that pillow and put it under your back,” she said, before pulling Rio toward her, making only her upper body lie there, she started kissing and nipping the soft flesh of the inside of her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did as she was told, and she moaned loudly the moment Agatha started licking the length of her slit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Please, Agatha, please.
     </em>
     ” Rio pleaded, not even knowing what she was pleading for, as her tanned skin glistened with sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha started teasing Rio’s entrance with her tongue, pushing only the tip of it inside. Then she moved up to tease her clit. And Rio’s moans only got louder and more desperate, as the hot knots in her stomach kept tying up around themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled Rio more toward her and pushed her face in, as she kept licking her softly. Agonizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Until she wasn't, the length of her tongue started licking and sucking on purpose. Her nose is pumping into Rio constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sounds were blaring and obscene, not fitting with the sereneness of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     But honestly? Fuck the morning from its roots. Let the sounds of their uncontrollable lust replace the chirping of the birds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm so close…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth continued devouring her out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Until Rio came into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licked every drop of her, the mixed taste of saltiness and sweetness filled her mouth as the strong smell of her hung on her nose. Rio’s body was trembling uncontrollably, begging Agatha to stop, or maybe encouraging her to keep going.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha didn't stop until the fourth got pulled out of Rio’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio crashed out on the couch, trying to stabilize her breaths. Feeling herself inhaling through her mouth and nose and still not getting enough air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her legs and placed them down gently. Then she got up and adjusted Rio’s body so she wouldn't hurt herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she placed her legs on the end of the couch, she saw the blood through the band-aids that were stuck one above the other—what Rio thought was an X at the time. What a loser.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and brushed her foot gently with her finger, and Rio pulled her leg at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey! It tickles,” She protested, still struggling to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at her. Then she sat beside her legs. She started kissing a path of Rio’s body, from her toes and going up until her hands rested on both sides of Rio’s head, caging it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her body was a few inches from lying completely on Rio’s, and she looked down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm so exhausted right now I could sleep for eternity, but I also want you to eat me out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her hands up and cupped Agatha’s breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I won't let you sleep for an eternity unless I would be there with you. And…” She rolled a nipple between her fingers as her other hand moved and landed on Agatha’s ass. “I would gladly eat you out because I'm starving. Just take those off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why don't you take them off yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hand moved deliberately, until it rested on the waistband of her sweatpants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, baby, I want you to use those beautiful strong teeth of yours to strip me down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head up and almost caught Agatha’s bottom lip between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha pulled back slightly as she slid her leg between Rio’s, and Rio whimpered from the sudden friction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, she bites.
     </em>
     ” She moved her leg slightly, causing Rio to sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just want to show you how strong my teeth are.” Rio pouted, looking up at Agatha with her half-lidded eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm,” Agatha hummed. “Show that to me upstairs,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I… I didn't clean the room, so let's stay here for now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I cleaned it. Get up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? What time did you get here then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Two hours ago. I tried to wake you up but…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I'm sorry,
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you apologizing for, angel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “All of it. You're exhausted and it's all because of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't. It's not because of you. And what, I don't look beautiful when I'm exhausted?” Agatha smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're always beautiful.
     <em>
      Always
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I see. Come on now before I collapse on you,” Agatha said as she took her hands away and sat down, giving the space for Rio to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They got upstairs, Agatha’s hand was resting on Rio’s ass the entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they stepped inside the room, Agatha voiced,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't keep your boxers on the bed next time. It's distracting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha!” Rio whined.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your nipples are distracting.” Rio pointed her fingers at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked down at her breasts, then back up at Rio, smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I know. I also know you want my breasts shoved down your throat.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood facing Agatha, a blush creeping up her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I do
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned her head down and closed her mouth around Agatha’s breast and Agatha’s hand immediately flew up to her hair and pushed Rio’s head in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm, so good to me, aren’t you?” The words left her mouth the moment Rio bit her nipple.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue as she tightened her hold in Rio’s hair and pulled her head back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you're determined to use your teeth?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You said I bite, and I’m proving it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So what are you, a bad or a good dog?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Always good for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked as she started pushing Rio’s head down, until she sat kneeling in front of her. Looking up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes were half-opened from exhaustion and her lips curled up into a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then behave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put her hands on Agatha’s legs and started moving them up and down above the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hands down. Use your teeth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted up her body slightly and grabbed the waistband of Agatha’s sweatpants with her teeth, starting to pull it down. She struggled a bit because of how wide the elastic was, but she did it gradually.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pulling it down from Agatha’s hips, to her thighs, down to her shins until the fabric pooled around her ankles. And she stepped out of them the next second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look at me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up, waiting for any command Agatha was about to say. Eager to please. To show that she can be good and behave. Because it was nagging inside her head somewhere, the fact that she treated Agatha awfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her chin between her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good job. Now get up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood on her feet, and Agatha kissed the front row of Rio’s teeth before she crushed their mouths in a messy kiss. All teeths and tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
     She held Rio’s hand and walked to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She lay down on the pillows as Rio kissed her way from Agatha’s forehead, down to pressing soft kisses on Agatha’s cunt above the fabric before she started taking her underwear off with her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the fabric was out of her legs and thrown somewhere, Agatha spread her legs widely for Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat between them and inhaled deeply. Taking Agatha in.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stuck out her tongue and licked her softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I teased you before, it doesn't mean you can do it now,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her with a pout. “I wasn't intending to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you're behaving so good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled and leaned her mouth down again.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few licks with the length of her tongue, Rio was sucking on Agatha, making her moan deeply and breath heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, Rio. So good, so fucking good. Don't stop.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     And she didn't stop even after Agatha came—her hips jerked up and her body shuddered. She stopped only after pulling another intense orgasm out of Agatha’s system.
    </p>
    <p>
     She licked the remains of Agatha off the edges of her mouth. Her lips were glistining with her. Filled with her taste.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come here,” Agatha said, offering her hand for Rio to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held it and crawled up. They kissed a lazy and a messy kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she rested her head on Agatha’s chest and Agatha was brushing her hair softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the movements stilled, Rio lifted her head up and saw Agatha sleeping. Her lips slightly parted, her hair falling down on her face. And god, her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stayed like that for a few minutes, lying under the covers beside Agatha’s sleeping body, and just looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she got up, deliberately not to disturb Agatha. She got out of bed, almost tiptoeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put some clothes on and leaned in to kiss Agatha softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her phone and laptop and got out, after pulling the door and leaving a slightly opened gap out of habit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got downstairs and headed to the kitchen. She put her stuff on the counter, and without even realizing it, her eyes started to water the moment she saw the coffee and the box of donuts setting beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt awful. Because god, how could she do something like that? How could she treat her like that? Think of her like that?
    </p>
    <p>
     Blaming it on the alcohol wouldn't make her a better person, it would just make her look as awful to herself. Because nothing would ever justify it. And no amount of I'm sorrys could ease those feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wiped the few tears away.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat on the couch, laptop opened in front of her, her face illuminated by its light. She sipped the coffee even if it was cold.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a promise floating inside her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      She will do better.
     </em>

      Also, if you're getting strange vibes from this it's because I don't like this chapter, because it's rushed asf. I wrote it while I was spiraling instead of Rio and I blame capitalism for that.

      Anywayyyy, I may or may not be losing interest in this, so... help

     Chapter Eighteen
    </h2>
   </div>
   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     When a mother loses her child, the pain she'd feel would be double, worse than the pain she felt during labor. During giving birth, while witnessing her entrails being cut. She'd feel the pain mentally. Her head would bleed constantly. And the child would be swallowed by the head rather than pushed from the womb.
    </p>
    <p>
     The little body ceased to exist, but the memories still exist. Haunting, horrifying, as sharp as a butcher’s knife, constantly cutting flesh. Constantly munching with bloody teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what does it feel like when a child loses the mother?
    </p>
    <p>
     When a child loses the connection to the world?
    </p>
    <p>
     When the soil is nowhere to be spotted and the plant is lying, petals torn, and the roots don't have a place to plant themselves in? Don't have the ability to grow?
    </p>
    <p>
     Not feeling alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     A child would feel like they had never lived, and yet, their body is still carrying the memories of a life that once had been lived. Memories that don't feel real at all, but they're there. Gnawing, feeding on the misery.
    </p>
    <p>
     When a child loses their mother, they would feel like their coronary arteries are cut off, no blood reaching their heart. The heart won't be pounding. The body won't be functioning. But the brain would still be there, no blood reaching it, but still functioning on the misery of the memories. Squeezes the sorrow and quenches its thirst with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, would it matter to find the lost piece of the puzzle when there is no longer a board to place it on?
    </p>
    <p>
     Would it matter to reach the water when you feel like a fish, thrown on the island, thrashing?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “The court finds the defendant not guilty.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words landed on Rio’s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Court is adjourned.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And the one single bang of the judge’s gavel banged in her head. Rang in her ears. Then silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The entire place looked like a TV that just got turned on, and the only thing Rio was able to hear was the static noise. And everyone around her looked like the tiny black dots, surrounding her and floating in front of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lawyer beside her embraced her little body with warm hands. Her aunt by her side leaned down to her level. Saying something Rio heard nothing of.
    </p>
    <p>
     People cheered behind her, some of them were even crying—relatives and her parents' friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she wasn't able to hear all that. It was only the buzzing filling her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     They got out of the courtroom, people with poster signs showing their love and support to her and to her case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Calling her the little hero.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their little hero.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cameras flashed on her face once they stepped out of the court building. Microphones almost shoved down her throat. Reporters asking questions she wasn't understanding or hearing. Only looking at their mouths moving. Assuming they were shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood there beside her lawyer, and the small black dots remained there, and the buzzing blended with the noise of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lawyer dismissed them all with a few words, updating them with the bare minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, do you have a message to your parents?”
    </p>
    <p>
     And she felt herself being pulled. Her eyes were opened widely, voices and sounds sharpened as they blended. Her heart was pounding in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lawyer held Rio’s hand and they walked their way with hurried steps to the black car that was waiting for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt hollow when the car door got closed. No sound was inside the car but the noise was living in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her aunt sighed as she checked if Rio was alright.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio wasn't alright.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she be?
    </p>
    <p>
     Because what does this all mean?
    </p>
    <p>
     The peoples’ words meant nothing. Their reassurance meant nothing. All of it meant nothing. Rio wasn't supposed to be here in the first place. She wasn't supposed to witness all that. To live it. To go to a juvenile court. To testify it. To say it out loud. To admit it. To talk about something that didn't feel real. But it was real. Because no matter how hard she tried to pretend it was all an illusion, pictures would show up and fill her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a punishment of survival. As a reminder of escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
     The blood. The murder. The guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't supposed to lift this heavy weight on her shoulders. She wasn't ready to handle all of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this time a few months ago, she would be back from school, walking into the house that was full of warmth and love. The delicious smell of baking. Of watered plants.
    </p>
    <p>
     She would go to the backyard and see her mother, sitting there in the middle, surrounded by the plants they planted together. See her painting a mesmerising view. Kiss her cheek softly. Embrace her and feel the peace and safety that could fit the whole world. She would be eating one of her favorite meals. Sit and talk with her parents about nothing and everything all at once. Talking about her day enthusiastically. Listen to her father talk about the new boat he was building. Feel her cheeks pushed up with a smile the whole time until they start to hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was supposed to feel alive at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio wasn't. For long miserable months, she didn't feel like it. And it only kept getting worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't listening to the lawyer by her side speaking. Or her aunt talking about the family court, the custody and all. Something about child service meetings and arrangements this week. About how they would get along together.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio couldn't comprehend anything. She just stared outside the window, looking at the life outside. Thinking about the one that got robbed from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay honey? You have an appointment with Doctor Sandra tomorrow. Your aunt will drop you off and I will be there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snapped her head to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought we weren’t going there anymore.” Her voice was so small. So innocent. Filled with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, that was two weeks ago, dear,” the lawyer took Rio’s small hand. She wanted to yank her hand free, but she was more focused on what the lawyer was going to say next. “But now, the court required more sessions with Doctor Sandra. Just a few more.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why do I have to go see her? Why can't I do the sessions with Aunt Teresa? She's a therapist.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because, love, I can't be involved if I'm going to be your guardian. I told you that.” Her aunt said, turning her face to look at Rio with a soft smile and a sympathetic look on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio stared at her, the same way she did every time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked so much like her mother. She sounded like her mother. But she wasn't her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she stared for a longer time after her aunt turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the sound always rang in her ears and blended with her mother’s voice in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the features always mixed in front of her eyes even if they weren’t there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her aunt and mother looked so much alike, almost like identical twin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Except the eye color.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her aunt’s were dark brown, but her mother’s were the greenest green she had ever seen. The only pair of eyes that embraced her with its softness.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pair of eyes she can't stare at anymore to find the softness of the whole world living in its irises.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know. But why her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said after a few heartbeats.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't like her? Did something happen last time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The lawyer asked and Rio looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's… it's not that. She—she asks a lot and I don't like the stuff she gives me.” Rio turned her face back to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
     And god how it hurts.
    </p>
    <p>
     How it shutters a child.
    </p>
    <p>
     To look to the side and see someone their age with their parents beside them. Unharmed and alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     How it hurts to be jealous of someone else's happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     How it hurts to lose something you thought you'd keep forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     How it hurts to know that you don't deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
     It hurts like hell to be thirteen and yearning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yearning for something in a way you don't quite understand yet, but you know without that thing you feel hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence filled the atmosphere between the three of them. Stretching loudly. Because even in silence, everyone's eyes were staring loudly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as Rio looked at the street, how she wished they would get into an accident and she'd be the only dead body after, rather than the only survivor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because there's no glory in surviving.
    </p>
    <p>
     If survival meant this, she didn't want it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice will come later to spend the night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her aunt turned around briefly to look at her, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You like Alice, don't you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah…she's cool. I like her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And silence stretched again, as her aunt stopped the car to buy her an ice cream. And she bought the vanilla flavored one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hated vanilla ice cream.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried eating it, but she couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she was picky. And that made her feel sad, not for herself, but for her aunt because she'd have to deal with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She feels guilty. Rio always did and always will do.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the cone was melting on her hand when they arrived at her aunt’s house.
    </p>
    <p>
     They got inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     There wasn't any delicious smell of freshly cooked pies. The smell of her favorite meals.
    </p>
    <p>
     The place was empty of her parents. This looked nothing like the haven she once lived in, and she was supposed to get used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This house was empty of home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her parents weren’t there so her home wasn't there.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't able to feel home for months now.
    </p>
    <p>
     As her aunt walked around the house talking about something, Rio threw the ice cream cone and washed her hands in the kitchen sink.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she turned around, the lawyer was looking at her, smiling a soft smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face stayed as it was as she approached her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But once she lifted her eyes, they landed on the painting hung in the hallway. The one her mother gifted to her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was there during the process of it, she even helped her mother with it. It was one of her favorites.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now it has haunted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other kids were afraid of the monsters under the beds. But thirteen-years-old Rio was afraid of the memories hanging on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you need anything, Rio? Tell me,” the lawyer asked as she bent down to Rio’s level, putting a strand of hair behind her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried holding Rio’s hand, but Rio yanked her tiny hand immediately and clenched the necklace on her neck instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need my mother,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, but it echoed in the empty hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
     It echoed and echoed and echoed in her ears on repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt like it won't stop echoing. Won't stop reminding her. Ringing in her ear. The invisible sound vibrations made her ears bleed invisible blood, and yet she felt it dripping from them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unforgiving and punishing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Until it faded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh honey…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why was I the one the universe picked? Why did it have to happen to me?” Her tears fell down her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fast and scalding.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did nothing wrong, Miss Viv, why am I being punished?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hold tightened on the piece of her mother she was able to save, as the tears continued to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lawyer stood up and hugged Rio’s little body, and Rio immediately clung to her, wrapping her arms around the woman, burying her face in her abdomen, and crying without a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not because of you, honey. You did nothing wrong.” the lawyer brushed her hair softly, running her fingers in the long dark locks, trying to soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m scared, Miss Viv. What if… what if I can't live without them? My heart is hurting me, Miss Viv. I know I shouldn’t have gotten upset because of the stupid marshmallows,” she gasped. Involuntary, her sobs grew louder and louder as she struggled to breathe. “I always think about them. Always.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should’ve… I should’ve died with them. I should’ve let him kill me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, honey, you survived. You're the little hero.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not a hero! I’m selfish!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. You're not. You're not selfish, you did what you were supposed to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio buried her face more and squeezed her eyes shut, fisting the lawyer's shirt tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I am. I’m selfish. I’m alive and they're not. They're not, Miss Viv. They're not with me.” She felt her little heart pounding in her chest. So loud, ringing in her ears. And it was too much to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My heart… my heart… it hurts… so much....” She said between gasps. “Por favor, Miss Viv, por favor que se acabe. Por favor.” Little Rio lost it all. As her heart clenched in her chest. “I miss them.” A whisper followed by a gasp. “You ask me what I need. You say the law would do me justice, but… why justice taste so bitter Miss Viv? Why it can't bring them back to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The lawyer tightened her hold and said something, but Rio felt her senses go mute. Unable to catch the outside. She wasn't aware of anything around her. She just felt her eyes burning, her nose sniffing, her heart pounding, her vision dark from how she was burying her face, and her head was a chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
     Filled with pictures and thoughts and memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My heart. It will explode.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She gasped, unable to breathe. She felt herself being suffocated. Crushed down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please make it stop.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And she wept.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio loosened her hold after what she assumed were long minutes, feeling her legs unable to hold her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled back and wiped her eyes and nose with her sleeve, then looked up at the lawyer. She looked at her eyes long enough to start assuming that the lawyer was upset with her for doing such a thing. For weeping like a little baby.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Rio felt herself being a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm…” she swallowed her sob. “I'm sorry, Miss Viv.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio walked away to her room, despite the lawyer calling her name from behind and her aunt from the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio made her way up the stairs as tears continued to fall down.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want to be their little hero; she wanted to be her parents’ little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want justice; she wanted her mother’s embrace to soothe her, to calm her heart and lull her to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirteen-year-old Rio wanted to feel alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to breathe and not feel suffocated.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for almost three decades, Rio yearned to be home.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Soft kisses landed on her hair. Her forehead, her eyelids, the tip of her nose, her cheeks. Rio smiled as the kisses continued, her upper lip, her bottom one. She opened her eyes, and Agatha started to kiss her chin, her jaw, her throat, her neck, her cleavage. Then she lifted her head up, their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brown met blue and stirred with it. Danced the morning dance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their smiles reflected the effects on each other’s faces.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inhaled deeply as she tried opening her eyes fully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I missed you,” Agatha said, brushing a strand of hair away from Rio's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, I might’ve…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her finger to Rio's lips to silence her nonsense and apologies.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shush.” Their eyes stayed locked. Though Rio was able to speak, she didn't want to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because what's there to say?
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking at Agatha was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she just smiled and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Really looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt like home, and she brought that feeling with her everywhere. Sheltering Rio with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because home isn't a place or a land.
    </p>
    <p>
     Home is a person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt at home when she looked at the universe inside Agatha’s eyes. Home was in her addictive scent and her intoxicating accent. In the way she snorts and lights up when she laughs. It's in her features, one by one. In her skin and scattered freckles. In her birthmark and birthing mark.
    </p>
    <p>
     Home is in the way Agatha’s heart beats in Rio’s hold. It's in the way she acts and talks. Home is in the way she looks at Rio while holding the entire world in her hand to give. It's in the way she takes Rio in and embraces her. It's in the way she promises.
    </p>
    <p>
     Home is in the way Agatha says her name with a rhythm every time. In the way she draws every detail of her with precision. In the way she kisses and worships her. Home is in Agatha’s touches. It's in the way she makes Rio melt under her effortlessly. It's in the way she sees Rio and understands her. Home is in Agatha’s hip bones when she sways them, although that’s Rio’s altar, her place of worship. Of kneeling and praying.
    </p>
    <p>
     And after almost three decades of yearning for a home. Of trying to search for a little corner in the wrong places and faces. After she failed and got tired of searching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha came, and was there, standing in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio realized that home is Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Home is the woman she looked at while drunk, and with just a look, she sobered her up and made her fall to her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her finger up and leaned in to press a soft kiss to Rio’s lips. Her hair falling to the sides, tickling Rio’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm gonna fix us a breakfast.” Agatha leaned in again, and her knee hit Rio’s heat from above the duvet in the process. Rio thought it was a little sinful accident, but when Agatha started moving her leg slowly, Rio moaned helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was on purpose.
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     sweet torture.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I need you to put some clothes on, baby, before I go completely insane and forget that I have work to do.” Another kiss. “Preferably speaking, pick something from my closet. Wear my black tank top and the black shorts with the heart on the back. You know, the ones that make your ass look devourable, yeah? But it's totally up to you.” She smirked and moved her leg again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned involuntarily, then she huffed with a smile. “Is it edging day already?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Edging day?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, when you keep edging me all day until I lose my—
     <em>
      oh fuck, baby
     </em>
     ,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clung to Agatha’s shoulder as the woman above her started moving with intention.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not edging you, baby. I would’ve fucked the ability of speaking out of you if I didn't know that I ruined you a few hours ago, and you could barely walk now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh, mi corazón…” Rio was about to say something, but she fell silent, feeling the pain of her swollen clit mixing with the pleasure sitting on the tips of her body, waiting to be pushed, to flood her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mon cœur.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and pressed another kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is there…
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     … is there something else other than the dress code ma'am? A favorite position maybe? Do you want me to crawl down the stairs?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said mockingly, but her tone didn't help her achieve that goal. She sounded desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
     She closed her eyes shut and clung onto Agatha for dear life. Digging her nails in her shoulders, feeling them reach Agatha’s flesh even above the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, you'd look so good while doing that. Crawling back to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to her temple.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll keep that in my mind for another day.” and she made no move to stop torturing Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But now...” a kiss landed on the tip of her nose. “I want you to do me a favor,” Her leg didn't stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     ,” a helpless moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to behave for just a few hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Baby
     </em>
     ...”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their breaths grew heavier.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you do that for me, angel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes. Half-lidded and dark. Locking with Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, holding Agatha’s shoulders tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will behave,” she bit her bottom lip to suppress her moans. “I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to come?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, oh god. Yes. I do.” she breathed out. “
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     ,”
    </p>
    <p>
     And that did the trick. The sweet plea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved her leg slowly but on purpose, hitting Rio’s swollen clit with every go.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you look at me while you come? Can you do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their dark eyes locked again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Any—anything for you,”
    </p>
    <p>
     They just looked into each other’s eyes, without a word. Rio’s heavy, hot breaths filled the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm falling for you, Rio.” Agatha said, her voice was soft and honest.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio only blinked, several times, batting her eyelashes, breathing heavily, feeling herself getting closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And for the first time in my life, I don't feel myself being pulled down. I'm falling on my own.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed her thigh and Rio came with a soft whimper. Her orgasm reached her. And she felt pleasure running in her entire body, wave after wave. But that wasn't why her heart was pounding rapidly in her chest. And it wasn't why she couldn't even moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just came, her body shaking under Agatha. She was looking into Agatha’s eyes who was looking down at her. Searching for uncertainty there.
    </p>
    <p>
     But her blue eyes were only filled with sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're all I need.” Was the only thing she managed to say as she came down from her high.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and licked her lips. Leaning in after stopping her leg’s movement, their mouths connected in a kiss. It was tender and honest. Their tongues intertwined slowly, patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss felt like something she yearned for.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt like home. Her home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back after kissing Rio’s neck, then she got up. Putting her clothes on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't fall asleep.” She said with a wink and left, swaying her hips seductively. Making Rio grin like an idiot, drool over her, and forget to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stayed in Agatha’s bed for a few more minutes, though she wanted to sleep more, but having breakfast with Agatha was way more tempting. To look into her eyes and fall into them.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she got up, did her morning routine and wore what Agatha wanted her to wear.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she walked down the stairs, in the place that she felt herself more comfortable in than her own house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha greeted her with a smile, and Rio already felt her hands twitching, trying not to touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked so good. Seductive and pulling. She looked
     <em>
      ethereal
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Even at this time of the morning, Agatha effortlessly looked like a goddess, and Rio simply wanted to kneel and worship her all day.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she just stood, leaning on the counter, while Agatha moved around, preparing breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you standing there like you're grounded?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio narrowed her eyes. “I'm grounded, in a way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you're not,” Agatha chuckled as she put the food on the plates. Pour honey on top of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked to the side where Rio was standing and licked her fingers, one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Forgive me,” she smiled. “But I need your hands on my hips so I can focus,” She looked into Rio’s eyes, then her eyes drifted to her mouth as she started speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is this a trap? I can't risk being impulsive right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You should figure that yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is not fair.” Rio pointed her finger with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her then down at the finger. Twice.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she put the plates down, stepped forward, and bit the top of Rio’s finger. Then she sucked on it, slowly, rolling her warm tongue deliberately around it. Looking straight into Rio’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breath hitched, her stomach burning with the heat of her arousal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her brain wasn't functioning in the right way. Her heart pounding in her chest. She put her hand in the back of Agatha’s head and spread her fingers in her hair. Lifted Agatha’s head deliberately. Put her other hand around her waist and switched their positions. Making Agatha’s back hit the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can behave, Agatha. But can you?” Rio asked, putting her hands on Agatha’s hips and pinning her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and leaned in to graze Rio’s ear, but Rio didn't give her the chance to and she pulled her head back slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No chance, baby. If you want me to behave, you should too. So I'm setting a new rule for today. Don't touch me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It sounds hot and
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     tempting. But that's not how things work around here.” She smirked, lifting her thigh up and pushed it between Rio’s legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried her best to not look affected. But who was she kidding?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tensed her thigh muscle and Rio’s body twitched. Agatha leaned in and bit her ear instead of grazing it gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let out a warm breath on Rio’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now,
     <em>
      big boy
     </em>
     , you need to eat your breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes were blown wide. Dark and lustful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the way she was squeezing Agatha's hips, Agatha moved them hand by hand and freed herself from the hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in again and kissed Rio’s neck teasingly. Landed a light slap on her ass and walked away, setting breakfast on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio just turned around and looked at her as she swayed her hips. Fighting her demons not to touch Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     And they sat around the table, eating breakfast, drinking their coffee and sharing glances.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't the shy kind, she was certain of it. But every time they sat around a table and shared a meal, her face and entire body set on fire. She'd turn red and blush by just a glance. Though that would happen in other contexts but mostly it was during eating. She felt the glances land on her heart rather than her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because, to be looked at and be seen. It's thrilling. It's hell.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “Yes, I know how to build a boat from scratch,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? And how did you learn that, sailor?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well.” Rio chewed, gesturing with her hand like that would speed it up. “My father used to build boats. High quality ones. It's how he used to spend his time when he was home.” A sip of coffee. “And I used to watch him do it. Help him. When he—they died, I tried to keep up the work. He had some unfinished ones. Well, at first I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but by twenty I rocked that shit. They're still at my aunt’s house.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at her as she took a bite of her food, “Do you visit your aunt often?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, sipping her coffee. “Nope. Not really. I like the woman and all, she was nice to me and I lived with her for quite a long time. But we don't get along. Never did. She always tried to be the therapist more than anything else. She used to introduce me to her friends to ‘take a look at me’ like some rat lap or something. So moving away from her felt like breathing again.” Their eyes locked. Then Rio looked down at her plate. “She ruined the healing experience for me.” A choked chuckle. “For years I was determined to be worse. You know, until I could achieve the worst version of me… fucked-up, right? I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Rio. Look…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, so when I did therapy again, years later, after I really turned into the worst version of me—I realized that shit wasn't going to do me any good. So I quit it like it was some part-time job.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There I go, ruining the meal.” Rio chuckled, sipping her now cold coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn't ruin anything.” Agatha reached for her hand across the table. “You don't ruin, Rio. Stop saying that you do.” Agatha’s thumb gently brushed her skin. “There's nothing wrong with you. Everything that happened to you—every single thing—didn't happen because you were some sort of bad person that didn't deserve a thing and had to be ‘punished’ for the ruins they caused. No, baby. You're good. You're so good. Way better than you think.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their fingers intertwined.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know, when someone goes through a lot, and by a lot, I mean a lot. They start to think that they're doing something wrong. That they're some glitch in the system. But no. Maybe the world is cruel and everyone around was fucked up? And that one person had to deal with all of it. And because of how fucking good they are, they blame themselves and no one else. You're not bad, baby. There's nothing wrong with you. Even if you ruin, you fix more than what you ruin. You even fix things you didn't break. You're a goddamn healer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears fell down her face. Fast. She didn't even feel them until they started tickling her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you so… delicate with me?” Rio said. Her voice wasn't as affected as her eyes. As her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got up from her chair. Walked around the table and reached Rio. She cupped her face with both of her hands, brushing the tears away with her thumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why not, angel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't make me cry. I could be such a crybaby, especially in the mornings.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you now?” Agatha smirked, leaning in to kiss Rio’s wet cheek. “I don't want you to cry, I want you to know that. I mean it, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in for another kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     They continued their breakfast. One conversation leading to another, and another. Then another.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “My father was a priest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha said, after the conversation, in a way, led to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He wasn't my real father, though. But the only one I knew. And he was a piece of shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her now empty plate and mug of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And well... he fucked my childhood. Then he ran away. And I couldn't blame him. No one could handle my mother.” Agatha got up, holding her plates. “But it made me relate to Ingmar Bergman movies.” She joked. “I'm gonna go do some work now, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only looked at her and nodded. She wanted to push, to talk about the way Agatha’s face changed the moment she started talking about her parents. But she didn't. Agatha would speak when she's comfortable with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     They kissed. Agatha went up to her studio. Rio washed the dishes and sat down doing some work afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Agatha was back, Rio was lying on the couch, covering her eyes with her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha approached her, stood there, looking at her with a smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't asleep. She was just lying there, and she felt Agatha’s stares, the way she was looking at her, the way she smiled and took a few steps forward. Rio felt it all. For some reason, she did. And her heart was pounding in her chest. Though she wasn't looking, she knew it, and felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, trying to wake her. She called her name gently. The way she drags the two syllables in her mouth and rolls them with her tongue never fails to amuse Rio. Because her name sounds right only out of this woman’s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio removed her arm and looked at Agatha with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thought you were sleeping.” Agatha started brushing Rio’s hair, looking down at her with so much longing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I tried to, but couldn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, I took longer than I thought.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's okay, I also did some work I should've done weeks ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How is it going? At work.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat down, stretching her arms overhead, showing off her navel—where Agatha’s eyes traveled before landing back on her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's good. Going well. Some kids are driving me insane, but in general they're good kids.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood up, facing Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha looked at her, her expression was unreadable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Um,” Agatha hesitated as she walked, heading to the kitchen, and Rio followed behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wanted to talk with you about something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know, Lilia’s birthday dinner party tonight…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anyway, she's coming here so we could discuss the project we're working on. I think her new girlfriend is preparing the party for her and she kicked her out of the house.” Agatha said, pouring herself the third mug of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're only going to be in the studio for two hours max. So, if you're not ready to… be seen with me, it's totally okay. If you like, don't want her to know you're here or anything. I understand. You can do what's best for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her bottom lip, leaning on the counter, pretending to think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm fine with it. Totally. I want to be seen with you, Agatha. I already told Alice, and we're going to the party together, so it's okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You told Alice?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Kinda, in a way,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and Rio reflected it on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. And that woman is dying to meet you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s smile widened. She set her mug on the counter and pinned Rio’s hips, leaning in, hips flushed against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know what I'm thinking?” Agatha said, leaning in to kiss Rio’s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, holding back a whimper. “No, ” She swallowed. “I don't know,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at her, pushed her hips forward, and made Rio’s spine hit from the back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to see you on all fours up here, but Lilia would be here in a few minutes,” She said with her low, lustful, deep voice. “So, what do you suggest we do?” Agatha leaned in, nipping Rio’s earlobe, making her moan helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We could…” She swallowed, feeling Agatha’s cold hand getting to her heat through the hem of the shorts she was wearing. “
     <em>
      We could
     </em>
     …” She struggled as Agatha’s fingers reached her heat, teasing her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dripping? Already?” She teased.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, baby, you'll get there.” Agatha smirked, pushing two of her fingers slowly into Rio’s—still recovering—sore pussy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know… just fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue. “Wrong answer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And the doorbell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus, that woman travels fast.” Agatha withdrew her fingers, before Rio could whine, she pushed them inside her mouth. Making her suck on them. Rio moaned around her taste, and like many times before, Agatha took her fingers out mid-sucking and sucked the rest herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slapped Rio’s ass. “You ruined those. Go change them and get down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked several times, then grinned like an idiot, heading upstairs to change her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She made her way down the stairs, hearing Agatha and Lilia talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some reason, Rio was nervous as she walked. She was even sweating. But she managed to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Lilia!” Rio greeted with a grin, walking forward. She hadn't seen the woman since her birthday surprise-not-surprise party.
    </p>
    <p>
     She noticed the way Lilia looked at her, then at Agatha, then back at her with wide eyes and raised brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course Agatha didn't tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio? What are you doing here?” She stood up and looked at Agatha who didn't take her eyes off Rio once she stepped into the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're…” Rio cleared her throat, looking at Agatha for encouragement. Agatha slightly nodded, and Rio smiled looking back at Lilia. “We're seeing each other. Me and Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When did that happen?” The stunned woman was still ping-ponging glances.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood and placed her hand on Lilia’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you panicking right now? Oh my god, Don't make it look weird!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio threw her hands around her and embraced her with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia immediately embraced her back. Wrapping her hands around Rio’s body and taking her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Kid, why didn't you tell me?” She said with that mothery voice that makes Rio shatter every time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ever since Rio met Lilia years ago, she felt that sweet sense of peace around her. The woman tried her best to take care of Rio. To always check on her, even if Rio was acting like a dick and refused to meet or talk to anyone. Lilia was always an exception. She always knocked again even if Rio closed the door in her face. Even when Rio was depressed, Lilia was the wise voice that keeps whispering in her ear. She's a weak spot that makes Rio sob and shatter with just a change of voice tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     And though most of the time Rio doesn't listen, Lilia's words always stick in her head. And she repeats them when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though they both get busy, drifted by their lives, it always feels the same to be around the woman. She always comforts Rio without even knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She saved Rio’s life once. And she doesn't know it. With a bottle of champagne, some cheesy jokes, and domino stones.
    </p>
    <p>
     She saved her from herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that woman also introduced her to Agatha. She's forever grateful for her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled back from the warm embrace, a single tear hanging on the edge of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was going to, but…” She scratched the back of her neck. Because honestly? There's no but. She just didn't know what to do or say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia turned to the side and looked at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you!” She pointed a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both women chuckled, except Lilia who was clearly pissed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I asked you a week ago why you have a portrait of Rio, and you dismissed me. I saw the way you blushed, by the way. I'm just a nice lady, that's why I didn't ask more!”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha blushed again. Just like a week ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are a nice lady, Lilia. What a decent woman,” Agatha said with a smile, sitting down on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm her muse,” Rio whispered to Lilia as she walked to sit beside Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course you're her muse.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Woman! I whispered the words to you, why the hell are you yelling them!” Rio said and her face immediately turned red, unable to look at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha grabbed her waist tighter, pulling her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, because this woman,” she looked at Agatha, “Is obsessed with you, and I only realized that now.” She sat down next to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, nice lady. Drop it.” Agatha said, feeling herself exposed. Like she wasn't exposed in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     They chatted for a while, then Agatha and Lilia went to the studio to discuss their work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat and tried to keep herself busy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though Agatha told her to come with them because they wouldn't be doing anything that important, Rio insisted that she'd only disturb them. Agatha obviously didn't like the way she said it, so she just gave her a look and went up with Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour in, Agatha came down and found her with her elbows on the kitchen island, scrolling through her phone and eating ice cubes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ice cubes? Really, baby?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? I'll fill them back, don't worry.” Rio stood straight with a smile, and Agatha smiled back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned her body and pinned her. Kissing her neck feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Missed me already?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed her one last time, then pulled back, grabbed two bottles of water, and went upstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they finished—an hour and a half later—Rio was still scrolling through her phone even though nothing interesting was there. And everything interesting was busy working. And ignoring her, in a way. Because yeah, she was the one who refused to go to the studio with them, but she also knew if Agatha was working, that meant she was really working. Focusing every bit of herself on what she was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard them walking in the hallway, talking about something Rio was oblivious to.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she heard Lilia almost whispering,
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take care of Rio, Agatha. Don't hurt her in any way. She's a good kid. She gives a lot and she hurts herself for others.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio’s tears fell down.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't have to say that. Now Rio was feeling vulnerable and exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, Lilia. And I promise you, I won't hurt her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you do, I won't go easy on you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Heard, loud and clear.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And they stepped inside to where Rio was sitting. She brushed her tears immediately, stood up, and put on a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both walked Lilia to the door. She told them to take care of each other, and they wished her a happy birthday, which she responded to with “Don't remind me of growing older.” Then she told them to not be late and be there on time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the door was closed, Rio huffed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned around to face her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmm? Someone’s bored?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, and tired for no reason.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh baby, come here.” Agatha said, offering her chest for Rio to lean on. And Rio accepted it without thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Embracing Agatha, taking her scent in, feeling her body pressed against hers. Feeling her hand stroking her hair gently, soothingly. Listening to her heartbeat and sensing her chest rising and falling.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's heaven on earth. It's Rio’s heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
     No.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's her home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Home is Agatha’s embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Home is Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     And since Agatha is here, it doesn't matter if they actually did something or just sat and looked into each other’s eyes for hours. Because she's there, and even nothing with Agatha is a thing.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     After they embraced each other for a little while, they talked about everything and nothing at all. Pressed kisses everywhere their mouths could reach. They pinned each other more than once, in different places in the house, though neither of them had an orgasm, because apparently, it was, in fact, edging day and Agatha wouldn't allow Rio to come. The orgasm in the morning was a distraction to show Agatha’s hidden agenda. Because she was denying Rio and herself all day.
    </p>
    <p>
     They made lunch together, just a light meal to satisfy their hunger for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was doing the actual work, and Rio was holding her hips, kissing her, and taking her in to make her focus, upon Agatha’s request this morning. Because apparently, it wasn't a trap to take her down, but Agatha was really missing her hands on her hips. Missing Rio standing behind her and distracting her, but she claimed the distraction as focusing.
    </p>
    <p>
     And who’s Rio to deny her something like that? She'd stick her hands on Agatha’s hips if she asked her to.
    </p>
    <p>
     They ate and talked and eye-fucked each other the entire meal. With Agatha’s successful attempts to tease Rio under the table. Brushing Rio’s leg with her bare foot. Moving it up to make her twitch and swallow her moans with her food.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because what could she actually do?
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Agatha was leaning on the physical teasing, Rio held her flirting like a sword and an armor in this battle, and she made Agatha blush, smirk and lower her gaze to her plate every time she had the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they were done, they decided to lie in bed and watch a movie, which this time was Agatha’s time to pick. And Rio gave her a hard time again for not having a TV yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, the next movie afternoon is definitely at my place.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha agreed with a kiss that started as a delicate gesture and ended as a full make-out session that they had to end before they both came from just kissing and touching each other’s clothed bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time it was 5:30, they both got up and got going with preparing themselves for the party.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though Rio tried not to show it, her heart was pounding in her chest. Because the thought of being seen with Agatha was making her nervous. Not in a bad way, but in a thrilling way. In a way that made her heart bang in her chest alongside the heat she was feeling in her abdomen. But she didn't show it. Even though she applied her eyeliner with a shaking hand, she didn't show it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished before Agatha and decided to sit in the living room instead of the bedroom, sitting cross-legged in her strapless black dress just over the knee, checking with Alice, who was heading with her fiancée to Lilia's place.
    </p>
    <p>
     She adjusted her hair a dozen times, and Agatha was still not finished, so she decided to go check on her. The moment she touched the rail of the stairs, Agatha was coming down. Rio lifted her gaze to take in the woman who was wearing a breathtaking navy suit.
    </p>
    <p>
     The suit was great, beautiful but it was Agatha who was breathtaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard as her heart beat in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry I made you wait,
     <em>
      my muse
     </em>
     .” Agatha said with a smile, coming down the stairs, the clicking sound of her black stiletto shoes was loud and commanding. The shoes that Rio may or may not have been having sinful thoughts about. Like, getting corrupted and railed by this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed again, because she can't collect herself if Agatha was looking this good. And no one should expect her to. She was already losing control of herself, on the edge of kneeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     My muse. Oh god.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It doesn't matter, you're here.” Rio said, taking Agatha’s hand and kissing the back of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yes, she was panicking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look gorgeous.” Agatha said, standing in front of Rio. She grabbed her hips and leaned her closer. Their senses filled with each other's perfume. “Maybe we should stay here and have our own dinner.” Agatha smirked, leaning in to kiss Rio’s lips gently so as not to ruin their lipstick.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Unfortunately, we can't do that.” Rio said, playing with Agatha’s blazer, their eyes locked on one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes drifted lower, to her cleavage.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn't hide those well, baby,” Agatha said, looking at a few dark hickey marks that even the concealer failed to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck… let me grab my bag.” Rio tried to release herself from Agatha’s hold to grab her bag, but Agatha only tightened her grip on her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think it would be inappropriate to leave them like this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well… yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then leave them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio smiled nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on baby, we're gonna be late.” She leaned in and kissed her neck teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     This woman…
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put on her tailored blazer and they got out. Got in Agatha’s car and drove to Lilia’s place.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They took off their seat belts, and Rio leaned in to open the door, but Agatha grabbed her wrist gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned to look at her, and their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't want to be this person but…” she spoke softly, intertwining their fingers. “Don't drink too much tonight, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I won't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And they got out of the car after a quick, tender kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was sober for a week now, well technically. Because on the third day she had to drink a beer after a very shitty day at work. Two beers actually. Maybe three. Probably the six cans in the sixer she bought on the way home. Who’s counting? Definitely not Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     But other than that day, she was trying really hard. This was the second time in ten years that she actually tried to be sober. But the difference now is someone was there beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They got into Lilia’s house.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there she was, standing, welcoming guests, with her girlfriend next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both gave their gifts, the ones they bought together a few days ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took her blazer off, and Agatha gave her that look again with a smirk, which made Rio blush and she tried to dismiss it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced at Alice beside Jen, talking to a certain redhead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fucking Ron Weasley.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha seemed to notice where Rio’s eyes landed, so she grabbed her waist tighter, making her flush to her side. Agatha leaned in and whispered in her ear, “Baby, don't worry,” then she pressed a soft kiss to her cheek, which made the hairs on Rio’s body stand to their ends.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Agatha had just kissed her in a house filled with people.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that's why her heart started banging again. It's the affection. It was warm, and she's not used to it in general, but especially not in public.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she was fighting herself not to go to that side table and down at least two drinks to chase the feeling away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because what the hell was she supposed to do with her hands now? She needs a glass, even if it's empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then Agatha leaned in again, “Are you okay, baby?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her for a few long seconds. “I'm fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slid her hand from her waist and intertwined their fingers together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh yes. That's what she's supposed to do with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hold Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     They walked to the inside of the house. Agatha was greeting some people that Rio didn't know and hadn't seen before, Lilia and Agatha’s mutual friends. Those artistic people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was silent most of the time, standing beside Agatha, only speaking when spoken to. And she didn't mind it in the slightest. Because she can't handle an anxiety attack in the middle of her friend’s birthday party. Again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the way Agatha was introducing her to her friends? That's gonna give her a heart attack and not just an anxiety one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is Rio,” and Agatha would look at her side profile with the widest smile ever, while Rio pretended she wasn't getting affected by the way she looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was looking at her like she was something precious. Saying her name in a way that made her heart tighten in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha’s hand stayed either on her waist or holding her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Agatha didn't know. Or maybe she did. But Rio was so glad that she was there, grounding her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because memories of what happened last year at Lilia’s birthday dinner party flooded her head. It was a disaster on a personal level. She had a fight with her ex-girlfriend, and that led to a big argument and a breakdown in the bathroom, and she couldn't stay there any longer so she got out early.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now, with Agatha beside her, and her hand resting on her waist, she could do this party till it ends.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey dude, you're here.” Alice said, leaning in to take Rio in a hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am,”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where’s Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Catching up with her friend. Came here to find you. Where’s your fiancée?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Grabbing us some drinks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A few minutes passed with them catching up. Rio felt an arm wrapping around her waist, making her smile mid-sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi Alice,” Agatha said, offering her hand for Alice to shake and she took it gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio noticed the way her friend grinned foolishly, she's such a fangirl.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi Agatha, Miss Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just call me Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, right, I'm such a big fan of your work, I told you that before, didn't I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed, “Jesus, Alice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? I am. You know I am a fan, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know Alice. But you're panicking. Don't make it look weird dude.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled. “Thank you Alice, It's a pleasure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But her smile dropped briefly as her hold tightened on Rio’s waist, when Jen and a certain redhead walked toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Alice, who was looking at her with the same look. And Rio’s heart pounded in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s eyes locked on Agatha. For a few long seconds that felt like a lifetime for Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha. Nice seeing you here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Likewise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Heard you're settling here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm settled.” Her hold tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s eyes stayed longer on Agatha, as if she was taking her in. Then her eyes drifted to Rio, her lips curling up in a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     She offered her hand for Rio to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, right? I was at your birthday party.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you were.” Rio feigned a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you really know Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hand tightened on Wanda’s, shaking it with a little too much force.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then their hands fell down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda shook her hand in the air dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, you're strong,”
    </p>
    <p>
     To break the tension that was hanging in the air and suffocating them, Jen decided to step in. So she introduced herself to Agatha. A savior.
    </p>
    <p>
     At dinner, Rio sat in front of Agatha, Jen to her side facing Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Wanda was sitting there, right next to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     And her blood was boiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time Wanda leaned in, trying to talk with Agatha about something. Like she had something to speak about with her. And every time she'd whisper, it made Rio struggle in her place. Unable to hear a damn thing, but flames were jumping out of her eyes anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     She saw Agatha dismissing Wanda every time, but that didn't change a thing. Didn't change the fact that her heart was pounding in her chest. Didn't change the fact that Wanda and all those dishes in front of her were making her sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     People talked as they ate and drank, talking about whatever the hell they were talking about, because Rio wasn't paying attention and wasn't hearing a damn thing. And she was fighting herself not to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice mouthed to her, “What’s wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio said, “Nothing.” A little too loud. Causing several people to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now she could have a panic attack.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her gaze to Agatha when she felt her teasing her with that fucking black stiletto.
    </p>
    <p>
     And maybe Rio was greedy, maybe she was fucked up and a total mess. But she didn't care about that at the moment. She wanted Agatha's attention, all of it. In any kind, shape or form. She needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio spread her legs a little wider under the table instead of closing them. And she let those shoes do the work, her eyes locked on Agatha and her hand was trying to do something with the fork in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     To her side, she heard a drunk, chuckling Lilia telling that goddamn horse-riding accident story that Rio had heard her telling at least a hundred times.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the heel started to go higher.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Higher.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio was fighting herself, looking at Agatha’s blue eyes, she felt herself getting pulled into their orbit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda leaned in, putting her hand behind Agatha’s chair, and whispered something right into her ear, causing Agatha to break the intensity of their eye contact and look at the redhead, who smiled at her, showing off her fucking perfect teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her legs immediately as she felt a tear running down, or maybe several were falling down.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed the glass of red wine to her side and gulped it. Her eyes turned red immediately, and she never looked away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha looked back at her, Rio excused herself and got up. Causing almost everybody to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fucking birthday parties.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fucking socializing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She walked in a hurry, gulping half a glass of dirty martini she found on her way to the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got in and locked the door behind her. Washed her face several times as she tried avoiding looking at herself in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood there, leaning her face down to the sink, pitying herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because she was vulnerable, weak and jealous. Again.
    </p>
    <p>
     And why?
    </p>
    <p>
     She knows Agatha was pushing that woman away.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knows Agatha didn't do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knows she was only overreacting.
    </p>
    <p>
     But fucking hell, her heart was a few beats away from stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
     She might have a heart attack from how she was panicking and suffocating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling herself getting crushed down, and this bathroom was only shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tears stopped falling. But when she finally looked up to her reflection, her eyes were red. As if everything she was feeling settled there.
    </p>
    <p>
     She's jealous, yes. And the feeling sucks.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was helpless in front of herself. In front of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio?” Agatha called from behind the door as she tried opening the bathroom door. “Baby? Are you okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't say anything. She just looked at the water running in the sink. “Answer me, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm—I'm fine.” She choked on her sob, and she doubts Agatha even heard her from how low and broken her voice was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Open the door for me then. Let me in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was silent for a long minute, only hearing Agatha’s soft voice calling her through the door. And god, how it made her feel awful to do this to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She splashed water on her face for one last time, then walked to open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     They looked into each other’s eyes for a second. Then Agatha got in, immediately closed the door behind her, and leaned in, holding Rio in her embrace. Taking her closer to her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both said it at the same time. And Rio? Rio crashed down when Agatha started brushing her hair softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to soothe her, but Rio wasn't there. Not in that place now. She doesn't want to be soothed, she wanted to claim.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her head up from Agatha’s chest and looked at her. Their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she looked into those blue eyes, she felt guilty. Guilty of making Agatha worry for just a tiny little bit. Guilty for being this weak and vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it's so goddamn… it's childish… but fuck, my heart, Agatha...” She rested her hand on her chest. “It hurts… so much. And I can't bear it. I can't handle it pounding like this in my chest. I can't handle seeing her, or anyone else getting close to you… it's a lot. I know I'm a lot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ran a hand through her hair, trying to turn around and not look at Agatha, but Agatha leaned in, wrapped her arm around Rio’s waist and grabbed her closer. Brushing her cheek with the back of her other hand as their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio’s heart didn't calm down, and neither did her tears, because they resumed falling down her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lowered her hand and rested it on Rio’s chest, above her heart, feeling it beat in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is loud,” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha…” Rio exhaled a shaking breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn't be able to control myself if we were at some party and your ex was there. Sitting next to you at dinner. I would’ve exploded if someone leaned close to you like this, ex or not. So why are you saying it like you did something wrong by reacting, hmm?” She grabbed Rio closer. “You're allowed to react. You can be jealous. You can be mad at me for acting in a certain way that you don't like and hurting you. But no, you just hurt yourself. You just… god, you take it all on yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand still rested on Rio’s chest, feeling her fast heartbeats and unsteady breaths. Their eyes locked. Not even able to blink in the presence of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't want to hurt you in any way. I don't want to hurt your heart, baby. I want to be good to you. And only you, yeah? Fuck Wanda and fuck everyone else. God, Rio...” Agatha closed her eyes and inhaled deeply, pressing her hand on Rio’s chest and tightening her hold on her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You, Rio…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed the gap between them, leaned in and crashed their mouths together, swallowing Agatha’s words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips and hands were shaking. Her hands traveled higher and cupped Agatha’s face, bringing her closer and closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Desperate to take all of Agatha in. Kissing her as if Agatha were her salvation. And she is. Her salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't fight to take control, she was just standing there, doing her part. Allowing Rio to take what's hers. To claim her. To feel her.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio’s heart was diseased with jealousy, then she could find the antidote in Agatha’s mouth. And get rid of that fucking poison.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wants to consume and be consumed by Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha? Rio? Are you okay in there?” Lilia’s voice rang in her ears. But Rio didn't pull away. She couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is everything okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back slightly, breaking the kiss. She looked at Rio. Both of them were trying to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're okay, Lilia.” Agatha said, heavily breathing, eyes locked on Rio. Their faces just a breath away. “Just a minute. We'll be there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is Rio okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm fine, Lilia.” Rio said, holding Agatha’s hand tightly in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. Don't be late, we'll eat the cake without you.” Lilia said with a chuckle. That woman was wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before even knowing if Lilia was gone or not, Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio again. Their bodies flush against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hands slid under Agatha’s blazer and grabbed her waist, pulling her closer and closer to her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands slowly slid lower to Agatha’s ass, causing her to moan softly and for Rio to swallow it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She started moving her hands forward, touching her thighs above the fabric, causing several shivers to run down Agatha’s spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put her fingers in the belt loops for a few seconds, then she pulled her head back slightly. Looking into Agatha’s eyes and pulling her closer by the belt loops, even though there wasn't any closer left.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, chest rising and falling.
    </p>
    <p>
     She licked her lips, and before Rio said anything, she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She tried to provoke me. It's how she plays.” Agatha leaned in, tucking a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “None of what she says is important. Don't think about her. I just want you to think about me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're all I want to think about, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They kissed again. Feeling themselves getting lost in each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled back, tried to adjust their hair and smudged lipstick. Then they got out before someone came to search for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     After dinner, came the cake which Lilia made a dozen times better with her hilarious state and constant tripping.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Agatha were standing side by side, laughing at one of Lilia’s absolutely not-funny stories.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked to her side. To Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     How beautiful she looked with a smile on her face. She looked ethereal.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for Rio to have her by her side, grabbing her waist, feeling the warmth of her body, inhaling the intoxicating scent of her, it all felt unreal.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the words, they were trapped in her mouth. Rested on the tip of her tongue. Unable to voice them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to look at her, and her smile widened as her pupils dilated briefly the moment she looked at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” She asked, and her voice was clear, landing straight into Rio’s ear despite the noise, the talking, the music in the background. In a way, her ears knew what mattered. What Rio wanted to listen to.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're beautiful,” Rio softly said, taking the glass of red wine from Agatha’s hold, looking straight into her eyes. She took two sips, then gave it back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say a thing, she just smiled and looked at the birthday woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time the evening ended, they got out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen asked them to join them for a few rounds of drinks, but Agatha said she had to work tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But we will go on a double date!” Alice yelled, clinging to her fiancée's side who was fighting for her life to hold her without making her fall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Agatha laughed and nodded for her to go.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Heading home?”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both turned around to see Wanda standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Wanda,” Agatha said, holding Rio’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should meet sometime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why is that exactly? To strengthen the bond?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, why not? I'd like to know more about Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tossed her car keys into Rio’s fist, telling her to go to the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio didn't, she stood there, beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you could talk shit about me in front of her? Because it hurts to see me happy with someone else, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You left.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think I'm stupid, Wanda? No, seriously, do you think I'm that stupid?” Agatha took a step toward her ex, making Wanda take one backward.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you saying? That you didn't leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where’s Natasha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s face changed color.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's at home. Wait… what does Nat have to do with all of this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, I know about you. I've known for years. So Stop acting like a victim. It's pathetic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand and they walked away, technically dragging her with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They got in, and Agatha was furious, cursing her ex under her breath as she fastened her seatbelt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, baby,” she put her hand on Agatha’s thigh. “Look at me,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her blue eyes softened. “Nothing, I think I just had so much to drink. And she kept showing up all night... testing my patience.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, don't think about her.” Rio gently moved her hand up and down Agatha's thigh. “I'm here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her, her eyes half-lidded and calm
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank god you're here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in and kissed Rio's lips, a kiss that held so much weight but still translated with tenderness on their lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they pulled back, Rio tucked a strand of Agatha’s hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You said it yourself. Fuck Wanda and everybody else. I want to be good to you, the same way you're good to me. And don't think about them… just think about me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're all I think about, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio drove them to Agatha’s place. And their night was far from over. It's just started.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they stepped inside the house, they were each other’s to ruin and fix.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because they were each other’s.

    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio called as she put her keys in the bowl. The keys to Agatha’s house.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ones Agatha gave Rio when she spent the night at her place four days ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     And in the morning, when Rio had to go to work, wearing one of Agatha’s suits that was a little larger than her own. The light grey one that Agatha helped her put on, piece by piece. Kissing Rio’s skin, spot after spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha came down the stairs and called for her before Rio put her hand on the door handle. Calling her name softly. Tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Lovingly.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     A silky robe was put on her shoulders languidly, not even bothering to tie it. Her pale skin made Rio's mouth water the moment she turned around and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes kept drifting between Agatha's enchanting eyes and how
     <em>
      ethereal
     </em>
     she looked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held Rio’s hips the moment she approached her and pulled her closer, stopping Rio from taking another step back with a kiss. Holding her hips tightly with both of her hands as their tongues tangled in a heated kiss. Rio felt an object in Agatha’s hand; she was clenching it a little too tight in her fist so as it wouldn't dig into Rio’s hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they pulled back slightly, their eyes locked. Rio’s lips curled up in a warm smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt herself like a goddamn balloon, almost floating in the place. And instead of hitting the ceiling, the only thing that kept her grounded was Agatha’s hold on her hips. Feeling as if her string was wrapped around Agatha’s wrist so she wouldn't stray away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was that for?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio asked with amusement, as her eyes kept drifting between the most captivating pair of blue eyes she had ever seen and drowned in, and the most perfect pair of lips she had ever kissed and felt the warmth of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood in silence for a few long seconds, only looking at Rio’s face with a smirk on her face. She leaned in again and pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look so beautiful,” Agatha said, pulling Rio even closer to her. And Rio only grinned, feeling so much warmth. So much
     <em>
      love
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And before Rio could say anything, Agatha took her hand and put the keys in her hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here,” she said, not looking away from Rio’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked down at her hand, and her smile dropped briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you wouldn't have to call me every time you come here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha… are you sure?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “About what?” Both of Agatha’s hands were back on her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “About this. Giving me this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, baby. I'm sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tossed the key inside her pocket and placed her other hand on the back of Agatha’s neck, pulling her in a kiss that lasted for minutes, filled with so many emotions—that for the first time—Rio was able to handle. To take all of them and feel them flooding her body with…
     <em>
      love
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And since that day, Rio had never looked at that key as if it's just a key. It was much more.
    </p>
    <p>
     So much more.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She got upstairs after calling Agatha’s name again. She looked for her in the bedroom, but it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she stood in front of the studio’s wooden door. She raised her hand up to knock on it, and before doing so, Agatha spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on in, baby. I'm here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A warm, fond smile found its way onto Rio’s face. She pulled the door handle and got in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was in front of her, lying on the floor in shorts and a flannel shirt. Her eyes closed, her hand raised in the air with a cigarette between her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned as she approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing on the floor?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only smiled without opening her eyes. When Rio took the cigarette from her, she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inhaled as she looked down at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you always look so handsome when you get back from work?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only once or twice a month.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't spread false information, baby. Someone might believe you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio narrowed her eyes as she inhaled again, then gave the cigarette back to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you believe it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned softly. “
     <em>
      Absolutely not.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's what matters.” Rio leaned in, as close as possible, until she was able to press a kiss on Agatha’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she pulled back to stand again, Agatha held her hand tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Agatha said, holding Rio’s hand and pulling her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without saying anything more, Rio took off her black blazer and remained in the white tank top as she straddled Agatha’s body. Shaking her head with a smirk resting on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha inhaled the last of the cigarette as she focused her eyes on Rio, then turned her face to the side and stubbed it on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put both of her hands on Rio’s hips as she exhaled in the atmosphere between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha started moving her hands up and down Rio’s sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you need anything?” Rio asked, her voice low and deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Agatha said as she pulled out the tank top that was tucked under Rio’s pants. Then slid her warm hands underneath it and started stroking the skin of her sides soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whimpered as she felt Agatha’s hands drifting to rest on the waistband of her pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked, and she swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How was your day at work?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good… it was fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put her fingers in the belt loops and pulled Rio’s body closer, almost making her lay on top of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she unbuttoned her pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I brought…” Rio swallowed hard, feeling Agatha’s fingers on her skin. “I brought food with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm. Later.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes stayed locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put her fingers in the belt loops again and pulled Rio’s upper body even closer to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt like she had nowhere to go, and she had never felt this much pleasure while being trapped before.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put both of her palms on either side of Agatha’s head on the floor and leaned in.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she drifted her eyes away from Agatha’s, she glanced at the opened sketchbook by her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh? Drawing me again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha matched her smirk, but it was even wider.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can't help it,
     <em>
      my muse
     </em>
     ,” she said as she placed one of her hands on Rio’s back, pushing her closer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can't help it, you're obsessed with me.” Rio grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know…” Rio said, her face a breath away from Agatha’s. “You said you'd paint me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? And you said you'd love to pose for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would love to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bent both of her legs up, put both of her hands on Rio’s hips, and switched their positions smoothly. Slowing down a bit as she laid Rio’s head on the floor, then she was on top of her. Her hands on either side of Rio’s head, trapping it. And one of her legs rested between Rio’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked, and their wide smirks matched.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to pose for me.
     <em>
      God
     </em>
     , I need you to do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio managed lifting her head up slightly to press a soft kiss on her lips, and Agatha was quick to take off the barrette that was pining Rio’s hair up, letting the dark locks that got longer since Rio decided to cut them loose on the white floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her heart pounding in her chest. Feeling Agatha’s weight on her. Taking in her scent every time she inhaled. Feeling her close to her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she just wanted that. All of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to feel Agatha. All of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're not breathing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stated with a smirk. Many other times she'd said this exact same sentence with concern written all over her face. But now, it was dark. It was delicious to hear and see.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How can I? With you being this… close to me? God…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Breathe for me, baby,” Agatha said, the smirk still visible on her features.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes were dark, and from how close her face was to Rio, Rio was able to see her reflection in them. And it was the only reflection Rio was able to look at without turning her face away. Because it was in Agatha’s eyes. It felt like she could really see herself in the woman’s eyes, and it wasn't even metaphorical.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put her hands on Agatha’s back and pushed her toward her to lean in even more. And she whimpered straight into Agatha’s mouth as she felt Agatha’s leg resting exactly between hers. Utterly on her heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to breathe you, if you don't mind,”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio said with a helpless smile, her eyes half-lidded and dark with lust and anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leaning Agatha in even more, and lifting her head up, she was able to bury her face in Agatha’s warm neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't mind. Go ahead, fill your lungs with me if it's the only way to make you breathe properly.” Agatha moaned the words as Rio started inhaling Agatha in, and exhaling her warm breaths on her skin. Feeling her shake above her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're right, my love. You're the only one that could make me breathe properly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Ah, Rio…
     </em>
     ” Agatha moaned softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt how Agatha’s arms were almost shaking by her sides. Pressing on the floor with her palms so hard. So Rio put one of her hands on Agatha’s back and the other on the back of her head, securing it tenderly with her hold. And instead of pulling Agatha in, she switched their positions, and Agatha was lying on the floor again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was on top of her, imitating the way Agatha was on top of her a few seconds ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she leaned in, burying her face in Agatha’s neck once again. Taking her in with urgency. As if she really wasn't able to breathe. As if Agatha was the only thing keeping her alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that was the case since she started falling for the woman. Rio felt like she wasn't more than a body before her and Agatha was able to pour a soul into her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly making her drink it, until she was full.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio is never full.
    </p>
    <p>
     Never full with Agatha. And as much Agatha is willing to pour into her, Rio will take her until she floods—and even that won't stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kept repeating her name with every sharp inhale and a warm, shaking exhale on Agatha’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her leg was moving up and down absentmindedly. But she was feeling it—under the layers, she was feeling the heat radiating from Agatha’s cunt, hitting her leg and body through the layers of fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was luscious.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Agatha’s body trembling underneath hers. She felt Agatha's breaths shaking as she clung onto her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio was still breathing through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You smell so good. You're intoxicating… God, you're…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her body up an inch without pulling her head up from its place. She drifted her hand slowly, opening the buttons of Agatha’s shirt as her nose was digging in Agatha’s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened them all, feeling Agatha’s skin with her palm, taking a path between their bodies, until she slid her hand down underneath the waistband of Agatha's shorts—her fingers reaching their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she paused for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck, Rio. I need you,
     </em>
     ” Agatha whined, her words and hot breaths landing straight on Rio’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, god. You're not wearing underwear?
     <em>
      Oh, baby.
     </em>
     ” Rio moaned breathlessly on her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she finally felt Agatha’s heat on her palm, she lifted her head up, and Agatha immediately removed her hands from Rio’s shoulders to her hips. Holding her tightly, almost digging her short nails in her flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment they were face to face and their eyes locked, Rio felt her heart stop for a moment—only for it to pound so hard in her chest as she stared at those blue eyes and moved her palm up and down Agatha’s drenched slit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want that. To paint me while I pose for you. I need it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand started moving faster, feeling Agatha holding her hips tighter than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to see me right in front of you. I want to look into your eyes while you see me…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed a single finger into Agatha's entrance and started thrusting it slowly, deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to look at my body and face and paint them like you've never done before. I want you to forget everyone that once posed for you. Everyone you looked at and painted with your talented hands…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She added another and started stretching deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes stayed locked, as if they were frozen. Unable to look at anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because they weren’t me—and they were
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     lucky to have you look at them. But… this body? This body is yours. You own it. My heart? It's yours. I'm yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you're mine,” Agatha said heavily, followed by a loud moan when Rio started rubbing lightly on her clit with her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am. I'm yours. All of me. And I’m your muse, aren’t I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are my everything, Rio.” Agatha closed her eyes. “
     <em>
      Baby…
     </em>
     ” She moaned softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Open your eyes, please. I want to see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha did. Opening them slowly, half-lidded, dark and enchanting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started thrusting her fingers faster, hitting that sweet spot as she continued rubbing her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to come for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And a few more thrusts, Agatha came with a loud, heavy moan, as she forced her eyes to remain open and locked with Rio’s so she could look into them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio slowed her pace and only took her hand out after Agatha’s body calmed down underneath her and she was able to loosen her tight hold on Rio's hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her glistening fingers up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Open your mouth for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha did the exact same second. She opened her mouth. Rio brushed her bottom lip slightly before putting her fingers inside Agatha's mouth to suck on and to wrap her warm tongue around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned on her own taste, and before finishing sucking Rio’s fingers clean, Rio pulled them and sucked the rest as she kept looking straight into Agatha’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tasting and smelling her with hunger. Everything about Agatha was intoxicating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Rio drifted her hand lower, palming Agatha’s skin. When she felt Agatha trying to switch their positions again, Rio spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.” She denied softly, and she saw the shift in Agatha’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will take my clothes off now, and I… I will pose for you. And you will use your
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     fucking talented hands to paint me and then… then I need your fingers inside me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her for a second as she started moving her hands up and down Rio’s sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby, you just came back from work and you're probably hungry…” Her voice was soft, filled with concern and sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Please.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pleaded, leaning her face in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled fondly as she stared at Rio’s eyes and her movements never stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anything you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in even more, pressing a soft kiss on Agatha’s parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then a flicker of uncertainty washed over her as she looked at Agatha’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s movements stopped the same second as Rio used her arms to sit down and straddle Agatha’s body briefly, then she sat on her heels on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But if you're resting, tell me. If you don't want to. I don't want to be demanding.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha followed suit and sat down. She took Rio’s hand in hers and Rio just looked at her flushed state. How her hair was messy. Her eyes dark and half-lidded.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stared into each other’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're not demanding. But I want you to demand things from me. I want you to tell me everything you want from me, and I will provide it, no matter what it is.” She put a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You think you're demanding because you want me to paint you? Rio, how can I tell you that I've been thinking about it the moment you said you'd pose for me? How many times have I pictured it in my head and repeated it over and over again?” Agatha put her hand on the small of Rio’s neck as she leaned closer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How can I tell you that the only thing that occupies my head is you? I can't think of anything or anyone else but you. From the moment you leave my eyesight until I see you again—and even when you're here with me…
     <em>
      it's just you, Rio
     </em>
     . I've never felt this…
     <em>
      free
     </em>
     , while working, until you came into my life. The moment I saw you, the night I tried painting your beautiful face out of my memory, my life shifted entirely, and I don't want to go back. And you fear being demanding?” Agatha leaned in closer, resting her forehead on Rio’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me how you're being demanding while you're offering yourself to me? Be demanding if you want to be. Tell me what I should do for you, and I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes as she pulled Agatha’s head closer to hers. Their foreheads resting on one another, their breaths heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't want to go back either. I don't want to go back where I didn't even know you. I want to start from here, with you by my side. I want…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed as she felt her heart still banging in her chest. “I want to be good to you and to truly deserve you, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're good to me. So good, baby. And you deserve me, don't doubt that. I'm yours the same way that you're mine. I want you to trust me and believe me when I say that you own every piece of me, Rio. I'm all yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their faces leaned closer, their mouths connected in a tender kiss, and their tongues tangled with heat and confessions resting on their tips.
    </p>
    <p>
     And they continued kissing messily. Sucking and nipping and breathing heavily as they held each other and stood on their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss deepened, and neither of them was trying to pull away. They only seemed to pull each other closer, as close as possible. To feel the heat of their bodies and mouths. To hear each other's rapid heartbeats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put her hands on Agatha’s hips under her unbuttoned shirt and started walking their bodies to get out of the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their feet were stepping forward and backward in hurried but calculated steps, as if they were dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holding each other in a way that made them look like they were colliding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unable to pull back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned their bodies around so she could pin Agatha’s body on the wall beside the door. She pulled back and looked at Agatha’s eyes. Their chests rising and falling heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she leaned in again, kissing Agatha’s neck and sucking on her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're all I need, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before letting Agatha say something, their mouths were back again to munch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squeezed Agatha’s sides and walked their bodies to the side, feeling both of Agatha’s hands fisting her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     They got out and kissed all the way to the bedroom, pulling back slightly only when air became a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio guided Agatha to sit on the bed as she took off her pants and tank top, locking her eyes with Agatha’s as she freed herself from the layers of fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     And
     <em>
      oh
     </em>
     , how goddamn perfect and ethereal Agatha looked. Sitting there. Devouring Rio with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should I lay down?” Rio asked, still breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whatever you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You tell me what to do.” Rio walked toward Agatha and kneeled by her feet. “Guide me, my love. Tell me how to please you. How to offer myself to you so you could take me entirely.” Her hands were moving up and down the exposed skin of Agatha’s legs. Her palms were hot, but Agatha’s body was scorching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cupped her face, her thumbs stroking Rio's face gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take those off and come lay down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed. Her hands went behind her back and unclasped her bra, then she used Agatha’s knees as leverage to stand up and take her underwear off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at her. Taking her body in with dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She licked her lips.“
     <em>
      You're perfect.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she stood up to face Rio. They kissed again, and through the kiss Agatha guided Rio’s body to lay down—adjusting the pillows with one hand and holding Rio’s waist with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Agatha pulled back and walked to be in front of the bed, looking at Rio’s bare lying body, looking at Rio, seeing her, exactly how she did once before.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, once again, felt looked at.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Seen
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lift your leg up,” Agatha told with a deep, low voice. The lust and arousal were visible in her command.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed, bending her leg up without giving a damn about how drenched she was. She was aware that she was dripping on the mattress. That she was turned on. It was no secret.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched, and she immediately lifted her eyes up to lock them with Rio. She was fisting her hands by her side, her knuckles turning white, and she was digging her teeth in her bottom lip so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was struggling, and Rio knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me touch you. Let me take care of you.” Agatha took a step forward, putting her palms on the bed, a second away from crawling up and being on top of Rio’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha just wanted Rio to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head slightly with a smirk as she put her arm behind her head, resting on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Afterward.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm dying to let you touch me. I think I will come from just looking at you looking at me, but… afterward.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It could take hours, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know.” Rio said with a grin. As if she were confident. As if she really could wait for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say another word. She just looked at Rio, then got out of the bedroom to get her stuff from the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exhaled a shaking breath once Agatha was out of the room. She was painfully aware of how turned on she was. So much that she might explode if Agatha only looked at her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to touch herself, but she thought if she was going to do that, Agatha should be there too. To give her a show. Not to torture Agatha in any way, but because Rio truly wanted to offer herself to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a couple of minutes, Rio was lying there. Trying to keep her hands to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was back, both of her hands holding things, a cigarette between her lips and that goddamn shirt was still open and only hanging on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sight of her pale skin and the valley between her breasts wasn't helping Rio in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's breath hitched, her heart pounded in her chest, and she swallowed so hard when Agatha sat on the chair, facing her and looking at her like…
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Without saying anything—not a single word came out of Agatha’s throat, she held the charcoal pencil between her fingers and sketched lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time she glanced at Rio, Rio felt her body being set on fire. Every part of her was burning, begging for the fire to be put out. Craving Agatha’s touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hands were twitching. Her muscles were tense. Her lips were dry and she was dripping nonstop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was focused on drawing, her fingers moving, her lip between her teeth and she hadn’t glanced at Rio in almost a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio moved her hand down on her body, lower, almost reaching her heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha looked at her. Straight into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hand froze in place above her pubic bone. Her entire body froze, unable to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     She blinked several times, her brow frowned. An overwhelming amount of feelings washed over her. And the words rang in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Rio's voice was barely above a whisper as their eyes remained locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart was racing in her chest. Hearing the words again didn't help. And hearing Agatha saying her name like this didn't help either.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her breaths were uneven and her chest was rising and falling heavily. Heavier than any time before.
    </p>
    <p>
     She propped on her arms and put her leg down, still looking at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt herself panicking, unable to breathe or think properly. The words rang in her head and Agatha's voice as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those words she'd been wanting to say for a long time now. The words that rested on the tip of her tongue and got swallowed so many times to be counted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say anything more, she just looked at Rio. Then she got up from the chair she was sitting on and walked across the bed to where Rio was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio just looked at her. Unable to do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was frozen and floating and drowning and feeling everything, every emotion all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio was quick to take her hand and pull her in with a kiss that was desperate and filled with disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled Agatha more until she was on top of her. Their faces less than a breath apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you too. I love you, Agatha. I love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her tears fell down, she couldn't hold them back any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were fast and hot and honest.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt herself not just saying a word. Not just confessing something. Not just feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, it was more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     It meant that Rio was able to love with certainty and honesty and sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
     That her heart was truly beating for Agatha and Agatha only. And only now she realized that she could show that and make Agatha feel it and see it too by saying the words she thought she wouldn't be able to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     But they came out with ease, because they were real, coming from a deep place inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you, Agatha.” She repeated the words once more before pulling Agatha in for another desperate and deep kiss. As if she couldn't believe herself saying it out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time her heart pounded because of Agatha, Rio felt like she finally could show it. Translate it into words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to say those exact same words the day she woke up for the first time in Agatha’s bed. Those three words were living inside her waiting to be released.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waiting for Rio to gather her courage and say them out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I love you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     They kissed and Rio didn't try to switch their positions. She wanted Agatha to be on top of her. She wanted to be able to look up at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She moved her hands up and took Agatha’s shirt off her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they pulled back and Rio moaned instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Touch me. Please, touch me, my love.” She pleaded with heavy breaths and a rapid heartbeat
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha didn't wait any longer, her mouth was on Rio’s, and her hand was drifting lower. Determined to satisfy Rio's needs immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her leg up again, inviting with want. With desperation. With need. Her need to feel Agatha, to feel the words on her body after they’ve been said.
    </p>
    <p>
     She moaned loudly the moment Agatha slid two of her fingers with ease inside Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I could feel you inside me. I could see myself in your eyes. I could… feel my heart beat for you.” Rio mumbled, almost incoherently. The words mixed with moans, whimpers, heavy breaths and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the way Agatha was looking down at her? It showed that the words reached her deeply even if they were incoherent and Rio was inhaling and exhaling before every syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh god, Agatha. Oh, my god, Agatha.
     </em>
     ” She moaned as she closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words and warm breaths were hitting Agatha’s parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't even know if she was pleading a god out there, or begging the goddess on top of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      My love.
     </em>
     ” Agatha said and it hit Rio’s heart immediately. The same way Agatha’s thrusts inside her weren’t only hitting her G-spot. She was truly feeling Agatha inside her. In so many ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt tears falling down on her face from above that weren’t hers. So her eyes snapped open—and she saw Agatha’s beautiful, enchanting blue eyes, glassy with tears. Her tears falling straight down on Rio’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, my love.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s tears were falling down on her face so fast, mixing with Agatha’s falling down on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her hand and clung to Agatha’s shoulder. The other was softly brushing Agatha’s tears away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of their bodies were shaking—and the bed beneath them as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hair falling down by her sides, tickling Rio’s skin gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love your blue eyes. I love your dark hair. I love your voice when you call my name. I love your nose. Your face. Your body. I love everything about you. I love you, Agatha.” Rio breathed out every sentence, and she came with a loud moan while saying Agatha’s name out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha’s pace remained the same, feeling Rio’s body shaking with the intensity of her orgasm beneath her. And she didn't slow down a second. She moved her body lower, her other hand stroking Rio’s sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was between Rio’s legs, spreading them widely with her free hand. She got out of bed for a second, not even giving Rio the chance to whine at the loss and unpleasant emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat down on the floor in front of the edge of the bed and pulled Rio’s body toward her. Rio’s lower body was in the air, her hips were jerking up constantly, shaking and twitching and her pussy was directed straight at Agatha’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, baby,” Rio moaned as she felt Agatha’s fingers filling her again. As if she couldn't handle the thought of leaving Rio empty when she could fill her over and over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Open your legs wider for me, my love.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio once again felt the words striking her heart, and she obeyed with desperation. Spread her legs as wide as she could, feeling all of her muscles tensing and only her toes were hitting the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, kissing Rio’s thighs tenderly. Biting the soft flesh and leaving her marks lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in even closer, and her mouth connected with Rio’s sensitive clit that was intensely and constantly throbbing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cried out the moment Agatha started thrusting inside her with two of her long fingers and sucking on her clit with urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, fuck…” The words were stuck in her throat and she was only managing to moan and cry out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried propping her body on her arms to see Agatha, but the moment she did so, Agatha sucked on her clit, and Rio's stomach muscles tensed and burned, so she threw her head back on the bed helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha kept her pace, determined to make Rio come with a massively intense orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was close.
     <em>
      So close
     </em>
     . The pleasure waiting on the tips of her entire body to be pushed forward and flood her completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a few more thrusts and sucks, Rio came with a loud curse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha removed her fingers and lowered her mouth down. Her long tongue started thrusting inside, and her thumb was rubbing on Rio’s clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby, please. I can't,” Rio pleaded, and even though one of Agatha’s hands was on her hips to keep her body down, her hips were jerking up in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her head up and looked at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can. Just this one,” her voice was soft, as if she were begging to make Rio come. Desperate to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio only moaned. Because she didn't really want Agatha to pull back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was back on her. Lips and tongue and fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took her tongue out of Rio's entrance again and replaced it with three of her fingers, stretching Rio even more. Making her mumble and moan out incoherent words.
    </p>
    <p>
     After another thrust, Agatha took her fingers out and just kept rubbing on her clit. She lifted her eyes up to look at Rio, then down at how her walls were clenching around nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio came with a forceful gush, soaking Agatha’s cleavage wet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s body was trembling—she couldn't even know what to do with her body. And the moment Agatha licked her slit with the length of her tongue, Rio lost it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was cursing. Moaning. Breaths uneven. Tears falling down her face from the delicious intensity she was feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her body calmed down after a while, and Agatha started pressing soft kisses on the inside of her thighs all the way up to between Rio's breasts. Every kiss was filled with devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she got up on her feet and helped Rio adjust her body on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her shorts and underwear off as their eyes were staring into each other’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was trying to steady her breaths as she looked at
     <em>
      her love
     </em>
     with a tired smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Agatha got into bed with her, and their mouths connected with a deep tender kiss. Sharing Rio’s taste as their tongues tangled languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you,” Agatha said, tucking a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. Then started stroking her face gently with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes. She would never get tired of hearing those words. Every time Agatha said them, her heart would race in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha inhaled sharply through her nose as she pulled Rio’s body closer to her, making Rio’s head rest on her bare, warm chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio was able to hear how Agatha’s heart was in the same racing condition as hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you hungry?” Agatha asked softly, brushing Rio’s hair soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can we eat later? I want to stay like this for a little longer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anything you want my love.”

    <p>
     Rio Vidal had never understood feelings in general. She'd never comprehended what they actually are.She was able to feel them, experience and express them—the bitter and the sweet ones—but never understood them. She could define each one of them accurately. Give a handful of synonyms to each emotion. Explain what they are biologically and psychologically, but the issue that she’d never found a solution to was how and why all of them burdened her at some point. One way or another. Everything overwhelmed her, no matter the amount of it or the intention behind it. She found it all overwhelming in a way she couldn't handle and had never known how to contain within limits. Everything slipped and ran out of her hand like a liquid. She knew it could adapt to the shape of its container, but the paradox was that she couldn't find the damn right container. Things always spilled and adapted a chaotic, unplanned shape. Not that she ever planned something and it actually went according to her plans anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     No matter what the feeling was, the terrifying process of experiencing it inside her body would always be the same. Whether, by definition, it was a positive or a negative one, it was all equivalently consuming.
    </p>
    <p>
     She always felt it. The feeling would creep slowly inside her body, run in her veins and ride the waves of her blood. Starting in her heart—and it would clench in her chest. Thereupon to pump inside her lungs—when she'd suffocate and struggle to breathe. Then it would turn back to her heart, making it clench tighter for a good, nocuous mesure. Thus, the feelings would pump inside her whole body, nauseating and unbearable. Then eventually, like a combusting whack, it would reach her head, where it would analyze everything, throb and react. There, where lay everything that would make her miserable, simply for just
     <em>
      feeling
     </em>
     . Which—being miserable—is also a feeling. And it would remain like that, coursing with her blood circulation. Inside, where nothing could be visible and everything is fucking
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     . Until, occasionally, it all would appear on her face and dragged out of her throat. She would sometimes weep uncontrollably, shout and scream loudly with rage and desperation. But most of the time, she kept it inside, eating her alive until she'd be alone and take it all on herself in different ways. By consuming alcohol to numb it all momentarily. Neglecting and lothating herself to let it rot. Letting her body struggle—physically and mentally—or the many other ways she adopted as methods of coping over the years. Ways of surviving in the face of simply,
     <em>
      feeling
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Feelings were wicked. All of them. Whether they provided her a temporary happiness or a long-living sorrow and agony. The countless days and nights tormented her ashen body and forsaken soul. When she wished she would turn cold the next day. To be uncaring and distant even from herself. To just be living in this big melancholic world, just another number of a person, until the day for her would come. To be withdrawn
     <em>
      slowly
     </em>
     , then she'd be one with the void. Rio never cared about the world losing another person—losing her—because she never considered it losing in the first place. Many died every millisecond and doubles were born in the same exact damn millisecond. So it wasn't that big of a deal.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only thing she wished, the only emotion she wanted and
     <em>
      begged
     </em>
     her body to feel, was the bliss of complete numbness. Something to match her long-lasting loneliness that she felt even in the middle of a teeming place. Amongst a crowd she didn't belong to. Because Rio never belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
     The people who Rio was able to express her emotions to weren’t people she found by herself and decided to go toward. To just speak out her mind and express what she felt for them. They always—
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     —came to her. Whether she wanted them to come or not. The good and the dreadful ones. They always approached her first. She was never the one who started things first. She didn't come first even in contexts like these.
    </p>
    <p>
     She always felt herself driven. Sailing with the flow in a boat with holes and no oars by her sides. There was no way to reach a destination where she could land and just simply walk with bare feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all of it turned out just fine, or at least that's what she repeated to herself over and over again. That everything went in its own way and led her so she could be here. To be what she is. Even if she didn't approve of where she stood or who she was as a person, she still took it. All the traumatic events she went through. All the disappointments she experienced, and the reckless, unreasonable things she did, they guided her to stand in the mark she was standing on. Which didn't mean anything and it wasn't much by all means, but it was fine. She accepted it with exhaustion, without making peace with it, because that was the only thing she was able to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      But
     </em>
     love
     <em>
      .
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Love? Unquestionably, that one was dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because just like how immensely she felt everything, love took the same overwhelming pattern—only worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she felt love toward someone or something? That meant being exposed fully. It meant being unguarded, unraveled. It meant her body and soul would react immediately, without giving her the chance to even hold the weight inside, to measure it and make sure of how heavy and overwhelming all of it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio loved so deeply. Deep enough to be hurt beyond healing. Her love was aching. The scarring kind. She loved with all of her senses, and the worst part? She attached easily. And she was all aware of it. But what would being aware do in front of being helpless?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew the chaotic and overwhelming side of loving. Nothing other than that. And that was her only view of it. All the movies she watched under the romance genre—which were many, because she always touched something through them, something untouchable—all the feelings they tried showing through rehearsed scripts and beautiful cinematography—she was aware those weren’t real. Not what love actually felt and looked like. Not what she experienced her entire life. Because all of it was written beforehand after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew love, that cursed feeling. Rio experienced it. Her body got infected with it more than once. It was more of a disease than a feeling. Love was ugly. It was painful. There were times she wished she hadn’t had the ability to love so she wouldn't have to suffer because of it. Wouldn't have to deal with the sorrowful aftermath of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because she knew, if a thing went wrong, just a tiny little error in the enormous system, it would lead to a total collapse. It meant wreck and destruction. It meant suffering, and suffering is never good unless you're a tortured artist.
    </p>
    <p>
     She loved three times. Three women in three different, cursed periods of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of them was Alice, which was the only relationship Rio made peace with, because at the time she was young and
     <em>
      way
     </em>
     too oblivious of how fucked everything was. Including herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other two? Disasters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nightmares she wanted nothing but to run away from. To just wake up and escape them.
    </p>
    <p>
     One relationship that lasted nearly a year, but moving on? The process of getting rid of the feelings she had? They lasted longer. Way longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then years later, Jane appeared. Fucking Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
     A troubled woman Rio fell for because she was nothing but a pathetic, desperate fool. A woman that dragged her through every layer of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hate she had toward love feelings—she predominantly experienced with people. Other fellow human beings. Because plants and inanimate objects? The things she experienced solitude with? Those were the most appreciative and grateful. No matter how small and trivial they were. They never kissed goodbye, they kiss in their own ways and remain to give more than what they take.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio just kept looking at the picture in that way most of her life. To the point she didn't remember anything that had existed before it, because she always seemed to see it that way. Her eyes always gazed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     With ease and tenderness she turned the picture around. To its actual face. And revealed what it held. What it should always have been.
    </p>
    <p>
     A scenery of something real, something that always existed and was there. Not out of this world, not fiction. Yet it was arresting in its conspicuous, exquisite reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because apparently, Rio was only gazing at the back of a picture hanging on a plain wall. And she was too convinced that this was it, to the point she didn't question it any more. She just sat and stared forward. Trying so desperately to make sense of it even if it lacked any common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that's what you do when you limit yourself, isn't it? When you get exhausted and start trying to convince yourself with something nonsensical, that even you don't understand—just so you could sit down and stop thinking about it. Taking hold of the fallacious so you could rest. Then you realize that it only took a simple move. Just a shift to make it obvious for you. To make you really rest, body and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that’s what Agatha did. With a tender shift, she showed Rio that everything could change to the way she wanted. That feelings shouldn't always be overwhelming. Life wasn't always mournful and unfair. Healing shouldn't cost more than being hurt. And that her existence meant something. Her journey wasn't nothing even if she took a path that made her struggle, a path that forced her to think less of herself. Agatha showed her that she deserves to take, to be loved, to be embraced. And if something happened, if that day came, she wouldn't just float away to the void. Rio would be lost. Not as a number, but as a goddamn human being.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      And
     </em>
     love
     <em>
      .
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Just by existing, Agatha made Rio realize that she could love. Could say the words out loud, express them and act upon them. She made her realize that her ability to love is something to be cherished and not chained down. Something to be proud of. Something human. Something Agatha was ready and willing to take inside her, no matter how deep it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, maybe she found a container.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “Shit, I neglected them for so long.” Rio said as she ran a muddy hand through her hair perturbedly. Her other hand continued running in a dainty path through the discoloured leaves. She was looking at them for a long time, crouching in front of a pot, trying just to know what caused her dear plants to turn like this. Unable to figure out if it was because of improper watering—because she was busy and forgot to do so in the past few days—or if they were diseased.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Even though I really know absolutely nothing about plants… but it's gonna be okay, baby. Do you know what happened to them?” Agatha said with a soft tone in an attempt to calm Rio a bit. Her voice was so soft, landing on Rio’s ears like a sterling melody, causing her heart to flutter in her chest. She closed her eyes briefly and exhaled a deep breath, because yes, Agatha’s voice did
     <em>
      that much
     </em>
     to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes again as she moved her hands through the leaves of the other plant that was suffering the same discolorations. She felt regret creeping inside her, mixing with the anxiousness and frustration she was feeling with herself, because how did she forget to check on them for days?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a step toward her in the indoor garden and put her hand on Rio’s shoulder in reassurance, and Rio exhaled as she lifted her muddy hand to put above Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her with a slight pout. Looking at Agatha’s wide, soft eyes and staring straight at the heartwarming gleam they held inside. Her eyes drifted down to look at how Agatha’s bottom lip was between her teeth, slightly biting down on it while looking down at Rio, who was still crouching in front of a probably dying plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     And despite her frustration with herself, and how bad it hurt to look at the condition of her plants that she abandoned for a little too long, Rio smiled at her. An honest, soft smile that reached all the way up to her eyes. Because no matter how bad it was, looking at Agatha and that reassuring look in her eyes? That's all she needed to be reminded that everything will be fine. And by everything, it meant
     <em>
      everything.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scraped her hands off to get most of the soil off her fingers. “Well, this is a murder case,” she said as she clapped her hands on her thighs and took a last look at the leaves, scanning them with her eyes. Then she got up, facing Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked straight into Agatha’s eyes with a grin as she wiped her hands on the sides of her shirt, trying to get the rest of the soil off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it that bad?” Agatha asked as she leaned in and put both of her hands on Rio’s hips and pulled her closer. Moving her thumbs in soothing patterns on Rio’s hip bones while looking at her. Searching her face with her eyes for any sign of distress, because she knew how much Rio’s plants meant to her. Each one of them. Every flower, leaf, petiole, stem and root. Every pot and vase.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew gardening wasn't just a little part of Rio’s life. Not just a hobby she picked to spend her time with. She knew this place was Rio’s sanctuary. A sacred part not just in her house, but in her entire life. Agatha fathomed with contentment the love and warmth that bounced from Rio’s eyes and varnished her words, the delicateness in her voice whenever she brought up this topic. Whenever she decided to talk about this particular side of her life and personality. And she understood the time and tenacity Rio put in all of this, not to build, but to
     <em>
      grow
     </em>
     something. How she used this spot as a place to unleash all of the feelings she was able to feel but never knew how to contain. Things that were holding her captive. Agatha knew that this was one of the few containers Rio was able to find and to actually use. Something she grew by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inhaled deeply as she looked at the plants behind her once again, then she exhaled a warm breath as she turned around to look back at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, but… I can handle it. I think. I shouldn't have left them for so long. It's just the delicate ones. They're needy, and I didn't consider the change of the weather in here. It slipped out of my mind… also because I forgot to water them properly.” Rio said, as she ran her hand through her hair. Looking straight into Agatha’s eyes. Those beautiful eyes that were embracing her with their warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it because you were spending so much time at my place?” Agatha asked, with a hint of a pout on her lips as she squeezed Rio’s hips gently and pulled her even closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     , how adorable she looked like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled at her as she lifted one of her hands and tucked a stray strand of dark hair behind Agatha’s ear with the back of her hand, so she wouldn't smear her beautiful face with the soil that was still coating her fingers. Then she started brushing her knuckles softly against Agatha’s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, baby. I don't think so.” She smiled as her eyes drifted briefly to look down at Agatha’s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well yes, it was half the truth. Part of it was because she was spending so much time at Agatha’s. She was forgetting because she was sleeping and going to work from Agatha’s house, since it was closer to the university than her own. She was occupied most of the time with her—all day—and that was heavenly. She wasn't complaining, she didn't want it to stop at all. But Rio also knew the actual reason for why she wasn't checking that much on her plants. It has been months, and not just a few days. Even before meeting Agatha, way before that. She was just looking at the big green ones in front of her eyesight—the ones that didn't seem to be affected by her uncaring so far—and she forgot the small ones. The ones that were still trying to grow. The hiding, demanding, delicate ones that implored her caring hands and time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I think it is, baby.” Agatha said with a soft, knowing smile as she continued drawing patterns with her thumbs above the fabric of Rio’s brown shirt. “If it makes you feel any better… the two plants in my house… they look a bit like this one.” She said, glancing at the plants behind Rio for a good measure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled at the delivery. “I've been watering and taking care of yours. They're healing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh? I didn't know about that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You haven't noticed? The one in your studio was literally dying. That poor thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I noticed that one, I thought it was just how it was supposed to look. Recovering by itself or something. Like tomatoes,
     <em>
      maybe
     </em>
     ?” Agatha’s tone wasn't sure, and that made Rio smile because of how adorable the woman in front of her looked.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, how she loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like tomatoes?” Rio chuckled in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha met her gaze. “You know, they stitch themselves when their skin cracks. Something like that. I read it somewhere. It's phenomenal.” She said as she took both of Rio’s hands and put them on her hips. Not seeming to care about soiling her green tank top—Rio’s tank top. The one that she grabbed from Rio’s hold when she was about to put it on this morning. Agatha wore it herself so Rio wouldn't wear it and would remain shirtless, as if Rio didn't have any other clothes in her own house. But she did remain shirtless most of the day, because she liked the way Agatha kept looking at her for hours, until she put a shirt on after Alice video-called her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, they do. But it's a different deal. Most of my plants need time, and they demand care and patience. You know, just like when you meet someone new… another human being. It's the same. But plants are actually way more interesting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I see. They give things in return, don't they? They don't just take. Plants, I mean.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, exactly. And they give way more than what they take. So it's unfair to neglect them.” Rio said with a fond smile as their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm.” Agatha hummed softly, a smile planted on her lips as she slowly started swaying their bodies without a rhythm. Just moving their hips while staring into each other’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in and rested her head on Agatha’s chest. The movements of their bodies continued as she lifted her hands up and held Agatha’s back to pull her closer to her body. To hold onto her. To feel her warmth. To take her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     To listen to how her heart was beating, because that was the only rhythm Rio wanted to sway her body to while she was in Agatha’s hold. The sound of Agatha’s breaths. Her soft hum. Her heartbeat. The rising and falling of her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha embraced her back with warmth, with love, as she put her hand on the back of Rio’s head. Securing it in her hold. Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to her temple, then she started moving her fingers in Rio’s dark hair soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exhaled a warm breath on Agatha’s collarbones. Feeling her body relax in Agatha’s tight, loving embrace. Her tranquilizing scent filled her senses—the scent that she grew addicted to.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I used to garden a lot when I was a teenager. Even when I was a kid,” Rio broke the silence, her voice was low and calming. Feeling herself growing more and more content. All the tension in her muscles was nowhere to be felt. And the weight of her exhausting week was decreasing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But when I was a teenager, it was different. Gardening was part of the therapy plan and a big part of my life… it's the only thing that ever worked with me. It's just, so…
     <em>
      gratifying
     </em>
     , you know?” she resumed, as their bodies continued swaying to the melody of their steady breaths. “It makes me feel good, to just… do something. It isn't just my hands that are working but my whole body. And then… to see the result of it after trusting the process, after putting in so much time and care. It looks back at you, and you realize that nothing goes to a waste. Seeing a result of something you did with so much love and patience, and it stares back at you, embraces you back, but differently. In that thing’s own way. You know what I mean, or is it nonsense?” Rio said as she embraced Agatha tighter. Feeling the bones of Agatha’s shoulder blades in her hold. Brushing her fingers lightly on them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, baby. I downright know what you mean. I feel that way when I'm painting something. Especially the stuff that I don't display anywhere, because I do it for the sake of it. The sake of creating something and feeling it consumes you whole while doing it—and you consume it in return but in a different form. You know, like it's a process of giving and taking at the same time. And it really feels good. Like you said, it stares back at me and embraces me differently in its own way. It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     gratifying.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm.” Rio responded, her smile visible in her hum.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her head up and looked at Agatha with the same soft smile. The movements of their bodies stilled, and their hands on each other's bodies remained and tightened on their spots as their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in and brushed the tips of their noses briefly, feeling the warm, soft exhales of Agatha’s parted lips on her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then her mouth was on Agatha’s, taking her lips in a tender kiss. Agatha’s lips were plump and so addictive to kiss. It was addictive to feel the warmth and the softness of them against hers. Rio was tightly grabbing the fabric of Agatha’s tank top, clenching it in her fists as the kiss deepened. Her tongue slid inside fondly. Invited and welcomed. Tangling with Agatha’s with heat and desire. The taste of the peach Agatha ate earlier lingered—rich and sweet, mixing with the warmth and the taste of her mouth. Rio closed her eyes as she continued kissing her, her fingers never stopped their movements up and down Agatha’s shoulder blades. Agatha allowed her to take, as deep and tender as she wanted. She only followed the pace and depth Rio set and kissed her back in the same way. Tenderly and lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled her head back slightly, her eyes were half-lidded and gleaming. And so were Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     She ran her tongue on her own lips, tasting Agatha on them. Fucking sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their smiles mirrored.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Talking about your plants, who gave them to you?” Rio’s voice was low and quiet as she moved her hands all the way down from Agatha’s back, slowly, going lower, until her palms rested on Agatha’s hips once again. Holding her tightly, pulling her body closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The one in the studio, Lilia gave it to me even though she knew damn well I won't be able to keep it alive.” Agatha said with a timid smile, the unsteadiness of her breaths visible in her voice. “And the one in the living room…” Agatha paused for a second to lick her lips. She moved her thumb up to wipe the edge of her mouth and Rio whined involuntarily, feeling her eyes blink and her heart flutter in her chest like a bird fluttering its wings in excitement. Agatha smirked as she placed one of her hands on the back of Rio’s neck and gently pushed her head closer to her face. Their chests were flush against each other. “Well, the one in the living room, I bought it. And honestly? I still don't know why. I just wanted to use that vase, I guess. It fits though, doesn't it?” She resumed as she leaned her face closer, their hot breaths mingling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, it does.” Rio said with a smile as she leaned in and pressed another soft kiss to Agatha’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could pull back, Agatha tightened her hold and deepened the kiss. Her tongue slid inside Rio’s parted lips as she tilted her head slightly to the side. The kiss grew deeper in a second. More desperate and heated. And it escalated to be messier. Filthier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands were everywhere on Rio’s body—on her hips, her back, her shoulders, her neck, and they rested on the small of her back under her shirt. Agatha's fingers ran soothingly and deliberately on Rio's hot skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled back briefly, a string of warm, silky silva on their bottom lips connecting their mouths. And they looked into each other’s half-lidded, lustful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I love you.
     </em>
     ” Rio said with a low, aroused voice, meant only for Agatha’s ears. Her breaths were unsteady and her heartbeats were rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes fluttered, and she pulled Rio in for another short kiss. “
     <em>
      I love you too.
     </em>
     ” She said through a whisper, right on Rio’s mouth. Both the words and Agatha’s warm breaths vibrated on her parted lips and made Rio’s heart tighten in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd never get used to the way those words made her feel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her head back slightly, just an inch. She tilted her head to the side again and looked at Rio with hungry eyes—a look Rio knew all too well—and it immediately made her heart clench in her chest and caused her walls to clench around nothing. She swallowed hard as she looked at Agatha’s eyes scanning her face. Looking at every spot and feature, but mostly gazing at her mouth. Rio licked her lips to wet them, and Agatha smirked with a raised brow. Her lips were far from dry and her mouth was constantly watering, she was almost drooling for god's sake, but the way Agatha was intensely looking at her made her head stop functioning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rested one of her hands on the back of Rio’s neck again, moving her palm up and down the scorching skin, while her other hand remained under Rio’s shirt. Her fingers moved with delicate urgency on her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so beautiful, my love,” Agatha said as she slid half of her leg between Rio’s and she secured her weight with her holds. Agatha’s gaze was locked on Rio’s parted lips. The way they were pink and swollen. Devourable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stick your tongue out for me.” She whispered the command right on Rio's mouth. Causing a shiver to run down her spine, making her tremble in Agatha’s hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed down and obliged the next second. Sticking her tongue out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Good girl.
     </em>
     ” Agatha praised with a smirk, making Rio moan helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she leaned in and caught the tip of Rio’s tongue between her teeth. Biting vaguely on the fleshy organ but not pressing too much to hurt. Agatha hollowed her cheeks and grabbed Rio’s tongue between her lips and started sucking on it with her whole mouth. Thrusting Rio’s tongue in and out frantically. Fucking her mouth with it as one of her hands pressed on Rio’s back and the other slid down from her neck to hold her hip tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt the tip of her tongue hitting the warm walls of Agatha’s mouth with every thrust, and it was maddening how she was dripping down uncontrollably. Feeling the heat in her abdomen and between her thighs increasing. And she with desperation jerked her hips forward, trying to chase the ghost of a fraction. Signaling for Agatha to direct her thigh where she desirously needed that strong muscle to be. But Agatha didn't move her leg at all, she just kept it there and continued sucking. Filling their ears with an obscene symphony.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time Agatha leaned her face forward to suck in and take the whole length of Rio’s tongue inside her mouth, their swollen lips connected briefly and Rio felt her legs unable to hold her weight any longer. Her knees were buckling and her whole body was shaking, ready to collapse. The heat she was feeling in her stomach was burning. Wild and untamed. She was feeling how drenched she already was, but unable to even bring her thighs together. But Agatha’s tight holds on her body kept her standing on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s moans were swallowed down, the only audible sound was Agatha’s mouth taking her whole tongue in and out with vehemence. When Rio tried—with choking, lustful desperation—to move her tongue and tangle it with Agatha’s in the inch of space that was appearing between their faces with every suck, Agatha squeezed her hip firmly in warning, and Rio obeyed immediately. Just standing there with a shaking body, swallowed moans and a dripping cunt. Offering her tongue for Agatha to fuck and devour.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head to the side and took Rio’s mouth in a deep kiss again. Rio felt Agatha’s tongue everywhere inside her mouth and it made her unable to think of anything. Her desire for Agatha was fogging her head. She placed one of her hands on the back of Agatha’s head to push her head closer, and the other rested on the waistband of Agatha’s sweatpants, ready to slide down. Ready to claim. But Agatha stopped her hands in their tracks. She grabbed both of Rio’s wrists and guided her hands to rest on her hips instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me do it, love.” Agatha said as their eyes locked. Her words were hot on Rio’s parted, swollen lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded with a whimper into Agatha’s open mouth as she felt Agatha walking them backward in hurried steps. Pulling Rio’s body with her by the hips as their mouths connected in yet another, feverish kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pinned Rio on the nearest white wall, not planning on breaking the kiss anytime soon. She took both of Rio’s hands and ushered them to her shoulders so Rio could cling onto them. Then the next second, she lifted and bent up one of Rio’s legs, resting it around her waist while holding it with a tight grasp. Her fingers were digging in the tanned flesh of Rio’s exposed thigh, leaving marks that she would definitely appreciate the look of on her skin later.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed her hips forward as she pulled her head away. Both of them were panting, struggling to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked. Agatha’s face was flush, her pupils dark and blown widely with lust and yearning. And Rio was a mess.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Baby
     </em>
     … we have dinner in...” Rio paused to moan as she felt Agatha moving her hand on her heat from above her shorts. And she was certain Agatha was feeling the heat radiating from her. Sensing how soaked she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know. I'll make it quick.” She slid her fingers inside the hem of the black shorts and started feeling Rio’s cunt from above her underwear. Teasingly, drawing messy patterns and making Rio squirm against the wall. Her body was trembling, already begging for release.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Yes, oh fuck… we need to be ready…
     </em>
     <em>
      fuck, baby please.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have time, my love.” Agatha said as she continued teasing. Her thumb moved up and down her slit, pausing briefly when it reached her clit just to press or tap firmly on it—making Rio twitch in her place, unable to hold back her moans.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      We…
     </em>
     ” Rio swallowed, now feeling Agatha’s middle fingers holding the drenched crotch of her underwear, moving up and down against the fabric. Feeling the soft skin of the back of her digits right on her drenched lips. “
     <em>
      We don't—fuck me…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in to suck on her neck, right under her ear—the spot that she knew would make Rio go insane.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her knees on the verge of giving up, and her body almost slipped from Agatha’s hold, but Agatha was quick to tighten it and dig her short nails in the flesh of Rio’s thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have all the time we need, don't worry,” Agatha whispered right into her ear. “
     <em>
      I just want to feel you.
     </em>
     ” She grazed her earlobe then licked it with her warm tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes shut. Feeling electric waves flowing inside her body. Her chest was rising and falling heavily, and her heart was beating rapidly in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      You drive me fucking insane, I love you,
     </em>
     ” Rio said with a helpless, aroused grin. “
     <em>
      Take me, Agatha.
     </em>
     ” She heavily breathed out the words into the dark locks of Agatha's hair that were tickling her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although she couldn't see Agatha’s face, she knew she was smirking. Smug.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha made love to Rio in that indoor garden. Amongst the greenery, dragging out the most symphonic, sinful sounds from her throat. Pulling multiple, crashing orgasms out of her body while she was pinned against the wall or seated on that familiar wooden dresser. So on and so forth. What was supposed to be ‘
     <em>
      quick
     </em>
     ’ work, made them half an hour late for their dinner—double date—with Alice and Jennifer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got out of her car, and Rio kept looking at her as she walked across the vehicle to open the door for her. Acting like the gentlewoman that she is. Wearing that Burgundy suit with a white shirt tucked underneath her pants. The color on her made her blue eyes lighter but no less intense and craving. She looked intoxicating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened the passenger door for Rio and offered her hand for her to take. Their eyes locked as she pressed a gentle kiss to the back of Rio’s hand once it was in her warm hold. Their smiles matched in their softness and warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slid her hand under the leather jacket Rio was wearing—the jacket Agatha clung into while kissing Rio with fervency before they got out, not caring about ruining their perfectly applied lipstick. “
     <em>
      You should get a motorcycle.
     </em>
     ” Agatha said with half-lidded eyes and an amusing smirk on her swollen lips. And Rio actually found the suggestion appealing, which earned her a playful raising of eyebrows from Agatha as she grabbed her wrist and stepped out of Rio’s house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her waist under the leather as they entered the bar Alice had picked—the bar where they first laid eyes on each other. The bar where the stars aligned and fate had been rewritten. Where Rio approached first. When she drunkenly murmured, “
     <em>
      Gosh, you're gorgeous.
     </em>
     ” to the most gorgeous human being she had ever seen. Thanks to the alcohol that was in her system at the time, and for how fucking
     <em>
      intoxicating
     </em>
     Agatha looked. Sobering Rio up and knocking her out the next second. She looked so goddamn enthralling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whatever stories she tells you about me, don't believe them.” Rio said as they walked forward. Approaching Alice at the end of the booth, who stood up immediately with a bright smile on her face once she saw the couple. And her fianceé beside her stood as well while looking down at her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at Rio’s side profile with a smirk. “Should I not believe them because they really happened or not?” She asked as she slid her hand down from Rio's waist to hold her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled. “That's for you to find out, my love. But I warned her not to say anything stupid. Or to threaten you. She gets weirdly protective sometimes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello, stranger!” Alice greeted as she took Rio in a hug, causing their intertwined fingers to loosen and fall in the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello, Miss Harkness. Agatha.” Alice said as she took Agatha’s offered hand to shake, then she pulled her in a warm embrace. And that made Rio smile widely, feeling warmth coursing inside her body from looking at them. As if witnessing two of her worlds combine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, we're late. The traffic was insane.” Rio said with a grin while she embraced Jen. As if she couldn't believe her own lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha greeted Jen as well, then they sat down beside each other, facing the engaged couple.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was about to get up and bring them drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The usual, Rio. Right? And Agatha, what do I get you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Alice. “No, bring me an iced coke.” Alice raised her brow, but didn't say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took the wise decision she was taking for the past two weeks. She was determined to take the right path of this journey.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her with the softest look and smile ever as she put her hand on Rio’s leg, which started shaking nervously under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “An iced coke for me too. Thank you, Alice.” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You guys must be so fun at parties.” That caused Agatha to chuckle and Rio to smile an anxious smile at her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I just… I'm trying to quit drinking,” Rio admitted. The words somehow felt heavy as they left her throat. Almost choked her. Because she knew Alice. Alice was there with her almost her whole life, and she knew Rio like nobody else did. She saw her messy and wrecked and devastated. Alice knew and saw all the sides and looks of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice smiled fondly, that bright smile of hers, as she took Rio’s hand between hers. “God, I'm so fucking proud of you.” She said with sincerity. Then her eyes drifted to Agatha. “I'm adoring your affect already.” She said, her eyes glimmering from the bar lights above their heads and the warmth of the feelings rushing inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's all her, I did nothing.” Agatha met Alice’s gaze with a smile as she started moving her fingers soothingly on Rio’s thigh. “But thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat down with their drinks. The conversations flowed easily between all four of them, as their food arrived as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't nervous about Agatha meeting her friends—she knew they would get along. And good thing, Alice wasn't fan girling that much. She was just Rio’s best friend, sitting beside her fianceé and talking with Rio’s girlfriend, and not just Agatha Harkness the artist who they adored for her work. And Rio saw how much that meant to Agatha. In the way her eyes were softening and how her body relaxed beside her. Every time Agatha said something or engaged with the conversations, Rio felt her heart beating with so much love inside her chest. Seeing how perfectly Agatha fitted in her world, with ease. Like she'd always been there. And god, how Rio wished she had always been there, in her world. By her side. But now, she really had her. And it warmed her whole being to see Agatha laugh and be herself. With no restraints or heavy, overwhelming weights to hold her down. Rio hadn’t met Agatha’s friends yet, but she wondered inside her head if she'd easily fit there. The same way Agatha did. But she hoped for that. She hoped she would be a piece that would fit on her board.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, once, we played in front of a church—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, Alice. Shut up. Nobody wants to hear that story.” Rio said, raising her finger up for Alice to stop talking, although her smile was visible on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I actually want to hear that. Go on babe.” Jen said to her fianceé with a grin. Her eyes were lidded from the alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me too, if it involves a church and your dykey band.” Agatha joined as she looked at Rio with an anticipated smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Guys…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, Rio. Three against one. So… there was a church in the neighborhood…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck you, Alice.” Rio said with a grin as she picked her glass and sipped her coke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you, my dear friend. Let me talk. Anyway… the father was so fucking homophobic. Every Sunday he had some trash to throw at gay people—
     <em>
      us in particular
     </em>
     . Rio was so pissed off with him. She was like the raging dyke of the neighborhood, or something. Everybody knew her. But her aunt still forced her to go to church every two weeks. While my mother forced me every goddamn Sunday. Anyway, so Rio gathered us during the summer break before college. And she said, ‘
     <em>
      Do you guys want to change the world for gay people or not? Because you know what? Punk isn't dead.
     </em>
     ’ she was acting really serious about it. Pissed off with the whole thing. It was hilarious. But we agreed, because after all, we were just like her and she was our leader in a way. Dragging our asses with her everywhere. Anyway, Chris’s house was across the street, right in front of the church and we held most of our rehearsals in her parents garage.” Alice took a sip of her drink while eyeing Rio, who was trying to act nonchalant about it. But she was grinning, remembering the good old rebellious days.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We were awake and waiting for the father all morning. Once Rio spotted him, she hurried and struck the strings of her guitar and it was so fucking loud. She said with that tone of her: ‘
     <em>
      Hey father, you want to hear something cool?
     </em>
     ’ He just shook his head and clenched the cross around his neck and prayed. He was so dramatic. Rio immediately took her shirt off and remained topless…” Agatha gasped and chuckled immediately as she looked at Rio staring at Alice with a wide smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice, end of story. The credits are rolling. Stop.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “‘
     <em>
      This one's for you, Father!
     </em>
     ’ Rio yelled into the mic and started singing: ‘
     <em>
      I kissed your mom, and she tasted good. Shaking in my hold, she barely stood.
     </em>
     ’ and she kept repeating the same goddamn phrase over and over again. She was so off tone it was insane and we just went along with her. No idea what the fuck she was trying to prove. Or when she wrote the lyrics in the first place. And she kept going on even after the father got inside and closed the church door in our faces.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was trying to make a difference. He was so fucking homophobic, I hated him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Difference my ass, Rio. We were grounded and went to church three days a week for two weeks because of you. And it was our summer break!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, really loud. And so did Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio folded her hands on her chest. “He could suck my dick…” She said, and Agatha’s hand stilled on her thigh as she smirked. Rio swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should’ve really kissed his mom, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She was dead, wasn't she?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, she wasn't at the time. And she was kinda hot if you think about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fucking freak.” Alice grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squirmed in her place, feeling Agatha’s fingers moving faster on the fabric of her jeans. Moving lower to rest between her slightly parted thighs under the table. But she moved her hand away entirely after realizing Rio wasn't breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, “
     <em>
      Breathe for me, big boy.
     </em>
     ” She whispered into her ear. A whisper meant only for Rio. Then she pulled back to resume moving her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha’s face and that damn smirk on her lips. She was clenching her glass tightly in her hold, her knuckles turned white. And she did as she was told. Obediently breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You still have the photos, though.” Alice said, breaking the heated moment between the two. But the heat Rio was feeling inside only increased.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was a tape.” Rio cleared her throat as Agatha’s fingers slowed down in empathy for Rio’s messy state. “The tapes are with you.” she resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh yes. But I think Chris took it, no?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She stole it. Yes. And gave it to that fuckass.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes! I should definitely tell this story, oh my god, Rio!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice! No. For fuck’s sake. Enough with my embarrassing stories. Say something about you for example.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why? We're having fun. And they're my stories too, I was there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nope. That one is
     <em>
      specifically
     </em>
     mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, baby. I want to hear about you in your glorious days.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly, let us honor your punk self,” Jen added while looking at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were ganging up on her. So she just sighed in helplessness, giving Alice the cue to embarrass her once again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, that Chris. She was one of the band members, obviously. And the most annoying one. God, she was unbearable.” Rio nodded at that in agreement. “The three of us were in the same university freshman year, then Rio got transferred the next year. Anyway, there was that guy who was
     <em>
      way
     </em>
     too obsessed with Rio, from day one. He was a junior and kept running after her even after he saw us kissing. I think he believed he could change her to be heterosexual. That dude was really obsessed. So, that Chris. She was in love with him. Cool? Cool. So she decided to take some of our band tapes, especially the ones where Rio was shirtless or acting weird or something, and gave them to him to watch. Like, that girl was seriously troubled and she wanted him to hate Rio so bad. But that dude fell even harder. So once, we were talking on the phone, ready to meet on campus so we could go home at the end of the day. We were looking at each other, waving from a distance. Then he came up to Rio and kneeled in front of her. And in his hand was a bag filled with the tapes. Trying to give them back or something. He was literally proposing to her with her own types.” Alice paused to chuckle. Her eyes drifted to everyone in the booth surrounding her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “‘
     <em>
      Get up.
     </em>
     ’ Rio said to him, she was furious and I was fighting myself not to laugh. Hearing how pissed off she was while witnessing the iconic scene right in front of me. He stood on his feet immediately. And once he was up, Rio grabbed the bag and slapped him. I swear, to this day, I could hear the sound ringing in my ear. ‘
     <em>
      I'm a lesbian, Isaac. Keep your dick in your pants because I have my own.
     </em>
     ’ and then she just walked away from him. She traumatized the guy and I never saw him after that day ever again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Damn, Rio. You don't play,” Jen said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was I supposed to do? He was annoying.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For personal reasons, I
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     to see those tapes.” Agatha’s voice was low, almost a whisper. She definitely meant for the words to stay in her head, but they escaped her throat before she could catch them. Rio’s head snapped to look at her. Searching her face and the look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You haven't seen them yet? You definitely should, don't let Rio gatekeep them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “By the way, you guys are beautiful together,” Jen said, her eyes gleaming from the alcohol and drifting lazily between them both.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. You both are adorable.” Alice agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you.” Agatha thanked them and Rio smiled an honest smile in response. Still thinking about what Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let's make a toast. Shall we?” Alice said, raising her glass in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      To you two!
     </em>
     ” And the sound of their glasses clinking blended with their chuckles, filling the atmosphere between them and mixing with the noise of the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen excused herself to the restroom, and Alice followed her after half a minute. Giving Agatha and Rio that look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Solidarity
     </em>
     ,” She said, raising her fist in the air, causing them both to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her glass for a sip of her coke that was technically just melted ice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There she is,
     <em>
      my icon.
     </em>
     ” Agatha said with amusement in her voice. Brushing Rio’s cheek with the back of her hand and looking at her with loving eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Barely, I was just a repressed teenager.” Rio shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, from what I heard so far, you're an icon. And I really need to see those tapes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio met her gaze. “I didn't show them to you because… I thought they're embarrassing. I mean… teenager me stuff.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love all of you, Rio. That wasn't embarrassing, it was… sweet and wild. Someone who was strong enough to express themselves. I know why you think it's embarrassing…” She leaned in to press a kiss to Rio’s cheek. “But everything about you is beautiful. Your past and your present. I want it all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, feeling her heart clenching in her chest. She leaned in and took Agatha’s lips in a kiss. That's when Alice and Jen came back, both of them wiping the edges of their mouths with their fingers as they slid in the booth, facing them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They didn't pull back immediately, as if the whole world around them ceased to exist, not caring about it. And only when Alice wolf-whistled did they pull back.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both smiled, their faces flush red. Rio grabbed her glass and swirled the melting ice in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, Agatha. Are you planning on marrying her?” Alice asked accusingly while narrowing her eyes. A gaze meant only for Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio coughed immediately at the question, feeling as her heart dropped down in her stomach. Caught off guard. She put both of her palms on the table and stared at Alice in disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell, Alice?” Rio choked on her own words. And Agatha beside her didn't say anything. She was calm as if the question didn't stir her. She placed her hand on Rio’s back and moved her hand in slow movements along her spine as she looked at Alice with a soft smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? I'm asking the right questions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      We…
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We haven't talked about it, Alice. You know that. What the hell? This is not a right question.” Rio interrupted what Agatha was about to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled a deep, soft breath. Rio looked at her, noticing that Agatha probably had something else to say, but she cut her off. Rio straightened her posture and looked at Alice, giving her a stern look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like Rio said, we haven't really talked about that. It's a little early I think. It hasn't come up yet, we're taking short steps. I love her so much.
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     … she really means the world to me. And we're just trying to figure things out at the moment. We… actually, talked about going to Paris next month…” Agatha looked at Rio, asking her with a look if it was okay to talk. But Rio was still stunned by Alice’s question. And feeling heat increasing inside her from hearing how casually Agatha was talking, showing off her love. So she just gestured with her head slightly—not even a nod. Agatha smiled at her as she turned her gaze to Alice and Jen again. Her hand on Rio’s back never stopped moving soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We've known each other for a while now… there are things we need to talk about and yet to discover. To show each other. And I’m willing to do all of this with her, with
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     . I want her to see my world and I would leave the decisions for her to make. I want us to be part of each other’s everything. We're… not running. We're willing to walk the path together. And I want us to be ready for every step we're going to take and not to just… take it.” Agatha inhaled deeply. “I know what you mean with your question, Alice. I know how much you love her. And I know that you... know me. You know things about me… which yes, I'm definitely not proud of. But I want to make all the right decisions, because
     <em>
      I love Rio
     </em>
     .
     <em>
      I really do
     </em>
     . And if you… have something to tell me. I'm ready to listen and take it. No matter what it is. You've known Rio for a long time… and I know what you must feel. So when something like that comes up in the future—If we discuss it—I'm sure you'll be the first to know.” She finished, and for some reason the entire bar decided to go quiet around them.The four of them were looking at each other. Back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if something pulled her from her head and back on earth. Rio blinked several times. Then she leaned in, cutting off whatever Alice opened her mouth to say. “
     <em>
      I love you so much,
     </em>
     ” Rio said loudly. She cupped Agatha’s face and pulled her in, their mouths crashed in a kiss. Rio felt like it's the right thing to do. The
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     They pulled back before the kiss could deepen and turn into a bedroom-rated one. Agatha smiled softly onto Rio’s lips before pressing a soft peck on her upper lip and pulling her head back slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—I don't think I have anything to say. Or to add. You have my blessing. I just want you guys to be happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you, Alice. We appreciate it.” Agatha said, but Rio didn't seem to agree with that.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at Alice, annoyed. She folded her hands on her chest and wet her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you not to say anything stupid, didn't I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't yell at my wife,” Jen said as she grabbed Alice closer to her by the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's not your wife,
     <em>
      yet
     </em>
     .” Rio narrowed her eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     my wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A staring contest was about to be held before Alice decided to interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, baby, I totally get what you mean. But I'm your fianceé, for now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Talking about that, when are you guys gonna marry? Clearly, Jen can't wait to claim you as her wife.” Rio asked. Her tone changed entirely, as if she forgot what she was annoyed about a second ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Soon. Jen has some work to do out of the country in the meantime. So when she's done with all of her stressful work. Though… we talked about it a lot. So there won't be a wedding, you know. Just a small party for family and friends. Then the honeymoon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm really happy for you both.” Agatha smiled sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “See? She's technically my wife,” Jen cut through with a drunk chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There's no such thing as ‘
     <em>
      technically my wife.
     </em>
     ’”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, kids. Wrap it up.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They talked about more, different things here and there. Sharing stories charged with giggles and honest laughter. And their night came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
     They embraced each other with warmth. Each couple thanking the other for the night they had, appreciating their shared company. Their ways parted. Alice and Jen took a cab home since both of them were drunk, almost wasted, and they, with a tipsy smile, declined the ride home Agatha had offered them, deciding to go on their own after they wished each other a good night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio checked if they were safely seated in the back seat. She said her goodbyes once again, then turned to look at Agatha, who was already looking at her with a fond smile. Folding her arms on her chest. Her eyes were gleaming from the street lights, and the night breeze was gently playing with her dark hair. She looked so beautiful.
     <em>
      Ethereal
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled as she took a step toward Agatha and stood facing her.

    <p>
     Agatha extended both of her arms for Rio to hold, and Rio took her warm hands in hers, intertwining their fingers by their sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked. Agatha was slightly taller than her because of the heels she was wearing, causing her to look down at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are we spending the night, my love?” Agatha asked, leaning her face closer to Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, staring up at her beautiful, captivating blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're spending it between my arms. In my hold.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhmm. Sounds tempting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to her cheek, then she started walking them both to the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the passenger door for Rio to get in. And Rio found herself, once again, staring at Agatha walking across the car. Looking effortlessly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she got in, she leaned in and kissed the edge of Rio’s mouth. Then she fastened her belt and put her glasses on. Rio’s breath hitched at the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, baby, I don't want to crash us,” Agatha said with a chuckle as she started the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although it was teasing, something stirred inside Rio. Knowing this topic wasn't just a teasing thing for Agatha—It was much more—and it made her heart spike.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she half-got up from her seat. Her seatbelt was restraining her. She she leaned in closer. Although she was aiming for Agatha’s forehead, Rio pressed the kiss on the tip of Agatha’s nose since it was the only spot she could reach from her position.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she sat down after seeing the soft smile appearing on Agatha’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like Alice,” Agatha said as she drove them out of the parking lot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I like her too. But... she could be a lot sometimes. You know, she has been with me for a long time. So…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know. I'm not complaining. I'm ready to hear every story she has to tell.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, that's never good. She knows way too much. I'm not putting you guys in the same place again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed. The sound rich and so peaceful to hear. Landing on Rio's ears beautifully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Baby
     </em>
     ,” She put her hand on Rio’s thigh and started brushing her thumb gently above the fabric. “I love hearing everything about you. To know you all. I like being among people you love and they truly know you. I like existing… in your world.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted Agatha’s hand and held it briefly in her warm hold. “You're my world, Agatha.” Then she lifted it up, close to her lips, brushing Agatha’s soft fingers on her own lips. Then she kissed the back of it. Tenderly. Lovingly. More than once.
    </p>
    <p>
     They arrived at Rio’s place and they stepped inside after Agatha parked the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they were inside, Rio went straight to the kitchen to drink some water. Then Agatha followed her after a minute. Rio was drinking the bottle of water and nearly choked after seeing Agatha in her white shirt without the blazer—as if she wasn't the one who kissed Agatha's shoulders, smearing her skin with her red lipstick, then she put the blazer on Agatha’s shoulder before they got out a couple of hours ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Easy with that,” Agatha said with a smirk as she approached Rio who was standing near the fridge, half of her body leaned on the counter. She took the bottle from Rio’s hold and started drinking the rest of it while guiding Rio’s hand to rest on her hip. Then she lifted her own hand and teasingly started running her fingers on Rio’s wet lips. With light brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was dumbstruck, swallowing down really hard. Feeling Agatha’s fingers brushing on her lips while seeing her exposed throat popping as she gulped the water down. And suddenly she became aware of how her whole body was connected. How everything seemed to directly affect her cunt. Every little goddamn thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved the empty bottle away from her mouth and turned around to throw it in the trash can, then she looked back at Rio as she placed her hand on the back of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I had fun tonight.” Agatha admitted as she started brushing the small hairs on Rio’s neck. Her other hand slid under Rio’s jacket, holding her hip tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't say anything. She just kept looking up at Agatha’s face. Now Rio was back to being slightly taller than her after she took her heels off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      And you know what?
     </em>
     ” Agatha wondered, moving both of her thumbs on different spots of Rio’s body. Both of them making shivers run down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Hmm
     </em>
     ?” Rio weakly hummed in question. Feeling herself getting dizzy from looking at Agatha. Because fuck, she really looked dazing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think… I deserve sucking your dick more than that priest.” Agatha smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh fuck.
     </em>
     ” Rio heavily moaned out the words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you think?” Agatha asked, drawing patterns on Rio’s pulse point with her thumb. Weakening her completely. Making her knees shake in their place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. Of course. Yes.” The words stumbled on their way out of Rio's mouth. Causing Agatha to smirk even wider.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Hmm
     </em>
     ? I'll let you take me. How does that sound, my love?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like winning the fucking lottery.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a breathy chuckle as she leaned her face in and inhaled Rio’s neck deeply. Then she pressed a teasing kiss to Rio’s lips as her hand drifted lower from her hip, down to grab her butt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled back, her pupils were dark and blown widely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then go get ready for me. I want you to fuck me real good. Hmm? Can you do that for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Yes, I can.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Good boy.
     </em>
     ” Agatha praised as she leaned in to slightly bite Rio’s bottom lip, taking it between her teeth. Then she let go, making Rio a whimpering mess.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha landed a slap on her butt cheek, then immediately squeezed the flesh tightly with her whole hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go up stairs. I'll follow you in a minute.” She kissed Rio again.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio was technically running up the stairs as she took off her blazer on the way up. Hearing Agatha’s arousing chuckles behind her.
    </p>
