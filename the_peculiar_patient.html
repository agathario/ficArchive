<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio had always been good with people; listening to their problems, cheering them up when situations were dire, and being there whenever something happened. That's why she had always been popular, ever since high–school, and her popularity reached her everywhere she went — obtaining the nickname: '<em>The Therapist</em>'.</p><p>It was a silly epitome that her friends had given her — strangers even — but that described her perfectly; Rio couldn't deny that it made her feel important. Did her words really manage to get through people's hearts?</p><p>So, when college time came, Rio knew what major she would take; psychology. Her parents threw a fit over it — but she had already made up her own mind and wouldn't have changed it. Ever.</p><p>But Rio was keeping something hidden from her parents — she would've become a psychologist — but specialising in sex, meaning that she would've become a <em>sex therapist</em>.</p><p>Usually, it was a job like any other — a bit unsual — but Rio truly admired the mind of the man and particularly enjoyed learning about attraction, sexuality, and stuff of that sort.</p><p>She graduated; after a while, she had opened her own studio — it wasn't big, but not small, just something she could feel to be of her own. Satisfied with her achievement, she quickly started to get herself know — through friends, interviews, sponsors online, even her LinkedIn page.</p><p>And she had succeeded — in a few months, she had become notorious; Rio had already a couple of clients, and knew that more had yet to come. Time went by, one, two, three years, and she was completely in the business, known as one of the best (sex) therapists of town.</p><p>One day; she had received a text from a woman. It said that she wanted to schedule an appointment — that it was her first time — and that she wanted to come by in the late afternoon. Rio thought she had said that time because it wasn't busy and wouldn't have caught people's eyes (not that it was something scandalous, maybe she was shy).</p><p>And yet — Rio had agreed; her patients' comfort was her priority, and she knew how scary it could be. And didn't, wouldn't have judged.</p><p>Rio ended the session with a woman she had been taken under her care, noting down some important things she had said to her — that specific session had gone better than the last one, and progress was made.</p><p>"Alright, Wanda," she left the pen on her desk, "I'm happy of today's session; we are getting to a good point."</p><p>"Thank you," the woman, whose name was Wanda, was fidgeting with her dress; she appeared to be satisfied as well. "I can't even imagine going through this without you; I've talked to my husband, and he was so understanding! My sex life has gotten way <em>better</em> — all because of you!"</p><p>"Vision is collaborating wonderfully," Rio smiled at her, "I'm positive you'd like another session with me, you and him? Like last, we could talk and—"</p><p>"Oh, he was so embarrassed with the first!" Wanda giggled, and Rio felt a bit tense, "I think he's getting better; there's more communication, more times for ourselves, and everything is fine. But, thank you. We'll see each other next week?"</p><p>Rio nodded and walked Wanda towards the exit; they briefly exchanged mutual looks of understanding. Wanda had gone, and Rio had only one session left — the one with the woman she had asked, begged even, to not be seen by others.</p><p>She looked at the clock — half an hour, and she would've been there — so, Rio scrolled through her phone; Alice, her friend, had texted her.</p><p>'<em>Rio! Are you up for drinks tonight?</em>'</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>'<em>Yup. Just one patient left, and I can relax.</em>'</p><p>'<em>Do your best! We'll be at the 'Witch's Bar', thought you'd want to know.</em>'</p><p>Suddenly — Rio had heard a knock on the door; she lifted her gaze to the clock, only a couple of minutes had passed — could she be there? Already?</p><p>'<em>Gtg, see you.</em>'</p><p>Rio opened the door — and she stood there; a woman with fine yet mature lineaments and eyes of the lightest blue she had ever seen and probably thought they were fake. Examining further, she wore elegant clothes (many of her patients would visit her in their pyjamas, it was weird), thin make–up and hair smooth, silky, and of a deep black colour.</p><p>"I'm sorry," she spoke; her voice was neat, yet anxious, "I came here a little earlier — I was nearby, I hope it's not a problem."</p><p>Rio smiled — cursing herself for having watched the woman longer than she should've. "Oh, Ms. Harkness! No, it's not a problem at all! Please," she opened the door fully, "I insist, let's get started."</p><p>The woman entered, feeling in a place she didn't belong — Rio noticed and swore to herself that she'd make her comfortable. With a movement, she had told her to follow her, and she did — they reached the room of her studio. Once inside, Rio had made her seat on the couch while she took the armchair.</p><p>"So," Rio stared at her; she was tense, anxious, and stressed — but that was normal — she couldn't have said anything (or wanted to). "Let's start with the basis. My name's Rio, and yours?"</p><p>"You already know my name."</p><p>Rio blinked. It was true — she knew that, but it was her way of getting patients comfortable, a way to gain their trust. She smiled — perhaps she wasn't a common woman.</p><p>"I know," her voice was understanding, "I'd like to hear it from you — could be a start?"</p><p>The woman sighed, rolling her eyes. "<em>Agatha</em>."</p><p>Rio wrote the patient's name on her paper.</p><p>"So, Agatha," that was the hard part. "Why did you decide to be here today?"</p><p>Agatha was already embarrassed. "I—, I was told that I'm—," her eyes struggled to look at the brown ones, "I'm disappointing in bed."</p><p>"<em>Oh</em>," Rio didn't have to sound like she pitied her. She quickly composed herself — what was she doing anyway? "May I ask why?"</p><p>"My husband, Ralph," she bit her lip, "I was made aware that I, well—, can't seem to— you know— that."</p><p>Rio didn't understand, like at all. "What?"</p><p>"<em>Orgasms</em>. I don't do that with him. It's hard to— he just—"</p><p>Realisation had hit Rio's head — why hadn't she thought of that? She quickly scribbled down some notes.</p><p>'<em>Agatha can't seem to reach orgasms</em>.'</p><p>"I see," her gaze lifted, "I have a question; have you tried different positions?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Foreplay?"</p><p>"No," Agatha sighed. "He just puts his stick there, does that stupid movement of his, and calls it a day. Ralph says that foreplay is boring, useless."</p><p>Rio tried hard not to cringe at her words; soon, another couple of notes had been added.</p><p>'<em>Repetitive sex, no foreplay — may need suggestions on how to gain pleasure</em>.'</p><p>"And, have you told him that you'd like—"</p><p>"Look, Ms. Therapist," Agatha was serious, but also teasing, and that scared Rio (kinda), "I'm here because I need to be fixed; I can't keep on pretending, I have to please him."</p><p>"And can't he please you?"</p><p>Agatha shut her lips; Rio wrote some notes down.</p><p>'<em>Her husband is a fucking idiot</em>.'</p><p>"Agatha," Rio read through her notes, it was too soon to say something on the matter — needed more sessions, but felt incredibly bad. "Sex is <em>not</em> about pleasing your husband; you have to feel good too. You don't need to be fixed — you're not wrong, or broken. Just, there's a lack of communication. I'm here to help you talk to him."</p><p>"He doesn't listen."</p><p>"He has to," she felt irritated, but couldn't have her shown that, "I'm serious, Agatha. There's nothing wrong in talking — I can help you."</p><p>Rio watched Agatha fall into silence; it was her opportunity to write some notes, once again.</p><p>'<em>Agatha seems reluctant to speak with Ralph, she is scared</em>.'</p><p>"What are you <em>even</em> writing?"</p><p>She let go of the pen — no one of her patients had ever asked that; it came as a surprise, Agatha's distrust was noticeable.</p><p>"Notes," she explained, "I'm reviewing them once session's over; I won't share them, or anything. They just are helpful to me."</p><p>"Right. Have you already written how <em>pathetic</em> I am?"</p><p>Rio saddened at hearing that; how deep was Agatha hurt? How far did her trust issues go?</p><p>"No," she smiled, "I don't think you're pathetic; to seek help requires courage, even if I don't particularly agree with the idea of you being here to please your husband. But, this could be a journey of self–discovery?"</p><p>"Wow, you really are a <em>full</em> therapist. You sound so confident, annoying, and incredibly sure of yourself."</p><p>"Because I am," Rio's fingers lingered on the papers, "I believe in you; this is an opportunity for discovery. It's up to you."</p><p>Agatha lowered her gaze — her cockiness leaving her body. "I've already done enough self–discovery; it couldn't have gone any further."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Her eyes were distant. "When I was little — teenager — I had this friend; she and I shared a lot, so much that we ended up kissing each other. As time went by, we had sex, and after that," Agatha gulped a chunk of saliva, "I was forced to end things."</p><p>She was surpised. "May I know why?"</p><p>"My mother," she attempted a smile, "I mean, who would've wanted a <em>gay</em> daughter? That's ridiculous."</p><p>Rio felt an increasing sense of awareness reaching her; she wouldn't have replied to that — even if what she said was wrong — so, she just dismissed that thought and tried focusing on that moment.</p><p>"That experience made you doubt your sexuality?"</p><p>"<em>I'm not gay</em>, Ms. Therapist; I'm married, have a son and all."</p><p>Rio wrote something down.</p><p>'<em>Unresolved problems with her sexuality</em>.'</p><p>"Yes," she felt so awkward, "I'm not assuming anything; did it change something in you?"</p><p>Agatha pondered for a while. "It did. I've had fantasies about women — but they are just fantasies, completely normal. Problem is, sometimes <em>they appear</em> when I'm having sex with Ralph."</p><p>Oh, the closet was <em>so</em> thin — almost breakable. Rio shouldn't have said anything, because she had a hunch that Agatha knew, but was really stubborn about it.</p><p>"It <em>excite</em> you?"</p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat; anger boiling in her veins — she clenched her hands into fists, eyes severe. "How dare you to imply such things?"</p><p>Rio had messed up — she was obviously sensitive about it. "Agatha, it's just a question — they are just fantasies, everything's fine. Trust me."</p><p>"Yes," she finally admitted, her breath was short, "I think they excite me more than I'd like to admit."</p><p>Quickly, another note.</p><p>'<em>Agatha has doubts about her sexuality. Women excite her. <strike>More than men?</strike></em>'</p><p>"That's fine, completely fine—"</p><p>"Thinking about other women while <em>fucking</em> your husband? Which part of it seems fine?"</p><p>Rio couldn't help but smile. "It's fine that you admitted it; you're starting to trust me."</p><p>Agatha looked away — shying from the conversation, and Rio thought that it was adorable — wait? She shook her head. What was that thought?</p><p>"What can I do?"</p><p>"For starters; talk to him — tell him what you'd like to do in bed, what excites you, positions, the importance of foreplay," Rio explained and Agatha listened carefully, "I'm sure that, if he loves you, he'll listen and he'll try to be better."</p><p>"And if he doesn't?"</p><p>"If he doesn't — we can have him in the studio? We can do a session; you and him, and me."</p><p>"Are there any other options?"</p><p>Rio laughed; and she couldn't remember the last time she had let out a laugh with a patient — Agatha had a smile on her lips.</p><p>"I'm not forcing anything; it's up to you. But—, before we start working properly, I need you to talk to him — just an attempt. Next week, we'll discuss how it went."</p><p>Agatha stared at the clock; an hour had passed, and she didn't even realise it — how was Rio able to tell? As if she controlled time.</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>"Great!"</p><p>Her fingers made her write a note.</p><p>'<em>Agatha wants to collaborate.</em>'</p><p>Rio stood up from her chair, Agatha did the same; they started walking towards the exit of the studio.</p><p>"How can I pay you, by the way?"</p><p>The part that Rio hated. She always felt awkward to take people's money, but bills didn't pay itself.</p><p>"First session is free," she said, "I'm sure you have my contact. I'll send you the details there."</p><p>"What if I decide to <em>change</em> therapist? You won't get any money."</p><p>They stood before the door; Rio had never heard anything more funny — how could one even think of that? Ditching your therapist on your first day?</p><p>"That'll be fine. If you were to change therapist — I'd be more than happy to give you some names."</p><p>Agatha laughed, in a very soft and unique way; it was able to catch Rio's attention, the sound was harmonious — <em>a mermaid's call</em>.</p><p>"You're so weird, Ms. Therapist."</p><p>"<em>Rio</em>," she was able to look in her eyes; the shiny, light blue eyes of hers, "I know you know my name, it's Rio. Calling me 'Ms. Therapist' isn't a good way to establish a relationship. Don't you think?"</p><p>"Psychoanalysing me even after the session's over?"</p><p>"It means I really, <em>really</em> look forward to work with you, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha couldn't stand the smug on Rio's face — she was younger than her, yet, had more experience than any of her peers. She was impressed, satisfied even.</p><p>"Alright, Rio," her name, spoken so quietly, as if whispering a secret, and Rio wanted her to say that again, and again, and — "I'll be seeing you next week. Enjoy the week–end."</p><p>Rio waved at her; once she was gone — she walked towards her studio, sitting on the armchair. Picked up her notes and reviewed it, she tried to concentrate but the image of Agatha would appear in her mind — interrupting her thoughts.</p><p>"Rio, you're so <em>fucking</em> stupid," she scolded herself; of course, there wouldn't have been any feelings, if not the truest and deepest desire of helping Agatha. Even if she doubted she needed her help.</p><p>She was sure that Agatha wasn't attracted to men, or maybe she was? Why had she married Ralph? There were many things she needed to know — and had to know. But, for now, she would've rested, and relaxed at the bar. Agatha was her last patient — a drink was well deserved.</p><p>—</p><p>Hadn't it been for Alice; Rio would've drank almost a whole bottle of wine — Jen could've filmed the whole thing, but decided to respect her moment.</p><p>"Jeez— that work of yours is going to make you an alcoholic." Alice, who had managed to snatch the bottle off her hands, was now trying to not sound too annoying.</p><p>"Had a really long, and <em>weird</em> day. Give the bottle back."</p><p>"Nuh–huh," Jen had now the bottle, "Rio, what's up? You never drink this bad; and you're already drunk."</p><p>"I'm not!"</p><p>Alice was concerned. "Did something happened at work?"</p><p>"Can't tell you; I'm a professional, there's the privacy of my patient here," Rio sighed, "I just had a very weird encounter."</p><p>"Well, you talk about sex — I'm sure things <em>get</em> weird," Jen laughed, and Rio glared at her; a fight was about to start, and Alice quickly calmed them both down.</p><p>"Is the patient difficult?"</p><p>"Difficult? More '<em>sexually repressed</em>', said many things that made me mad — her closet made of glass."</p><p>Jen gasped. "A straight woman has <em>fallen</em> in love with another woman and has troubles figuring out how to tell her?"</p><p>"Jen," she smiled, "I've always admired how you can make all of those assumptions; and they turn out to be wrong, all the <em>damn</em> time."</p><p>Alice stepped in. "Now, now—, Rio will do her job, help her, as always."</p><p>'<em>As always</em>.'</p><p>That's right; she would've helped Agatha, as she usually did — nothing more, nothing less. Rio stared at her glass, almost empty, she sighed. Another week would've passed, and she wondered what Agatha would've done.</p>

<p>Quickly — <em>one week</em> had passed; Rio had already ended all of her sessions, all but one. She was curious and excited to hear developments from Agatha. Had she succeeded? Did she still need her help?</p><p>So, when Agatha's turn arrived, as they sat on comfortable seats — Rio looked at her, completely eager to wait for her to speak. She didn't say a word, and a couple of minutes had passed.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>"It <em>didn't</em> work."</p><p>Rio's eyes studied her expression; sadness, guilt, and a sense of worry, in her icy eyes. What had happened? She had high hopes for her.</p><p>"Tell me about it."</p><p>"We talked," Agatha spoke, "I told him about his repetitiveness — his lack of communication, and well—," there was a sickening smile, mixed to nervousness, "Ralph said he doesn't think that 'all of that stuff' is necessary. He gets the job done — he's been stressed at work; that's why."</p><p>Rio was perplexed; she couldn't believe her own ears. '<em>Getting the job done</em>?' As if Agatha was some sorta of toy, with no desires or feelings.</p><p>"That's not good," she was caught off guard, "I—, do you wish to do a session with him?"</p><p>"I spoke with him about this; he says that he <em>doesn't</em> need fixing, I do."</p><p>She couldn't have shown her how surprised, disgusted she was. "Agatha, you don't—"</p><p>"—'I don't need fixing', yes, you told me that, but," Agatha was unreadable, she, who was a therapist, couldn't understand her, "I'm starting to think that I do; that there's something wrong with me."</p><p>The roots of her problem were crystal clear to Rio; her sexuality, or lack of attraction towards Ralph. Either way, she had to deepen that matter — to explore, help her.</p><p>"Agatha," her voice was serious, but also caring, "I've avoided mentioning this to you, but it's now something we must discuss; are you attracted to Ralph?"</p><p>"Well, I have to be."</p><p>"Have you considered that, maybe, he isn't what you're looking for? You could have different preferences?"</p><p>Agatha didn't understand — or pretended to not understand. "Where are you getting at?"</p><p>"I'm saying," Rio gazed at her notes, "<em>unresolved problems with her sexuality</em>," that was what caught her eyes. It was meant to be. "Have you ever thought you might be interested in women?"</p><p>There was no reply — and Rio may have gone overboard.</p><p>"Because you see, Agatha," she stared at her notes, once more, "I will give you my humble opinion; lack of attraction, your fantasies, your past experience with your friend, you not orgasming — which is also because he doesn't give you stimuli —, there's something deeper than satisfying your husband."</p><p>"You don't know a <em>shit</em> about me."</p><p>Rio flinched at the sudden usage of that word; it was true — she really was just a stranger, but also her patient. It was her job.</p><p>"Agatha, it's okay — your sexuality doesn't define you or change anything."</p><p>"I can't be a <em>fucking</em> faggot!"</p><p>Rio saddened at hearing that; brown eyes meeting the icy ones — what had she gone through to repress so much of her being? Whatever reason was, she had to face the truth.</p><p>"Agatha, we live in modern times, the Queer Community has made progress. I know it can be confusing, especially while you're married with a man, and it's eating you alive—"</p><p>"You're one of <em>them</em>, right?"</p><p>'<em>One of them</em>'? Rio wished to not understand what she meant — her sexuality was nothing of her concern and wouldn't have helped her in any way.</p><p>"These matters don't concern you, Agatha."</p><p>"<em>Fuck it,</em>" she quickly stood up from the couch, "I had a fucking hunch; it was weird, how could I possibly have a therapist that happens to be a fa—"</p><p>"Agatha," she also stood up, "I want to help you, I really do. But, if you have nothing to say but insults to me — then, I'm sorry, I can't and don't want to work with you."</p><p>"Fine," Agatha walked towards the door, "I'm so glad! Who knows what you <em>would've</em> done to me?!"</p><p>Rio sighed. "I'll send you some names of my coworkers," she looked at her notes, "I hope they'll be able to help you."</p><p>"Oh, they sure will. I love Ralph, and he <em>loves</em> me! Your mind tricks won't work on me."</p><p>And then — she disappeared from the studio; Rio fell on the couch, she felt bad, that reaction definitely hid an indescribable amount of pain — a pain Rio failed to understand. Her heart ached.</p><p>—</p><p>The day was about to end; Rio was at the bar with Jen and Alice. They were worried about her — she hadn't said a thing, not even after thousands of questions.</p><p>Soon — Rio received a text; it was from Agatha. Probably, she had received the names of other therapists — she sighed. Rio was about to open the chat, wondering what her reply could be.</p><p>"Rio, who's texting you?"</p><p>"No one; I sent some contacts to my ex patient. She's probably thanking me," Rio thought of her words, a 'thank you' was incredibly out of character. "<em>Probably</em>."</p><p>Jen lit up. "Is that the straight patient that loves another woman?"</p><p>"She called me a slur."</p><p>Alice was speechless, she looked at Jen, then at Rio; she demanded an explanation — and pretended one, the least she could do.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"She's not under my care anymore; I pushed some buttons — she got really mad — and now, she doesn't want to work with me."</p><p>"Oh," Alice was incredulous, "I mean; did she have to say slurs?"</p><p>"Well, we were talking about her sexuality; I told you, she's really repressed."</p><p>"I see, well, hurry up and answer! <em>Hell</em> to that bitch!" Jen laughed, Rio didn't.</p><p>Rio opened the chat.</p><p>'<em>I know you're not my therapist anymore. But, can I talk to you? — It'll take a few minutes. I swear</em>.'</p><p>Quickly, she texted back.</p><p>'<em>Now</em>?'</p><p>'<em>I'm at the local park. I hope it's not too late</em>.'</p><p>Rio had never thought of agreeing to that request — but she did, and she had told Agatha to wait there; she stood up from the chair, looking at her friends.</p><p>"I have to go."</p><p>"What, why?"</p><p>"Sorry—, uh," nothing came in her mind, "I have to."</p><p>With hasty steps, she left the bar — and ran towards the park; she didn't have a plan, or wasn't sure of what Agatha would've said, but the opportunity to let her explain made her feel weird.</p><p>—</p><p>She had arrived at the park, and Agatha was there — she looked anxious; as if she was about to throw up, which didn't suit her. Rio got closer, and, once near her — she sighed.</p><p>"Agatha, what is it?"</p><p>Agatha lifted her gaze; her eyes were teary. Had she been crying? Probably yes, Rio felt a sudden sadness, but she shouldn't have cared.</p><p>After minutes of silence — as she had not heard a word from her — Rio started to feel annoyed.</p><p>"If this is over, I'll go—"</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, Rio was surprised.</p><p>"<em>What</em>?"</p>

<p>"I said, I'm sorry."</p><p>Rio blinked — more times than she should've. "I heard you, I just—"</p><p>"Look," she preceeded her, "I feel bad for what I did, I shouldn't have lashed out. And, you know, saying those stuffs."</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes; she really wasn't that angry — she had heard worse insults — there was a feeling of impotence, not being able to help her properly. Agatha was in denial, and she pretty much knew it.</p><p>"Apology accepted," she stepped back, thinking already of a way to get back to the bar, "I have to go now; best of luck."</p><p>As she was about to go, Agatha grabbed her by the wrist — the grip was strong, but Rio could feel that she was shaking. Maybe she shouldn't have underestimated that moment — but she wasn't her therapist anymore.</p><p>"You don't sound sincere."</p><p>Rio turned around, quickly gazing at her hand, then eyes. "What do you <em>even</em> want from me?"</p><p>"I want to be better."</p><p>"Have you already checked some of the infos I gave you?"</p><p>Agatha nodded. "I did, I found a therapist — her name's Hela. She scheduled an appointment for tomorrow."</p><p>'<em>Hela</em>', she hadn't heard that name in a while. She was one of the best — probably, even better than Rio. It was the right choice; also, because Hela was incredibly determined and rarely let people down.</p><p>"Oh, she's very good."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah," Rio stood there, feeling embarrassed, "I'm sure she'll help you."</p><p>Agatha let go of her wrist; there was another defeating silence, and Rio could've said something — anything. She stared at her, noticing how her eyes shined, even with slim lights.</p><p>"I just—, I haven't said the whole truth to you."</p><p>Rio didn't have to be informed; but, a deep and selfish part of her wished to know what she meant — should she have pushed her, or simply let it go?</p><p>"I mean," Agatha continued, "I've kept hidden that he is cheating on me. It happened <em>several</em> times, that's why I wanted to change."</p><p>Oh God; her trauma was deeper than she had originally thought — her unsatisfied life, with someone she didn't love, who was also cheating on her?</p><p>"He's actually so stupid. How could one cheat on you?"</p><p>The look in Agatha's eyes was strange — only by then, Rio realised what she had said; she had to clarify, desperately so.</p><p>But Agatha laughed. "He is. He's so <em>fucking</em> stupid."</p><p>Rio giggled — what was even going on? Were they getting closer, using Agatha's husband? After many exchanges of jokes on Ralph, some bad, others good, Agatha stared at her. Again, with an enigmatic look.</p><p>"I really am sorry for calling you—," she sighed, "I mean, you know."</p><p>"Oh, no offence taken; I've heard worse insults."</p><p>Agatha gasped. "So, you <em>really</em> are gay—?"</p><p>"<em>Lesbian</em>, actually," she explained, as she enjoyed the surpised in her gaze, "I guess—, 'gay' is fine; but, using lesbian is better. Sometimes, people are scared of that word — as if it's something forbidden."</p><p>There was curiosity in her blue eyes; she wanted to ask more — but, something was holding her back — Rio knew it, and didn't want to make her uncomfortable.</p><p>"Is it hard? Being—, uh, lesbian?"</p><p>"No," a smile appeared on her lips, "I swear, it doesn't change anything; sure, there are annoying situationships — sometimes, even—," Rio stopped, why was she telling her this? "Anyway, it's not too bad."</p><p>"How do you deal with people's opinions?"</p><p>Was Agatha trying to get information out of her?</p><p>"I usually ignore them," she tried to remember, "I, sometimes, kick their asses."</p><p>Agatha was incredulous to have heard that — she couldn't be serious, but her eyes were telling her otherwise. "You're weird."</p><p>"I know, you told me that already."</p><p>"How did your parents react?"</p><p>Rio smiled — Agatha was like a kid, who was curious of every little thing, asking questions and seeming to never stop. "I'm sorry; I really have to go."</p><p>"Oh," she looked sad, "I guess, this is the last time we'll see each other?"</p><p>She pondered; Agatha wasn't her patient anymore, but under Hela's care, meaning that she couldn't — or <em>shouldn't</em> — known about how her therapy would've gone. Rio was intrigued by her, curious even — maybe a little friendship wouldn't have hurt? It was not very recommended to be friends, but Agatha seemed to need one so badly.</p><p>"Well. Do you want it to be the last time?"</p><p>"You're not my therapist anymore; we shouldn't—?"</p><p>"We can hang out, as friends?"</p><p>Agatha looked away. "But, I was horrible to you."</p><p>"Yeah," she laughed, "I think it'd be the start of a great friendship; only, if you want to."</p><p>"I do want to."</p><p>Rio had never felt embarrassed; but, she couldn't help but blush, tenderly and shyly — there was a sudden moment of awkwardness.</p><p>"Alright," her smile had grown, "I'll, uh, text you?"</p><p>"Text me."</p><p>"Will do," Rio stepped back, walking towards the exit. "Good night, Agatha."</p><p>She didn't know why, how — but something shifted in her; suddenly, Agatha didn't seem so bad.</p><p>—</p><p>'<em>Just to let you know, this is my business number — I'm sending you my personal one</em>.'</p><p>Rio had really texted her — and she felt so awkward about it; her apartment was empty, and she was attempting to cook something.</p><p>Maybe, starting a friendship with Agatha was wrong; she had never done that before or felt the need to befriend someone — she was really sad for her, but didn't pity her.</p><p>Soon, Agatha texted her to the new number.</p><p>'<em>A second number? Are you sure you're a therapist? Reminds me more of a super–hero</em>.'</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>'<em>I kinda am? I save people's sex lives</em>!'</p><p>'<em>The hero we needed...</em>'</p><p>Again, another laugh escaped from her. Why was Agatha actually funny? She didn't even realise it, but she hadn't turned off the fire of the kitchen — the food burnt, but Rio didn't mind — she felt at ease (the poor food).</p><p>'<em>Right??? Anyway, I'm trying to cook something. So, I should focus. I'll text you when I'm done</em>.'</p><p>'<em>Don't burn the whole kitchen down</em>.'</p><p>But that had already happened.</p>

<p>Rio and Agatha texted for weeks — the conversations were smooth, funny, and incredibly entertaining. But, sometimes, Rio would feel bad about her situation; a closeted lesbian and with a cheating husband.</p><p>She wasn't supposed to step in and wouldn't have done it.</p><p>"Rio, I haven't been honest with you. There's something I've avoided mentioning."</p><p>Rio looked at Wanda; the session had recently started, and Wanda had arrived on time — she looked nervous since she had stepped in the studio. There had been times when anxiety took the best on her, but that time seemed different.</p><p>"Wanda. If you feel comfortable sharing with me — go ahead."</p><p>Wanda sighed. She was distressed. "I know that I've told you that I'm <em>bisexual</em>, right?"</p><p>Rio nodded. "Correct."</p><p>"I actually don't know if I should say this — it's really, uh, not really sex–related?"</p><p>"Wanda," she had a comforting smile on her lips, putting the pen down and eyes of a docile look, "I don't always talk about sex; I talk about feelings, emotions — I'm still a therapist, I just <em>specialised</em> in sex."</p><p>The red–head smiled — feeling embarrassed to have made–up a stereotype on Rio's job; she felt calmer and safer.</p><p>"I'll tell you," Wanda breathed. "When I was a teenager — I had this friend of mine. She was really amazing, and we were a couple for a while. Things were great — kissing, holding hands, and even sex! But we kept our relationship hidden."</p><p>Rio started to scribble down. "May I know her name? So it'd be easier to follow the story. You can even invent a fake name, I don't mind."</p><p>"Oh," Wanda brightened up, "I haven't said that name in a while; it's <em>Agatha</em>."</p><p>Her fingers stopped writing; it must've been another Agatha, right? But, the story she was telling, with so many details, matched Agatha's (short) version of her story. So, the friend she was talking about — was actually Wanda? How did things escalate this quickly? She took a deep breath.</p><p>"Go on."</p><p>"She and I were happy for a while — but that happiness wasn't meant to last; her mother found out, and," her eyes widened, her breathing became faster, "I'm sorry, can I stop for a while?"</p><p>Rio was worried. Rarely, she saw Wanda in that condition. "Of course. Actually — you don't have to say more if you don't feel ready."</p><p>A couple of minutes went on; Wanda seemed to have calmed down, and Rio was glad of that — another rounds of minutes, and soon, she began speaking again.</p><p>"You may be wondering: 'Wanda, why are you saying all of these stuff?', 'Wanda, this is not sex–related'. It's just — she played a huge part in me finding out I was bisexual, and I recently saw her. It brought me back some memories I thought I'd forgotten."</p><p>There was a reassuring smile on the therapist's lips. "Wanda, I'm not here to judge you, but to help you. Clearly, Agatha had a huge influence on you, and was someone important; you loved her, it's not a bad thing. If you wish to speak about it — we can."</p><p>"No, I—, I've heard that she found a husband, has a son," Wanda attempted a smile, "I guess, she followed her mother's advice."</p><p>Rio had to press in. "How does that make you feel?"</p><p>"Me?" Wanda had an absent gaze, as if a lifeless body was in the studio, "I think she's acting; I know her, and she does not like men."</p><p>"Have you tried to contact her?"</p><p>Wanda sighed. "No. I—, I was told not to."</p><p>The clock had made a weird sound; Rio looked at it — an hour had passed, the session's over. She looked back at Wanda, who was disappointed but also relieved for it to be over.</p><p>"Wanda, if you want — we can discuss this next session.'</p><p>"No, I don't want to," Wanda stood up, "I shouldn't even have brought up the topic; let's focus on me and Vision, okay?"</p><p>Rio had agreed. Wanda left the studio — and Rio's thoughts were messier than before. What to do now? What about her professional relationship with Wanda? It was confusing — a decision had to be taken — but Agatha was just a friend, and they didn't talk to each other anymore; she had to think about it.</p><p>Without any notice, she received a text from Agatha.</p><p>'<em>Ms. Therapist, I was wondering if we could get drinks this evening?</em>'</p><p>'<em>Sure. Let's meet at the 'Witch's Bar', around 7 PM?</em>'</p><p>Agatha agreed — Rio felt nervous.</p><p>—</p><p>The time came; Rio arrived at the bar, and Agatha stood at the entrance, waiting. They greeted each other — had entered, taking a seat. The atmosphere was weird, suffocating almost.</p><p>"So," Rio had no idea on what she was doing, "I, uh, how was your day?"</p><p>"<em>That's it</em>? Asking me about my day? I thought you therapists had better questions — outside work," Agatha teased, smiling even; Rio was surprised, as she understood she wasn't a fan of small–talks.</p><p>"How do you think our government will handle the economic crisis?"</p><p>"Oh God, not that."</p><p>Rio laughed — snorting even; Agatha stared at her, a warm smile on her reddish lips. She had seen her laugh, but not like that — it was new and sincere.</p><p>"Alright, alright," the laughs ceased, "I'm sure you started with your new therapist. How's it going?"</p><p>"She's weird, but she seems very determined to help; I'm just — I don't know."</p><p>"Yeah, she can be really weird," Rio shouldn't have spoken like that of her — but couldn't help it — Agatha wouldn't have pried on the matter.</p><p>"Oh? You seem to know her well."</p><p>She had <em>pried</em> on the matter.</p><p>"Yeah. We have history together."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. "What kind?"</p><p>"Secret."</p><p>She crossed her arms; unsatisfied by her response — Agatha knew that there was something else, and if Rio didn't want to tell her, she would've guessed on her own.</p><p>"Was she your, uh—, <em>partner</em>?"</p><p>Rio smiled at the word 'partner', it was obvious that Agatha was avoiding using 'girlfriend' — Rio wouldn't have indulged in.</p><p>"Who knows."</p><p>"You suck at lying."</p><p>After a while; a waiter had come to get the orders — Rio ordered a beer of a brand unknown to the other woman, and Agatha ordered a glass of wine. Once the orders were written — Agatha's eyes were once on Rio.</p><p>"I was wondering; how's the <em>sex</em> life between two sex therapists? I bet it's full of weird fetishes, kinks, and so, so much unspeakable stuff."</p><p>Rio couldn't have said anything; she didn't want to confirm that she and Hela had been a thing — but she also did want to answer that question.</p><p>"If I were to date another sex therapist, <em>which I didn't</em>, I'd say the sex is great."</p><p>"Just great?"</p><p>"Do I have to be more explicit?"</p><p>Agatha laughed. "If you want."</p><p>How did they even get on that topic? Agatha seemed curious and interested — they were friends, and friends usually talked about that stuff; so, she would've improvised — without mentioning the stuff she did with Hela.</p><p>"I, uh," she felt a sudden embarrassment, "I really don't know what to say; it was very—," Rio noticed her icy eyes, how they were telling her to say more, "I don't think it's <em>appropriate</em> to discuss these things. She is your therapist."</p><p>"What? But you said you <em>weren't</em> dating."</p><p>Rio had managed to fall for Agatha's trap; when had she ever fell for someone's words? Even more — a trap. Her brown eyes brightened up, and she gazed at the smile on her lips.</p><p>Luckily, the drinks arrived, so Rio's opportunity to drop that conversation; she wouldn't have answered that — and it was probably better that way.</p><p>Agatha took a sip, beaming up. "This wine is really good."</p><p>"Never been a fan of wine," she stared at the red liquid; a colour so intense — it caught Rio's attention, "I'm more of a beer girl."</p><p>With a quick movement, Agatha lengthened the glass — she smiled, stared at Rio. "Come on, try it. You might like it."</p><p>Rio smiled; she went to pick the glass, her fingertips brushed against Agatha's ones — the skin was soft — the glass was held.</p><p>Agatha's hand was still — she felt the touch of Rio, knew that it was by mistake, but couldn't help but think of those instants. Her eyes lingered on her fingers, she felt a sudden shyness — Rio, on the other hand, didn't seem to have noticed the reaction of the woman in front of her.</p><p>"You're right," Rio giggled, "I don't think it's that bad!"</p><p>Agatha didn't reply — wanted to, but failed to.</p><p>"Is everything fine, Agatha?"</p><p>She snapped out of it. "Yes, I–, I feel a little tired."</p><p>Rio let go of the glass; she didn't want to insist, so — <em>for now</em> — she had to pretend that Agatha was really fine.</p><p>—</p><p>After the drinks — Rio had told Agatha to go home; they stood outside of the bar, saying each other's goodbye.</p><p>"How will you get home?" Agatha asked, her fingers played with some keys — probably of her car — as if fluanting them.</p><p>"Taxi? If I'm lucky bus."</p><p>Agatha sighed. "Fine, I'll lend you a ride at home."</p><p>"What? No, you can't."</p><p>"I can," Agatha insisted, looking at Rio — she knew that taxis were expensive, buses never arrived; Rio probably knew that too. "And I <em>will</em> give you a ride home."</p><p>"Oh? Psychology tricks on me don't work," Rio smiled, her words managed to get through her heart. "But sure, can't waste your few moments of kindness."</p><p>Agatha laughed as she led the way to her car; one arrived, Rio stopped, immediately — her lips parted, surprised.</p><p>"You own a <em>Cinquecento</em>?!"</p><p>"Uh, a what?"</p><p>Rio ran to the car — gazing at it, longer than she should've; Agatha started to worry.</p><p>"No way," she touched the car, "I'm so jealous — these cars are so cute."</p><p>"It's just a car."</p><p>Agatha found her adorable and detested the idea of it; that side of Rio, who she had been hiding, was actually not that bad — underneath that mask of seriousness, there was someone she didn't mind spend time with.</p><p>"Oh, you <em>poor</em> ignorant soul."</p><p>Never mind; Rio was annoying. "Watch it."</p><p>"Come on," she opened the passenger's seat, getting inside, "I want to see how fast this baby goes!"</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "It can't go that fast, and I drive responsibly — unlike you."</p><p>"How boring."</p><p>"Actually, you can take the bus, or a taxi," she tried to get Rio out of the car; the other one laughed — as she tried to stop her from kicking her out.</p><p>"I was kidding! Let's just go!"</p><p>And, she followed her words; Agatha got in the car, positioned the keys — the engine started, Rio was so happy, Agatha too, even if driving exhausted her.</p><p>The car started moving; and, as expected, it was slow, but Rio didn't complain. Soon, she noticed a radio — an idea crossing her mind.</p><p>"Where do you live?"</p><p>"Oh, 'Salem's Street, 6'," Rio's eyes went back to the radio. "Can I turn on the radio?"</p><p>"Do you need my permission?"</p><p>"Yes? Is it your car? Or did you steal—"</p><p>Agatha glared at her. "Do as you please."</p><p>Rio had turned the radio on; and, suddenly, she had heard a familiar melody — a song she so much like and never got tired it.</p><p>"Oh God!" Her eyes widened, "Chappell Roan! 'Good luck, babe!"</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>Her hands were shaking — excitement having the best on her. "It's a famous singer, one of my favourite of the moment. I didn't know this song could reach the radio!"</p><p>Agatha listened to the song — the rhythm was good, upbeat, and original. Was that the reason why Rio liked it so much?</p><p>"What's the song about?"</p><p>Rio smiled, then, she remembered, and her smile turned upside down. The song described Agatha's situation — maybe not the best choice — and she didn't want to anger her. So, she could've sacrificed that moment.</p><p>"Uh, we can change station—"</p><p>"What? No, it's catchy. This Chaperone—"</p><p>"<em>Chappell Roan</em>."</p><p>Her palms were sweaty; begging some high being to not make Agatha understand the lyrics — so, she sighed, praying hard.</p><p>♪ <em>When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night</em> ♫</p><p>Rio knew she messed up — her eyes were still on Agatha; studying her expressions, but it was hard to understand — as if she had never seen a face like that.</p><p>♪ <em>With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife</em> ♫</p><p>She could've swore to have seen a twitch in Agatha's face — the song went on.</p><p>♪ <em>And when you think about me, all of those years ago</em> ♫</p><p>Agatha's grip had tightened; Rio had noticed, and she had to say something — anything.</p><p>♪ <em>You're standing face to face with "I told you so"</em> ♫</p><p>Rio had turned off the radio; Agatha stared at her.</p><p>"Why did you—"</p><p>"We're here — 'Salem's Street', I stopped right on time, you were about to drive further."</p><p>"Oh," Agatha removed her hands from the handler, her eyes still on Rio — she probably knew what was going on; she wasn't stupid. "Right."</p><p>"Yeah," Rio got out of the car, "I have to thank you for the ride — it's getting col—"</p><p>"The song," her voice was serious, "I—, was it about girls? One marrying a man? Even if she didn't like him?"</p><p>Rio couldn't lie. "<em>Yes</em>."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A few days after Agatha and Rio hang–out; the duo still held cordial conversations over the phone — but it was obvious something had changed — Agatha was <em>different</em>.</p><p>So, she sat on the couch of her new therapist's studio; Agatha was nervous — it was her second, no, third session? She didn't really hold the count — her therapist, Hela, sat in front of her.</p><p>"So, Agatha," she smiled, "I was hoping you'd tell me more about Ralph. We've seen each other a few times; but I never managed to have a better understanding of your situation," Hela's eyes were soft, "I remember you telling me that — with your previous therapist — you tried to talk about your desire to please him."</p><p>Agatha sighed. "My ex therapist," suddenly she remembered what Rio had told her — about them being a thing. "<em>Rio Vidal</em>, she was my therapist. Do you happen to know her?"</p><p>"Well, Ms. Vidal is a very notorious therapist."</p><p>"That's not what I meant," Agatha was amazed at how she, quickly, avoided the topic, "I mean, personally?"</p><p>"Personally? No, not really."</p><p>"What's wrong with you therapists and the way you can't tell a lie? You suck at telling them."</p><p>Hela laughed. "Agatha, your husband — tell me more."</p><p>Agatha realised that she was avoiding the topic — but it made sense, Hela was there to help her; nothing more.</p><p>"I told you; same position, no foreplay, no communication. I want to please him, because that's <em>my</em> duty."</p><p>"It's not your duty, but," Hela pondered, "I think you can, perhaps, heat things up?"</p><p>"What do you mean? Do you want me to set <em>him</em> on fire?"</p><p>Now, Hela's laugh sounded sincere. "Agatha, humour isn't going to help you," her smile became smaller, "I was wondering, how about you try using <em>sex–toys</em> with him?"</p><p>Agatha made a face; shock mixed to anxiety.</p><p>"Sex–toys? How do I even get them?"</p><p>"You're very lucky, Agatha," Hela stood up from the chair. She walked towards a small, secret section of her studio, opened a weird–looking drawer, and pulled out something. "I have them."</p><p>"You <em>have</em> sex–toys in your studio?!"</p><p>"You see, Agatha," in her hands, she held a toy — of course, it was in a box — and she went back to her seat, "I have very important patients — so important that they cannot be seen in certain shops, that's why I keep them. It's not that scandalous. They are even in the box!"</p><p>Hela gave the box to Agatha; her hands trembled.</p><p>"Ok, and now? What even is this?"</p><p>"<em>A vibrator</em>."</p><p>Agatha felt like dying. "What do I have to do?"</p><p>"Simple," Hela smiled tenderly. "Try it out alone; after getting confident with it — ask Ralph to use it with you. That way, you can create a moment for yourselves — and the intimacy will grow."</p><p>Her hands held the item — shocked at hearing what she had to do — but, perhaps, it would've worked?</p><p>"Right," she attempted a laugh, "I will try."</p><p>"Also, I've been meaning to ask you this; I need your permission to speak with your previous therapist — just to know more."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, not thinking much of it. "Alright."</p><p>Hela reached her desk; taking a paper out of a pile of stuff — Agatha watched her, wondering what that meant. Soon, she took a pen. "I need your written permission."</p><p>"All of that just for a chat with my previous therapist?"</p><p>"Yes," she laughed, "I'm very serious on this; I do want to discuss with her properly."</p><p>Hela handed the pen to Agatha, who took it; quickly, she had signed the paper.</p><p>"Wonderful," Hela noticed how late it was. "Time's up; let's talk about how it went next time."</p><p>"Yes, let's."</p><p>Agatha left the room; Hela watched her go — wondering how she could help her better? Rio Vidal. She was her previous therapist. She didn't know the motive of them not working anymore, but — Rio's advice, notes, and opinions could've helped her for Agatha's situation? It was true that Agatha hadn't spoken much. A little help wouldn't have hurt.</p><p>Hela had her phone in the hands; she texted Rio.</p><p>'<em>Hi, I know you told me to stay away. I was told that Agatha Harkness was your previous patient — I was wondering if I could hear your thoughts on the matter? Just work–stuff</em>.'</p><p>Soon, a reply came.</p><p>'<em>Hello Hela. Yes, she was. I have a few notes I wrote on her — I can lend you. After that, please don't contact me again. If not for work</em>.'</p><p>A smile appeared on Hela's lips.</p><p>'<em>Deal</em>.'</p><p>—</p><p>Rio groaned; the idea of seeing her ex didn't really appeal to her — she waited, in front of a nearby café — and Hela arrived shortly after.</p><p>"Rio," she excitedly waved at her. "It's nice to see you; how have you—"</p><p>She handled her the notes. "Here."</p><p>Hela took them; smiling. "So cold; I also wanted to hear your opinion on her. We can sit at the table — talk?"</p><p>Rio knew that she had to — the importance of other's opinions on a case that seemed impossible — she could've helped her; sharing only essential infos.</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>They sat on the table outside; a waitress took the orders — one coffee, and a cup of water — Hela seemed jumpy, Rio wanted it to be over as soon as possible.</p><p>"So, you're aware of Ms. Harkness's situation," she gazed at the notes, "I was wondering; at what point did you get with her?"</p><p>"Her husband; she wants to please him. He just wants to have sex."</p><p>"Same point; Agatha won't tell me more."</p><p>The drinks arrived.</p><p>Rio sighed. "There's more — she's struggling with her sexuality. I believe that's the reason she doesn't seem to reach pleasure."</p><p>"I see," Hela tried to examine the situation. "That's going to be hard."</p><p>"Yeah, good luck," she took a sip of her glass, "I believe that's all; right?"</p><p>"Yes! That's it!"</p><p>"Good," Rio continued to drink; Hela's eyes still on her — hypnotised. "If that's all; I'll go—"</p><p>"What are <em>you</em> doing here?"</p><p>A voice Rio and Hela were familiar with; they both turned around — Agatha stood there, besides her, a young boy. Rio felt weird, but she really shouldn't have.</p><p>"Ms. Harkness," Hela's eyes looked at the boy, "I told you; work stuff."</p><p>"Nicky, get in the car — I'll be right back."</p><p>The boy, Nicky, didn't question that order; followed it without complaining — once he was gone, Agatha stared back at Rio, then at Hela.</p><p>"Which kind of work?"</p><p>"Agatha; you gave me permission to discuss with your previous therapist, Rio Vidal, I've talked to her about your situation — she helped me to understand more. Now, I can help you even better."</p><p>Agatha looked distressed. "Yes, I did give you permission — but you could've chosen a closeted place. This an <em>open</em> café!"</p><p>Hela gazed back — no one was there. "You're right. Forgive my clumsiness."</p><p>"Whatever," her eyes went to Rio — she didn't speak or properly looked at her, "I'm going home."</p><p>They watched her go — Hela stared back at Rio; brown eyes reciprocated the stare.</p><p>"A rather <em>feisty</em> one, right?"</p><p>Rio didn't comment.</p>

<p>Agatha sat on her bed — the vibrator stood not so far from her. How was she even going to do it? To put that <em>thing</em> so close to her between?</p><p>She held it — her fingers trembling — turned it on; the buzzling sound reaching her ears. Agatha wanted to disappear.</p><p>Ralph wouldn't have been home for another hour, Nicholas was at a friend's house (some sort of sleepover) — she had time to understand how it worked.</p><p>So, she removed her pants and panties; the toy was still on — that disturbed Agatha. Now, what to think about as she had to be turned on? She didn't know.</p><p>Perhaps Ralph's naked body? No, that wasn't even an option. Some actress on TV? No, not a chance. Her mind worked twice as hard, and suddenly, someone appeared — <em>Rio</em>.</p><p>Oh no, Agatha didn't want that; the idea of Rio, naked, touching and caressing her, speaking soft yet harsh, her laughs, her eyes — Agatha was turned on. She hated it and despised it — her fantasies were getting <em>out</em> of hand. Rio wouldn't have ever known.</p><p>She laid on the bed, bringing the toy near her sensitive area — it started. Thoughts of Rio appearing in her mind; the toy increasing its power.</p><p>Unfortunately — Agatha had heard steps that she so well recognised; Ralph. Quickly, she hid the toy in the drawer — put panties and pants back on — and tried acting as if she wasn't about to masturbate thinking of Rio.</p><p>Ralph opened the door; he sighed, looking at her. "What are you doing?"</p><p>Agatha had to set the mood.</p><p>"Uh—, waiting for you?"</p><p>"Oh," Ralph walked closer, "Agatha, you shouldn't have—"</p><p>"Why did you get home so soon?"</p><p>"You sound as if you don't want me here."</p><p>It was true — she <em>didn't</em> want him.</p><p>"No, I'm not," she corrected herself, "I mean, you always work so late; it caught me by surprise. That's all."</p><p>"Well, I can spend some time with my wife? Can't I?"</p><p>Agatha smiled. Maybe Ralph wasn't so bad — perhaps she could've talked to him — letting him know what she desired, what she loved, and more.</p><p>"You know, Nicky's not here, we could—"</p><p>"Right—, <em>sex</em>."</p><p>Ralph chuckled. "Since you started therapy, you seem more confident."</p><p>"The things I have to do for you."</p><p>He sat on the bed; his hands reaching Agatha's panties, entering them, touching her clit — gasping at sensing that she was wet.</p><p>"You're <em>wet</em>? Jeez, that's a first."</p><p>Agatha tried to smile — as if that wetness wasn't due to her thoughts of Rio. "You, hm, excite me a lot recently." A blatant lie.</p><p>"You really seem to be fixed," Ralph was smiling, and Agatha couldn't help but let out a sigh at those words; she understood that she wasn't broken — but Ralph had always made her feel like that. "Come on, remove your clothes."</p><p>And so she did; Ralph stared at her — hands touching her body — Agatha still.</p><p>"You know, Aggie—"</p><p>"Do not call me that."</p><p>Ralph flinched. "<em>Agatha</em>. I think you'd look better if you lose some weight; it's time to get back to shape."</p><p>"What?" Agatha's voice was weak — angry.</p><p>"You know; you used to have such a hot body — everyone envied you."</p><p>"I carried Nicholas; body tends to <em>change</em> during pregnancy."</p><p>He seemed amused by that answer; Agatha was slowly losing it — and would've bursted.</p><p>"Yes, it's true," Ralph stared at her, "I also know that bodies can get back to shape; you just got lazy."</p><p>"Lazy?" Agatha stood up from the bed, quickly dressing up — she was so fast, Ralph struggled to see her movement; his face red of anger. "I got lazy, but you got <em>unfaithful</em>. Which one do you think is worse?"</p><p>"This again."</p><p>Ralph had also gotten up, facing Agatha.</p><p>"I told you; I'm not cheating on you."</p><p>Agatha knew that it wasn't true. "I caught you having sex with your secretary; not once, but twice."</p><p>"Ok, and? She has a hot body — knows how to please me, doesn't act dead during sex!"</p><p>"Fine," she took her purse, phone, and keys of the house, "Ralph, go back to your secretary — I bet she sucks your dick just to get a promotion."</p><p>"Agatha!"</p><p>But Agatha had walked out of the room — out of the house.</p><p>—</p><p>She found herself at the 'Witch's Bar' — sitting alone in a forgotten table; she had drank a lot, and planned on having more. The alchool flowed in her veins — keeping her alive, her only outlet.</p><p>How would things be at home? Ralph would've been out — probably with his secretary — and, once things had settled down — Agatha had to pretend to be fine.</p><p>She hated it. Agatha drank the liquid and rested her head on the table; where would she even spend the night? Her body trembled in fear.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>A voice — the one she so well knew; her head lifted up, eyes meeting hers.</p><p>"Rio," voice was weak. "I didn't expect you here."</p><p>"I'm here with friends," she looked at her, properly, "Agatha, have you been crying?"</p><p>She had been crying; but admitting that wasn't necessary — so, Agatha dried her eyes. "No."</p><p>"And I was the one that sucked at lying."</p><p>Agatha smiled weakly. "Just go with your friends—"</p><p>"Why are you here alone?"</p><p>"Uh—, drinking?"</p><p>"Alone?"</p><p>She looked mad; and her eyes severe — it was weird, that was undeniable. What would've she think about her? Drinking not to face your cheating husband.</p><p>"Can't a girl drink alone?"</p><p>"She can, but," she smiled, "I think it's sad."</p><p>Agatha looked down; she knew it — even Rio thought she was pathetic — she sighed.</p><p>"Just go—, okay?"</p><p>Rio sat next to her; legs touching, and Agatha shifted on her seat.</p><p>"Nah, my friends will manage," she spotted Jen, who was hyping Rio (misunderstanding the whole thing), then at Alice, who was smiling (she also didn't understand), she glared at them — only to stare softly at Agatha. "Besides, I can't leave a drunk woman alone."</p><p>"You don't have to."</p><p>"I want to, shut up."</p><p>Agatha didn't reply; she didn't know if the alchool or something else made her cheeks burn so intensely — Rio was so close to her, legs touching, and she couldn't think properly.</p><p>"You don't have to tell me what happened—, we can be quiet; but, you can't drink more. How many did you have?"</p><p>"Four? Five — I don't know."</p><p>"That's more than enough," Rio smiled, "I will personally kick you out of the bar if you get more. <em>Got it</em>?"</p><p>Agatha laughed. "When did you become so bossy?"</p><p>Rio brightened up; sensing that she was getting more comfortable. Eventually, she would've opened up — and then, who knows?</p><p>"When I care about someone; I become bossy, especially when that someone is drunk. I can be a bit nagging — at times."</p><p>"You care about me?"</p><p>"Of course," she put her hand on her shoulder, petting her gently, "Agatha, we're <em>friends</em>. I care about you."</p><p>How can someone be so kind to her? When everyone had turned their back; even her own mother — no, Agatha couldn't think of her — not now.</p><p>"Me and Ralph, we had a huge fight, and," she bit her lower lip, "Rio, do you think I have an unattractive body?"</p><p>"Huh?" Rio panicked, where did that question came from? Agatha's body was soft, curves that suited her perfectly — she did have a nice body. "No?"</p><p>"Ralph says it's ugly. That's why he chooses his secretary — with a much beautiful body — instead of me. He said that I should get back in shape; I've been lazy—"</p><p>"<em>Fuck him</em>," Rio's voice was powerful; words seemed to be on fire, "I—, sorry, Agatha, your body is perfectly fine. If you want to work on it; do it for you, not him."</p><p>Agatha looked at her; in a very dangerous way — Rio struggled to keep the eye–contact, she didn't know if she had exaggerated with her words, or was too harsh.</p><p>"I like my body."</p><p>"Then, he can go to hell."</p><p>A laugh, then snorts from Agatha; Rio was glad to have lifted her worries away, even if not completely. They sat in silence — Agatha was the first to speak.</p><p>"Can I have another glass?"</p><p>"Where will you sleep tonight?"</p><p>Rio had changed the subject; Agatha sighed — she hadn't thought about it — home wasn't possible, and she had no friends.</p><p>"An hotel?"</p><p>"I will bring you there; let's go — you need rest, can you stand?"</p><p>Agatha tried stading up, but fell back on seat; her head hurt, and the vision was a bit blurry — many, many thoughts — legs weak.</p><p>"Alright," Rio put her hands around Agatha's waist; helping her to stand up — it worked. "Here you go. Hold on to me, okay?"</p><p>Agatha felt warmness — the hands of Rio weren't heavy but soft, and her touch didn't disturb her, unlike Ralph's. Her gaze was low, she grabbed Rio's arm, holding it. "Don't make me fall."</p><p>"Wouldn't dream of it."</p><p>They both started to walk towards the door; Agatha touched Rio's arms — there were mucles? Did she go to the gym? Her fingers pinched the mucles, and Rio laughed, Agatha timidly stared at her.</p><p>"Do you go to the gym?"</p><p>"I do," a smile on her lips. "Impressed?"</p><p>A tender blush on her cheeks. "Shut up."</p><p>Rio's laugh became louder. Suddenly, Jen and Alice had stopped her — they had been laughing, she could tell.</p><p>"Didn't know you wanted to have fun tonight, Rio." Jen teased, staring at Agatha.</p><p>"You are so weird. She's drunk — I'm taking her to a hotel."</p><p>"Need a hand?" Alice stepped in.</p><p>"I'll manage," she stared at Agatha, her eyes were shut — was she sleeping? It didn't seem like that. "Can I go now?"</p><p>"Tell us how it went!"</p><p>"Jen, I told you to shut up."</p><p>Alice pinched Jen's cheek — and they could finally go.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio had called a taxi; Agatha still was still wrapped around her arm — her hold was firm — as if she was scared of falling. It made Rio smile.</p><p>"I called a taxi," she explained, Agatha listened carefully. "If you let go of my arm; I can book a hotel."</p><p>"Oh," Agatha let go — feeling embarrassed to have held her for that long; did she make her uncomfortable? "<em>Sorry</em>."</p><p>Rio didn't reply, she quickly searched for a nearby hotel — opened the booking app and reserved a room. It's simpler than she originally thought.</p><p>"Done; I'll ride the taxi with you. I have to make sure you get there — safe."</p><p>"Right."</p><p>The atmosphere felt weird; tense.</p><p>"You don't have to go with me."</p><p>"No, I want to go," Rio stared at her, "I don't even want to think of you getting lost; I'll bring you to your room, check if you're okay, give you some medicines—"</p><p>Agatha laughed. "It's cute that you worry."</p><p>A timid smile appeared on Rio's lips, her cheeks of a tender rosy — Agatha wouldn't have noticed that — being called <em>'cute'</em> made her feel happy; she really wasn't that bad.</p><p>"The alchool makes you soft, Agatha."</p><p>"You just have to ruin moments, do you?"</p><p>The taxi arrived; Rio had made sure Agatha was comfortable in her seat, and she sat right next to her — soon, Agatha's head rested on Rio's shoulder, eyes closed. Was she sleeping? Rio checked if she was, gently tapping her shoulder.</p><p>"Agatha, don't die on me!</p><p>"I'm not dead, <em>idiot</em>. My head is spinning, and I'm resting."</p><p>Rio smiled — the driver looked at them; worried to have interrupted something.</p><p>"Where to, ladies?"</p><p>"The hotel nearby the park, it's called 'The Road'."</p><p>The driver started the car, but couldn't hide a smile. "It's nice to see a cute couple like yourselves; you're very caring, Miss."</p><p>She leapt back; how would Agatha have reacted of the idea of them being together? It was better to not test her patience.</p><p>"No, you got it all wrong!"</p><p>The man gasped. "<em>Oops</em>, my bad!"</p><p>Agatha knew that Rio meant well; but, for an instant, that idea didn't disturb her — as she thought it would've.</p>

<p>In a matter of few minutes; the taxi had arrived at destination — Rio had managed to get Agatha out, and also pay the driver (who gave her a <em>wink</em> of encouragement, Rio wanted to disappear).</p><p>Again, she held Agatha tight; some steps further, and they would've arrived at the reception — Agatha looked tired, extremely exhausted, and Rio couldn't wait for her to get some rest.</p><p>Once inside, the receptionist saw and greeted them.</p><p>"Good evening; have you reserved a room?"</p><p>"Yeah, through the app," her eyes met the ones of the receptionist, and she had a mischievous look — Rio knew. "It's just for one night; can I pay later? I have to put her to bed first."</p><p>"Sure, <em>later</em>," a smirk on her lips, "I can do that; your name?"</p><p>Rio wanted to cry; why was everyone <em>misunderstanding</em> the whole situation? "Rio Vidal; I booked a room under my name."</p><p>A quick sound of tapping on tthe keyboard perhaps checking the reservation — soon, her eyes were on Rio again.</p><p>"The room is on the second floor," she handed her the keys, smiling widely, "I hope you have a nice staying!"</p><p>"Right."</p><p>They walked away, reaching the elevator — Agatha had yet to speak, Rio started to worry; had the alchool gone to her head, making it hard for her to speak? Once inside the elevator, the only thing left to do was putting Agatha to sleep and handing her some medicines, or some water.</p><p>"Hang in there, Agatha; we're almost there!"</p><p>But she didn't reply — Rio should've kept it quiet.</p><p>The hallway was big. Surprisingly, Rio had managed to find the room; she opened the door. The room looked cosy, suitable for one night. With a little more effort, she had found the bedroom and the bed — making Agatha rest on it.</p><p>Rio's eyes were still on Agatha; she could've left some medicines she had on the drawer and got home — ignoring that <em>annoying</em> voice telling her to stay.</p><p>"Agatha," her hands brushed against her hair, so smooth and silky, fingertips playing with them, "I have to go; do you need anything?"</p><p>"Don't," she murmed, not quietly enough; Rio had heard.</p><p>"Oh," Rio looked around; she saw a chair, went to take it, positioning the tool next to the bed — facing Agatha, feeling awkward. "Are you still unwell?"</p><p>"No, I'm—," her words seemed messy, "I need a bottle of water; I think there's one in the kitchen?"</p><p>"Wait here."</p><p>Rio got up, walking towards the kitchen; Agatha sat on the bed, head heavy and heart beating faster than usual — as if it wanted to jump off the ribcage. Why was Rio taking <em>care</em> of her? Was this what friends did? She had inconvenienced her so much. A hand went to her hair, blushing. What were those emotions?</p><p>"Here," Agatha hadn't realised that Rio had returned; she took the bottle of water, feeling everything but thirsty. Rio went back to the chair, sitting on it.</p><p>Agatha timidly drank the water.</p><p>"You should try to sleep."</p><p>"Yes," she handed the bottle to Rio, laying back on the bed, "I know that; I can't seem to fall asleep."</p><p>"I can tell you a <em>bed–time</em> story!"</p><p>Agatha glared at her; Rio laughed softly — perhaps she shouldn't have made fun of her. There were a few minutes of silence, and Rio had really thought she had fallen asleep, but then Agatha talked.</p><p>"Did you speak with my therapist?"</p><p>Rio was surprised. "Yes. But, strictly related to your situation," there was a huge sigh, "I–, truth to be told; I <em>shouldn't</em> have asked you to be friends."</p><p>"Oh," she couldn't seem to be able to hide her sadness — her words were heavy. "I see."</p><p>"But," continued Rio, "I don't regret doing that; it's rather questionable, but not forbidden."</p><p>"Why did you do that, then?"</p><p>"I just <em>like</em> you."</p><p>Agatha jolted on her seat, immediately; her eyes still on the brown ones — but she seemed completely fine. How could she?</p><p>"You 'like me'? But, I'm—"</p><p>"Agatha, I like you as a friend."</p><p>Rio was smiling widely; she knew that it was wrong of her to tease Agatha, but her reactions were too funny for her to stop. Either way, she wouldn't have remembered that (maybe).</p><p>"You shouldn't tease a drunk woman; your morals are messed up," her voice trembled, as she laid back to the bed, her back facing Rio — she felt angry, even if she didn't have to.</p><p>"Are you angry at me?"</p><p>"Yes, I want you out of my room."</p><p>Rio laughed; she got up from the chair, sitting at the end of the bed — she could've looked at Agatha properly.</p><p>"Technically, I'm paying for <em>'your'</em> room. So, it's my room," her eyes searched hers, but Agatha had covered her face with the sheets of the bed, and Rio pulled them down; now, she was without something to cover up.</p><p>Agatha sighed. "Okay? Do you want me, on my knees, thanking you for your benevolence?"</p><p>"Oh? That idea doesn't seem so bad."</p><p>"You're impossible; how did you even manage to become a therapist with your <em>sadistic</em> tendencies?!"</p><p>Rio got closer to her, giggling endlessly. "Those are some bold accusations, Agatha."</p><p>Soon, silence overcame them; Rio thought that, finally, she was asleep — but Agatha wasn't. She wanted to say more.</p><p>"Must've been embarrassing talking to my therapist, who happens to be your ex."</p><p>"Well," she was surprised by that affirmation; even more by the use of 'ex', Agatha had never thought of the word 'girlfriend', so 'ex' was a start. "We see each other at conferences. We do have to keep it civil; I really didn't find it embarrassing."</p><p>"Did you love her?"</p><p>Shock came to Rio; she didn't understand.</p><p>"Yes," words coming from their own, "I did, not anymore now."</p><p>"Why did you break up?"</p><p>Rio tried to smile; she got up from the bed, tucking the sheet over Agatha's head. "<em>Sleep</em>."</p><p>"You're always like this; so avoidant of the past."</p><p>"I'm not," and she meant it. "You're the one that's avoidant."</p><p>Agatha bit her lip; she took the sheets, uncovering her face. "If you knew, you'd run away; like <em>everyone</em> else."</p><p>"I'm not 'everyone else'," Rio smiled, her hands tangled with her hair; once again, she didn't understand why of that movement. "I thought you knew that."</p><p>"Right. You're more annoying than other people," she froze at the soft movement of Rio's fingers; she wanted to stop her, or touch her hand — but couldn't. "That's what I know."</p><p>"You always get <em>so</em> emotional when drunk?"</p><p>Whatever; Rio was really focused on building a friendship — and Agatha appreciated that, even if she knew that it didn't really suit them.</p><p>"Guess I'll sleep, so you can run to <em>flirt</em> with some girls at that bar."</p><p>Agatha stopped; had she really said that? Quickly, her eyes met Rio's — there was a weird look in them — she didn't really want to sound annoying, but teasing.</p><p>"Oh, Agatha," Rio used an even more annoying voice; that Agatha found cute (she shouldn't have), "I never knew you were a protective friend."</p><p>'<em>Friend</em>', because that's what they were.</p><p>"Ugh. Go already."</p><p>Rio brushed her hair behind; she got close to her, bending a little — lips over her ear, whispering.</p><p>"I don't flirt with girls randomly; I'm not a <em>fuck–boy</em>."</p><p>Agatha's hand went over her ear; there was a massive red colour on her cheeks — Rio's voice, whispering to her, had made her feel warm — she shouldn't have felt that way.</p><p>"Got it?" Rio walked away, "I'll pay the room; and I'll call you to see how you're doing. You can text me, obviously."</p><p>But there was no reply; Rio took her things, and went out — Agatha gazed at the ceiling. How could she have fallen asleep? <em>Stupid Rio</em>.</p>

<p>The next day, Agatha was a mess; she didn't call <em>nor</em> texted Rio. How could she? Agatha had hoped for the alcohol to wipe away those memories, but that didn't happen.</p><p>She returned home; her husband was still there, Nicholas at school. Agatha walked towards the kitchen, Ralph stopped her.</p><p>"Where did you sleep? I tried calling you; not once you answered."</p><p>Agatha sighed. "Sleeping at a hotel. You must be familiar with those places, since, you <em>fuck</em> your secretary there."</p><p>A defeating silence — then, Ralph took a deep breath — and Agatha expected the worse; even if things couldn't have gotten lower than they already were.</p><p>"We could do one therapy session together," Ralph looked stressed, Agatha surprised. "Just one, okay?"</p><p>"Why the sudden change of heart?"</p><p>He looked like he was about to have a heart attack; his lips were sealed, only after a few attempts of bringing him back to reality — he spoke again.</p><p>"Your mother will visit us soon; I don't want her to know that you're still not attracted to me — there's <em>my job</em> on the line!"</p><p>Agatha laughed, and did it so loudly, as if Ralph had said a funny joke. "Oh, so you want to please your boss? Got it. What a good employee; have you already received a promotion?"</p><p>"Agatha," Ralph was angry, his hands clenched into fists, "I think that no one, in their right mind, would want to marry you; or be <em>with</em> you. Your temper is shit, your behavior is shit — your body is shit! And why can't you divorce me, and let me be happy? You're selfish."</p><p>She gritted her teeth; she couldn't cry — and wouldn't have done that. Why was he tormenting her so much? Why couldn't he pretend? It was hell, with no way out.</p><p>"You know I <em>can't</em> divorce you."</p><p>Ralph snapped out of it. "Right, you can't," he walked away, "I have time this afternoon; call your therapist and say that we'll have a session, together."</p><p>And she did.</p><p>—</p><p>The atmosphere was weird; Hela had tried to ease up the tension — with comforting words, questions and even tea. But, it was just tense — they <em>both</em> were.</p><p>"Ralph, I didn't mention how glad I am to have you here," Hela attempted a smile and looked at Agatha — who was not smiling — rather tired, lost. "Me and Agatha are doing a splendid work, and—"</p><p>"So splendid that she still can't come."</p><p>Hela frowned. "Ralph. Not that much time has passed, these things require time," her eyes on Agatha, "I even dare say; a <em>strong</em> will, and a deep <em>understanding</em> of the themselves."</p><p>"She's already old; more time, and she'll pass away."</p><p>That statement had caught her by surprise. She had to fix things before they got out of control; she felt bad for Agatha — as her blue eyes were on the verge of crying. "Now, Ralph—"</p><p>"Me, 'old'?" Agatha laughed, but it was forced, "Hela, forgive him; he has a thing for <em>younger</em> people, secretaries to be precise."</p><p>Ralph got up from the seat. "You liar!"</p><p>"Your reaction says it all—"</p><p>"Hela," his gaze went back to the therapist, "I don't think anyone would to be with a woman who complains, complains, and complains!"</p><p>Hela quickly attempted to answer; Agatha preceeded her.</p><p>"I don't think anyone would want a man that—," she stopped, her eyes meeting the ones of Hela, "I—, sorry."</p><p>He realised that he, too, had gone too far; he sat back on the couch — Hela breathed in relief.</p><p>"Ralph, Agatha," what could she say? "I believe that there's a lack of understanding from both sides; Ralph, cheating is wrong and unforgivable, and Agatha has every right to be mad at you — and needs time to forgive you, if she ever will," Hela didn't know what to say next. "And, Agatha, I know that there's a lot of anger in you; but, I have a solution."</p><p>Ralph stared hard, and so did Agatha.</p><p>"The sexual part isn't good; I'd say to work on the <em>romantic</em> one. Romantic attraction is as powerful as the sexual one," Hela knew that, for Agatha's case, it wouldn't have worked, "Ralph, have you ever taken Agatha on a date?"</p><p>"No. We–," he struggled, "I mean, it's been a while."</p><p>"Take her on a date, tonight," she smiled, "I need you both to work, start from the basis."</p><p>Eyes lingered on the time; the session was over — she stood up, and so did they.</p><p>"We'll discuss how it went next week," even if she didn't have high hopes, "Ralph, you must be there. Alright?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Agatha and Ralph walked out; they didn't speak — until he did.</p><p>"Where would you like to go?"</p><p>Agatha attempted a smile, even if there was nothing to smile about. "You can decide."</p><p>—</p><p>And so, they sat at the table of one of the most prestigious restaurants of town; Agatha had wore a nice, long dress, Ralph just a suit — because he possessed only that.</p><p>"This is nice, right?"</p><p>Even his voice irritated her; she took a deep breath — she needed to make things work.</p><p>"It's, whatever," icy eyes on the glass of wine; they shifted to Ralph — who was angry and frustrated.</p><p>"Can you be a <em>little</em> romantic? Just once?"</p><p>"Thank you, lovely husband! I can't even thank you enough. You're so—"</p><p>Ralph sighed, drinking wine. "With that attitude, we won't go far. And I know that you know that."</p><p>Agatha knew it. Of course, she knew. </p><p>"Sorry, I—," her eyes had managed to linger on a woman; she had brown hair, long and smooth — same posture of, Rio? "Wait."</p><p>Eyes focused, waiting for the woman to turn her head — when she did — Agatha gasped; it was Rio, and at the table, there were people she could've swore to have already seen. What was she doing there? In a place like that?</p><p>"What are you—"</p><p>"Bathroom," she stood up; walked towards Rio's table. What she was about to do was very wrong — Rio had a personal life, as she did. Then, why did it bother so much for her to be there?</p><p>Agatha stood behind her — not knowing what to say.</p><p>"Uh—," Jen spoke; fighting hard a laugh, "Rio, there's an angry lady behind you."</p><p>Rio let out a small laugh. "Finally gone mad, Jen?"</p><p>"No, Rio," Alice was now joining the conversation, "I think, you have to turn around."</p><p>She did that, worried; Agatha glared at her — eyes severe, and Rio was surprised. What was her problem? The whole situation was hilarious.</p><p>"Oh, Agatha," she smiled. "Hi."</p><p>"Don't '<em>hi</em>' me!" Agatha sounded serious, but Rio was trying to keep it low; Jen and Alice would've asked her many questions, teasing her — she couldn't have said anything risky. "Come with me."</p><p>"But," Rio pointed at the pasta she was about to eat, "I have to eat; this gets cold soon."</p><p>"Poor you," Agatha took her by the wrist, making Rio stand up — and they walked away — reaching the restroom; Rio gazed back at her friends, they were laughing.</p><p>"Do you think they will—, you know, in the bathroom?" Jen asked Alice, and she smiled back.</p><p>"Nah. I mean, I hope not."</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha had managed to bring Rio, quietly, to the restroom — luckily, no one was there; and Agatha felt her patience running low.</p><p>"Agatha, did you have to drag me there? My friends are going to—"</p><p>"What are you doing here?" Agatha's voice was scared, upset — scaring Rio, that truly didn't know what was going on. That was a restaurant, a public place.</p><p>"Uh, eating?"</p><p>"In a restaurant known for couples?"</p><p>Rio had a smirk on her lips; Agatha wanted to wipe it off. "It's not only known for couples; also their pasta, service, and amazing desserts!"</p><p>"You did that on purpose, did you?"</p><p>Her paranoia was having the best on her, Rio really didn't have to be her target; but something was telling her to continue, to give her a piece of her mind — she hated it, Rio had done nothing wrong.</p><p>"What? No, look," she cleared her throat, "I've been trying to reserve a table for my friends for almost two months; it's very hard to get a table — I had to wait, and wait. I swear, I didn't even know you'd be here."</p><p>Agatha knew that she was telling the truth. "Right."</p><p>Rio smiled. "It's true, I," her eyes looked better at Agatha; scanning her whole body — checking her out — she wore a black dress, that highlighted her curves, hair smooth and thin make–up. She stopped talking, and a shy blush appeared. "You look nice."</p><p>Soon, even Agatha's cheeks were rosy. "Please, don't make fun of me."</p><p>"Make fun of you?" Rio crossed her arms, "I'm not; I really do think you look very pretty."</p><p>Agatha looked away because, if she kept looking at her, Rio would've realised how her words had managed to pierce through her heart — she was having an hard time — and the brown eyes of the woman on her, didn't help.</p><p>"What's the occasion?" Rio asked.</p><p>"Trying to save my marriage."</p><p>There was a quiet moment, then Rio softly laughed — Agatha didn't understand; she should've been annoyed, but wasn't, Rio was cute.</p><p>"So, uh, your husband is here?"</p><p>"Yes, unfortunately."</p><p>Another minute of silence; Agatha wished for her to say more, to ask more — but she knew that Rio wasn't nosy (maybe), and would've probably dropped it.</p><p>"You didn't call, or text, or answered my calls."</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened. "Were you sad?"</p><p>"A little," again, an irritating laugh, "I expected a proper 'thank you' — on your knees."</p><p>"You will not get that."</p><p>Rio didn't really need that; Agatha had calmed down — that's what mattered to her — her eyes were soft, her posture relaxed.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Really."</p><p>A 'thank you' wouldn't have arrived, she didn't mind — Rio had other plans.</p><p>"Can I get you to say 'yes' to go to a new café? With me?"</p><p>Her lips shut, only to re–open shortly after. "Why?"</p><p>"It's cute; you'd like that."</p><p>"Why do you want to go with me?"</p><p>Rio shrugged, and a grin appeared. "Because I want to."</p><p>Agatha was about to reply — but she had heard a know on the door; she flinched, knowing who it was. Eyes on Rio.</p><p>"Agatha," Ralph's voice, "I started to worry; the dishes have arrived. Are you okay?"</p><p>There was panic, Rio didn't seem to realise the gravity of the situation; Agatha quickly stepped out of the restroom — greeting Ralph — but, Rio had done the same. The three of them stood there; Ralph was looking at Rio, even if he should've looked at his wife.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>"Yes, I just—, I needed a moment," her eyes were glaring at Rio. Why wasn't she walking away? It was awkward.</p><p>"Right," Ralph had noticed the awkwardness, and his attention was now on Rio. "Can I help you? Miss?"</p><p>"Yes, you're blocking the way." Her voice was cold; there had been a shift in her behaviour — Agatha had never seen her like that.</p><p>And it was true; they were blocking the way — so, Agatha stepped back, and so did Ralph; Rio had stopped to take a proper look at him — he was, well, like she had imagined.</p><p>"Sorry, I didn't mean to."</p><p>"No worries."</p><p>Rio walked away, glancing at Agatha one last time — now, the 'couple' was alone.</p><p>"Let's go back. Alright, Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>—</p><p>Once again, Agatha was on her seat — the conversation she had had with Rio seemed to not leave her mind; her compliment, her voice, her–</p><p>"Agatha," Ralph seemed worried, really worried, "I know you told me you were okay, but, are you really?"</p><p>"Yes," her voice was sincere; when did she ever sound like that around him? "A little tired, also Nicky — he started asking questions as of why we fight a lot."</p><p>"He is a vulnerable kid," his eyes were distant, "Agatha, if our marriage doesn't work for us; let's make it work for him. Alright?"</p><p>"Stop <em>cheating</em> on me."</p><p>Ralph was surprised, sighing. "Yes. I won't cheat on you. And, uh, I'll make it work."</p><p>"Thank you," another pause, then another breath in, "I'm sorry for acting crazy."</p><p>"Don't apologise; I did worse."</p><p>But Agatha couldn't really laugh at his joke.</p><p>Her eyes looked back at Rio, and surprisingly, she was looking at her, too. Agatha didn't understand, but when Rio noticed that she was looking at her, she did a heart shape with her hands; smiling annoyingly — but making Agatha laugh.</p><p>"Haven't heard that laugh in a while." Ralph brought her back to reality; her reality — she smiled, not <em>because</em> of him.</p><p>"Yeah," she said, "I know."</p><p>—</p><p>"Rio, a heart with your hands? Are you twelve?" Jen said; her hands pinching the bridge of her nose. "I don't know; why can't you tell us who she was?"</p><p>Rio had noticed Agatha laughing, her heart beating faster; and she stopped doing that — eyes on Jen and Alice. "I made her laugh."</p><p>Jen was about to throw hands; Alice was more understanding.</p><p>"You can't tell us who she is?"</p><p>"I can, but not now."</p><p>Alice smiled. "Okay, I trust you."</p><p>Rio had missed how understanding Alice was — compared to Jen — she was a kind soul; so, they continued their dinner.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The day after the '<em>romantic</em>' dinner with Ralph; things seemed to have settled down — Agatha tried her best to reassure Nicholas, telling him that everything was fine, and so did Ralph, but it simply wasn't true — the lie would've grown and grown.</p><p>Ralph was away at work, and Agatha had told Rio that she would've gone to the café with her — so she proceeded telling Nicholas.</p><p>'Nicky?" Agatha entered his room; the boy was studying — he had always been very diligent, almost scary. "I'm going out for a few hours; would you like me to get something for you?"</p><p>"No," Nicky turned around, smiling and softening his gaze, "I'm happy you're going out; you seem happier."</p><p>"Yes, well," did she look happier? "Your father and I, we are trying to make things work."</p><p>"Mom, I <em>highly</em> doubt that he can make you smile like that."</p><p>Agatha was surprised. She knew that, between him and Ralph, there wasn't the best father–son relationship, but she thought they had worked on that.</p><p>"Nicky, you shouldn't speak like that of him; he's <em>still</em> your father."</p><p>"Then, he has to stop being an asshole to you. What's wrong, anyway? It's not like he's here. He's never been here. You raised me—"</p><p>Nicholas stopped; he had gone too far — there was a huge pause. Agatha understood what he was going to say, but she didn't have the right words to say to him. So, she dropped that conversation.</p><p>"I'll go. Don't study too much, okay?"</p><p>"Will do."</p><p>—</p><p>Rio stood at the entrance of the local park; she waited for Agatha — patiently and eagerly. Her mind wandered to the image of Ralph (the cheating husband) and how he didn't deserve her. Agatha was funny, beautiful, and way too smart for him. Why couldn't she divorce? It was fine that she didn't want to admit her sexuality; but, at least, she could've divorced.</p><p>Something was amiss; Agatha didn't tell her more.</p><p>"If you think that hard, you're going to get wrinkles," the voice was teasing; Rio lifted her gaze — Agatha was smirking, pleased by her ambush on her.</p><p>"It's creepy to appear like that," Rio answered, matching her energy, "I have a weak heart; I could've died from a heart attack."</p><p>The older woman laughed. "You really have to get better at lying — I can always tell when you lie."</p><p>"Maybe I don't need lies," and she sounded so sincere, and Agatha wondered what she meant. Did she really not need them?</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. "I'm surprised you managed to hang out with me; I thought you were a very busy therapist?"</p><p>"I am," Rio corrected her, "I just took a day off; you don't really think we work every day, do you?"</p><p>"Just for me?" </p><p>The intent of Agatha's words were to tease her; she was well–aware that, in no right mind, Rio would've sacrificed a day of work — who would've done that for her? Not even her own husband, Ralph.</p><p>"Yes," she said, so straightforward and without thinking twice, "I did that; I thought you'd want to spend some time with me."</p><p>Agatha bit her lower lip; she was shocked, surprised? A sudden embarrassment hit her — Rio was joking, she must've been joking? She didn't know, but the way she kept silent didn't help.</p><p>"Quit joking," those were the words she managed to say; harsh and fast — Agatha thought of it as a joke, a sick joke.</p><p>"I'm not? I'm serious."</p><p>Her steps were loud, back facing Rio; she couldn't keep on looking at her — she feared something inside of her, growing stronger. How could she have kept it at bay?</p><p>"Where's the café? Which direction?"</p><p>"You can admit that you're happy I did that."</p><p>Agatha turned around. "Rio. Which direction?"</p><p>Rio had a disturbing smile, her lips curled — Agatha didn't understand — what was she planning?</p><p>"Left."</p><p>They started walking towards that direction; Agatha could've used a walk to calm down — even if she knew it wouldn't have worked.</p><p>—</p><p>After a few minutes of walking; Agatha realised that there was no café — nothing that had caught her eyes — just a bunch of shops, buildings but no café. It was weird, she suddenly stopped, her eyes meeting Rio's.</p><p>"There's nothing here."</p><p>Rio bursted out laughing; her laughs echoed, and Agatha could've said something — but the sound was soft, peaceful, and it distracted her, even for a while. It wasn't annoying, as she thought before.</p><p>"I lied; the direction was right!"</p><p>Agatha felt the need to strangle her. "And you did that because?"</p><p>"Say it," Rio's eyes were playful, mischievous, "I want you to admit that you're happy; I mean—, happy that I got a day off for you."</p><p>"What are you? <em>Five</em>?!"</p><p>"Twenty–eight," another laugh; she knew her demise was near.</p><p>Agatha swallowed her saliva; when had Rio been that assertive? It was new, exciting, and scary. Was that a good thing?</p><p>"Fine, I'm happy you took a day off," she got closer, "I'm so, so happy."</p><p>"I know; it's written on your face."</p><p>Had she been that obvious? Agatha thought of Nicholas's words — how he noticed her sudden happiness — was he talking about this? Did Rio make her happy?</p><p>"Now you got that. Can we go to this damned café?"</p><p>"Yeah, I'm thirsty. Follow me."</p><p>And, again — they walked away; this time, the direction was the correct one (she hoped).</p><p>—</p><p>They had taken a seat inside; Rio read through the menù — there were many options and many cute drinks. Agatha stared at her, even if she should've looked at the menù.</p><p>"What are you getting?" Rio asked, as she was still examining the whole drinks — her fingers scrolling down.</p><p>"Uh, me?" Agatha realised that she had to order, "I guess, a black coffee."</p><p>"That's boring," she answered, and the other woman glared at her, "I mean, they have latte art! You can take a cappuccino with a kitten shape. Isn't that cute?"</p><p>"You like that stuff?"</p><p>Rio nodded. "I like everything that's cute," her eyes stared at Agatha, longer, hinting at something that she wouldn't have said — to avoid angering her. "You don't?"</p><p>"I'll get the cappuccino with the heart shape."</p><p>The waitress arrived; her eyes gazed at Rio — she seemed hypnotised by her, and Rio stared back, wondering why she wasn't speaking.</p><p>"Hi! We are ready to order."</p><p>The girl panicked. "Sorry, uh, what would you like?"</p><p>"I'll get the cappuccino with the kitten shape—"</p><p>"Oh, it's a nice one! You sure seem to know a lot."</p><p>Agatha noticed something; the air was different — she gazed at the waitress, her cheeks were red, meaning that, <em>oh</em>, of course, there would've been other people interested in her. Rio seemed to not have a flaw. It was hard not to fall for her. That thought made her sad, and her lips turned upside down. But, again, nothing she could confirm — she shouldn't have let her fears consuming her.</p><p>"And for your girlfriend—"</p><p>"—<em>Friend</em>; it's not like that. She gets the heart one."</p><p>The waitress smiled; not even hiding the fact that she was happy, and Agatha started to feel annoyed. After the orders were taken — she quickly ran back to the counter.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha; she noticed her sudden switch. "What's up?"</p><p>"Nothing; can we talk about anything?"</p><p>"Sure? Rio was scared, "I was meaning to ask—, do you usually wear dresses?"</p><p>"Not often? During special occasions. Why?"</p><p>"Why didn't you wear one today?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes twitched as she was perplexed. "It didn't seem special; we are just getting coffee?"</p><p>"Oh," Rio sounded sad, but she was trying not to show it — it didn't work. "Don't think that I'm weird; you looked very pretty with that dress yesterday."</p><p>"I—," her thoughts were messy; Rio shouldn't be joking. Maybe she wasn't? "It was just a dress."</p><p>"It was a good dress, I haven't been able to forget it."</p><p>That compliment got to her — Ralph had not even commented on the dress, yet Rio had, and that made her feel strange; as if the thing she was hiding was now out of control.</p><p>"I can wear it next time," Agatha looked down; she knew her face would've been red — at least, Rio wouldn't have teased her.</p><p>"For me?"</p><p>"Yes. Happy?"</p><p>Rio really was; she was about to reply, the drinks came — the waitress looked at Rio, and she pointed to a piece of paper attached to the drink, then walked away. Agatha saw the whole thing.</p><p>"What's written in there?"</p><p>"I don't know," her fingers picked up the paper, she quickly read through it. "Oh, she gave me her number."</p><p>How could she speak of that in such a free, nonchalant way? As if it was nothing; Agatha felt a sudden irritation — she was aware of Rio's attractiveness and knew that she couldn't do much about it. She was straight, Rio wasn't — that's how things were supposed to be — where the line <em>between</em> them was.</p><p>Agatha's heart ached. "Congrats."</p><p>"Don't say that; she's not even my type."</p><p>A sudden hope? Why was she feeling like that? It was confusing — she didn't care about that — or did she?</p><p>"You have a type?"</p><p>A smile grew on her lips; testing Agatha's patience. "I do; I told you — I'm not a fuck–boy."</p><p>Agatha began drinking; Rio kept staring at her, smile still on her lips — she was up to something, and that something wasn't good.</p><p>"Aren't you gonna ask?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Rio's fingers tapped on the desk. "About my type?"</p><p>Time felt to never flow; Agatha was curious, did want to know — but felt that it wasn't right — she realised that, if she had known Rio's type, that would've made things more complicated, awkward.</p><p>"I don't really care."</p><p>"A shame; you could've learnt something new about me."</p><p>And she was right; Agatha hated it — feeling as if the words were hard to say, the thoughts messier than before.</p><p>After minutes of silence, Rio sighed, and the other woman looked up — what was that?</p><p>"Fine, Agatha; I'll tell you a bit about my past."</p><p>Agatha was confused. "What? Why? You don't have to."</p><p>"I feel bad, and I also want you to know me properly," she was staring at her — more intensely than usual, "I'm sure you want to listen? You told me I was '<em>avoidant</em>', remember?"</p><p>"Took it personally?"</p><p>Rio smiled. "No, I just give a thought; I want you to know."</p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p>The hard part came; what could Rio say? There were many things to tell, some good, others bad — maybe Agatha would've wanted to listen to the interesting ones? She pondered for a while; then, the words came to her.</p><p>"I was pretty popular in school, and—"</p><p>"Are you kidding me? That's the thing you want to tell? I don't care if you were the popular kid."</p><p>There was confusion in Rio's eyes; what did Agatha want to hear?</p><p>"Alright; you do the questions — I answer."</p><p>Agatha thought hard on what to say; she could've asked about her sexuality? No, that was too straightforward, and it would've been weird — something else had to be said.</p><p>"Why did you become a sex therapist? Couldn't you have chosen a different profession?"</p><p>Rio giggled softly. "I've always wanted to help people; I do agree that sex is a complicated topic — but I also hate the stigma around it. I mean, I just want them to be happy — what's wrong with it? I don't think it's something weird, it makes us humans," her eyes on Agatha, and they had never been this focused, "I, also, wouldn't have been able to meet you, hadn't I been a sex therapist. So, <em>lucky me</em>?"</p><p>Agatha felt shy, confused; the feeling inside her didn't seem to cease to exist, to matter how hard she tried to keep it hidden — how much longer could she go on?</p><p>"Yeah, 'lucky you', only I can deal with your costant, annoying behaviour."</p><p>"Yet, you didn't tell me to stay away."</p><p>She hadn't, and that consumed her alive.</p><p>"Maybe I will."</p><p>Rio grinned. "No, don't. I'll be sad."</p><p>The topic had to be changed, and quickly — Agatha wanted to ask many other stuff; focusing on her sexuality.</p><p>"Rio, how did your parents react to, you know?"</p><p>"Oh," she didn't expect it. "I didn't think you would ask that." Did it mean that Agatha was getting comfortable with the topic? "I mean, they threw a fit; I'm their only child — it was hard."</p><p>Agatha had imagined that; it was like her situation — only child, parents hard to please — how did Rio managed to outcome that?</p><p>"But, it was worth it."</p><p>Rio's eyes met the ones of Agatha, her hand trying to reach hers — she didn't know why of that movement, she wanted to feel her closer, "I mean it; it was really worth it."</p><p>Hands were about to touch, and Agatha's face was slightly red — she had noticed her hand approaching and wanted to hold it; she desperately wanted to.</p><p>"Mom?"</p><p>Agatha jumped on the seat; her hand went under the table, eyes looking at the direction of the voice — Nicholas stood before her, and the icy eyes widened.</p><p>"Nicky, I—," she seemed speechless, "I want to know what you're doing here!"</p><p>Nicholas glanced over Rio; she was trying to hide herself — as if, seconds ago, she wasn't trying to hold Agatha's hand, his mother's hand. Then, his eyes were back to Agatha.</p><p>"Mom, you told me not to study hard, remember? So, I thought of getting a coffee."</p><p>"Here?!"</p><p>"Yes? It's really good here," he didn't understand, and Agatha had realised that, maybe, he hadn't seen what she was about to do. "Is there a problem? I didn't mean to interrupt you; I wanted to say hi. I swear, I'll grab the coffee and go."</p><p>Agatha tried to cool down, but nothing seemed to help — her breathing was fast, her heart ached; Rio had noticed it, and looked at the boy, who was starting to worry.</p><p>"Is that a '<em>Lady Gaga</em>' shirt?"</p><p>Nicholas looked down; realising what he was wearing, feeling embarrassed and shy.</p><p>"Yeah; it's actually my pyjamas, I didn't have the time to change—."</p><p>"Don't <em>disrespect</em> the Queen like that; you shouldn't use it as a pyjamas."</p><p>Rio smiled, and so did Nicholas. Agatha looked at them, surprised — were they getting along?</p><p>"You're right; how could I even permit such blasphemy?"</p><p>The laughs echoed through the café; Agatha hadn't heard Nicholas laugh in a while — she smiled, even if she wished to join in, whatever, the conversation was.</p><p>"What's your name, kid?"</p><p>"Nicholas, yours?"</p><p>"I'm Rio; I've never met a kid as cool as you."</p><p>Nicholas smirked. "And I've never met an adult as cool as you; except my mom, she's the coolest."</p><p>Agatha couldn't help but smile; she knew her son loved her — and that wouldn't have changed — he was the only good thing that came out of that messed marriage.</p><p>"Yeah, it's hard to reach her level; I'm still trying—, don't know if I will ever succeed."</p><p>Did Rio think Agatha was cool?</p><p>"Good luck, Rio!"</p><p>"Come on; you're her son — you have to tell me how I can be as cool as her."</p><p>Nicholas was considering it, and Rio could tell. Agatha, on the other hand, had sent a glare to Nicky, but he ignored it — soon, his lips parted.</p><p>"If you buy me a coffee; I'm sure you'll be on her level."</p><p>Agatha gasped. "Nicholas—!"</p><p>"Alright," Rio stood from her seat, "I'm guessing you usually get an iced coffee?"</p><p>"How—"</p><p>"Rio, you don't have to."</p><p>But Rio didn't answer, and ignored Agatha; she walked towards the counter — leaving them alone — Nicholas waited for his scolding.</p><p>"Nicky, that was very rude."</p><p>"I was joking, I didn't think she'd actually do it," his eyes were on Rio, he smiled, and then he gazed back at his mom, "I never knew you had friends like that; she seems so chill."</p><p>If only Nicholas knew of the headaches that Rio managed to give Agatha; she sighed, her eyes were low — she didn't mind Rio getting along with her son, liked it even, but something felt wrong.</p><p>"After she gets you the coffee; we're going home — also, coffee is bad for teenagers. When did you start drinking it?"</p><p>"But, mom—, you're having fun! You can stay as long as you want."</p><p>Agatha sighed. "Your father will be home soon—"</p><p>"So what?! He can be out for hours and hours, <em>fucking</em> his secretary, and you—"</p><p>Her hands were on the table; a nasty sound of slamming, head turned to face Nicholas (completely), and he felt scared.</p><p>"Your father and I, we—," Rio had come back; Agatha didn't know if she had heard what Nicholas said — judging from the look in her eyes, she had heard — and Agatha felt so embarrassed. "Let's go."</p><p>Rio handed the drink to Nicholas; he tried to smile, and so did she. Agatha had left the café, didn't speak to Rio — so, Nicholas saw the opportunity.</p><p>"Thank you, Rio; you're cool."</p><p>"I know," she didn't know what to do, if to comfort him or not, "I'm sorry your mom got mad."</p><p>"It's okay; I'll get scolded, probably. But, she isn't very strict, unlike that <em>bastard</em> I happened to have as a father."</p><p>Rio was surprised of the way he spoke of him. "He isn't as cool as me?"</p><p>"Nah; he's a dickhead. I—," he stopped, perhaps venting to her wasn't the solution; he just felt safe, "I'm sorry, got carried away. He's just so horrible to her."</p><p>"It's all good, Nicholas," her hand was on his shoulder, "I'm sure it's a lot to handle; I know we just met, but," she pulled out her phone from the pocket, "I can always lend a ear."</p><p>Nicholas's eyes were teary, he picked his phone — they exchanged contacts, smiling widely; Rio knew it was the right thing to do.</p><p>"Thank you, Rio. I'm glad you're my mom's friend; she needs you," he started walking towards the exit, "I'll text you when, uh, you know?"</p><p>"I know." Rio waved at him, he waved back.</p><p>Nicholas left the shop; his hand holding the drink, he tried to catch up with Agatha — Rio sat back on the chair, staring at her drink.</p><p>For how long could she have kept that act?</p>

<p>Rio had a dilemma; how to handle Wanda's situation — she knew that, by being '<em>friends</em>' with Agatha, there would've been a conflict of interest. That couldn't have happened, and Rio had to sort it out.</p><p>Wanda's session would've been in two days; a decision must've been taken — Rio had to decide on what to do. Her feelings for Agatha were definitely there, but so was her will to help Wanda.</p><p>So, Rio was at her local library — she had agreed to help Alice write a CV since the poor girl was looking for a job, desperately so.</p><p>"I could invent some stuff?" Alice said, laughing at Rio — and the other one smiled in return.</p><p>"See? You're already good at it!"</p><p>Alice wrote something down — suddenly, Rio's phone began ringing; the sound echoing in the whole library, and Rio had received many side–eyes.</p><p>The phone kept ringing — Rio should've ignored it, turning it off; but she didn't, she had answered.</p><p>« Who is this? » Rio asked; voice anxious, call–centers couldn't have called at those hours. It was 8 PM.</p><p>« Rio? It's me, Nicholas » his voice trembled.</p><p>Rio stood up from the seat, holding the phone with two hands; Alice worried for her.</p><p>« Oh, Nicholas! Is something wrong? »</p><p>He hesitated to answer.</p><p>« <em>Nicholas</em>? » Rio tried to gain answers — but there was a defeating silence — she felt weak.</p><p>« Mom is unwell. »</p><p>Rio could've swore that her heart had stopped beating; her palms were sweaty — for Nicholas to call her, that was basically a stranger, meant that something must've happened.</p><p>« What happened? »</p><p>A sound of a door shut; Nicholas was quiet.</p><p>« It's my father. Can you come over, I don't know what to do. I'm so sorry. » she heard sobs, cries — Rio had to go.</p><p>« Send me the address. Ok? »</p><p>« Yes. »</p><p>Nicholas had ended the call; Rio had received the address. She was ready to go, hoping that a taxi would've been able to bring her there.</p><p>"Rio?" Alice spoke, in a perplexed way; Rio stared at her — she knew that she deserved an explanation — and wanted to give her one, but not now.</p><p>"Alice, I need to go. It's urgent, I'm sorry—"</p><p>"Will you tell us what's going on?"</p><p>Rio bit her lip. "<em>I will</em>."</p><p>—</p><p>The taxi had brought her to Agatha's house; it was a palace, a giant one with many floors — Nicholas had told her that they owned the whole 9th floor. Rio found the door of the building open, her worries increasing.</p><p>Once in the elevator, she waited and waited — she had to calm down — because who knows what she would've seen there? The elevator stopped, Rio got out and rushed to the door.</p><p>Rio knocked — Nicholas opened and his eyes exhausted, face absolute mess. She stepped inside and looked around; and she noticed that there were no broken stuff, there was nothing.</p><p>"Nicholas," she looked at him, he was tired, "I have to make sure you're okay."</p><p>"I'm fine—," it was obvious that he was lying, "Rio, can you go check on my mom? She's closed in her room; I'm scared she—," there were tears, Rio had understood.</p><p>"Where's the room?"</p><p>"The last one in the hallway."</p><p>Rio nodded. "Stay here; I'll take care of this."</p><p>Her steps were quick; soon, she reached the room — Agatha was inside. Rio tried to open the door, but it was locked — and using brute force wouldn't have worked.</p><p>"Agatha," she spoke, calmy and softly, "I'm here. It's me, Rio."</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>"I know you're scared, upset even," her hand was on the door, "I'm here, you're not alone; you've been alone for so long — but, now, I'm here."</p><p>Again, no reply — Rio had to continue.</p><p>"You're afraid of showing this part of you; I know you think you're '<em>pathetic</em>', you're not," a smile appeared on her lips, "I see you; and the Agatha I know is smart, funny, gets annoyed at my jokes, can always tell when I lie and is an amazing mom — you're not pathetic, far from it."</p><p>She heard the sound of the steps — was Agatha walking towards the door?</p><p>"I'm happy to have met you because, without you," Rio realised her feelings for Agatha — she couldn't believe it — and sighed, she knew that things would've gotten way out of hand; Agatha wasn't ready for that, maybe never would've been, but Rio couldn't have ran away. "Because, I—"</p><p>Soon, the door had opened; Agatha stood there, her eyes red — she had been crying — and she was trembling, hair a mess. Rio stopped, looking at her, in a different way.</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"You really sound like a therapist."</p><p>Agatha's voice was weak, but she still tried to joke around; Rio smiled.</p><p>"No, I'm not using my therapist powers," she stared at her eyes; the blue colour, so beautifully highlighted, "I'm me. <em>This is me</em>, speaking to you. Not as a therapist, but as someone who cares for you."</p><p>Agatha stepped closer; soon, her arms were around Rio's body, wrapping her in a hug — Rio hugged back, her chin on her shoulder — she heard Agatha sob, and she held her closer. </p><p>It was fine, Rio was fine by the idea of her never confessing to Agatha; her being this close was enough.</p><p>After a while; Agatha had interrupted the hug, Rio waited, needed, her words. But, perhaps, she had to be the one speaking.</p><p>"Do you want to talk about what happened?"</p><p>"He cheated <em>again</em> — after saying he wouldn't, after saying he wouldn't have done that for Nicholas," her hands clenched into fists, "I found them on my bed; <em>fucking</em>. I was so stupid, I feel so—"</p><p>Rio held her hand, Agatha made a little jump; the softeness of her touch managed to calm her down. "It's okay. Don't tell me more. Where is he now?"</p><p>"I may have threatened him to sleep in a hotel."</p><p>There was a moment of laughs.</p><p>"He won't be here, then, I'll stay for a while. Nicholas seems very shocked — and you're not ready to talk. We can go back and do something with him, he has to see you. Okay?"</p><p>Agatha was astonished — she knew Nicholas needed her, and she needed him. "Okay, let's go," she stared at her hand, held shyly by Rio, "I—, can I have my hand back?"</p><p>"Oops," she let go of it quickly, Agatha smiled.</p><p>"And, how did you manage to get my address, to know about the situation?"</p><p>"Nicholas, well, I'll explain it later. Don't worry."</p><p>She believed her; Nicholas was her top priority.</p><p>They walked towards the living room; Nicholas sat on the couch, his eyes closed — Rio had told Agatha to sit next to him, and she did — only by then, Nicholas had opened his eyes.</p><p>"Mom! I was worried, I'm so sorry, I'm so angry at that bastard!"</p><p>"I'm sorry for making you worry."</p><p>Nicholas snapped. "You, sorry? No, mom, he should be the one apologising! You didn't do anything — you're amazing! You care for me, encourage me, and motivate me; I can't ask for a better mom," he was crying, "I love you, and can't stand seeing you unhappy."</p><p>"I'm not unhappy, Nicky. I have you, and you're my happiness. I love you."</p><p>Agatha wiped the tears off Nicholas; the boy hugged her, and she felt that her worries disappeared — Rio watched them, smiling.</p><p>"Don't cry; we could watch the show you like so much. Will that make you less worried? We can order pizza — from that restaurant you like?"</p><p>Nicholas beamed up. "That sounds amazing," he had noticed Rio. "I'm guessing Rio will stay with us?"</p><p>"Yes, she is."</p><p>Rio walked closer to them. "I am! Which show you want to watch, Nicholas?"</p><p>"I'm into 'Grey's Anatomy'; I'm watching it for Derek, he is divine."</p><p>That comment had made Rio laugh; Agatha stood up, walking towards the phone.</p><p>"I'll make the order."</p><p>—</p><p>The pizza had arrived; they were on the coffee table of the living room — the TV was on — Nicholas was hooked, Agatha struggled to follow the show, and Rio knew it by heart.</p><p>They seemed to have calmed down; Agatha was sleepy — probably relaxing after a long day — Rio sat next to her, she couldn't help but smile at her sleepiness.</p><p>She took a nearby blanket, slowly wrapping it around her; Agatha didn't understand but appreciated the gesture.</p><p>"I'm supposed to follow the show."</p><p>Rio glanced at Nicholas, hoping he wouldn't have heard, and whispered. "They all die. Please, get some rest."</p><p>Agatha laughed quietly — as she didn't want to disturb Nicholas. "What if I wanted to find out on my own?"</p><p>"You can; not all of them die — some survive, you can find out who survives."</p><p>"You're <em>such</em> a brat."</p><p>And they laughed until Nicholas shushed at them; Rio glanced back at her, smiling — tucking the sheets. "Sleep."</p><p>"You're not staying for the night?"</p><p>Rio wanted to, but couldn't. "I'd love to, but I have to go."</p><p>"So, I won't find you when I wake up."</p><p>Agatha seemed sad — but tried to act mature; Rio had her life and her duties, and she couldn't waste it on her.</p><p>"No, but I'll call you or text you."</p><p>But she had to pretend that it was enough; soon, she snuggled closer to Rio — her head rested on her shoulder — the other woman was surprised, as she tried to act normal.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>"Rio, shut up — I'm usually against physical touch," she lied, <em>horrendously</em> so, "I surrounded because I'm tired; don't you dare say something."</p><p>Rio wouldn't have done that; she was too worried of her own heart — hoping Agatha wouldn't have realised how fast it was beating.</p><p>"I was about to say 'good night' — you and your weird premonitions."</p><p>Agatha knew it was a lie. "Be quiet."</p><p>And she did — she would've kept it down — eyes looked at Nicholas, and, for an instant, he turned around to stare at Rio; he was grinning, and Rio tried to gesticulate that everything was fine, but, Nicholas couldn't remove that smirk off his lips.</p>

<p>The day of Wanda's session came; Rio felt nervous, but she had taken a decision — to stop working with her. Her own feelings were at stake. Her judgement would've been clouded because Wanda, obviously, still faced hardships when it came to remembering Agatha and wanted to talk about it (even if she insisted it wasn't true).</p><p>So, when Wanda sat on the couch; Rio sighed loudly, making the other woman look at her in a very concerned way.</p><p>"Is something wrong, Rio?"</p><p>Rio gathered all of her courage; she had been stupid — she hadn't realised how complicated her relationship with Agatha could've gotten. If it had been a simple friendship, nothing would've happened. But, now that she had realised her feelings, the truth must've come out.</p><p>"Wanda. I have to tell you something. It's not going to be easy, and you have every right to feel upset, sad, or even confused about it," she tried to keep her voice calm; but the red–head's eyes were shaking, and she knew she had messed up, "I don't even know how to say it without feeling sorry."</p><p>"Rio, you're scaring me."</p><p>But that was the last thing Rio wanted Wanda to feel; so, she had to confess.</p><p>"I know you wanted to talk about Agatha, even if you did say you didn't; but your eyes told me otherwise," Wanda lowered her gaze, she had been caught, and felt embarrassed, "I wish I could help you to elaborate what you went through — but, I can't, because, I was unaware of that a the time, I know her personally, and I know her well. I can't continue with you, my judgement—"</p><p>Wanda gasped; her eyes widened, lips parted — she wanted to say something — but the surprise of that information had managed to mess her train of thoughts.</p><p>After a long while, she decided to speak.</p><p>"Is she okay?"</p><p>Rio was amazed at hearing that — she had thought of hearing her cry, get mad at her, anything; but, that wasn't the case, there was a sparkle in her eyes, something deeper than anger.</p><p>"I can't tell you, I'm sorry."</p><p>Wanda smiled, but it was a different smile. "I see. Does it mean we can't have more sessions?"</p><p>That couldn't have happened —<em> it hurt</em>.</p><p>"I'm afraid no," she bit her lips, eyes still on her, "I can give you some names of my colleagues; I know it's not the same, but, I hope you won't abandon therapy. You and Vision made great progress, and I know that there's this weight on you of the past — I want you to know that it's possible to feel better."</p><p>What could've been said? Rio struggled to read Wanda's expressions — she hated to have messed up.</p><p>"Me and Vision actually don't think we need therapy anymore; I appreciate what you did for us — you helped us a lot. So, I have to thank you, and it's not your fault."</p><p>But it was Rio's fault; it was her idea to be friends with Agatha, to be near her, to crave her. She sighed, looking directly at Wanda.</p><p>"I can't express you how sorry I am."</p><p>"It's okay, Rio! I was glad to be in your care, we've worked hard; and I'm sure that — one of your coworkers — will be able to follow me, maybe not in the sex aspect? The more <em>emotional</em> one?"</p><p>Rio tried to smile. "I'll be more than happy to send you some names."</p><p>Wanda stood up from the couch; she wasn't angry, sad, or confused — there was a smile on her lips — making Rio feel less agitated.</p><p>"Thank you," Wanda seemed nervous. "Is it okay if I give you a hug? Sorry if it's unprofessional?"</p><p>Rio got up, as she stepped closer; a hug could've worked — her arms stretched, and Wanda rushed to hug her — they held each other close, Rio's guilt increased, and Wanda laughed a little.</p><p>Once the hug ended; Rio stared at her, with apologising eyes. "It's been wonderful to work with you; I hope you won't give up on healing."</p><p>"Don't worry, I told you, it's not your fault," her hand went on her shoulder, comforting her, "I'm happy Agatha was able to find you; I do believe you're a good person, Rio."</p><p>"Thank you, Wanda," and she was so sincere, "I'm sure you'll do great. I know it."</p><p>Wanda nodded; she gave her one, last soft smile — and she walked away. Rio felt a lot of emotions. Losing a patient had never been that painful.</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha sat on the chair of the kitchen; she was focused on her computer — hardly ever she used technologies, or anything related to Internet — to read news, sure, nothing more.</p><p>Her fingers typed fast on the key–board; an idea appeared her mind — even if she tried to send that away, failing miserably. Cheeks red, fingertips digiting something prohibited.</p><p>&lt; <em>How do I know if I'm gay</em>? &gt;</p><p>The research had been done; many results appeared. From interviews of queer people to videos of therapists explaining in a detailed way — Agatha felt overwhelmed. She refreshed the page and typed something else.</p><p>&lt; <em>Maybe I'm gay but I don't know</em> &gt;</p><p>Even Google had trouble understanding her, as the results were confused, piles of information that made Agatha sigh even more.</p><p>One last attempt.</p><p>&lt; <em>Lesbian meaning word</em> &gt;</p><p>Agatha read the description; her hands trembled when the realisation came to her — those words described her.</p><p>'Lack of attraction towards men', eyes lingered on other words, and she wondered if, maybe, there were other people like her? Old, scared, incredibly in denial.</p><p>&lt; <em>Can you be old and a lesbian?</em> &gt;</p><p>'Late bloom lesbians', that was what came out of that research; Agatha quickly gave it a read — skimming the information. It was true, there were other people like her. But, was she really? It had been a long time since the last experience with a woman, and what about Rio? What did she want from her?</p><p>There was a huge sigh coming from Agatha.</p><p>"What makes you sigh like that?" Nicholas had entered the kitchen; he was wearing an outfit — and a very detailed one. "Were you on the computer?"</p><p>"It's nothing, Nicky," Agatha wouldn't have ever told him about what she was actually doing, "I'm sorry to ask you this; have you heard from your father? He's not replying to my calls or texts. I don't know what to do."</p><p>Nicholas looked disappointed. "No, I didn't even try calling him," there was a smile on his lips, and Agatha should've said something, "I'm sure he's fine, maybe he's at work."</p><p>"And where are you going?"</p><p>"Me?" He looked panicked; as if his mother had caught him doing something shady, "I have to go out for a while; I'm studying with a friend of mine — we're working on a project — but, I'll be back late. Do you need something?"</p><p>The older woman smiled, standing up and ruffling his hair; Nicholas groaned — but he knew that his mother was really trying to make him feel better.</p><p>"I'm good, have fun."</p><p>Soon, a smirk appeared on his lips; Agatha didn't understand.</p><p>"Why don't you go out with Rio?"</p><p>Agatha felt embarrassed at the only mention of Rio — as if, minutes ago, she hadn't searched her sexuality on Google, like some sorta of teenager. Truth to be told, she had done worse things while thinking of Rio — masturbating, for example — yet, searching her sexuality seemed way more shameful.</p><p>"She's busy, she can't always spend time with me; Rio has her friends, job and responsibilities," her arms crossed, trying her best to not be selfish — even if she wished wanting to be with her, "I can't disturb her, not after that night."</p><p>"Come on, Mom! Rio likes spending time with you — don't be so dense! Give her a call, or send her a text," Nicholas tried to encourage her, but Agatha was hesitant, "I'm sure she doesn't mind."</p><p>"I'll think about it, okay? Now go, or you'll be late."</p><p>Nicholas pressed a kiss on Agatha's cheek; he began walking towards the door — once out, Agatha turned on the computer, and her research could continue.</p><p>—</p><p>"So, Rio," Alice took a sip from her juice; Jen was also there — she looked as angry as Alice, but also intrigued. "What's going on?"</p><p>"Can we have one normal hang–out? Today was so shit at work," Rio was smoking a cigarette; she looked infuriated — her conversation with Wanda lingering in her mind, and also mad at the fact that she had to give her friends an explanation.</p><p>"If you don't explain; we'll make bad reviews of your studio," Jen joined; Alice laughed at the idea. She didn't mind it — Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Okay, fine. I may have some feelings for a straight woman."</p><p>Alice gasped, and so did Jen.</p><p>"Are you serious? The one at the restaurant," Jen asked, sounding as excited as child, "I bet she's married and has kids," Rio lowered her eyes, and that gave Jen the answer she needed — she was angry. "Rio, are you out of your mind?!"</p><p>"You guys don't know the whole story."</p><p>Rio was exhausted; she couldn't believe to be talking about Agatha to her friends — and she hated that they didn't understand. Rio couldn't have explained the whole situation.</p><p>"How about telling us—"</p><p>"Rio," Alice was now speaking; she sounded worried, "I don't know what's going on, and you don't want to tell us — but, I hope she's not using you to discover her sexuality; Rio, you're not a tool, a toy — do you know what you're doing?"</p><p>Those words were able to make Rio even more upset; Alice had made a good point — but that wasn't the case — Agatha wouldn't have ever used her, not like this.</p><p>"She's not like that, Al. It's really okay."</p><p>"Being a secret, it's okay?" Alice snapped, "Rio, being used is okay?! Cheating is okay?! Rio, what the fuck—!"</p><p>"I told you—'</p><p>"Yes; 'Alice, it's okay — I know what I'm doing', you don't — and when she'll break your heart, then what?" Jen tapped on Alice's shoulder. She had to calm down; and she tried to. "I'm worried about you. You're reckless."</p><p>Rio sighed — maybe Alice was right? Agatha could be using her? If they did get together, what would've happened? These things never crossed her maybe, or maybe did, but she ignored them. Still, they didn't know the whole story — so they couldn't judge properly.</p><p>"I'm sorry, but you have no right to say that."</p><p>Jen gasped. "We do have a right, as your friends — can't we be worried?"</p><p>"You don't have to — you're making a big deal out of it — if you were my friends, you would trust me when I say that I know what I'm doing!"</p><p>There was a defeating silence; the air was cold, wind messing with their hair — Rio's cigarette had lost its fire — the three still, freezed on the spot.</p><p>"I think I'll go," Rio grabbed her stuff; pack of cigarettes, phone, and purse — as she glanced at her friends, she knew they were tired of her behaviour. "I'll, uh, text you."</p><p>They didn't reply, Rio began walking away; her hands were in her pockets — it was freezing, she had to go home and rest (desperately).</p><p>Until someone bumped into her; Nicholas.</p><p>"Rio! What are you—," he noticed her eyes; lifeless and absent, "I—, are you okay?"</p><p>"I'm fine, it's been an intense day," she tried to laugh it off (failing miserably), and he wasn't convinced. "How's your mom?"</p><p>"You didn't call her?"</p><p>"I did, but—, she was still sleeping," Rio laughed at remembering Agatha's sleepy voice. She didn't make any sense — even after many attempts of trying to understand her. "I didn't really get anything."</p><p>"Yeah, I get it; when she's half–awake, it's impossible to understand her," Nicholas laughed along — a grin appearing. "She's cute, right?"</p><p>"Very—," Rio stopped; her eyes meeting his, and soon, a blush on her cheeks, "I mean—, it was funny."</p><p>"Right, <em>very</em> funny."</p><p>Rio felt annoyed, but in a good way. "Where are you headed? It's almost 6 PM."</p><p>"Shit! I have to run," Nicholas panicked as he gazed at her — but he wanted to help her (one last time). "Why don't you visit mom?"</p><p>"Because, maybe, your father will kick my ass?"</p><p>Nicholas giggled. "He's not home; she's alone, sad, and probably searching weird stuff on the computer."</p><p>Rio tried not to think much at the mention of 'weird stuff'; either way, paying a visit to her made her heart flutter — she wanted to see her.</p><p>"Does your mom like expensive wine?"</p><p>And he smiled. "She loves it."</p>

<p>Rio stood in front of Agatha's door; a bottle of fine wine in her hand, the other tried to ring the bell — she had found the main entrance open, so, she hoped to surprise her.</p><p>A few minutes had passed; Rio was still there. '<em>Whatever</em>,' she whispered to herself — finally ringing the bell. After a while, she heard sounds of steps approaching, her heartbeat increasing.</p><p>Agatha opened the door; and Rio smiled widely — as she enjoyed the confused face of the other woman, the surprise.</p><p>"Did you know that alchool increases mental well–being?" Rio giggled, gaze softened, "I also know that's it's a great way of getting closer to people!"</p><p>She snorted, rolling her eyes, and Rio felt happy — as her smile grew further. "Did you invent the last thing?"</p><p>"Don't question my sources," she handed the bottle to Agatha, and she took it in her hands, "I heard you were alone; I can keep you company?"</p><p>"Don't you get tired of spending time with me?" Her voice was serious; she really thought of being a bother to Rio — and her worries had messed her mind. "I don't want to force you."</p><p>"What? No, I <em>like</em> being with you."</p><p>And she was honest — which made Agatha slightly blush; how could she be so straightforward, without any filters, and incredibly annoying.</p><p>"Can I get in? It's a bit cold," she asked; resembling a puppy — and that silly resemblance had managed to make her smile.</p><p>"No. Beg on your knees."</p><p>An <em>obvious</em> joke, suddenly, Rio started to kneel down — Agatha rushed to make her stand up, but she wouldn't budge; her brown eyes stared at the icy ones, laughing.</p><p>"O' <em>benevolent</em> One! I ask your permission to get in; I'm a mere human, I can't stand the cold winter—," Agatha's hand grabbed her arm, lifting her up, and Rio was still giggling — she knew that the older one would've scolded her.</p><p>"Don't pull one of these ever again," Agatha looked away; she felt shy, embarrassed, and couldn't believe Rio had really done that.</p><p>She adjusted her shirt as she awaited her scolding; but that never came — Agatha had let her in — the air was warmer.</p><p>"Do you think I should take acting classes?"</p><p>Rio took off her jacket; Agatha stared, really, <em>really</em> hard — until she couldn't anymore, and went to put the wine on a nearby table (that was in the living room).</p><p>"I don't think you need those," she teased — still couldn't let go of the embarrassment. Why did she enjoy seeing Rio on her knees? Her heart was weak.</p><p>"Really?! I knew you had an eye for real talent," she walked closer to her, and Agatha felt uneasy. "Well, aren't you going to open it?"</p><p>"You didn't have to bring anything—, you already did a lot."</p><p>Agatha was sad; feeling ashamed to have let Rio see her when she was at her weakest — it was shameful.</p><p>"Come on, I couldn't come here empty–handed."</p><p>"Right," she took the corkscrew from the drawer and opened it; Rio watched her, feeling a sudden awkwardness. She took two glasses and poured the wine in, handing one to the other woman. "Here."</p><p>They drank the wine; Rio made a weird face — perhaps she wasn't a fan of the drink, while Agatha felt relaxed. Once over, they put the glasses on the table, looking at each other.</p><p>"Want to watch a movie?"</p><p>Agatha agreed. "I have my computer in the kitchen; you can sit on the couch, I'll go take it. Wait for me."</p><p>Rio followed her request; she proceeded to sit on the couch — Agatha walked towards the kitchen, took the computer, and proceeded to get closer to the couch.</p><p>She positioned the computer on the coffee table — but she had forgotten something, and that was to cancel her research. So, when Agatha opened it — a <em>huge</em> picture of the lesbian flag appeared. Quickly, she shut the computer down, with such rapidity that scared Rio herself.</p><p>"What was that?" Rio asked, genuinely confused; Agatha's cheeks were on fire.</p><p>"Rio, turn around."</p><p>"What—? Why?"</p><p>Agatha sighed. "<em>Please</em>."</p><p>Rio did that, as a laugh escaped her lips; Agatha felt nervous, palms sweaty — she opened the computer, cancelling every inch of proof, taking a deep breath in.</p><p>"You won't tell me what you were watching, right?"</p><p>"That's right," she cancelled the last page, "I'm done, you can turn—"</p><p>Rio immediately turned around; facing Agatha — amusement in her eyes and a playful, mischievous look.</p><p>Agatha had to look away. "What?"</p><p>"I didn't know you could, well—"</p><p>"That I could, <em>what</em>?"</p><p>A laugh from the younger one, Agatha felt her patience running low; she had understood what she meant — but it wasn't like she had imagined — the truth was far more humiliating (to Agatha).</p><p>"Nothing," Rio tried to gain her seriousness, "I've been meaning to ask — what are we going to watch?"</p><p>"You can decide since you brought the wine."</p><p>Rio beamed up — what was a movie that Agatha would've enjoyed watching? It was a movie that suited her, but that she also would've enjoyed. Soon, an idea hit her.</p><p>"How about '<em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>?', it's one of my favourites."</p><p>Agatha chuckled. She didn't expect that movie to be Rio's favourite — truth to be told, she had expected an animation movie or something of that sort.</p><p>"Alright," she went to search the movie, typing fast — steady, "I didn't expect you to like these movies."</p><p>"Oh, it's because there's Meryl Streep there, she's so beautiful, and in the role of Miranda? So bossy, so dominating, so sarcastic — I love her!"</p><p>Had Rio just described her type? Agatha thought about it more than she should've already done; did any of these things describe her? Some did, but why did it matter to her?</p><p>"You sound like a teenager."</p><p>Rio laughed, and Agatha was about to start the movie — but something felt amiss, there was something left unsaid — and they both knew. The movie started; Rio was hooked on it, Agatha should've been interested — but she found herself staring at Rio, and she couldn't seem to remove her eyes off her.</p><p>Soon, the scene of Miranda's first appearance had arrived; Rio smiled — Agatha felt annoyed and had to look away. Why did it bother her so much? Did Rio ever look at her like that? No, she couldn't think of that.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>Agatha had been brought back to reality, Rio's voice sounded worried; she was acting weird, and it was a matter of a few minutes before she would've noticed.</p><p>"I'm fine, why do you say that?'</p><p>Rio giggled. "You've been staring at me a lot — am I more interesting than the movie?"</p><p>She was — and that wasn't even up for discussion; Agatha felt nervous, and a sense of guilt overcame her.</p><p>"<em>Maybe</em>?"</p><p>It was said with pure irony — but Rio had stopped the movie, and she stared at Agatha; there was a red colour on her cheeks, it was very obvious, and the other one didn't understand.</p><p>"Rio—"</p><p>"Agatha." Rio sounded serious; her eyes stared directly at hers. "Can we talk?"</p><p>Agatha's hands started to get sweaty; she had a hunch on what Rio would've said, but wanted to hear it anyway — she needed to, and couldn't pretend to be blind forever.</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>"About us."</p><p>Rio had to be careful with her words — something said wrong, and it could've ruined everything — but, also, the truth had to come out; it couldn't be in the shadows anymore.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio thought of the words Alice had told her; about her being a 'toy', a way to find out her sexuality, of her being in the 'shadows' of a husband, about her being 'used', she took a deep breath, air seemed to never be enough.</p><p>"I know that you have troubles with your sexuality, and I'm not asking you to tell me; it's fine to not have labels but—," she bit her lip, "I've developed feelings for you, <em>romantic ones</em> — I know your situation is complicated, your husband, and stuff — but, something tells me that you like me too."</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened, and Rio got closer to her — their legs touched — and all Agatha could think of was that touch; she was sweating, her blood pressure skyrocketing.</p><p>"I don't want you to throw everything away for me — and I don't know the reason as to why you can't divorce, but," her hands went to hold hers, Rio noticed how sweaty they were, and she smiled, "I wanted you to know how you feel about me—"</p><p>"<em>I'm not gay, Rio</em>."</p><p>Those words were heavy; they pierced through Rio's heart — she let go of her hands, the brown eyes were watery, and Agatha realised what she had done.</p><p>"But, Agatha—"</p><p>"No." What was she even saying? She didn't want to — but words kept coming out of their own; image of her mother appearing, as a flashback of what had happened to her and Wanda.</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>"Rio, you listen to me," Agatha was shaking; she stood up from the couch, eyes trembling. "You've been leading me on — all of this time, all of your words, your kindness, just to make me believe that I'm something I'm not!"</p><p>Rio also stood up, facing her. "Oh, I've been 'leading you on', and you've been using me to understand what you like."</p><p>Agatha flinched — what was she even saying? Those accusations seemed not hers; as if someone was controlling her.</p><p>"That's not true. You know it's not!"</p><p>"Right," she sighed. "I feel so stupid."</p><p>There were tears in her eyes; Agatha wanted to hold her, to reassure her — she didn't know what to do, what to say, and the motive of why her heart ached, and it was so painful.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I need some time alone — to reflect, and all. I will text you later," Rio walked towards the door, taking her jacket — the steps were fast, and Agatha had tried to catch up with her.</p><p>"Rio, wait—," Agatha took her by the wrist, and Rio had turned around, "I, please, listen to me—, I meant—"</p><p>Soon, the doorbell rang, in a way so recognisable to Agatha, who froze on the spot, because she knew that it meant one thing — <em>Ralph</em> <em>had returned</em>.</p>

<p>Ralph entered the house — using the keys, since no one was answering him at the ninth attempt of ringing the bell; once inside, he stared at Rio, and he had never looked more <em>confused</em> in his life.</p><p>"Agatha," he said, sounding calmer than usual, "I didn't expect to have guests over — but that's fine."</p><p>Rio was one second away from choking him; Agatha had the right to have friends (<em>not–so–friends</em>) over, and he couldn't tell her that since he had done worse.</p><p>"She's, uh," her icy eyes stared at her, "I mean, she's a friend of mine."</p><p>"Right," Rio decided to play along, as she couldn't have made a scene — it would've only worsen Agatha's situation; she had noticed how nervous, anxious she was — and she had to be discrete. "I was about to leave, so—"</p><p>"You have a familiar face," Ralph preceeded her, perhaps remembering the time at the restaurant — where they briefly stared at each other, "I think I've seen you somewhere."</p><p>"No, you didn't."</p><p>Ralph flinched as he started doubting his own memories. Could <em>he</em> be wrong?</p><p>Agatha noticed the atmosphere getting awkward and tense, and she had to do something about it — the best course of action was to let Rio go, but that would've meant staying alone with Ralph, since Nicholas wasn't home yet; but she couldn't have forced Rio to stay, not after <em>what</em> had happened.</p><p>"I brought chicken soup — the store was open, and I brought some for Nicholas too," Ralph had shown a plastic bag, the food in it, "I was hoping we could eat us three, and we could enjoy the evening?"</p><p>Agatha knew what he meant. "Nicholas isn't home, and I'm not sure if I want to <em>enjoy</em> the evening with you."</p><p>Ralph sighed, then he stared at Rio. "You can join us for dinner; the soup is enough for three people — it can't go wasted."</p><p>Rio didn't want to; she was about to refuse when, suddenly, her eyes met Agatha's — she had a stressed, <em>preoccupied</em> look, and Rio knew that she couldn't have left her alone. For now, she would've joined them — hoping to buy Agatha enough time and to let her mind calm down.</p><p>"Sure. Thank you for inviting me," she tried to smile — but something felt incredibly off. "I'm Rio."</p><p>"Ralph," he handed the bag to Agatha, as he now fully stared at Rio, "I'm happy to meet a friend of my wife — she's usually shy."</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes; Ralph felt to have said the wrong thing — he felt a sudden sense of worry.</p><p>"The soup is from Agatha's favourite restaurant, I thought it might've been a good thing."</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio, and Rio stared at Ralph; the stares were so full of doubts, anxieties, and anger — the air could be touched, broken.</p><p>"<em>How kind of you</em>, Ralph." Rio managed to say — before turning around and heading to the kitchen. "I'll help Agatha heat up the soup."</p><p>Ralph had made himself <em>'comfortable'</em> at his house; Agatha and Rio were alone, in the kitchen, heating up the soup — they didn't speak, or not yet. It was after a while that, Agatha, had decided to say something.</p><p>"Rio, I—"</p><p>Soon, Ralph had stepped inside of the room; he looked at Agatha — and he took one step closer, positioning himself in between her and Rio, interrupting whatever was about to be said.</p><p>"I've noticed a bottle of wine. Did you buy it for us? Even though it's open, maybe you were thristy."</p><p>Rio glared at him. "I bought it for Agatha. We drank it together — I hope you don't mind."</p><p>Agatha looked down, Ralph could feel his patience running low — was Rio challenging him? But why? Either way, for his own sake, he decided to put up a friendly mask.</p><p>"I don't mind at all — I guess you didn't know I was about to come home."</p><p>"<em>That's right</em>."</p><p>The soup was about to be ready; Agatha coughed, bringing the attention back to herself — Rio stepped back, and Ralph proceeded to step closer — soon, the food would've been eaten.</p><p>Rio felt out of place — in a house that wasn't really hers, with Agatha, who also wasn't hers; why had she agreed to a dinner? But the motive was obvious — not leave Agatha alone. The irritating feeling of seeing Ralph continued to grow, stronger than before, each second more.</p><p>"I'll go set the table," she said — even if she didn't want to.</p><p>"No, Rio, please," Ralph walked away from Agatha, "I should be the one — please, you're our guest."</p><p>And so, Ralph set the table; Rio stood there, alone — even if Agatha was there, next to her.</p><p>—</p><p>The soup was served — Rio wasn't really hungry, as well as Agatha — Ralph was the only one eating in a <em>voracious</em> way (scaring both of them).</p><p>After a while of that, Ralph stopped, gazing at Rio — as a smile grew on his lips.</p><p>"So, Rio—, where did you meet Agatha? She barely goes out; let alone can make friends," he was smirking, laughing even — Rio felt so <em>incredibly</em> annoyed — the disrespect was too much, and Agatha looked down at her own dish.</p><p>Rio glared at him. "We actually met—," she thought about it — as she couldn't have said that she was her previous therapist — so, she had to come up with a story, "I met her in a café — she was with her son, Nicholas, and we really got along; she really is amazing, and I'm glad to be friends with her — I don't think she struggles to make friends, since she's the one who approached me."</p><p>Ralph was speechless — Agatha too busy to pretend that the story Rio had told (without an incredible, and convincing voice) was true; there was a feeling of gratitude, and her heart couldn't seem to calm down.</p><p>"Oh, that's—," he tried and tried to say something, but everything seemed useless, "I mean, I'm happy for her."</p><p>Agatha knew he was lying — he had <em>never</em> been happy for her.</p><p>"And what do you do for a living?" Ralph asked again, and Rio considered throwing the soup at him.</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>"I work with people," she half–lied, saying her real job would've been risky.</p><p>Agatha sighed — was that the best she could say? While, Ralph, was intrigued and had many questions on the matter.</p><p>"Oh, so a doctor?"</p><p>Luckily, Ralph had taken the bait.</p><p>"Yes, something like <em>that</em>."</p><p>The man seemed enthusiastic about this recent discovery as he stared at her — gazing hard.</p><p>"It's good to have a doctor as a friend — it comes handy, especially since some doctors tend to lie about conditions," his eyes met the ones of Agatha's, who tried hard to keep up the act, "I mean—, that's what seems to happen these days."</p><p>Rio admired how hard Ralph was trying to hold a conversation. "You seem to know a lot; what do you do for a living?"</p><p>"Me? Oh, I work in a <em>prestigious</em> company! I don't think you've heard of it, it's—"</p><p>"So, you work in an office, but you have a saying on what doctors do and don't do?" Her voice was severe — scolding had never been more amusing, "I think you're aware of how many years doctors have to study in order to work; and yes, sometimes the diagnosis are wrong, and other times are completely different, but it's normal to make mistakes — that's why they study hard to prevent them, as much as possible."</p><p>Rio had a bias because, <em>technically</em>, she had studied as much as doctors to graduate from college — it was tedious study, with many hardships and moments of 'giving up'. Why had Ralph even a saying in this?</p><p>"And <em>yet</em>, you work in an office."</p><p>Agatha positioned a hand over her lips — she was trying hard to not laugh, Rio noticed, and now, she wanted to laugh too; Ralph's face was red, perhaps due to the anger of the moment.</p><p>"She's right, Ralph — Rio is a good doctor, and office work can't really be compared to saving lives," Agatha had taken the leads of the conversation — and Rio was surprised, "I think they really do save lives; even if, sometimes, patients can be <em>stubborn</em>, and they don't always understand their conditions."</p><p>Rio lifted her head — staring at Agatha. Was she trying to say something to her?</p><p>"Sometimes," Agatha continued — Ralph started to worry, "I really think the patient is in <em>denial</em> about their conditions because — all of their life — they were forced to live without even thinking about the possibility of having an '<em>illness</em>', but—," she met eyes with Ralph, and he was concerned, which was weird. "Sorry—, I got off track."</p><p>"No, Agatha," she smiled, "I think it's the doctor's job to make the patient understand that, yes, sometimes a 'illness' is a part of us; we shouldn't fear it, nor be ashamed of it," she wanted, craved to be near her — but couldn't.</p><p>"Uh, what if the condition is terminal—? Shouldn't the doctor heal the patient?"</p><p>Ralph was weirded out — Rio, for once, could understand where that came from. Speaking of <em>queerness</em> as a '<em>illness</em>' may have not be the best idea — being gay wasn't an illness, or something that needed to be cured — but that was the only way for her and Agatha to communicate. They understood each other. That's what mattered.</p><p>"Where's the bathroom?" Rio stood up; she needed to clear her head — Ralph gave her the directions, and she headed towards the room — leaving the 'couple' alone.</p><p>Once Rio was gone, Ralph stared at Agatha.</p><p>"Your friend is a rather interesting one."</p><p>Agatha could agree to that; Rio had always been interesting, charming, so painfully smart, beautiful—</p><p>"So, how have you been?" Ralph asked — seeing an opportunity to reconcile with Agatha, but she was mad at him.</p><p>"What do you think? I found you, <em>fucking</em> on our bed, when you not only promised me, but also told me you'd promise for Nicholas's sake, that you would've never cheated again!"</p><p>Ralph looked down, lips parted — but nothing came out of him — not even an apology, even if Agatha didn't need one. So, after a minute of silence, he began to talk again.</p><p>"I know that I—"</p><p>"At least, you could've tried for Nicholas's sake! I get that you don't give a damn about me but he—," her eyes were teary, she had never been more hurt, "Nicholas doesn't deserve this — do you know how hard it's for him?!"</p><p>"That kid never liked me," Ralph's fingers tapped on the table, the wooden material made a weird sound — tap, and then stop, "I know it's your doing; you put weird ideas to him! He's sensitive, hangs out with weird people, and is into weird stuff!"</p><p>Agatha stood up, the chair almost flew. "Don't talk about him that way! Nicholas is turning into a wonderful man, a man that you'll never, <em>ever</em>, be!"</p><p>Ralph sighed, and he continued to eat — dropping that conversation, as Agatha did. Minutes passed — two, five, and then, Rio hadn't returned from the restroom.</p><p>Agatha was worried — she told Ralph that she would've checked on her, and he barely replied to her; so, she walked towards the room.</p><p>The door was slightly open; Rio was inside, looking at herself in the mirror, and the water flowed in the sink — it flowed, and flowed. Agatha opened the door, and got inside. Rio was surprised.</p><p>Rio sighed. "Sorry, I just needed a minute."</p><p>The sink was closed — she was about to walk outside, but Agatha stopped her — locking the door with the key; they were inside, <em>trapped</em> — Rio tried to keep it cool.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>"We have to talk."</p><p>Rio stepped closer, arms crossed. "I think you were pretty clear — I'll forget about you, <em>move on</em>, and I shouldn't have told you those stuff. I've been pressed about it because a friend of mine told me that, but I know you'll never use me — ever. I was stupid to believe that."</p><p>Agatha put her hands on the wall — imprisoning Rio inside her arms; she looked panicked, her back rested on the wall, still, the older one wanted to fix what she had done.</p><p>"Your friend isn't <em>exactly</em> wrong — I've been so confused, Rio. You make me feel things I never thought I'd feel, and I find these feelings so new, confusing, and exciting."</p><p>She got closer to Rio, and the brown eyes were hypnotised — Rio stared at her lips. They were <em>dangerously</em> close, and she tried hard to refrain herself.</p><p>"But, I have to figure things out — I tried doing some research on the matter, and I know what I am, but a part of me denies it."</p><p>Rio laughed. "That's what was on the computer?"</p><p>And Agatha looked away, embarrassed. "Yes, I was looking up stuff — terms, experiences, everything."</p><p>Agatha was captured by Rio's smile and laughs — she knew that, by staying this close, something bad would've happened; she quickly distanced herself from her.</p><p>"I need time—"</p><p>Rio took her hands, squeezing them. "It's okay — you can not like me, I don't mind. But I want you to understand who you are and don't hide anymore. Do it for <em>yourself</em>, not me. Okay?"</p><p>Agatha hugged her — and Rio hugged back; their bodies shared warmth, they felt safe — Agatha had to understand, to go through what she had been denying for ages, and Rio would've been there for her. Liking her back, or not — she couldn't wait for the best version of herself to come.</p><p>"We should go—,"</p><p>Agatha tightened the hug, their breasts touching — and the air was running short — she knew they had to go back, Ralph would've been suspicious, but she was tired.</p><p>"Stay for a while, Rio."</p><p>Rio melted at her touch — but she knew that they had to go.</p><p>"Agatha, he's one second away from kicking my ass — I don't think that's wise."</p><p>Rio's hands caressed her back; tracing a line with the fingers — Agatha let out a small sigh — and that made Rio bury her face even more.</p><p>"That shouldn't be a problem since you go to the gym; his weak points are his balls — kick him there, and you'll win."</p><p>There was a huge laugh, and Rio couldn't believe what she had just heard — Agatha sounded so serious, and that was the funniest part.</p><p>"You want me to fight your husband?"</p><p>Agatha interrupted the hug — staring, facing Rio. "That'd be amusing."</p><p>"Agatha, you're really something."</p><p>They both laughed; after a few minutes — they agreed to walk back to their seats; Rio felt better, and so Agatha.</p><p>—</p><p>After a (long) while, they returned to the table — Ralph was on his phone, he had already ate all of the soup; he looked stressed, angry, but tired the most.</p><p>Rio had told them that she had to get home — Ralph barely said something to her — he stood up and walked towards his room; Agatha was the one to walk her to the door.</p><p>With the jacket in her hands, she stood outside of the apartment's door — looking at Agatha, lips curled; she was about to go but had to say goodbye to her (properly).</p><p>"Thanks for uh—, the soup, and we should continue the movie, since, well—"</p><p>Agatha smiled. "I have a feeling you watched the movie many, many times."</p><p>"You don't have to expose me like that," her eyes were playful, staring at hers, "I also wanted to watch it with you—, it'd be nice. Maybe next time? You could come to my place?"</p><p>"I wonder how your place is; an absolute mess, I suppose."</p><p>Rio was now laughing vividly. "There's only <em>one</em> way to find out."</p><p>The duo laughed — giggling, and occasionally staring at one another; there were many things Agatha wanted to say, but felt as if they didn't matter much, and Rio, too, could've said something — but didn't have enough courage to do so.</p><p>"I'll take my leave—"</p><p>As Rio was about to walk away — with a rapid movement — Agatha had taken her by the chin, she leaned in, and pressed a <em>kiss</em> on Rio's cheek; only after a two, maybe three seconds, the realisation had hit her.</p><p>Quickly, she took a few steps back — Rio's face was red, of a pure red — and Agatha had to say something, anything. Why had she done that?</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"Text me when you get home, alright?!"</p><p>Agatha had shut the door — Rio was probably still outside, not moving; her fingers touched her lips — the warmth of the kiss still lingered.</p><p>
<em>Why had she done that?</em>

<p>Agatha was in Hela's studio, as she rested on the couch, trying her best to not look nervous (she was, desperately so), and Hela did <em>everything</em> to make her feel comfortable.</p><p>"So, Agatha, I see that Ralph isn't going to join us today, and I've told him to be here. What happened? If you don't mind telling me."</p><p>There was a tired, defeated laugh; Hela understood that action, that sound — and it meant one thing: she had given up.</p><p>"He cheated <em>again</em>," her eyes met hers, as she barely kept them still, "I don't have to tell you that the 'date' went horribly; it was just not that good, I guess."</p><p>Hela had a saddening look on her face, but she somehow had a hunch on how things would've gone — <em>nevertheless</em> — she had to help her and would've done that. It was time to face the truth — since she had Rio's notes about her dilemmas with her sexuality, she had to use them properly.</p><p>"Agatha, would you like to explore a new topic—, your <em>sexuality</em>, perhaps?"</p><p>Agatha stared at her, looking distressed — but Hela wasn't judging her, anything of that sort, and the smile on her lips was soft; she felt as if she could trust her — she was at her limits, after all. And, indeed, she couldn't have been in the shadows forever. Eventually, it would've come to light.</p><p>"Yes, I must. I've been avoiding it for, <em>well</em>, all of my life."</p><p>There was a long pause — Hela was calm, and Agatha simply wasn't; <em>how could she</em>?</p><p>"I've had—, a, well—"</p><p>"A girlfriend?"</p><p>That was the word; she had never used it before, or maybe did, but it happened a <em>long</em> time ago, and Hela reassured her, smiling, and she could continue.</p><p>"Yes. It didn't last long; my mother found out and, well—, she made sure I'd never do something like that again."</p><p>Hela had to understand. "What did she do, Agatha?"</p><p>"My mother is very powerful; she threatened to fire my girlfriend's father and to make sure he'd never work again — in all of his life," Agatha's eyes were teary, the guilt still managed to make her cry, "I had to end things — they weren't doing okay, economically. So, I had to—, Hela, I had to—"</p><p>"Agatha," her voice sounded caring and full of reassurance, understanding her pain, completely, "I know that what you did was very altruistic — and you prioritised her, but, in the process, you got hurt."</p><p>Agatha lowered her gaze, sighing. "It's complicated; she made me go to weird camps, organised by the church, to sort of '<em>convert</em>' me," she, finally, met the therapist's eyes, and they were worried. Was she doing the right thing? "I, naturally, had to face many hardships — so, after a while, and after many, uh, 'therapies', I learned how to keep at 'bay' these feelings."</p><p>Hela crossed her arms; she was thinking, probably trying to figure out the best course of actions, the right words to say, Agatha realised that, and that scared her. It mattered to hear about her judgement and her opinions, more than anything.</p><p>"Whenever I stared at a woman, and if my mother decided that I was staring in a 'lustful' way — I had to be punished; I was a teen, and these 'punishments' lasted until I got married to Ralph."</p><p>Agatha attempted a smile; Hela tried not to let too many emotions show, and it was hard.</p><p>"<em>In some ways</em> — I'm glad I got married; because it means I'm safe? Ralph got a job at my mother's company in order for him not to divorce from me, and a good pay — he cares about his career, more than anything. And, I—"</p><p>She stopped; soon, she realised that she had said too much — and Hela, after all, was a sex therapist, and these things were probably out of her league, probably too complicated to handle.</p><p>"Sorry, is this too much? It's not really '<em>sex–related</em>', and I may have made you uncomfortable."</p><p>Hela closed her notes, positioning them on the coffee table, and she gazed at her, fully — even if Agatha felt weak, vulnerable.</p><p>"Agatha, thank you for telling me this. You were very brave, and I'm proud of you—! It must've been hard, and you're strong," Hela meant every of her words, and she had to realise that — she wasn't just doing '<em>her job</em>', but, she wanted to help Agatha, "I'm sorry you had to go through that — you didn't deserve it, no one does, and I can help you; if you'd let me."</p><p>Agatha wanted to; but she hadn't said the whole truth — she gathered enough courage.</p><p>"I, also, have fallen for someone — a woman."</p><p>Hela smiled tenderly, happy to have heard that, incredibly happy — her smile had managed to calm Agatha, even if not completely; there was a mutual understanding.</p><p>"That's beautiful, Agatha, don't be ashamed of it, everyone deserves love, and you shouldn't feel bad."</p><p>Oh, if only she knew that Agatha was talking about Rio, <em>her ex</em> — but that had to be a secret; as she wanted to avoid useless drama.</p><p>"But Hela, I'm married. Isn't that cheating? I should feel, at least, ashamed.'</p><p>"Agatha, he cheated too; you don't love him, and he cares about other things, and you're together because of some sort of agreement — is it really impossible to divorce?"</p><p>Agatha pondered — perhaps there was a way? It had to be; her mother used to check on them every once in a while. Maybe she could've tried talking to her about the <em>possibility</em> of divorcing? Leaving Rio out of the equation and highlighting how bad of a husband Ralph was. But, rumours would've spread like wildfire, and her possible divorce would've brought shame to her mother, her family. Maybe there wasn't a way.</p><p>"I don't know—, I don't think so," she sounded defeated, destined to a path that wasn't really hers, "I know that there isn't a way, and I have to accept it."</p><p>Hela realised how complicated things were, but, she wanted to help Agatha, saving her from that life; she was a therapist, her therapist, she would've used her all to come up with a solution — or just supporting her, encouraging her to find a safe route.</p><p>"There's a way, Agatha," she was determined, and her eyes sparkled, "I'll help you find one — don't give up yet."</p><p>Agatha smiled. "You shouldn't waste your time with me — I'm a bit of a lost cause."</p><p>"Oh, Agatha, what kind of therapist would I be if I gave up at the first difficulty?"</p><p>Now, there was a sincere laugh; Hela was happy, and Agatha sounded reassured — trusting her didn't seem that bad and perhaps could've worked.</p><p>After a while, Agatha stared at her — again; eyes insicure and doubtful — a few more minutes, and the session would've been over. Agatha had to ask one more question.</p><p>"Hela, do you think it's okay for me, uh, love a woman? I mean, I don't know how to do it, it's been so long—, and I have no idea if that's okay, and—"</p><p>"Agatha, it's totally fine. I know that there are scars in you, but with the right person—, those scars can heal, not <em>disappear</em> completely, but slowly heal. So, yes, it's okay, and, trust me, I, too, have no idea how to properly love — we all love differently, and it's up to you! That's the challenge, and I think you should challenge yourself; ask her on a date, and see how it goes!"</p><p>Agatha felt better, and so, so excited; the clock ticked, and she stood up from the couch, Hela watched her — they looked at each other, smiling.</p><p>"Alright, we did great today, Agatha!"</p><p>"It appears so."</p><p>—</p><p>Rio was in her room — revising some notes on her patients; the intent was there, the concentration wasn't, as her mind wandered to Agatha, and her only. How could she have gotten some work done?</p><p>She thought of her lips on the skin, of how soft they were — and couldn't help but wonder, did she mean it? Of course, she was conflicted and everything, but she didn't want to force her.</p><p>It was better to focus, and so she did.</p><p>After an hour, she had managed to do most of the work — perhaps she could've gone out for a coffee? She deserved it.</p><p>So, she dressed up, took the money and keys, and went out. The café was near her house, she used to go there all the time with Jen and Alice — she knew that place very well, and all of her memories were there.</p><p>Rio entered inside, and there was chaos; the employees were scared, and she tried to understand why — she walked towards the counter and there was a woman, an old woman, with long, grey hair. </p><p>She gazed at the poor barista, and the girl trembled in fear — maybe she could've helped?</p><p>"Excuse me?" Rio stepped closer to the woman — and she had turned around, her expression was severe, eyes meeting hers, but she didn't fear them. "You're making other clients there."</p><p>The woman glared at her — scanning her, head to toe. "I'm the only one here — and I've been trying to order a coffee, but this <em>dammed</em> barista gets the order wrong!"</p><p>Rio stared at the barista on the verge of tears, and then she looked back at her.</p><p>"I'm also trying to get coffee — I'm busy, and all, but this girl is new; it's her first day, there's really no need to antagonise her."</p><p>She snapped. "Her first day, and already this useless — I should tell her manager to fire her."</p><p>Somehow, she felt as if she had messed things up. Rio had to try a gentler approach.</p><p>"Just, what do you want — ma'am?"</p><p>"A black coffee."</p><p>Rio fully turned to see the barista, and she whispered. "Alright, I know this is hard — pretend that I order that drink, okay? I'm waiting for it. No one is here — <em>but me</em>."</p><p>The barista sighed, and she tried the order again; after minutes, after many words of encouragement from Rio — she had done the order, handing it to the woman.</p><p>"T–Thanks, sorry for the wait."</p><p>The woman barely looked at her — her eyes were on Rio, there was an amusing smile; something emerging in her mind.</p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p>"Rio."</p><p>"My name is Evanora," she said, proudly and fiercely — as she took a sip of her coffee, entertained by something that only she knew about.</p><p>"Right, uh—," there was an indescribable awkwardness, as she hadn't really asked for her name, "I better get my coffee and get back to work."</p><p>Evanora looked at the clock of the café; it was getting late — and she seemed to have urgent matters to attend, Rio could tell that she was someone to not mess with.</p><p>"Working this late?"</p><p>Why was she initiating a small–talk?</p><p>"Yeah, my work is like that—, you know, I have bills to pay and trying not to starve."</p><p>The older woman let out a small laugh; she seemed calmer, but still, Rio felt uneasy — an incredible sense of worry overcoming her. Maybe she had to play along?</p><p>"Anyway, it was nice meeting you—, I'm sure you have something else to do, right?"</p><p>A sigh from Evanora — she pulled out her phone, "I almost forgot, I have to meet my daughter and her husband," another sigh, "I'm running a little late."</p><p>Rio was glad. "Well, enjoy your evening! I hope you have fun."</p><p>"Right, <em>fun</em>," then, she walked out of the café.</p><p>The barista looked at Rio. She was flustered and attempted to speak — but failed, after many attempts — so, she was the one initiating the talk.</p><p>"Uh, one iced–coffee. Thanks!"</p><p>"Thank you for standing up for me—, she is very scary."</p><p>"No problem, she was being an asshole."</p><p>Suddenly, the girl laughed — Rio found herself laughing, too; the drink was made, handed it to her — and then, she got out of the café, thanking the barista (and reassuring her).</p><p>—</p><p>It was about 1 AM, Rio was on her bed — she tried falling asleep. Perhaps getting the coffee was a bad idea? The damage was done, and there was no need to cry over spilt milk. Soon, as her eyes were closed, she heard a notification — who could it be?</p><p>She groaned and sat on the bed; cursing herself for not having put her phone on silent mode — whoever it was, she would've got really mad.</p><p>The text was from Agatha — they hadn't spoken in a while — after the atrocious dinner, things had gotten quiet; Rio was full of work, and Agatha busy.</p><p>
<em>Are you up?</em>
</p><p>Rio smiled tenderly — she had to reply.</p><p>
<em>Nope.</em>
</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio waited and waited — but there wasn't an answer; had she not got the joke?</p><p>
<em>Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you so late.</em>
</p><p>Somehow, Rio felt bad.</p><p>
<em>You're not bothering me. I'm surprised you texted me this late — something's wrong?</em>
</p><p>Again, another few minutes of silence — only for Agatha to type in.</p><p>
<em>Can I call you? Just for a minute?</em>
</p><p>A grin appeared on Rio's lips; she hit the button call — the ringing sound went on, and on, until Agatha answered.</p><p>« Rio, good evening. » Her voice sounded tired — as if she was trying to hold back the tears, and that made her worried.</p><p>« It's a little too late for evening, but, good evening to you, too. »</p><p>Agatha laughed — the sound echoing in Rio's ears, she felt happy; her stomach <em>twirled</em>, and her heart was about to burst. The laughs lasted for a few seconds, then silence. Rio had to press.</p><p>« Is everything alright? »</p><p>There was a huge pause and sound of breathing — Rio's concern grew.</p><p>« Could be better — talking to you helps, so—, thanks »</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks burning, and she giggled awkwardly — she resembled a school–girl that was dealing with her first crush.</p><p>« I'm guessing you can't talk about your day — maybe I can tell you mine? »</p><p>Again, another soft laugh.</p><p>« Alright, Rio. I can listen for a while, make it quick. I don't have much time. »</p><p>And so, it began. Rio talked and talked, Agatha listened carefully — she seemed attentive and genuinely interested; the conversation went on for a few minutes, and soon, the words seemed to have already finished.</p><p>« That's all — I tried to work a bit, but I couldn't concentrate well. »</p><p>« Why's that? »</p><p>Rio began to be nervous — as her fingers trembled.</p><p>« I was thinking about stuff. »</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>« <em>About me</em>? »</p><p>The time seemed to have frozen; Rio let out a small giggle — hiding would've been useless, and she knew it — but why was Agatha being so bold? What had happened?</p><p>« Perhaps. »</p><p>Now, Agatha was giggling, too — Rio could only imagine her smile, how her lips were curled, and wished to be with her; but couldn't.</p><p>« Are you free tomorrow? »</p><p>Was she free? Not quite, in the afternoon — after many, and many sessions; maybe in the evening, but she would've been too tired to properly function.</p><p>« Asking me out, Agatha? »</p><p>« That's the intent. »</p><p>Rio could've done it.</p><p>« In the evening, yes. Around 7 PM? A bit later than that. »</p><p>« Can I pick you up from work? »</p><p>It was sweet of her; but Rio, especially after many hours of work, would've been in a horrible state — messy clothes, hair, make–up.</p><p>« Yeah, but—, uh, I won't look as my usual self; tomorrow's going to be hard. I will probably look like shit. »</p><p>« Don't worry — you always look nice to me. »</p><p>Her whole face began to burn; Rio was confused at such words, Agatha had always been so cautious with her words.</p><p>« I'm hanging up if you say <em>one</em> more cheesy thing. »</p><p>Agatha hummed in surprise.</p><p>« Are we getting shy, Vidal? »</p><p>Rio sighed — more than shy, she was, dangerously, getting hotter; and that would've made the whole situation complicated.</p><p>« Night, Agatha. »</p><p>And then, she had hung up; her hand went over her chest, placing it on her heart — it was beating fast and on a steady rhythm.</p><p>Rio decided to lie on the bed, as she was about to turn off the phone — a text from Agatha.</p><p>
<em>Didn't know you could get this shy...</em>
</p><p>What was she doing?</p><p>
<em>Sleep!!!</em>

<p>Rio was in her studio; the conversation she had with Agatha, so late at night, still lingered in her mind. That was probably wrong of her, because her focus had to be on her clients.</p><p>But, <em>nevertheless</em>, she still managed to do her job — successfully; after many, many hours of work, only one patient was left.</p><p>The patient had recently begun working with Rio — but she had done so much progress; and she couldn't help but feel proud.</p><p>An hour later, the session was over; she had reassured her and congratulated on the progress made. Then, the patient left, and Rio started to feel nervous, real nervous.</p><p>Her '<em>hang–out</em>' with Agatha was nearby — Rio began closing the studio extremely slowly, staring to get self–aware of the situation. She didn't know Agatha's intentions, but something felt out of place, and Rio was genuinely confused.</p><p>After closing the whole place, she received a text from Agatha; she had told her that she was outside, with her car, and ready to go.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath — her purse in her hands, keys, and she went outside – she tried adjusting her shirt, hair, but failing miserably. Then, she closed the door behind and began walking towards the car (she had spotted it, and couldn't pretend she didn't).</p><p>Once near the car, with a little courage, she opened the passenger's door; entering inside and staring at Agatha, and, <em>oh</em> — she was wearing the dress she had seen at the restaurant, the same, beautiful one.</p><p>Rio squinted her eyes. "Hi, Agatha."</p><p>"You weren't kidding — you look an absolute mess after work."</p><p>"Goodbye, Agatha."</p><p>As she was about to open the door, Agatha had stopped her, taking her by the wrist, making her sit — <em>once more</em> — and Rio gasped at how much force she had used.</p><p>"I was joking, Rio. You look nice, it suits you."</p><p>Rio began to feel flustered, eyes meeting hers — Agatha had no problem in keeping the stare, while Rio found it hard; she was, definitely, more confused than before.</p><p>"Thanks—," terrified, she smiled, "I also think you look beautiful; the dress is my favourite, and it seems like this hang–out is going to be a special occasion."</p><p>Agatha diverted her eyes, staring at the wheel of the car. "This isn't an 'hang–out'."</p><p>"Oh? So, what is it?"</p><p>Finally, her gaze was able to meet hers — her bluish eyes trembled, and the brown ones were perfectly still; Rio felt the sudden tension.</p><p>"<em>It's a date</em>."</p><p>Rio jumped on her seat, almost passing out. "Wha—"</p><p>"Yes. It's a date, I thought it was obvious."</p><p>It wasn't obvious, <em>at all</em>. Rio found it hard to contain the sudden blush, her hands sweaty, and she almost could feel her heart explode. What was Agatha doing?</p><p>"You really didn't specify."</p><p>"Well, since you're so smart, I thought of giving you a challenge."</p><p>A subtle, timid laugh from Rio; her fingers pinched the bridge of her nose — and she inhaled, exhaled, only to return to her normal–self.</p><p>"Alright, Agatha. May I ask you what's going on? First, you tell me that you need time, which I was okay with, then, you come to pick me up, saying it's a date and flirt?" Rio still laughed, and Agatha couldn't help but feel shy. "What happened? Did someone hit you with a rock?"</p><p>"I discussed things with my therapist, and I—, I don't know what I'm doing. I still feel weird, to, you know—, this. But, I wanted to try, and it's just one little date—, nothing too scandalous. I still feel guilty and resentful of being me, but Hela said I should challenge myself."</p><p>Rio, for once, was grateful to Hela; Agatha looked confident and incredibly attractive, and that's what mattered. It was a date, yes, but maybe, there was nothing to fear — she was Agatha, and things would've been fine.</p><p>"Where are we going?"</p><p>Agatha brightened up. "Oh, I wanted to go to the movies, after, maybe, relax in a bar?"</p><p>"The movies? What does the <em>great</em> Agatha want to watch?"</p><p>After a while, as she fought the embarrassment, Agatha managed to reply.</p><p>"Actually, you can decide. Horror or drama?"</p><p>"Oh, please—, horror, <em>obviously</em>."</p><p>The car started; that surprised Rio, and she looked at her — a smile on her reddish lips, and soon, the vehicle began to walk.</p><p>"Horror it is."</p><p>—</p><p>The tickets were bought; they had arrived a little late, but not that much late — taking their seats, but a few people were there, and that made Rio worry. Was the movie that scary?</p><p>"Are you good with horror movies, Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha let out a small giggle as a smirk grew on her face. "Why? Don't tell me you want to flee."</p><p>"Of course not!"</p><p>Rio felt annoyed (in a good way); the film started, lights off — and the start was good, even the actresses. Soon, she found herself hooked on.</p><p>After half an hour, and after two (failed) attempts at scaring the audience, Rio had heard that Agatha was particularly quiet. Was she not enjoying the movie?</p><p>So, she turned her head, and — Agatha had fallen asleep. Did she really hate the plot? After all the previous teasing, Rio laughed at her — she had to wake her up.</p><p>"Agatha, you told me not to flee — but you fell asleep!"</p><p>Rio poked Agatha's cheeks, trying to bring her back to reality — it didn't work — then, she squeezed her arm, and it also didn't work. What to do? Rio thought hard.</p><p>"Agatha, wake up!"</p><p>One of the spectators had shushed at her — Rio felt embarrassed; there was no use, she had to wait until the end of the movie, hoping she would've woken up.</p><p>"If you were tired, you could've just said so."</p><p>The movie went on — but Rio couldn't really focus on it.</p><p>—</p><p>After (almost) two hours, the movie ended — the lights were turned on, and, only now, Agatha had opened her eyes; yawning, and stretching herself. Rio glared at her.</p><p>"What—"</p><p>"You fell asleep."</p><p>Agatha stood up — immediately; cheeks burning, and eyes avoidant, she had to say something, but she couldn't have ever found a right apology to that.</p><p>"Rio, I'm sorry—"</p><p>"You didn't sleep," she had gotten up, facing her, "I suppose? We went to sleep late yesterday."</p><p>"No, I—, it's <em>complicated</em>."</p><p>Rio noticed a shift in her behaviour.</p><p>"You should go home, and rest—"</p><p>"I can't, not now — and I don't want to! Rio, I had to gather so much courage to, uh, ask you out. I just," she felt weak, extremely exhausted, "I'm sorry."</p><p>There was one thing that Rio could do — but Agatha would've definitely refused. She had to try.</p><p>"You can come at my place; I mean, sleep for a while? I have some beers, Netflix, and incredible snacks."</p><p>Agatha looked down, her hand rubbing the back of her neck — she sighed, loudly, and lifted her gaze, meeting Rio's.</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"Very sure, I don't mind, you seem too tired."</p><p>Rio smiled, Agatha tried to cool down.</p><p>"Alright, let's go."</p><p>—</p><p>Rio drove to her house; fulfilling her dream of driving a Cinquecento, and she giggled during the trip — meanwhile, Agatha was awfully quiet. Once there, Rio parked the car (horrendously), laughing while doing so.</p><p>Agatha got out of the car, feeling extremely nauseous.</p><p>"How the <em>fuck</em> did you manage to get your license?"</p><p>"What? This is nothing! I even went slow."</p><p>The duo began walking towards Rio's house, Agatha was still judging her driving skills — they entered in a palace, took the elevator, and after a few seconds, they were in a hallway; last door was her house.</p><p>So, they reached the door — Rio took the keys and slowly opened it; Agatha entered, and she expected the worse, but it was actually a comfortable place.</p><p>"Oh, it looks normal?"</p><p>Rio laughed, closing the door. "Did you expect rats running on the floor?"</p><p>"No, I expected rats stealing food from the fridge."</p><p>Rio's laugh was now louder — she had to take a few moments to calm down; Agatha watched her, eyes studying her smile and a sudden blush on the cheeks.</p><p>"Want a grand tour? It's not that big, but it has personality."</p><p>"Lead the way."</p><p>And so Rio did; she showed Agatha around — from her studio to her bedroom — and she was surprised at seeing how many books, notes, and pictures there were. After the tour ended, they went back to the living room.</p><p>"So—, that's all."</p><p>Agatha smirked. "I thought the house of a therapist, a sex therapist, had weird gadgets in all of the rooms."</p><p>Rio's eyes widened; could she be referring to?</p><p>"No, the gadgets are here — they are <em>hidden</em>, though. I can't scare the guests away."</p><p>There was a long pause; Agatha debated whether dropping the conversation before it got weird, out of hand, mischievous. Rio was proud — as she enjoyed seeing her shy, seeing her squirm.</p><p>"Want to see—"</p><p>"Can I sit on the couch?"</p><p>Agatha had ceased her attempt, almost immediately — Rio rolled her eyes, smiling widely.</p><p>"Of course, I'm getting some snacks — we could continue the movie?"</p><p>She nodded and went to sit on the couch — Rio disappearing in the kitchen — and that gave Agatha enough time to think. What would've happened next? Why did she agree to come to Rio's place? Things would've gotten complicated — she detested, and loved it at the same time.</p><p>"I have healthy, and unhealthy snacks — I brought both," she had returned, and positioned the food on the coffee table — with a huge grin on her lips, "I'm sure you won't mind!"</p><p>"I don't."</p><p>Rio sat next to her — so close to her; again, their legs were touching, and Agatha couldn't help but feel flustered.</p><p>"This is the second movie I watch in a day — you're slowly making me turn into a cinephille."</p><p>Agatha felt bad, extremely guilty — she didn't reply to that; the movie started, and Rio, again, was focused on it. '<em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>', she had seen it many, many times, but she couldn't help but enjoy it.</p><p>Then, she had heard a snore, she turned around, and Agatha was, once more, sleeping; her back rested on the couch, eyes closed. Rio started to worry.</p><p>The movie was paused — Rio turned around, her eyes still on Agatha; she was concerned, and didn't know the motive of such tiredness. Maybe she could've asked Nicholas? Texting him didn't seem like a bad option.</p><p>Rio picked her phone, and in that instant — Agatha had opened her eyes; and her gaze was on the younger one, she sighed.</p><p>"Agatha, are you—"</p><p>"I'm sorry; I keep falling asleep, I'm ruining everything—, I didn't mean to—"</p><p>Her hand went to hold hers; the touch was soft, needed by Agatha, and she couldn't help but feel embarrassed, flustered that Rio was so understanding, and not judging her.</p><p>"What's going on? You can tell me."</p><p>Even her voice was without any judgement; Agatha stared at her, her eyes, her lips (especially) — she wanted to tell her, but feared doing so. What if that scared her?</p><p>"I'm fine, didn't get enough sleep."</p><p>Rio caressed the hand, gently. "Why's that?"</p><p>There was this sense of weakness when it came to her words — Agatha didn't want to worry her, but also had to talk about it; either way, an answer awaited Rio.</p><p>"Well, uh," her eyes struggled to look at her properly, Rio got closer, positioning her hand on her leg, attempting to comfort Agatha, but that had made her even more shy, "I don't want to worry you, but, my mother came to visit us."</p><p>"<em>Oh</em>," she sounded sincere — and full of questions, and Agatha had noticed something change in her. "I'm sorry, how did it go?"</p><p>"Well—, my mother and I fought because," and she stopped; taking a deep breath in, as she exhaled the air, "I talked about divorcing my husband, and, well, she didn't like that."</p><p>"We can talk about it, if you want."</p><p>Agatha was hesitant — but the look in Rio's eyes was so sweet, docile, and caring; she understood that she was really interested — and wasn't forced to ask, she always was so attentive.</p><p>"She didn't like the idea, she says that divorce would bring shame to the family; but that, she, too, didn't like Ralph. I don't know what she's plotting."</p><p>Rio was shocked to hear that; times had changed, divorcing had become something accepted by society. So, why was her mother so reluctant about it? Who was she really? And <em>who</em> was Agatha?</p><p>"I know it's scary, but you need to make the difference—, divorcing isn't bad, it's more common than she thinks. You care a lot about her judgement, do you?"</p><p>It was undeniable; she did care, but, was also tired of following her rules — she craved freedom, and she wanted to abandon Ralph.</p><p>"Yes, well," she looked distant, yet, very still in the moment — obviously, her mind was elsewhere, "I want her to love me; but, she won't — because," her lips trembled, so were her hands, and Rio started to worry, "I'm not attracted to men, I— uh, <em>like</em> women?"</p><p>Rio smiled, purely and sincerely; her hand held the one of Agatha, tightening the grip. She had gathered so much courage, and that wasn't to be underestimated.</p><p>"Thanks for telling me. Really, thank you."</p><p>Agatha looked at the hand, then, again, at her eyes; she leaned closer — and Rio wondered why of that action, as her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>"Are you going to do <em>something</em> about it?"</p><p>The hint of embarrassment could be heard in her voice. Rio found it adorable, she understood the motive of her getting so close, and the thing she wanted from her, what she truly meant.</p><p>"What do you want <em>me</em> to do?"</p><p>Again, Agatha had gotten a little closer — her hands went behind Rio's neck, pulling her towards her; she was of a pure red colour, and Rio loved the view.</p><p>"<em>You know</em>."</p><p>Rio laughed, teasing. "I really don't."</p><p>A long sigh escaped Agatha's mouth, and Rio continued the laughs — then, suddenly, her eyes stared at her lips, intesenly.</p><p>"Rio, can you kiss me? <em>Please</em>?"</p><p>She had really said it, and she didn't dream it — those words, that request, had really been said; it was like a mirage in the desert, and Rio felt weak, because she desired that.</p><p>So, without further words, Rio got closer to her, her hands on her cheeks — the skin was soft, smooth, incredibly beautiful — she leaned in, and their lips touched; <em>they kissed</em>.</p><p>Now, Rio wanted for the kiss to be a soft, <em>calm</em> one, but Agatha had other plans; tongues on one another, her hands touched her body, as she bit her lower lip — after a long, long while, they separated, only a thread of saliva united them both, but it disappeared into thin air.</p><p>Rio was shocked to see Agatha so voracious; and even more to see how flustered she was afterwards, as she struggled to look at her. How cute.</p><p>"Sorry, I didn't mean to go rough."</p><p>Again, there was another laugh from Rio; she too didn't expect it, but didn't mind it — as the warmth in her grew, stronger than before, desire increasing.</p><p>"Agatha, I didn't know you had it in you."</p><p>"Be quiet, you make me feel weird, very weird. You make my body do things on their own."</p><p>That statement had managed to shock her. Had she really that much influence on Agatha? She hadn't realise it.</p><p>"Maybe I'm a witch."</p><p>Agatha glared at her. "An <em>annoying</em> one, for sure."</p><p>A brief moment of silence, followed by soft giggles — and Agatha, slowly, returned to her normal self; once more, she got closer to Rio, her hands cupped her cheeks, and she kissed her again, and again, until the younger one let a soft, quiet moan out, and it was able to make Agatha stop — she felt confused, happy, and incredibly aroused, as she enjoyed that sound, more than she liked to admit.</p><p>"I should go."</p><p>Agatha stood up, so Rio. They stared at each other; one felt ashamed, the other extremely pleased.</p><p>"You said you couldn't go home?"</p><p>"Things may have calmed down; I have to, for Nicholas."</p><p>Rio understood, she walked her to the door, once there; there was a fleeting, awkward silence.</p><p>"Thanks for, <em>well</em>, letting me relax."</p><p>"Did you relax? Even for a bit?"</p><p>"Yes, I did, thank you," Agatha suddenly remembered the kisses, the sounds, the way her body moved — the sudden realisation had hit her like a truck, and why was Rio so calm about it?</p><p>"I'm glad. Text me later?"</p><p>"I will."</p><p>And then, she walked away. Rio closed the door, and fell on the ground; her hands touched her lips, smiling widely — feeling thousands of emotions, not a single bad one.</p><p>"<em>I'm so fucked</em>."</p><p>Maybe, now, she could've explained everything to Alice and Jen? Will Agatha be fine with it? It was worth to try, Rio <em>missed</em> her friends. And she had been rude to them — so, why not?</p>

<p>Agatha couldn't bring herself to fall asleep; she tried, and <em>tried</em> — but the image of Rio, the sounds she had made, and the way she looked incredibly beautiful, breathtaking, made it impossible for her to do such thing.</p><p>To be honest; she hadn't planned on kissing her because, now, they reached a point where it'd be useless to deny their feelings — Agatha liked Rio, and Rio liked her back.</p><p>But, she was still married to Ralph. Would that have been cheating? Was Agatha turning into what she despised most in him? These thoughts were tormenting her, more than usual — she had to come up with a plan and fast.</p><p>It was a sunny morning. Her mother had stayed for the night, and she hadn't ask Agatha where she had been, and why she was late — she didn't care, or <em>maybe</em> never had.</p><p>After the fight she had with her; things had taken a weird turn — it wasn't like their usual fights. Evanora had remembered Agatha the motive of her getting married to him, her sexuality, and she had protested, saying she was '<em>cured</em>', or '<em>over it</em>', and that a divorce wouldn't have been that tragic, since her ways were out of time, and without a logic.</p><p>So, things were awkward — even more when Agatha had walked in the kitchen, as she found her there; attempting to make breakfast. Nicholas had left the house for school, and Ralph for work — she truly was alone.</p><p>She sat on the chair; scrolling through her phone, re–reading her chat with Rio. Could she have sent her a text? She wanted to, but she felt shy. It was so complicated (for her,  at least).</p><p>"You seem smiley today," her mother spoke as she sat down on the chair; a cup of coffee in her hands, eyes firm.</p><p>"Am I?"</p><p>Agatha couldn't believe her words; Evanora rarely noticed her emotions, feelings, or that sort of things — for her to care, meant that she had become easy to read. Was that Rio's effect?</p><p>"Yes," she was sincere; soon, she took a deep breath, seeming to want to say more. "Agatha, you were right."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Evanora sighed again. "That man, Ralph, is not suited for you; recently, he's been doing not well at work — and many complained, and it can't go on," her eyes lingered on her, "I think you should divorce; he's bringing shame to our family, we'll handle it quietly, we'll buy his silence — and there won't be rumours, I hope."</p><p>It felt like a dream; Agatha tried to keep her composure, she tried not to smile — laugh or other things. Her mother was serious, but something felt wrong, incredibly wrong.</p><p>"Where's the catch?"</p><p>"Right, you and your cunning senses," she stood up from the chair; waking towards her, getting closer, "I'm thinking you should start seeing someone else — <em>after some time</em> — being unwed is unacceptable, even more with a son, and we do have to keep the image."</p><p>Agatha flinched. "Wouldn't it be more shameful for me to have another husband?"</p><p>"I mean, it's questionable, but soon, I'll get old, Nicholas isn't suited to take the lead, and you need another—"</p><p>She had enough — her hands went through her hair, fingers trembled. Agatha felt sick, disgusted by what she had heard, and Evanora seemed completely fine, that irritated her even more.</p><p>"Am I a breeding machine!? Don't I have a say in this?"</p><p>A feeling of nausea overcame her; legs trembled — and she was slowly walking out of the room, and Evanora simply breathed loudly, rolling her eyes, bored.</p><p>"You don't; not after the humiliation that you put me through — after what you did with <em>that</em> woman! You have no idea on how hard I worked to control the scandal."</p><p>Why did her words hurt? They still managed to pierce her heart, even after years, and that surprised Agatha — and Evanora had noticed that.</p><p>But, she had to be brave.</p><p>"I won't marry anyone else; I'll fight for it — even if it means that you'll never look at me in the eyes or something much worse. I won't let you ruin my life again."</p><p>As her mother was about to reply, Agatha walked out, firmly — taking her keys, purse, and other stuff — heading far, far away, attempting to calm her mind.</p><p>—</p><p>So, she walked, and walked, without any direction; Agatha felt her stomach twisting, thoughts growing at an alarming rate — soon, she would've have had a meeting with Hela, and she really needed that — she just had to wait, a little more — enduring, surviving.</p><p>Her mind wondered to Rio; she wanted to call, or text her, or do something — but she feared being too noisy, clingy, as the memory of their lips touching appeared.</p><p>Now, Agatha had <em>really</em> lost every bit of sanity that remained in her, thinking of Rio — while walking — acting like some teen girl.</p><p>It was then that she had received a text from her, as if sent telepathically  — Agatha hurried to read.</p><p>
<em>Busy now?</em>
</p><p>She wasn't, but something felt wrong.</p><p>
<em>Aren't you working?</em>
</p><p>
<em>You don't want to see me? :(</em>
</p><p>A smile grew on her lips; of course, she wanted to see her, even for a minute, but maybe it was too selfish to ask for that.</p><p>
<em>I'm free, why?</em>
</p><p>
<em>I'm starting my turn in an hour — we could get coffee?</em>
</p><p>That surprised her; Rio was a busy therapist — but she hadn't realised that her work started so early. Maybe it was an emergency?</p><p>
<em>Sure. Where are you?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Turn around.</em>
</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat; she slowly turned around — and Rio waved at her. In her hand, there was a cup of coffee, and she rushed towards Agatha, smiling widely, laughing cutely.</p><p>"Good morning," she took a deep breath, "I took a cappuccino, I hope you don't mind; I thought you'd like that," her words calmed her down — her giggles, and soft gaze, too.</p><p>And Agatha couldn't contain a smile, not anymore. Why was Rio being so sweet to her?</p><p>"What if I were to say no? You would've wasted money."</p><p>Rio shrugged. "I don't mind — I originally took this for me — but, when I saw you, I didn't want it anymore."</p><p>"So I'm the second choice because you don't want it?"</p><p>A light laugh, and Agatha had realised that, maybe, she had been too paranoid — too judgemental; Rio was being nice, and she didn't have to be rude.</p><p>"No," a tiny smirk on her lips, "Agatha, you're <em>so</em> important that I'm giving up my morning coffee; I don't do that every day."</p><p>Agatha felt flustered, as she tried hard to fight a blush. How was she so nauseously adorable? It was hard to even find a good reply to that.</p><p>"You just wasted money," she took the cup in her hands, and Rio smiled, annoyingly so, "I guess I shouldn't complain. Thank you."</p><p>There was a brief moment of silence; Agatha drank the liquid, and Rio watched her doing that — as a dog does when its owner has a toy in its hands.</p><p>"Is everything alright?" Rio asked, once she has finished drinking.</p><p>"Sort of."</p><p>That meant something had happened — but Agatha was avoiding talking about it; either way, she would've waited for her to be ready, as she didn't want to pressure on the matter.</p><p>"It's fine, I'm here."</p><p>Agatha wanted to feel her closer, once more, but <em>couldn't</em>, since they were outside — people would've looked at them, judged, but somehow, inside her, she felt as if it didn't matter anymore.</p><p>"Thank you," her hand went over her cheek, slowly, softly — she caressed the skin — and Rio smiled, "I always manage to bother you."</p><p>"You don't bother me; I do what I do because I want to," her hand went over hers, and she kissed her palm — lips were warm, Agatha felt weak, useless. "Stop thinking that."</p><p>"You really like me?"</p><p>Rio was surprised, her gaze met hers, and she couldn't help but smirk. Agatha hadn't realise what she had said, how powerful that question was, and regretted those words — for a second.</p><p>Her hand was about to let go of her cheek; but Rio managed to stop her, still laughing.</p><p>"Is it obvious?"</p><p>And Agatha hated it — how much of a tease she could be — but secretly enjoyed it.</p><p>"A little, I thought you'd be more discreet."</p><p>"Why should I be? I want you to know how much I like you."</p><p>Probably, she was making a weird face — because Rio was still smiling, without seeming to stop — she, now, let go of the hold and stared at her.</p><p>"You remind me of a dog."</p><p>"A dog?!"</p><p>Rio blinked twice, thrice — she had never heard something so funny, yet incredibly in character; her giggles had brought a smile to Agatha's lips as she rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Which kind? Golden Retriever—, oh! Maybe German Shepherd!"</p><p>Agatha didn't imagine her to take it so seriously.</p><p>"Maybe a Corgi."</p><p>"Those dogs are so cute, I can work with that."</p><p>What even was that conversation? It felt so carefree, yet serious? A moment of relax; because Rio always was able to make her feel relaxed — and she could've allowed herself to calm her nerves down.</p><p>"Agatha," her voice sounded flirty, seductive — she spoke low, and so incredibly charming, and her eyes were firm, lips curled in a smile. "If I'm a dog; does it mean you <em>need</em> to put me on a leash?"</p><p>She couldn't have really said that. Agatha's cheeks were red, alarmingly coloured — as the image of Rio, on a leash, so submissive, staring at her, <em>oh</em>.</p><p>"I'm going home," the reply was dry; as she started to walk away from her — hearing, a little too well, Rio's laughs. Why was she like this? And why did she like it so much?</p><p>"Text me when you want."</p><p>Rio screamed loudly and proudly — making it hard for Agatha to ignore.</p><p>—</p><p>Once back home; Evanora was out, and so was Ralph, but, surprisingly, Nicholas was home — which was weird — as he was supposed to be at school.</p><p>"Nicky? Why are you—," she saw him, sitting on the couch — he looked focused on something on the phone. Was he skipping school?</p><p>"Oh, Mom — hi."</p><p>His gaze met hers; Agatha noticed something off.</p><p>"Nicky, why are you home," she sat next to him, "I thought you had school?"</p><p>Nicholas bit his lip. "I was worried; I skipped school — I didn't find you home, so I thought you were out, and I'm glad you're okay."</p><p>"Nicky," Agatha's hand went to ruffle his hair — the boy looked extremely tired, stressed, "I'm okay; you shouldn't skip school, you know that."</p><p>"Yeah, I know. I'm just worried of leaving you alone with dad, and with grandma," his words were heavy, "I just want you to be at peace in your own house, even if I don't understand many things — you never tell me."</p><p>He was right, Agatha had always avoided telling him about her past; she didn't want to worry him because the truth was hard to tell.</p><p>"Nicholas; your grandma and I, we're not on good terms, and the same goes with your father. But, I'm trying to make it work—"</p><p>"But you don't have to!" Nicholas stood up from his seat; eyes firm on her, hands clenched into fists — feeling many emotions, yet weak. "Mom, it's impossible to make it work with him, and it's worse with grandma. You have to put yourself first, and I'll be there to support you."</p><p>Nicholas was brave, and that bravery was inspiring — his words seemed to remove a spell from Agatha — setting her free, even if not completely.</p><p>"Okay, Nicky. I'll see what I can do. Don't worry, and don't skip school."</p><p>Agatha felt powerful, a little more than before — she had to be strong, and had to give the same strength to Nicholas. Together, everything seemed to be achievable.</p><p>Agatha stood up as she went to hug him; maybe, they could've really made it. Could she really have gone against her mother? Divorced Ralph?</p><p>"Oh, by the way, where were you?"</p><p>Nicholas looked at her, smiling as he interrupted the hug.</p><p>"On a walk, where else?"</p><p>"Was Rio with you?"</p><p>A sudden cough that brought awkwardness to her. When did he become so bold? So straightforward? She rolled her eyes, laughing it off — and he stared even more.</p><p>"Nicholas, Rio can't always be with me."</p><p>"She looks like the kind of person who would drop everything to stay with you," his eyes studied her visage, as he noticed a timid smile, "I mean, that's what I think."</p><p>"It's not like that."</p><p>But it was <em>exactly</em> like that — and Rio was that kind of person; but Agatha tried hard to fight a smile, especially with Nicholas there.</p><p>"Sure. Okay."</p><p>And Agatha didn't understand what he meant — or pretended not to. After a while, Nicholas had gone to his room, perhaps attempting to catch up with his studies, and Agatha was once more alone, as she sat on the couch, sighing.</p><p>Soon, a text from Rio, and a rather teasing one.</p><p>
<em>I think I'd look great wearing a green leash.</em>
</p><p>Agatha re–read the text more two times; the first was to understand what had been written, the second to let her imagination run wild — dangerously doing so.</p><p>
<em>Rio, don't you have work?</em>
</p><p>And the reply came soon than expected.</p><p>
<em>I do have hobbies, occasionally. Thinking about these stuff is one of them. :)</em>
</p><p>A lie — or perhaps, she was telling the truth?</p><p>
<em>Well, Agatha, is green my colour?</em>
</p><p>Had she really to reply to that? Could she avoid the topic?</p><p>
<em>Wear whatever you like.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, I have a few things in mind...</em>
</p><p>Agatha understood what she meant — her heartbeat increased at an alarming speed, and she could've felt her head spinning. Had Rio always been such a tease? Or was she refraining herself this whole time?</p><p>
<em>While I work, you can think of something you'd like me to wear? &lt;3</em>
</p><p>Of course, she would've done that, but never could let Rio know — as she didn't want to be made fun of it, endlessly. Still, she wanted to make her feel frustrated, distracted.</p><p>
<em>I'll see what I can do. Maybe, I can look up online? There must be some models with your same physique.</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, Agatha. WAIT. Forget it! DON'T! I was joking!</em>
</p><p>A laugh escaped her lips — maybe, Rio wasn't the only one able to mess with her. Maybe, she could've challenged her, once in a while.</p>

<p>Agatha was at the local library, as she wanted to find something new about herself, even if she didn't know where to exactly start, but she was there, and now, she appeared to be lost at a section of the store she so much ignored, the '<em>self–discovery</em>' one. </p><p>Sure, it was true that she had already done many (so many) research, and she had realised her sexuality, what those feelings were — but, still, her eyes lingered on those books, that were once strictly forbidden.</p><p>Originally, she had gone out with the intent of talking to Rio, as she wanted to go to her house to talk and let it all out; to be sincere, once and for all. But something felt off, the library called her in, a mermaid's call, she could've wasted a few minutes. Perhaps it was meant to be?</p><p>So, she looked at the books, and felt immediately calm, reminiscing her conversation with Nicholas — she was so lucky to have him in her life, and their relationship had grown so much; he wasn't the usual angsty teeneger (to her, at least).</p><p>A book was picked, and Agatha ignored the title and everything else, because the cover caught her attention — there was a picture of a woman, very similiar to Rio — she, casually, read through some lines, trying to send away the thought she just had.</p><p>"That book is a good one," a voice called her out, Agatha flinched at hearing that comment. She turned around, and when she did, surprise managed to get to her — eyes wide, lips parted, and something else, something she didn't quite understand.</p><p>"<em>Wanda</em>?"</p><p>The red–head smiled, but it was a different smile. It held emotions of the <em>past</em> and of the <em>present</em>, a powerful tool that had managed to set a false sense of calmness and bring back some hurtful memories.</p><p>"It's been a while, Agatha," she walked closer, as her arms crossed, a confident stare. "I saw you, and I thought of saying 'hi'," she smiled, easing up the tension. "I like that book!"</p><p>Agatha couldn't bring herself to say something trivial, futile. She didn't want to do the same, <em>useless</em> small–talk; there was a lot to tell, yet so little — so much courage had to be used.</p><p>"I'm sorry," she managed to murmur, quietly and with a hint of fear. But Wanda was able to hear that, and she could've walked away and kept on ignoring her, as she had done for so many years — but, this time — it felt different.</p><p>"No, don't apologise. It's been so long — I'm doing better, and I'm been followed by a therapist," that was reassuring, to say the least, and Agatha thought of how she, in some ways, hadn't changed at all — making her slightly smile. "I didn't mean to bother you, I could go if you wish so."</p><p>"It's fine, Wanda." But, was it okay for her to talk like that after what had happened? After so many years of silence? "I'm glad to see you, I really am."</p><p>"Would you like to go get a coffee? Catch up — perhaps? But, only if you want to."</p><p>Agatha pondered on it. She could've wasted a few minutes, it would've been awkward — of course it would've — but, she wanted to, craved it. Her mother was out of sight, and she had to decide for herself.</p><p>"Yes, okay. Let's go."</p><p>—</p><p>They found a spot at a nearby café, as they sat outside — the cold breeze didn't help, but somehow, it encouraged them to speak. After ordening coffees, and something tasty to eat — Agatha kept staring at her, feeling embarrassed yet guilty, and Wanda noticed that.</p><p>"You've changed a lot, Agatha."</p><p>That statement was able to astonish her as soon as she heard that — she didn't look different, nor felt different — was she trying to be nice? Either way, she put on a cordial smile.</p><p>"Did I? Well, you know how life is."</p><p>Wanda knew it perfectly. "Yes, but something tells me that you're going through a lot. But, it might be me."</p><p>How was she able to tell?</p><p>"You're not wrong, I—," Agatha stopped, her gaze lowered, and feeling the eyes of the other woman, "I, too, started therapy; it's helping — I guess."</p><p>"Oh!" Wanda sounded sincere and truly happy. But why? "I'm glad, Agatha. I really am."</p><p>"Yes, even if it's not really therapy. You see, I went to—"</p><p>"A <em>sex</em> <em>therapist</em>, right?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened as she looked at her — who was smiling, in a sort of creepy way — and a sudden feeling of shyness had the best on her, as she slowly nodded. She did question how she got it right, but quickly discarded the idea of asking her — Wanda had always been extremely perceptive, as if she <em>could</em> read into people's minds.</p><p>"No need to feel embarrassed, I went to one too; though, it was for me and my husband! We had a problem, but it's solved now — we were really lucky."</p><p>"Your 'husband' so, you're—"</p><p>Wanda giggled. "Married, yes," she saw a shift in her posture, perhaps, feeling confused, needing answers. "I'm bisexual, so, I wasn't forced to marry one or anything. I just fell for him."</p><p>The last sentence made her heart ache, more than it should've.</p><p>"I see," she had understood herself, she accepted who she was, and Agatha was happy to see that she was living the way she wanted. "I'm really glad, Wanda. I bet he's a lovely man."</p><p>"He is, a bit awkward, but that's his charm."</p><p>They both laughed, as drinks arrived, so the food. Soon, silence surrounded them, but not for long, as Wanda took the leads of the conversation (once more).</p><p>"I was told that you've found a husband, and have a son—? I was happy to hear that! Motherhood truly is beautiful—"</p><p>Agatha couldn't hide the sadness, not anymore; fingers tapped on the table, and her face looked tired. Wanda flinched, as she didn't want to make her uncomfortable.</p><p>"Agatha—?"</p><p>"I love my son, he's the only good thing that came out of that marriage," voice weak, as she couldn't believe her words, the trust she was putting on her, "I regret marrying him, I don't love him. I tried but it didn't work."</p><p>"Oh," she bit her lower lip, staring calmy, "Agatha, have you considered divorcing him?"</p><p>"I did, but my mother wouldn't like that. She'll disown me and never talk to me again—"</p><p>"And is that bad?"</p><p>Agatha lifted her gaze, understanding what she meant. Something she tried to ignore for so long — and that was now unavoidable. She sighed, loudly.</p><p>"She's the only family I have."</p><p>"That's not true," she smiled softly, and she struggled to understand — the blue eyes were still on her, waiting for an explanation, "I think that family is the one you chose; Agatha, you have your son, he's your family — it can also be with friends, people you care a lot. Family isn't <em>always</em> by blood."</p><p>It was true, there was truth in what Wanda was saying. Agatha felt weird, as she couldn't believe to be receiving advice from her, she, who she thought would've despised her, was now acting so nicely, unbelievably caring.</p><p>"You just have to take a step further, Agatha."</p><p>And she was right, obviously so.</p><p>"I thought you hated me, why are you so good to me?"</p><p>Wanda's lips curled in a smile. "It wasn't your fault, and holding grudges isn't good for your health. Don't you think?"</p><p>Agatha laughed, as she couldn't believe her words, her worries seeming to leave her mind, even a little — meeting Wanda, a meeting that she so much feared, was actually a way of setting her free? After a while, she asked what seemed to be madness.</p><p>"Can we exchange contacts? I'd like to — you know — hang out."</p><p>Wanda beamed up at hearing that. "Of course! We have so much to catch up on."</p><p>So, they exchanged numbers, and it was by then that Agatha had noticed the time — 6 PM, she still had to talk to Rio — she stared at Wanda, with a hint of worry.</p><p>"Sorry, Wanda. I have to go. I'll text you, yes?"</p><p>"Sure, no worries! Get home safe!"</p><p>But she wasn't going to her house.</p><p>—</p><p>Rio had had an incredible hard day, but the hardest part had yet to come; on that day, she would've talked with her friends, who hadn't heard in days — as she desperately wanted to explain the whole situation properly.</p><p>It was around 7 PM. Alice and Jen sat on her couch; waiting for her to talk, trying hard not to judge (as they usually did).</p><p>"Okay, I was stupid as hell," Rio began explaining, receiving nods from them both. "I really was, but, turns out she likes me back. So, in some ways, I was kinda right."</p><p>Alice sighed. "So, you're cheating with a married woman who happens to like you?"</p><p>"It's not as you think; her husband also cheated, and he doesn't love her — she's very unhappy! But, she can't divorce him."</p><p>"Or maybe she's playing with you?" Jen continued; sounding as upset as Alice, and Rio scoffed. They still didn't understand, that irritated her, incredibly.</p><p>"No, she's definitely not into men; I don't know why she can't divorce — I'll ask her, but, please, I want you to know that I know what I'm doing."</p><p>They looked at each other, sighing; if Rio knew what she was doing, that meant that they could trust her — even if a sense of worry still overcame them.</p><p>"Alright." Alice spoke first, breaking the tension. "I hope you really do."</p><p>Rio felt at ease; she realised how difficult it was for her to talk about it, and she was lucky to have them — understanding, even if sometimes they did go overboard.</p><p>Jen stared at Rio, in such a mischievous way. "So, have you — <em>you know</em>?"</p><p>"No, Jen. Our relationship is not like that; we didn't, and I'm fine with taking things slowly, unlike you—!"</p><p>"Come on, Jen! You know sex isn't everything," Alice interrupted her, with a grin on her lips. "I think Rio has a plan."</p><p>She was about to reply, but soon, the intercom rang — and the three got scared. Who could it be? Rio didn't expect guests, and so, the mystery increased. She went to answer, and after hearing who the stranger was, Rio made a worried face.</p><p>"You have to go."</p><p>The two friends looked at each other; wondering what was going on, but Rio seemed really anxious.</p><p>"I'm serious. She's about to come here, get out, now."</p><p>Jen laughed, and so did Alice. They had never seen Rio so panicked and incredibly flustered. What kind of power did that woman hold on her?</p><p>But, it was useless — Agatha had rang the bell, Rio rushed to the door; opening it, slowly.</p><p>"Agatha, hi," she stared back at her friends, who were giggling, visibly entertained by the scene. "I didn't expect you to be here."</p><p>"Sorry, I should've texted you. Can I talk to you?"</p><p>"Sure!" Rio stepped outside of the house, and Agatha had a weird look in her eyes, as she expected her to let her in. She didn't understand why of such action.</p><p>"Perhaps we can talk inside?"</p><p>"Oh, well, my friends are here, I don't want to make you uncomfortable."</p><p>Agatha smiled, adoring, once more, how understanding she was. "It's okay. Besides, it's rude to leave your guests."</p><p>"I would leave them for you if you asked me to."</p><p>And she rolled her eyes, as she couldn't tell if Rio was teasing, or speaking in a serious tone. Either way, she was fine by the idea of meeting her friends, even if informally.</p><p>"Get in."</p><p>"Agatha, don't be so bossy!"</p><p>She opened the door, and playfully pushed her in; once inside, Agatha stared at her friends, one of them was smiling, the other one analysing the situation — they were young, beautiful, and <em>free</em>.</p><p>"I'm sorry to interrupt you," her icy eyes stared at both of them. "I don't want to make you leave. You can finish what you were doing—"</p><p>"No need," Alice smiled, standing from the couch, walking towards the (anxious) stranger, "I'm Alice, Rio's friend — it's nice to meet you, uh—"</p><p>"Agatha," she stretched her hand, shaking it with her, and Alice was pleasantly surprised by such action.</p><p>"I'm Jen," the other one smiled. "I have to say, how did Rio manage to find someone as hot as you?"</p><p>Rio flinched, feeling so close to strangling Jen, as she gave a big glare, eyes furious, and Alice couldn't help but laugh. Agatha, too, was now giggling</p><p>"She got <em>extremely</em> lucky, I guess."</p><p>Now, the two friends were soundly laughing, enjoying the way she had joined in the tease. Rio sighed, looking at Agatha while she was only able to reciprocate a timid smirk, feeling proud of what she had done.</p><p>"Okay, can you please go?" Rio brought back the seriousness of the moment. Alice and Jen rolled their eyes — they took their stuff, waved goodbye at Agatha, and went out — shutting the door.</p><p>Once alone, Agatha walked closer to Rio — and the other one, still feeling slightly upset by her words, could only stay still, looking at her.</p><p>"Sorry, I didn't mean to bother," her voice sounded soft, harmonious. "I just wanted to talk with you."</p><p>"So, I '<em>got lucky</em>', huh?"</p><p>Agatha was surprised, she hadn't realised that her joke would've affected her that badly. She smiled, getting closer.</p><p>"I was messing around, you know I didn't mean it."</p><p>Rio crossed her arms. "Apologise, then."</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>"It's not enough."</p><p>That made her giggle. Where was she getting at? But Agatha knew and felt thousands of emotions at the thought of pleasing her request — because Rio was always like that, she always made her feel weak.</p><p>"Come on," her hands went on her cheeks, cupping them — as her thumbs caressed the soft skin, her brown eyes meeting hers, "I can't believe you got offended," and laughed, only for Rio's hands to go on her waist, pulling her closer — smiling.</p><p>"Rio—?"</p><p>"Agatha, I'm very angry at you," she got closer, extremely so, her lips almost touching hers. "I want you to apologise, properly."</p><p>And she couldn't resist any longer; their lips met, fusing in each other — for the second time, Agatha took the leads of the kiss, slow and steady, and Rio let out a moan, <em>again</em>, messing with her senses — she interrupted it.</p><p>"Satisfied?"</p><p>Rio smiled. "You always interrupt the kiss when I get too loud."</p><p>It was true, but Agatha didn't want to admit it.</p><p>"Because you do it on purpose."</p><p>"Should I be quieter?"</p><p>Agatha didn't want that, obviously didn't. Rio knew it perfectly — she sighed, as she kissed her again, differently, Agatha's tongue held the dance, and she was voracious, starving of Rio, biting her lips, doing everything she knew — the sounds came from her, as her moans, her sighs became louder each second more, and soon, they were out of breath, in need of air.</p><p>Rio stared at her, her hand going to touch her lips — they were wet, swollen, and red — she was smiling, breathing. Agatha had to look away. She couldn't believe to have done that, just to shut her up.</p><p>"Agatha, just where did you learn to kiss like that?"</p><p>"Don't be quiet."</p><p>Rio tilted her head. "What?"</p><p>"You heard me. I like when you make those sounds, they—, you know, they are pleasant to hear."</p><p>And Rio had this smug on her face, a smirk that would've been hard to wipe off. Agatha knew and found it annoying more than so.</p><p>"I'll do my best to be louder."</p><p>"Okay, you're making it weird."</p><p>A laugh from her, and Agatha soon joined; laughs echoed, and they didn't seem to end. Some minutes had passed, they stared at each other — Rio had to ask.</p><p>"So, what did you want to talk about?"</p><p>Agatha sighed; she sat on the couch, and so did Rio. The air was thick, tension palpable — and many were the attempts of speaking, but they all failed.</p><p>"Agatha—?"</p><p>"Rio, I'm thinking of divorcing my husband; I'll ask for help. It is something I must do."</p><p>And she gasped.</p><p>"And — I'm telling you everything. <em>Now</em>."</p>

<p>Agatha looked at Rio, her fingers intertwined with one another, as she breathed in and out, air seemed to be lacking — <em>never enough</em> — her gaze worried.</p><p>"You don't have to if it makes you uncomfortable—"</p><p>"Rio," but she ignored her, as she truly wanted to talk about it, <em>desperately</em> so. "I was forced to go to weird camps organised by the church when I was young, and I went to therapies to, <em>well</em>, stop me from thinking of women in a lustful way."</p><p>Rio got closer to her, their thighs touching. Agatha felt weird, calmer — her leg trembled, hands fidgeted fast. Yet, Rio didn't say anything.</p><p>"And, I had to go through many '<em>punishments</em>' whenever I—," eyes lowered, "I mean, when my mother thought I might be thinking about women."</p><p>Words were hard to find, but Agatha had to continue.</p><p>"I won't go into detail, but the punishments were questionable. They stopped when I got married to Ralph, then I had Nicholas, and my mother was convinced that I was cured — as she would say."</p><p>Agatha didn't know if she was doing the right thing. Why was Rio so quiet?</p><p>"But, she still felt something was amiss. She knew that I didn't love him, that I just settled. That's why she suggested me divorcing him — to which I was surprised — only for her to tell me that I have to marry someone else, and have another child, because Nicholas isn't suited to take the leads of my mother's company."</p><p>And she sighed, loudly and in a tired, exhausted way.</p><p>"I realised that I can't go on, not like this. I don't want to marry a man, have another child, or anything of that sort. I always wanted my mother's love, more than anything else, but I now realise that she will never love me back — no matter how hard I try."</p><p>Agatha's eyes met Rio's, cheeks slightly rosy.</p><p>"I just want to be with you. What's wrong in that?"</p><p>Rio's hands went to hold hers, the hold was gentle, and the skin warm. Agatha felt weak, regretting (for a second) to have said those things to her, perhaps it was too much to handle. Would she have abandoned her? Her mother was powerful and could've easily ruined her career — even if she didn't work for her.</p><p>"Agatha," voice was soft, hypnotising, "I can't thank you enough for the trust you've put on me. You're brave, so, <em>so</em> much. I know how hard it is to want love from your parents, but sometimes, things aren't meant to be. Your mother treated you horribly, and she tried to change you, all of this time, that's not love. Agatha, she's not what you need."</p><p>Agatha's eyes were slightly watery, Rio noticed.</p><p>"I know it's hard — you'll have to live with yourself, but don't forget that you're not alone. You have me, Nicholas, and <em>we</em> love you so much."</p><p>Rio stood up from the couch, as she kneeled down, knees on the floor, and her chin rested on Agatha's lap — her hands continued to hold hers, without ever interrupting her gaze from the bluish eyes.</p><p>"Please, let me help you. I know a few lawyers, and we can handle things in a private studio — it's not necessary to go to court, they'll take care of everything — as for Ralph, I'm sure that, with a right price, he'll sign the papers right away. It's going to be okay, we'll think of the other stuff. <em>Together</em>."</p><p>Agatha breathed heavily. Rio noticed that, and she smiled, kissing her hand lovingly, as a way of reassurance, as if telling her that she was speaking sincerely.</p><p>"I think I love you, Rio."</p><p>Rio giggled, eyes softened, humming in response — she got up, sitting next to her (once more) — studying how red her face was, how her eyes widened, and her expressions.</p><p>"You '<em>think</em>'?"</p><p>"No, I really do," getting a little closer to her, inch by inch, making the distance between them dissappear — eyes low. "I really am in love with you; I wanted you to know, because, well, I—"</p><p>"I love you too."</p><p>Agatha stared at her, and Rio had an adorable smile, impossible to ignore or to wipe away — she was always like that.</p><p>"You're not saying this because you feel forced?"</p><p>"<em>Forced</em>? No, Agatha," she meant it, smiling and staring at her lips, then at her eyes (trying hard to be discreet). "I'm not forced, I really am, I've been for a while."</p><p>Rio noticed how nervous she was, and how dangerously Agatha was looking at her, in a way she couldn't properly think. So, Rio kissed her again, pushing her on the couch, positioning herself above her — knee in her between, pressing gently — and Agatha softly moaned in response. The kiss continued, heat growing.</p><p>Soon, Agatha's hands began to wander, entering Rio's shirt, making the other one stop — they stared at one another. Rio had been too assertive. Was Agatha trying to match her?</p><p>"Sorry, we can stop, if you want. I don't want to pressure you in something you don't—"</p><p>Agatha snorted, pulling Rio back in the kiss. They were drunk of each other, <em>thirsty</em> — the sighs were loud, and Agatha's hands managed to reach her bra. It was by then that she didn't know what to do, how to continue. It had been so long since she was with a woman, and Rio noticed.</p><p>"I could teach you some stuff?"</p><p>And she sat back on the couch, so did Agatha. Rio removed her shirt, and quickly her bra. Icy eyes hypnotised by her body, her curves, everything — as she shyly, subtly began to blush.</p><p>"You're staring hard, <em>you perv</em>!"</p><p>Agatha smiled, as she understood what Rio was doing — attempting to calm her down, to make herself comfortable. And her hands went on her bosom, as she pinched her nipples, in a playful way. Rio gasped.</p><p>"Don't call me perv. I'm sure you're <em>way</em> worse."</p><p>Rio laughed, enjoying the temporary ticklish feeling — she got closer, kissing her once more. Agatha's fingers squeezed harder, and Rio let out a moan, followed by a laugh.</p><p>Agatha felt aroused, incredibly satisfied with herself, and with what she was doing. "You do have some masochist tendencies."</p><p>"I don't. Nipples are just <em>very</em> sensitive."</p><p>So, Agatha bent down a little, her lips over one nipple, as she sucked, bit, and kissed it fiercely. Rio moaned, sighing loudly, surprise came faster than expected.</p><p>After a while of <em>that</em>, the area became swollen, reddish. Had Agatha exaggerated? But Rio didn't seem to mind, she looked particularly happy, smiling vividly.</p><p>But suddenly, Agatha's phone began ringing, and the sound brought them back to reality — embarrassment reaching the cheeks of the older one, she quickly got up. Rio watched her answering the call; it was Nicholas.</p><p>« Nicky, is something wrong? » she tried to fight the shyness in her voice, feeling her lips still warm and wet — Rio's eyes were still on her.</p><p>« Mom, can you come home? I messed up. »</p><p>Agatha could only think of the worst.</p><p>« I'm on my way. »</p><p>The call was ended. Rio had dressed up, she noticed how shocked and anxious she was. Hands were shaking, eyes dilated.</p><p>"Agatha, do you want me to come with you?"</p><p>"Can you? I don't want to—"</p><p>Rio got up, taking the keys of her house. "Let's go."</p><p>—</p><p>Once there, Agatha quickly opened the door, as they both entered. Nicholas sat on the couch, and the look in his eyes worried them.</p><p>Rio looked around, studying the environment, to see if someone was there — but there wasn't, not a single soul. So, Agatha rushed to him, and she noticed how red his cheek was — her eyes widened.</p><p>"Nicky—, what happened?"</p><p>Nicholas tried to not sob, eyes low. "Grandma, I—, I'm sorry."</p><p>Agatha caressed his cheek. "Please, tell me."</p><p>It was now that Nicholas cried; tears crossing the skin. Rio got closer — and she positioned her hand on his shoulder, gently patting it — he looked at her, feeling safe.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I just—, I don't want to disappoint you."</p><p>"Nicholas, you could never disappoint me. Never."</p><p>And an attempted smile appeared on his face.</p><p>"I was with uh—, <em>my boyfriend</em>—," his eyes met the ones of Agatha, and she smiled tenderly, so did Rio. "I mean, we weren't doing anything; we were watching a movie, and got too touchy? Anyway, grandma walked on us — but she had told me she wouldn't be home for a while, she lied."</p><p>Nicholas stopped and sighed — Agatha didn't need to know more — she had figured out what happened, and she didn't want for him to revive the memory.</p><p>"Okay, Nicky. Don't tell me more, it's okay."</p><p>Agatha hugged him tightly, and the sobs were still hearable. Rio looked at him, then at her, and she could tell what she was thinking — as she looked so deep in thought, and incredibly, unbelievably mad.</p><p>After a while, Nicholas had calmed down.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to worry you."</p><p>"No, Nicky, you did good. I will act accordingly and put an end to this — once and for all," she brushed his tears away. "I won't let anyone hurt you, us."</p><p>Rio got closer. "Nicky, do you want me to get you something? Coffee? Snacks?"</p><p>"A coffee would be nice."</p><p>She nodded, looked at Agatha, smiling; she knew that they needed to be alone — so, quickly, she left the house.</p><p>"Nicky," Agatha sat next to him. "I don't want you to feel ashamed of who you are. I really do understand you."</p><p>The boy breathed in and out — his eyes met hers, and he felt understood. Agatha was the only one who had always managed to cheer him up.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I should've told you earlier, but I was afraid because I thought you'd see me differently, that you'd stop loving me."</p><p>"Oh, <em>baby</em>," her hand went on his hair, ruffling them and messing with it. "I would never, I love you so much. I'd be happy to meet him, if you'd let me."</p><p>Nicholas slightly blushed. "He stood up for me against grandma — and I told him to leave, I didn't want him to see me like that," he sighed loudly. "I really like him."</p><p>"I bet you do," Agatha kept reminiscing her own relationship with Rio and smiled — she and Nicholas truly were so similiar, and that was beautiful. "I'm so proud of you."</p><p>"Thank you, and also Rio — she's so amazing, I'm glad you have her."</p><p>Agatha knew it, she was so glad to have found her.</p><p>"Yes, she's—, I really love her."</p><p>Nicholas arched his brow — as a grin made its way to his lips. "Oh, <em>really</em>?"</p><p>And, soon, she realised that what she had said might've been misunderstood — she noticed the smirk on his face and rolled her eyes, not denying anything.</p><p>"Come on, don't make weird assumptions."</p><p>"I'm not, but," he went to hold her hand, "I'm always here whenever you want to talk — like you're doing now for me, I'm here for you."</p><p>Agatha smiled, admiring how he was. "You're all grown–up, I'm not even sure you're a teenager."</p><p>"I am!"</p><p>They laughed, giggled — and Rio had returned, as she rang the doorbell, Agatha went to open it; she entered, with coffee in one hand, cookies in the other. Nicholas smiled, and so did Agatha.</p><p>"Okay, Nicholas," she rushed to him, "I took a coffee, and something to eat. They are cookies with cocoa, it's a great way to cheer people up!"</p><p>Nicholas giggled, as he snatched the items off her hands, playfully. "Thank you, Rio."</p><p>"No worries," she looked at Agatha, and found her smiling softly — enjoying the cute display of affection of them both.</p><p>"Nicky, has she told you where she was going?"</p><p>"No — but, I guess she'll be home sooner or later."</p><p>Agatha nodded, gazing at Rio; it hurt to see her go, but it was for her safety, and of Nicholas's — she walked towards her, and she stood still.</p><p>"Rio—"</p><p>"It's fine; I'll take my leave," she smiled, understanding, "I'm sure you'll keep me updated, right?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"Okay, then," she wanted to kiss her, or simply hug — but Nicholas was there, so she caressed her shoulder, awkwardly, and Agatha couldn't help but let out a laugh. "I'll wait for a text," she whispered, her hand slipping down her arm, and it was so <em>hypnotising</em>, only for her to walk away.</p><p>Agatha looked away. Rio had gone out, and she sat next to Nicholas, blushing slightly, and he noticed — but didn't say anything, he knew (so well).</p>

<p>Agatha hadn't seen Hela in a while, things had gotten busy, as she kept post–poning the session; but, it was inevitable now, she had to ask for help — and she couldn't have inconvenienced Rio more than so.</p><p>Hela was smiling, her posture relaxed. "So, did you follow my advice? Have you challenged yourself?"</p><p>"Yes, I did," she answered immediately — without any hesitation — as she subtly flushed, remembering the shared kiss with Rio, "I think it went okay; we kissed, and I felt very happy."</p><p>And the therapist beamed up. Agatha's results were only the start of a long journey — a journey where she would've guided her, <em>step by step</em>.</p><p>"That's amazing! It really is," her gaze was soft, and lips curled upwards. Agatha seemed in a chipper mood, "I'm proud of you, but I believe you want to talk about something else?"</p><p>"Nothing escapes your eye," a sigh, followed by a laughter — Hela attentively stared at her, ears keen on listening, "I've decided that I need this divorce — not only for me — but for my son too."</p><p>Agatha breathed in and out, perharps trying to gather the courage to talk about it, without being judged by Hela, even if she <em>really</em> wouldn't have done that.</p><p>"My mother — she walked on my son with his boyfriend, and she hit him. I wasn't there, and," her voice trembled, but she had to go on, "I had to be there, but <em>I wasn't</em>."</p><p>Hela bit her lower lip, as she felt incredibly aware of the situation. "It wasn't your fault, you couldn't have known — don't blame yourself, Agatha."</p><p>"I just can't force her to love me — <em>she never has</em> — and I have to do something about it. I have to make him sign the papers, but I don't know how."</p><p>"You have to talk to him properly — I'm sure he'll listen if you're honest."</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. "Yes, well, we haven't been honest with each other — like ever."</p><p>But Hela had a hunch that things were like that; communication was the key for both parties — maybe Ralph was as unsatisfied as Agatha was — weirdly enough, she could've succeeded in her quest.</p><p>"That means you'll have to try."</p><p>And she, strangely, agreed. But, something else was bothering her, Agatha stared at her eyes, feeling weirdly determined.</p><p>"How do you—, I mean, between two girls? Don't get me wrong, I did have experience in the past, but it was a long time ago. I'm not sure how to, you know, keep things going smoothly? I was so much younger, and, well—"</p><p>Hela had a reassuring smile on her lips — as she wondered how much willpower she had gathered to ask her that — she didn't mind, of course.</p><p>"Well, Agatha, girls have to get a bit <em>creative</em>; sex is different for everyone, you just have to understand what you like to do — if oral sex or simply using fingers — it's up to you," she noticed worries in her eyes, and confusion, "I'm saying, it takes two to have sex. You'll have to explore it with your partner, and together you'll realise what you like — it's easier than done, and it takes a great amount of trust."</p><p>Agatha felt sort of relieved, even if not completely. "She's far more experienced than me, I don't want her to see me as someone useless, I don't know how to explain it."</p><p>"Oh, don't worry! I'm sure she'll be more than happy to teach you. It's a good way of establishing a cheerful environment!"</p><p>"If you say so," she looked at the clock — and amazed at how fast time flowed, talking to Hela really did help her, even if sometimes it felt awkward, but she always managed to lift that tension.</p><p>So — could she continue the sessions?</p><p>"Hela, can we continue seeing each other until I feel more confident?"</p><p>"Of course," she stood up from the chair — walking towards her, "Agatha, you can interrupt whenever you want. I'm not forcing you or anything — worry not!"</p><p>Agatha smiled, feeling as lucky as ever.</p><p>—</p><p>Nicholas and Agatha were at a nearby café — Evanora had left the house, but they both knew that she would've returned — for now, they would've enjoyed a moment of rest.</p><p>"Did you—, how's things with your boyfriend?"</p><p>His eyes meeting hers, and a smile on his lips, appreciating how hard she was trying, and how supportive she was — unlike <em>other</em> people.</p><p>"He's worried — of course — but he's been very supportive. He's texting me and motivating me to never give up."</p><p>Agatha breathed in relief. "That's good. He's a good one."</p><p>After minutes of silence — of unsaid things — Agatha felt the urge to ask him questions, without overwhelming him; simple and neat ones, that didn't require much thought — but maybe, even that wasn't the solution.</p><p>"Nicky, you could've told me that you were interested in boys," voice sounded sort of disappointed, making the boy lift his gaze, "I wouldn't have judged."</p><p>"I know, but I was afraid."</p><p>And she understood that feeling.</p><p>"We can talk about everything, I'll always be there."</p><p>Nicholas arched his brow and grinned. "If we can talk about anything, then how do <em>you</em> feel about Rio?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened, as she didn't expect that question; her eyes struggled to look at him, cheeks slightly rosy, struggling to form a proper phrase. Either way, she had to answer.</p><p>"We are good friends."</p><p>"Mom, come on. I thought we weren't supposed to lie!"</p><p>He was persistent and seemed amused by the whole situation. When had he become like that?</p><p>"We, well—, you see," how could Agatha even put it to words? "We <em>kind of</em> love each other."</p><p>"What, 'kind of'? Do you love each other or not?"</p><p>A sudden embarrassment had overcome her — she had never admitted her feelings out loud, and now, it felt like an incredible task.</p><p>"We love each other. We do," a sudden sigh, eyes meeting Nicholas's — she realised how entertained he was, "I don't know why you're making me say these things."</p><p>"To build your confidence, Mom! Trust me on this!"</p><p>Agatha found herself smiling at him. Still, there was something else to discuss about — a more <em>urgent</em> matter.</p><p>"Nicky, I'm planning on divorcing your father. I'll talk to him, bribe him even, but, maybe I'll have to find a new home, a job — and your grandma, she'll never talk to us again, and I'll probably be forgotten by everyone."</p><p>"Mom, I don't care! I just want to be with you. I don't care about my father or grandma — they never cared about me, so why <em>should</em> I?" Nicholas sounded serious, scaring Agatha a little — his anger was bigger than she had originally thought, perhaps she had to do something about it.</p><p>"You're the best thing that happened to me, Nicky," her hand caressed his cheek, and the boy laughed, smiling brightly.</p><p>"Is Rio the second best thing?"</p><p>"If you keep teasing me, you'll get grounded."</p><p>Nicholas gasped. "Mom!"</p><p>—</p><p>It was evening, Agatha had agreed to let Nicholas have a sleepover with his friends (she presumed with his boyfriend), either way, she had let him, as she gave him a lecture on how to behave first (Nicholas hated it, <em>cringing</em> at every word).</p><p>So, Ralph sat on the chair, typing something on the computer, probably busy with paper–work. Agatha's opportunity to talk.</p><p>"Ralph," she sat on the chair, next to him, "I have to talk with you."</p><p>And he sighed, focusing on her; his eyes were tired, but so were Agatha's.</p><p>"Go on."</p><p>"I want a divorce, and I'm going to do everything in my power to make it happen."</p><p>Ralph's eyes widened. He turned off the computer, and Agatha knew that, <em>now</em>, all of his attention was on her, and how complicated things would've gotten.</p><p>"Okay, let's divorce. We can handle this quietly."</p><p>Agatha was surprised, as she couldn't hide a gasp, but had to control herself, desperately so.</p><p>"I thought you'd be furious?"</p><p>Ralph attempted a smile. "No, I realised that this can't go on. The woman I truly loves deserves better, and I don't want to hide her —<em> I love her</em>. This job doesn't satisfy me, they all see me as someone who cheated by marrying the daughter of the CEO," his eyes met hers, "I tried loving you — we had a son and all — but, I can't convince myself, you, and I just want to breath again."</p><p>Why had those words managed to sadden Agatha?</p><p>"But, your mother wouldn't like that. I'll probably get insults and get fired, but you — your fate will be <em>worse</em> than mine."</p><p>Somehow, he was right. Evanora had suggested re–marrying, and getting divorced from Ralph, but that had to be done under her care; doing it alone would've raisen suspiciousness, if not something more.</p><p>Nevertheless, they would've handled it quietly. A discussion between lawyers, a sort of 'contract' to sign, and all of the bureaucratic stuff. But, it would've been worth it.</p><p>"I know, I know it well."</p><p>Agatha had to be strong for Rio, Nicholas, and mostly, herself. Facing her mother would've been hard, but she had to — her first, <em>real</em>, rebellion.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><em>Evanora had left the house</em>.</p><p>Few weeks, almost a month had passed, and Agatha, along with Ralph, had agreed to divorcing — so, they called a lawyer of the matter, discussed over agreements, child's support (to which Ralph had agreed to pay, and also let Nicholas spend two days of the week with him), along with other <em>interminable</em> procedures; but everything was completed.</p><p>Since Evanora was out of town — Ralph had quit his job, as he was really intentioned to make a change in his life — he had enough money and would've started looking for a new job, eventually, but he couldn't continue like that, perhaps his moral finally kicking in.</p><p>They still shared a house, but Ralph was actually looking for a new one; with Agatha's help — <em>weirdly</em> getting along. Nicholas knew of the whole situation and tried his best to mind his business — his relationship with Ralph was beyond reparable — or that's what he thought.</p><p>In all of this, Rio played a huge part in supporting Agatha; she would often visit her, go on little dates, bring her gifts (such as flowers, and more) — doing everything in her power to cheer her up, and it worked, because Agatha felt powerful, and so loved.</p><p>So, when the divorce got official, Rio was the first person to know — and she had told Agatha to celebrate and bring Nicholas too; she had organised a little <em>get–together</em> at her house.</p><p>It was a Friday night. Agatha, along with Nicholas, stood before the door, soon ringing the bell — Rio rushing to open it, smiling at the two.</p><p>"There you are," her eyes stared at Nicholas, then, finally, at Agatha, "I thought you'd ditch me at the last moment!"</p><p>Nicholas smirked. "That wouldn't have <em>ever</em> happened," hinting at the fact that Agatha, in no possible way, would've turned her invite down. Agatha realised that, as she rolled her eyes.</p><p>They both entered in — Nicholas gazed around, walking, examinating the room; he wandered alone, and Rio was still with Agatha.</p><p>"Are you okay, Agatha," her voice was soft, incredibly beautiful — so captivating, "I want you to tell me if it's too overwhelming."</p><p>Agatha smiled, looking at Nicholas — he was away, not looking at them — so, she put her hand behind Rio's neck, pulling her closer, and their lips met, sharing a kiss; they hadn't kissed in a while, because Rio wanted to give her space, and Agatha was so caught up with the divorce.</p><p>"Stop worrying, I'm exactly where I want to be," she distanced herself from her — Nicholas hadn't noticed a thing, and she breathed in relief, meanwhile Rio looked as happy as a puppy, as an annoyingly cute smile made its way to her lips.</p><p>"Okay," and sounded reassured, eyes on her. "Congratulations on the divorce — I finally have no more rivals."</p><p>"You never had rivals, it was always you."</p><p>Rio began to blush shyly, avoiding thinking too much of it. "Come on, tone down the flirting, Nicholas is here — how <em>scandalous</em> of you to flirt with your son in the same house!"</p><p>"Suddenly caring about morals," and her laugh echoed through the walls of the home, "I don't like this you."</p><p>She was about to reply, but Nicholas had walked towards them; he was grinning and staring fully at Rio.</p><p>"Are we going to eat, or are you going to keep <em>flirting</em>?"</p><p>Agatha coughed — breaking the awkwardness of the moment, but Rio seemed to enjoy his statement; she was aware that Nicholas knew about them but didn't expect him to be so straightforward about it</p><p>"Nicholas, you probably flirt more than me with your boyfriend. You shouldn't be talking."</p><p>Nicholas gasped in surprise, then laughed it off — Agatha found herself giggling.</p><p>"But, sure, let's eat. I made pizza, followed a suspicious recipe, but it's Nicholas's favourite, so you'll have to pretend that it's good."</p><p>They laughed and proceeded to sit at the table; good or not, Rio tried her best, and that was adorable.</p><p>—</p><p>After a surprisingly good meal, the three sat on the couch. Rio had brought — actually making a real subscription — to the streaming platform that had Grey's Anatomy on it, and Nicholas was excited, as he thanked her many, many times.</p><p>The show was good, interesting, and Agatha cuddled to Rio, her head on her shoulder — eyes closed, and Rio kept caressing her hair, which were smooth and silky, Nicholas didn't seem to mind.</p><p>"Nicholas, you have some serious bad taste; why liking Derek when Mark Sloan is literally there?"</p><p>Nicholas groaned. "Even if I tell you, you wouldn't get it."</p><p>And he was right — she probably wouldn't, but teasing him was incredibly funny.</p><p>"Nah, you just have low standards—"</p><p>Nicholas tried to protest; it was then that Agatha got closer to Rio's ear, laughing quietly, as she didn't want him to notice, whispering.</p><p>"Let him be. Don't make fun of him — or else."</p><p>Agatha went back to cuddling her, but all Rio could think of was of the '<em>or else</em>'. What had she meant by that? Probably nothing, meaningless words told to make her shut up — either way, she decided to focus on the show. Nicholas was hooked too.</p><p>But it was distracting.</p><p>—</p><p>It was around 11 PM when Nicholas began feeling sleepy, and so Agatha — Rio seemed perfectly fine, probably used to the all–nighters she would pull when overwhelmed with work.</p><p>Rio suggested that they should've stayed for the night; she could've slept on the couch, as they would've taken the bed — Nicholas protested, argued with her and, after many minutes of discussion, she had agreed to let him sleep there — Nicholas smirked at Agatha, and she tried to ignore him.</p><p>Also, Rio had lent him some clothes — old pyjamas, oversized t–shirt and comfy pants (that were too big for him, but he didn't complain). And to Agatha, basically the same, only that the clothes were a little too small for her (she, too, didn't complain).</p><p>After saying 'good night' to each other, Nicholas proceeded to get comfy on the couch; he didn't seem to mind it, as he was on a call with his boyfriend — probably the true motive of him wanting to be alone.</p><p>So, Agatha and Rio were in the room — <em>the bedroom</em> — and they both looked painfully aware of the situation. Rio gazed at her, smiling.</p><p>"I always sleep on the left — you'll sleep on right."</p><p>Agatha walked closer to her. "Claiming sides now?"</p><p>"My house, my rules."</p><p>Rio smiled as she couldn't help but noticed Agatha's irritation increasing — teasing her never failed to be amusing.</p><p>Soon, Agatha positioned her hands around Rio's waist, pulling her closer — once more — as they shared another kiss, this time more passionately; the air became short, and they had to pull away.</p><p>"I missed kissing you, I've been so caught up with things."</p><p>"It's fine. The longer the wait, the <em>greater</em> the pleasure," soon, a laugh — and Agatha shushed her with another kiss, then another one; as they inevitable walked towards the bed, Agatha gently pushed her on it.</p><p>She sat on the bed, and Rio got up, sitting right next to her — it seemed that Agatha wanted to talk about something; she had learned how to read through her.</p><p>"Is everything fine?" Rio asked, her hand on her thigh, Agatha sighing.</p><p>"Well, now that I'm divorced — my mother will definitely find out, and I'll probably be cut off her will, along with other things; Nicholas will probably get the same treatment, and the future of her company is unknown — I've been worried of some stuff."</p><p>Rio listened carefully and so attentively.</p><p>"I'm just—, I mean, I don't care about the company, I still can't believe I'll disappear from her life, forever," Agatha's eyes were low, and worried, but she managed to look at her brown eyes, that were so keen on her. "But, I'm glad because I have you, Nicholas; you're my family."</p><p>Agatha had remembered Wanda's words and how true they were — she was glad to have found her again and to re–kindle the old relationship. Meanwhile, Rio had the biggest smile in all history.</p><p>"Don't smile like that — or I'll think you're making fun of me."</p><p>Rio hugged her, arms around her, and Agatha reciprocated the hug; they stood still, in each other's presence, and the warmth increased — after a while, Rio interrupted the hug, as her fingers caressed her cheek, slowly and lovingly.</p><p>"I'm not making fun of you; I just find you adorable — and I'm so lucky to have you."</p><p>Agatha let out a laugh as she lay on the bed — followed by Rio soon after, scooping closer to her, hugging her (again), in a goofy attempt of cuddling together — and smiling.</p><p>"We'll think of what to do; I'll never leave you alone. We'll face it together," her voice was so quiet, almost silent, but Agatha had heard that.</p><p>"You're so clingy," an obvious tease, but she, too, got closer to her. "I'm serious."</p><p>"I just love you so much."</p><p>Agatha couldn't reply to that — she kept quiet, and Rio realised that she had won the challenge.</p><p>"What happened to establishing sides? You said you'd sleep on the left?"</p><p>Rio kissed her neck, and Agatha flinched.</p><p>"I changed my mind. Do you have any complaints?"</p><p>But she hadn't any. Agatha was so cuddled, loved, and Rio's kisses made her mind go numb — she sighed, lips meeting hers, only for them to part ways shortly after.</p><p>"Sleep now, Rio."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am."</p><p>And she smiled, sincerely. Rio was there, things would've been fine — Agatha breathed in relief.</p>

<p>Eventually, after another round of weeks passed on searching for a house, Ralph had found it — and he made sure to pack all of his stuff, and get away; he tried talking to Nicholas, and the boy tried really, <em>really</em> hard to listen to him. So, Ralph was out, but Agatha knew that alone, without him, and without her mother's support (economically speaking), she had to start looking for a new apartment too — a smaller one. And a job.</p><p>Rio, of course, had joined in the search of the apartment. It was a calm, tranquil afternoon, Nicholas was studying in the library, so they were alone; focused on the task.</p><p>"Thankfully, I have some money saved; I didn't know it'd be this hard," Agatha typed on the keyboard — they sat on the couch, Rio sat close to her, and she gazed at her, adoringly and smiley, "I don't want it to be far from Nicholas's school."</p><p>"You could stay at my place?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, turning her head — staring at her fully — she pinched her cheek. Rio let out a laugh.</p><p>"No. You being here is more than enough."</p><p>Rio hummed in response — she understood her and wouldn't have pressured in. Agatha needed her independence, now that she was slowly obtaining it.</p><p>"Alright, <em>my love</em>."</p><p>"Are we doing pet–names now?"</p><p>And she had that intention.</p><p>"Yes. Is it prohibited? My love, my sweet–behalf, and—"</p><p>Agatha kissed her — in order to make her stop talking, and it worked because Rio had completely shut up, nothing else could be heard. After a long while, they stopped — staring at each other.</p><p>"Stop distracting me, <em>idiot</em>."</p><p>Rio giggled soundly. "You're not good at pet–names. 'Idiot'? Are you into that?"</p><p>That made Agatha want to teach her a lesson; as she was about to respond to that, they heard knocks on the door, than the bell ringing restlessly. The two never looked more confused.</p><p>Agatha stood up, and so did Rio. They walked towards the door, carefully and quietly. Agatha looked through the peephole, and, after that, she took a few steps back as she started slightly shaking.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Rio was concerned by the sudden change of behaviour – rushing to hold her. Agatha seemed absent.</p><p>"<em>My mother is here</em>."</p><p>Rio could've swore that her heart had skipped a beat. She had to be strong and <em>needed to.</em></p><p>"I'm here. You can do this."</p><p>Agatha knew it, and she felt powerful — even if she couldn't exactly hide her fear; her mother there, but Rio also managed to give her a sense of peace.</p><p>The door was opened. Evanora rushed in. Her eyes, they were furious, and a maddening look characterised them.</p><p>"You," eyes on Agatha but, soon, she had noticed Rio. Oh, Rio recognised her. Suddenly, she stopped walking closer. "<em>You?</em>"</p><p>Silence fell. Agatha looked confused, terribly so. Her eyes shifted from Evanora to Rio, wondering the relationship between the two.</p><p>"You're Agatha's mom?" Rio couldn't believe it; the same lady she had met at the café, with such a rude, impolite temperament, was actually her mother? It seemed like a sick joke.</p><p>Evanora ignored her. Rio felt annoyed (even if slightly relieved) as she stepped closer to Agatha.</p><p>"I don't care if your friend is there; I can't believe what you did," her voice sounded severe — Agatha was used to that tone, that she so well knew. But Rio was <em>there</em> — she wouldn't actually do anything? "Divorcing him without letting me know?! Hadn't it been for him firing himself, I wouldn't have ever known!"</p><p>Agatha still didn't reply, focusing on what to say; every word had to be thought, and every sentences had to be studied. It was as if walking around eggshells — unbelievably hard.</p><p>"That's the problem; you wouldn't have ever known — when did you ever care about me? Or genuinely showed interest?" Agatha's voice sounded defeated, tired of a battle where no one really was the winner, <em>or the loser.</em> Rio looked at her, gaze softened, and knew that she had to let it all out, once and for all.</p><p>"I suppressed myself for so many years — waisting my youth, and most of my adulthood — and I was unhappy, trapped in this! Just to please <em>you</em>, and your <em>unreachable</em> standards."</p><p>Evanora remained silent, appearing to be listening carefully. But something felt off. The conversation wasn't over yet.</p><p>"But I'm tired, and I can't go on like this; I'll never have your love, and <em>that's fine</em> — but I can't sacrifice my happiness for you," bluish eyes met the brown ones, that had never looked at her more proudly, "I have to protect what I love."</p><p>Rio smiled tenderly as she got closer to Agatha. Then, her hand and went to hold hers. The look in the younger eyes was doubtful, but the other one reassured her. It was fine — Agatha had Rio.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, gazing back at her mother. "I don't ever want to see you <em>ever</em> again. I don't care about the destiny of your company, or you — I couldn't care less."</p><p>Evanora laughed, in a sickening way. "You need me. My money, support. You wouldn't last a day."</p><p>"I don't need you, and I probably never did." Agatha's gaze was firm, intimidating. Rio noticed how much her hand trembled; she was doing so good — letting go of the <em>ghosts</em> of her past.</p><p>"I've always known you were a troubled child — always needed useless attention and such. I tried to save you, but your soul is far too corrupted." Evanora glanced at Rio, noticing the hatred in her eyes. A stare so powerful – Evanora felt slightly uncomfortable. "Don't try contacting me again."</p><p>Evanora, finally, was able to look into Rio's eyes — she raised her hand, finger pointing at her. "And you, <em>sooner or later</em>, will realise your mistake. Who you choose to be with."</p><p>And — she left.</p><p>Agatha fell on her knees — breaking into a desperate lament. Tears came out and seemed to <em>never end</em>. Rio knelt down, hugging her.</p><p>"Let it all out. It's <em>finally</em> over."</p><p>—</p><p>It was evening, Agatha had calmed down significantly (Rio had helped her, a lot). They sat on the couch. Agatha cuddled to Rio — watching a movie. Both of them were distracted, Rio kept looking at Agatha, and she did the same.</p><p>"How are you feeling?" Rio asked, breaking the thousands of silent stares — pausing the movie. Fully focusing on her. Agatha smiled.</p><p>"Better. Don't worry about me."</p><p>"I do worry about you."</p><p>Agatha caressed her cheek. Rio was caring, almost intoxicating, and treated her with great care and respect — she loved her. When had she been that happy? Rio truly did save her from a cruel destiny.</p><p>"Rio," her voice was weak, Rio looked at her — wondering what Agatha was feeling. "Do you want to have <em>sex</em>? We won't be interrupted like last time."</p><p>It was sudden. Rio was shocked to hear that (not that she hadn't been hoping to), and she didn't know if Agatha had told her that because she felt guilty or forced to. Either way, she had to find out.</p><p>"I don't want you to feel forced." Rio reassured, smiling tenderly. A smile that Agatha could never get bored of looking at. "I don't mind waiting; I want you to be comfortable with it—"</p><p>"Rio.<em> I want to</em>." Agatha paused — Rio's pupils were wide, still on her. Oh, Agatha knew the effect she had on her — how powerful her words could be. "I've been talking to my therapist about it. I'm working on me, on how I perceive myself — and I'm doing progress. I really, <em>really</em> want to."</p><p>Rio's cheeks were on fire, her body betraying her — she had to look away rapidly. Agatha purred, and she got closer to her. Lips over her ear, as she whispered.</p><p>"And I really want <em>you</em> to touch <em>me</em>."</p><p>It was enough. Rio couldn't handle the warmth anymore — the teasing, her desires. Agatha looked beautifully confident, incredibly irresistibile. So, Rio stood up — taking Agatha's hand — as they walked towards the room.</p><p>—</p><p>The duo reached the room — barged in it. Rio kissed Agatha fiercely yet lovingly. Agatha panted, gasping for air — moaning in her mouth.</p><p>Rio, playfully, pushed Agatha on the bed and positioned herself on top of her. The view was breathtaking: Agatha's rosy cheeks, her heavy breathing, messy hair. It was beautiful, she was hers.</p><p>Rio started removing her shirt, followed by the bra. Her brown eyes gazed at her body. Her curves, stretch marks, and her <em>scars</em> too. It was simply beautiful, simply Agatha's.</p><p>Soon, Rio noticed how nervous Agatha was to be seen (almost) naked. It was true, Agatha did mention Rio how she hadn't always been confident on her body — how that (idiot) ex–husband of hers was always criticising it.</p><p>Agatha tried to hide herself, avoiding looking into Rio's eyes; feeling embarrassed, unworthy — ashamed of her looks.</p><p>"You're beautiful, Agatha." Rio got closer to her — she kissed her neck, her tongue licking the skin, only to kiss that spot again. Agatha gasped. "You don't understand how amazing you look; I can't even think properly. Your body is so, so beautiful."</p><p>Agatha felt at ease, calmer than before — a chuckle escaping her mouth. "<em>Womaniser</em>."</p><p>Rio's kisses continued — as she moved downwards. Lips kissing her neck, then her chest — and then in between her bosom. Agatha was speechless and could only reply with soft sighs, moans.</p><p>Then, Rio kissed her nipple. Biting, licking it. Agatha felt aroused, lost to her senses. It had been a long while since she had been stimulated like this — <em>loved</em>.</p><p>"Rio, I want more." Agatha murmured — her voice trembling with pleasure. Rio grinned, sucking her nipple one more time. They were red, swollen.</p><p>Rio's hands removed her pants, and, once out of the way, her panties. Then, Rio stopped — admiring the view she so much loved. Then, she had to ask.</p><p>"Are you comfortable with penetration?"</p><p>Agatha looked at her, shocked to hear that question. She really wasn't, and Rio had probably realised that. After many years with Ralph, after so many times doing the <em>same</em> thing — Agatha had come to hate it, feeling slightly uncomfortable.</p><p>Of course, she knew that Rio was different; <em>she wasn't Ralph</em>. But Agatha couldn't control it, nor explain it.</p><p>"I, well—" Agatha didn't want to say no, but neither she wanted to say yes.</p><p>"It's okay." Rio kissed her tummy, caressing the places Agatha hated and tried to hide. The touches were soft — needed. "There are other ways."</p><p>Oh, but Agatha knew that. <em>Absolutely</em> <em>did</em>. After all of that research, the (few) experience of the past she had shared with Wanda. Agatha had a general knowledge — and more.</p><p>Agatha had to brightened up the atmosphere.</p><p>"Let's see what you can do."</p><p>Rio giggled at that comment. Was Agatha challenging her? Not that she minded. Rio loved to see Agatha so confident, happy.</p><p>So, with a hasty movement, Rio managed to spread Agatha's legs. And, her lips went on her clit — making Agatha sigh. Toungue making circles, adding pressure, then stopping suddenly — Rio was teasing her, and Agatha noticed.</p><p>"Stop messing around." Agatha breathed, and she couldn't hear Rio's little (bratty) laugh. Obviously, Rio was doing that on purpose.</p><p>"Have you always been this impatient?"</p><p>"Please," Agatha begged — voice weak, raspy. "Please, <em>baby</em>. Make me cum. You're so good."</p><p>Rio was hypnotised by such words. If before was all a tease — now — her priorities had shifteted. It seemed like a matter of extreme importance. Who was she to deny that to her? Rio couldn't resist any longer. Rio wanted to hear those sounds coming from Agatha. <em>Craved it</em>.</p><p>Once again, Rio worked her to reach her climax. Licking, sucking — kissing. Pressure, and extremely rapid movements. Agatha was in a wave of sensations, and her body trembled. Lots of whines, cries. Her hand went on Rio's hair, pushing her down — and Rio increased her speed.</p><p>Then, she <em>reached</em> it. Agatha had reached her orgasm. It felt different than other times (obviously), and Rio had done so, so much for her to do so.</p><p>"You doing okay, Agatha?" Rio asked, getting closer to Agatha — her lips being wet.</p><p>Agatha pulled her in a kiss. Both lips now shared the same liquid — the same passion. Rio moaned, and so did Agatha. Needing air, they separated — as only a thread of saliva united them.</p><p>"Rio. I never thought I could, I mean, my body—"</p><p>Rio smiled, lovingly. "You can do <em>everything</em>, Agatha. <em>Orgasming</em> is one of them."</p><p>Agatha laughed, and Rio too. After a while, Agatha glanced at her; she had something to say. Rio knew it.</p><p>"Rio, do you want me to—?"</p><p>Rio covered Agatha with a blanket. Shutting her down completely.</p><p>"Sleep."</p><p>"Wait. Rio—"</p><p>"Agatha, I'm serious. It's been a hard day. You need rest." Rio cuddled closer to her, holding her tight. "Let me take care of you. Just for today."</p><p>Agatha didn't reply. She wanted to be taken care of, after years of loneliness. So, she snuggled closer to Rio — getting into her arms. The tiredness getting to her.</p><p>It truly had been a difficult day. But, with Rio being there, things seemed a little easier. Agatha didn't know how things would've gone — or what would've happened. Even if she didn't fear it. Agatha didn't fear anything, anyone.</p><p>Not anymore.</p>

<p>Weeks, then months passed. Agatha (slowly) gained her independence back; from obtaining a job, to trying new activities – be herself, after so many years of repression. She, along with Nicholas, had moved out of their old house. Living in a peaceful environment really did help them to grow, to understand themselves.</p><p>It was all great. But, one thing bothered Agatha, and that was <em>Rio</em>. Not in a bad way, obviously – rather, something concerned her. How could she ask Rio to be her girlfriend? In a more official way?</p><p>Rio always respected (practically, adored) Agatha – and always waited for her to be ready. So now, Agatha was ready, and she wanted to make the first move. <em>But how?</em></p><p>It was a day before the week–end, Agatha sat on the sofa of Hela's studio. The session had ended, but Agatha felt something amiss – something she had to ask.</p><p>"Hela," her voice, doubtful yet determined, "I did a lot of progress with you; I started to love myself, I'm more happy, more confident. And, well–," she met the therapist's eyes, that waited for her to speak, "I think I'm ready to walk on my own."</p><p>Hela smiled, tenderly. One thing she loved about her work was to see her patients walk on their own – without being scared, hesitant. Agatha had made a lot of progress, and Hela couldn't be more proud.</p><p>"Agatha, I'm truly grateful to have worked with you, and I'm sure you'll do fine on your own. You can still text me if you need something, or just talk. I'll always listen."</p><p>Agatha smiled, understanding Hela's words. Everything was over. But, one thing still had to be asked.</p><p>"Thank you, Hela. But, may I ask you one last thing?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Oh, how to pose that question? Either way, she had to ask, and fast. Rapidly, she gathered courage, as seconds passed by – the clock kept on ticking.</p><p>"How do you ask, <em>officially</em>, to be someone's girlfriend?"</p><p>A small giggle, and Agatha feared to have looked extremely dumb and awkward. But Hela wasn't judging, anything of that sort.</p><p>"Well, I'd go for the usual: during a romantic dinner!"</p><p>Agatha sort of agreed. But, wasn't it too cliché? She didn't want to indulge – nor ask any further questions. So, she just nodded.</p><p>"Thank you, Hela. I'll see you around."</p><p>"Good luck, Agatha!"</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha returned home, Nicholas was in the kitchen, doing his homework. Quickly, Agatha walked into the room. The boy was focused, as he seemed to not have noticed her.</p><p>"Nicky?"</p><p>Now, Nicholas's attention was on her – head tilting, his eyes worryingly staring at her.</p><p>"Mom? Is there something wrong?"</p><p>Agatha smiled – in a reassuring way. "No, worry not, I–," she got closer to him, sitting on a nearby chair, "I just wanted to talk."</p><p>"Sure," Nicholas smiled, letting out a sigh of relief. "About what?"</p><p>It was hard to describe how tense Agatha was. Her rational part knew that Nicholas wouldn't have said anything against her, only a few teasing words – <em>that's it</em>. But then, why was it so hard for her? Agatha felt shy, embarrassed, and could feel her cheeks turning slightly rosy.</p><p>Nicholas noticed that.</p><p>"Is it about Rio?"</p><p>"Wha–, How did you–?"</p><p>"You always have that gaze, always blush subtly – that's Rio's power." Nicholas giggled. Of course, he wasn't stupid – or, perhaps, Agatha was easily readable.</p><p>"It is about her," Agatha breathed in – it was her chance. "I was thinking of asking her to be my girlfriend."</p><p>"Weren't you already?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, but Nicholas looked serious – confused as ever. <em>Oh</em>.</p><p>"No. We aren't."</p><p>Nicholas wanted to say many things, but he opted to restrain himself. He knew that Agatha was sort–of new to these stuff – <em>romantic ones</em>. Ralph, being Ralph, left Agatha no time for that.</p><p>"Are you looking for my approval first? You have my blessing – but you know that."</p><p>Agatha looked away – ashamed. "No, I–, I wanted to ask you–, how should I do it?"</p><p>"Me? <em>How</em>?" Nicholas was surprised, and Agatha was deadly serious.</p><p>"Yes, well–, I want it to be perfect. I can't fail, I really can't."</p><p>"Mom, Rio would be as happy as a <em>puppy</em> even if you gave her a used handkerchief as a gift; asking her that is easier than you think!"</p><p>Agatha wasn't totally convinced, but she believed in his words. Perhaps – it really was easy, easier than other things she had gone through.</p><p>"But," Nicholas continued, "I'd go to a park – on a sunny day, a picnic maybe? Then, ask her!"</p><p>"Is that what you did for your boy—"</p><p>"If that's all, I have to keep studying–!"</p><p>Agatha laughed, standing up from her seat, as she kissed his forehead, then proceeded to walk away.</p><p>The ideas were there, but still not enough. <em>It was foggy.</em></p><p>—</p><p>The next day – Agatha had agreed to meet Wanda for a coffee. The duo talked, from time to time. Wanda was made aware (by Agatha) of her situation: her mother, her divorce, and her <em>being</em> <em>with a woman</em>. They actually got along, rekindling that old flame – that was now an authentic, genuine friendship.</p><p>So, the two of them sat at a table; coffees in her hands, as they were playfully talking to one another.</p><p>"Is something wrong, Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha looked at her – confused. They were laughing, smiling even. How was Wanda able to see through her? Did something happen?</p><p>"Why do you ask, Wanda?"</p><p>"Well," Wanda let go of the cup, "I can sense something bothering you? I can't really explain – you look distracted, though."</p><p>It was amazing, Agatha was actually speechless. Hiding was useless – she had to let her know.</p><p>"It's embarrassing to even talk about it."</p><p>Wanda smiled. "If it's bothering you – it's not."</p><p>"Alright," a timid, shy smirk appeared on Agatha's lips – she truly was glad to have Wanda. "I don't know how to–, like, ask, someone to be my girlfriend. <em>Officially</em>."</p><p>"Oh!" Wanda sounded surprised – as a soft giggle escaped from her. "Agatha, when do you want to?"</p><p>"I was told during a dinner. A picnic, even."</p><p>"Those are <em>not</em> your choices."</p><p>Agatha knew Wanda was right – obviously so. Then, how? Agatha thought hard, and wrinkles could be seen on her whole face. Seconds, then minutes passed by.</p><p>Suddenly, Agatha had an idea.</p><p>"She likes stargazing. I could, maybe—"</p><p>"You have to!" Wanda brightened up, and Agatha felt embarrassed – probably realising how bad of an overthinker she had been. "See, Agatha? You just had to take a minute for yourself!"</p><p>"Do you think she'd like it?"</p><p>Wanda pondered, then smirked. "Yes."</p><p>—</p><p>So, evening came. Agatha sat on her bed – phone in her hand, as she tried to text Rio. She had to keep it simple, not too obvious.</p><p>But, unexpectedly, Rio had sent a text before she could properly type.</p><p>
<em>Agatha! Are you free tomorrow's evening?</em>
</p><p>How? Agatha was impressed – also glad.</p><p><em>Yes, I am. But, I decide where we go</em>.</p><p>Rio soon replied.</p><p>
<em>So bossy... okay... Do you want me to wear something specific? ;)</em>
</p><p>Oh, Agatha was flustered – so, so much. How was Rio always so charming, playfully pleasing to be with.</p><p>
<em>You can choose, but choose wisely. :)</em>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, Agatha... I'll have to stay awake all night thinking.</em>
</p><p>Agatha chuckled – because she, too, would've done so.</p>

<p>The day came, and Agatha couldn't exactly hide how anxious she was; her stomach ached, and her heart simply couldn't stay calm – not to mention the entirety of her thoughts: <em>all about Rio</em>.</p><p>The two of them had spent the whole day texting, and that reassured Agatha. Rio texted in such lively way, almost impossible to get bored of.</p><p>Of course, Agatha had planned everything (as promised). A nice dinner (in an <em>even </em>nicer restaurant) and a walk through the park – where the confession would've taken place.</p><p><em>7.30 PM.</em> Agatha had left the house (after being encouraged and teased by Nicholas). Wanda had texted her, wishing her luck – even Hela had sent her a text.</p><p>Agatha felt ready, more than ever. So, she got in the car and she drove to Rio's house. Time flew during the trip, and the night was so confusingly beautiful; the moon shined, and the stars seemed to help her light increase.</p><p>A breathtaking sight for a fated night.</p><p>The car stopped, and Agatha texted Rio to come out – then she waited. Seconds, minutes? Rio wasn't coming out, Agatha worried. She parked the car and walked towards her palace – pushing the bottom of the intercom.</p><p>Rio opened the main door – but didn't answer, nor asked who was ringing.</p><p>How much was Agatha's heart racing. She ran towards the elevator and waited. Once on the floor, she rushed towards the door of her apartment and rang the bell.</p><p>Weak sounds of steps, and Rio opened the door, and – <em>oh</em>. She looked sick, her whole face being red, messy and sweaty hair, and her body shaking.</p><p>"Agatha–," a sudden cough, and her eyes looked down, embarrassed, "I should've texted you–, I got sick at work and, well, I thought I could've recovered overnight but, I–, well–"</p><p>Agatha entered inside (rushed in, practically) and closed the door. Rio took a few steps back, ready for the scolding of her life.</p><p>"How high?" Agatha asked, intertwining her arms – Rio stared at her, and she (for once) couldn't exactly tell her thoughts.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Agatha got closer. "The temperature. How high is it?"</p><p>"38.1 in Celsius," Rio looked around, avoiding her gaze, "100.58 in Fahrenheit."</p><p>It was high, and could've gotten worse.</p><p>"Did you eat something?"</p><p>"Yes," an obvious lie, and Agatha had noticed that – a loud sigh came out of her lips.</p><p>"Agatha, I'm sorry–"</p><p>Agatha took her hand and began to walk towards her room, both in pure silence. The door was open, and she began to approach Rio's bed. Once there, she made Rio sit on it – and the brown eyes couldn't help but stare at her, speaking no (useless) words.</p><p>"Stay here: relax. I'm going to cook something for you."</p><p>Rio was about to reply (to protest mostly), but Agatha had left the room with such hasty movements, leaving her in awe.</p><p>Was she mad at her? She couldn't tell – and that made her thoughts spiral in deep concern. Had she ruined everything?</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha woke Rio up – as she did fall asleep, probably due to tiredness.</p><p>"You were exhausted, were you?" Agatha smiled. Rio noticed a plate in her hands, and the smell was beautifully pleasant to her nose. A soup, perhaps – or something else?</p><p>"I–," Rio was about to reply, but Agatha sat on the bed – next to her. That made Rio, too, sit on the bed as she (slowly) got up from her sleeping position.</p><p>"Come on, eat while hot," Agatha suggested, and Rio simply nodded, being immune to the smell of such dish – and to her demands.</p><p>Agatha blew the steam off, as she didn't want for Rio to burn her toungue. And Rio watched, admiring the way her lips united – how soft that movement was. Then, Agatha moved the spoon towards Rio's lips.</p><p>"Say '<em>ahh</em>', or else you won't eat."</p><p>"I'm," Rio felt flustered, or was the fever? "I'm capable of feeding myself; I'm not a child. Do not worry–"</p><p>"Well, lying about your health seems pretty <em>childish</em> to me." Agatha smirked, laughing even – and Rio didn't (couldn't) reply. "Now, open your mouth." And she did.</p><p>After a while, as the soup was almost out, Rio gathered the courage to speak again.</p><p>"Are you angry at me?" Rio sounded defeated, and her eyes were the ones of a puppy when scolded – making Agatha slightly feel bad.</p><p>"Do I seem angry?"</p><p>Rationally, Rio knew she wasn't – but emotionally?</p><p>"Yes," Rio swallowed, and then continued, "I should've told you, but I really thought I could recover. I guess I'm not as young as I used to be."</p><p>A giggle from Agatha, and Rio realised (in a few milliseconds) how dumb she had been.</p><p>"I'm not angry, Rio. I just feel bad, because I could've taken a proper care of you – you could've texted me, and I would've been there; helping you recover," Agatha positioned the plate (along with the spoon) on a nearby, tiny table and then stared back at Rio. "Because you were there for me, and I <em>want to</em> do the same."</p><p>Rio was speechless, in a good way.</p><p>"You could've gotten infected, I–, uh–"</p><p>Agatha smiled as she took Rio's cheeks and leaned in for a kiss. Lips pressed on hers, and the warmth was unmatched. Rio was surprised and reacted lately to her initiative – and Agatha was lovingly, gently kissing and caressing her cheeks.</p><p>Once out of breath, Agatha gazed at her.</p><p>"I'm infected, now. I guess you really have no choice."</p><p>Rio positioned her fingertips on her lips, feeling them slightly wet – her cheeks burning, heart racing.</p><p>"Agatha, why–"</p><p>"What do you mean? I can't leave my <em>girlfriend</em> alone – not even when sick."</p><p>Oh, wait. Did Agatha? No. Yes.</p><p>"Agatha–," Rio couldn't think of a possible answer or anything else of the matter. Had Agatha taken advantage of the situation? Smart, sly.</p><p>And Agatha, too, had realised what she had said. "I guess you should rest–"</p><p>No, Rio couldn't. She took Agatha's wrist and, with the little force she had, managed to pull her in the bed – as she fell (almost) on Rio.</p><p>"Rio–"</p><p>"Agatha, did you say 'girlfriend'? Tell me I didn't hallucinate it–"</p><p>Agatha gazed at her, crawling her way to see the look of her eyes; brown and nauseously cute. She was above her, admiring the view – shyness mixed to surprise.</p><p>"You didn't. It just slipped–"</p><p>"Did you want to tell me tonight?"</p><p>And she didn't reply, simply looked away – Rio knew the answer. She smiled and brought her closer, hugging her – bodies melting. Rio's arms around Agatha's neck.</p><p>"Oh, Agatha! You are so cute! My cute, overthinker girlfriend."</p><p>"Rio, stop embarrassing me."</p><p>Thankfully, Rio wasn't able to see her face; how red, sweaty it was. The hug intensified, and Agatha could've almost fallen asleep in her arms of the woman she loved.</p><p>"No. It's my job as your girlfriend. Only I get to see your reactions; that's the pay."</p><p>They held each other, starving of touch – obsessed with that rush.</p><p>"I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you earlier, but–"</p><p>"Agatha," Rio interrupted the hug and was now staring at her, "I was waiting, and I would've waited forever; you are worth the wait, and so <em>much</em> more."</p><p>"And," continued Rio, "I'm so happy. So, so much."</p><p>Agatha kissed her, again and again. Kissing her cheeks, nose, and lips – softly. The movements were slow, and Rio could feel completely healed.</p><p>"I don't want to hear complains after you get sick." Rio laughed, tangling her fingers in Agatha's hair – making her hum in response.</p><p>"I won't complain," she proceeded to kiss her jawline, "I choose this, I couldn't think of something better than this."</p><p>"I just know that Nicky will take care of us. He'll curse us – forever."</p><p>"Don't jinx us, dear."</p><p>They laughed. Seemingly to never cease the sounds, the snorts. Agatha felt powerful, an unimaginable strength flowing in her veins – and that power wouldn't have ever stopped to flow.</p><p>Wasn't for Rio, Agatha wouldn't have discovered how amazing life is when being true to yourself; loving who you love, and loving the person you are.</p><p>"Let's sleep, Agatha."</p><p>"Will you be here when I wake up?"</p><p>"I will, always."</p>
