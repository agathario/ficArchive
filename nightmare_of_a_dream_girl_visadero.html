<h2 class="toc-heading">Nightmare of a Dream Girl</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>On the night after her seventeenth birthday, Rio Vidal lay curled up under a quilt in her aunt’s trailer, limbs tangled, half-listening to the drone of the late-night radio. Delilah was on, solving the problems of the world one caller at a time. </p><p>She could feel herself dozing as Delilah patiently reassured a caller that she shouldn’t give up on love despite being 40 years old and not having had The Dream yet.</p><p>“Always remember, honey, just because you haven’t had your dream yet, doesn’t mean that special someone isn’t out there somewhere dreaming about you.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her breath slowing as she finally fell asleep.</p><p>Somewhere else, her soulmate was awake.</p><p>And then—Rio <em> was </em> that someone else. Somewhere else.</p><p>This wasn’t like a regular dream—this felt <em> real</em>. Crisp air on skin. The distant creak of old wood. And the sharp spike of adrenaline as her heartbeat surged in someone else’s chest.</p><p>She was moving. Fast. Climbing out of a window, narrow, freckled hands braced on the sill. A leg hooked awkwardly over, and then a hissed curse as a boot slipped on the way down. </p><p>Whoever this girl was, she caught herself at the last second by grabbing hold of a white-painted trellis crawling with vines. She dangled there for a breathless moment, the porch light humming somewhere above her head, and then dropped the last few feet to the ground with a muffled thud.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>A soulmate dream.</p><p>The tether only activated when one half was asleep and the other awake. At seventeen, Rio hadn’t expected hers to light up for years—<em> if ever</em>. Most people spent their early twenties waiting, watching, wondering if they'd get anything at all. </p><p>But here she was, eyes closed, breath caught, seeing through the eyes of a stranger who had just risked a broken neck to sneak out of an upstairs bedroom.</p><p>And it was exhilarating<em>. </em></p><p>The girl moved with purpose, barefoot on dew-slick grass, rounding the corner of a big, wraparound porch like she’d done it a hundred times before. Rio caught glimpses—ornate columns, porch swings draped in cushions, moonlight glinting off expensive glass. Wherever this was, it was not her side of town.</p><p>The girl crouched low near the back steps, reached behind a loose panel, and pulled out a small, crumpled bag. Inside: a pack of cigarettes and a lighter worn down at the edges. She lit one with practiced ease, cupping her hand to block the breeze, and took a long, careful drag.</p><p>Then she leaned back against the post and exhaled slowly, like it was the first real breath she’d taken all day.</p><p>Rio grinned in her sleep.</p><p>Who <em> was </em> this girl? Some senator’s daughter sneaking out for a smoke? A prep school rebel with a private stash and no fear? She couldn’t tell. Couldn’t see her face.</p><p>But her heartbeat was still hammering from the climb, and Rio could feel the rush of it like it was her own.</p><p>She didn’t know her name.</p><p>Didn’t know where she was.</p><p>But as smoke curled up toward a haloed moon and distant crickets hummed in the dark, Rio could only think what it might be like to someday hold that hand in hers.</p><p>The girl shifted, resting her head back against the column, eyes turned up toward the stars. Rio could imagine what she was feeling as she sighed. That kind of sigh usually came from a quiet ache that pressed against the ribs when the world felt too heavy to hold, and you had no choice but to pretend you liked the weight.</p><p>Rio didn’t even try to wake up.</p><p>She wanted to <em> stay</em>. Wanted to learn everything about this girl with her hidden cigarettes, this girl who snuck out just to breathe. There was something sad in the way that she smoked like it wasn’t for the thrill but for the ritual.</p><p>Another drag. Another exhale. She tucked a curl of hair behind one ear, then paused, just for a second, and turned her head, like she’d heard something in the distance.</p><p>Rio’s pulse stuttered.</p><p>Did she know?</p><p>Could she feel her too?</p><p>But the girl just stood slowly, brushed the grass from her legs, and slipped the pack back into its hiding place. She glanced once over her shoulder, then started for the trellis again, every step careful, deliberate, like this wasn’t her first midnight escape and wouldn’t be her last.</p><p>And just before she climbed, she paused, fingers curled around the frame, and looked up at the stars one more time.</p><p>Rio startled awake, her hand clenched in the quilt, chest tight like she’d just run a mile. </p><p>The window AC unit groaned and sputtered to a stop, throwing the room into thick, humid silence. A cicada buzzed outside. Somewhere down the road, the Kaplan’s stupid dog barked at nothing.</p><p>She sat up, swung her legs over the side of the cot, and rubbed her face with both hands. No way she was going back to sleep now.</p><p>The trailer door creaked open with a familiar squeal, and she stepped out barefoot onto the warped wooden steps. The night air wrapped around her. Mosquitoes circled, lazy and loud.</p><p>Out front, her Aunt Lilia rocked steadily on the porch, her cigarette glowing orange in the dark. The breeze stirred her hair. Rio wondered if it had ever not been grey. She couldn’t remember it ever being any other way.</p><p>Rio padded over and dropped down onto the step beside her.</p><p>Lilia didn’t look at her. Just blew a ribbon of smoke into the night and said, “Auspicious night, kiddo?”</p><p>“I think I saw <em> her </em>,” Rio said, voice still rasped with sleep. “My soulmate.”</p><p>That earned her a glance. Lilia arched a brow but said nothing. She took another drag, slow and thoughtful.</p><p>Rio eyed the cigarette in her hand. It wasn’t like the one in the dream. It smelled more like cedar and herbs than tobacco.</p><p>“Can I have one?”</p><p>Lilia barked a dry laugh. “Have you ever smoked a day in your life?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No. I just… she did. In the dream.”</p><p>A pause. Then Lilia gave her a look, the kind that cut through the nonsense. “So you wanna cough up a lung to feel close to someone you don’t even know yet?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>Lilia smirked like that avoidance didn’t surprise her, and stubbed her cigarette out.</p><p>“What about a beer?” Rio asked, trying for casual. “Can I at least have one of those? It is my birthday.”</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to argue, but Lilia added, “You can have a sip of mine. <em> Or </em>… hear me out, you could be a normal teenager about it and sneak one later when you think I’m not looking.”</p><p>Lilia handed over the bottle without ceremony, and Rio took the tiniest sip, nose wrinkling at the taste.</p><p>“It’s awful,” she muttered, handing it back.</p><p>Lilia smiled, rocked once more, and said, “That’s how you know you’re still a kid.”</p><p>They sat in silence after that. Just the two of them and the crickets and the dark, and Rio thinking about a girl running from a beautiful house carrying smoke on her breath.</p><p>Three days passed.</p><p>Three nights.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Rio flopped back on her bed with a dramatic groan, limbs starfished across the patchwork quilt, and stared at the ceiling.</p><p>She’d tried everything.</p><p>Warm milk? Gross, but she tried it.</p><p>Lavender oil was Lilia’s idea. Made her sneeze.</p><p>She’d even stolen one of her aunt’s romance novels and forced herself to read three whole chapters before bed, just to see if <em> maybe </em> it would set the mood. Unfortunately, all it did was make her deeply uncomfortable as she noted the many dog-eared chapters.</p><p>But no matter what she did, she only ever got <em> normal </em> dreams now. Boring, disjointed things about school lockers and her teeth falling out.</p><p>Rio rolled over onto her stomach and buried her face in the pillow.</p><p>It wasn’t fair.</p><p>She sat up, wild-haired and determined, and started pacing her room.</p><p>“If one of us has to be asleep and the other awake,” she muttered, “then maybe I just need to figure out <em> when </em> she’s awake.”</p><p>That made sense. Simple Soulmate logic. Like time zones, or fate.</p><p>She pulled a notebook from under her bed where she had already started tracking her sleep schedule since the dream.</p><p>Monday: Slept 1 AM → 7 AM.<br/>
No dream.<br/>
Tuesday: Slept 11 PM → 6:30 AM.<br/>
No dream.<br/>
Wednesday: Slept 2 AM → 9 AM.<br/>
No dream.</p><p>Behind her, the window rattled in the wind. She turned and squinted out into the night, hoping—just maybe—that something would shift. That the stars would realign. That the thread between them would snap back into place and carry her somewhere else. To <em> her</em>.</p><p>Rio stood at the window a moment longer, palms pressed to the glass.</p><p>Then she turned out the light, climbed under the covers, and whispered to the dark, “Come find me again.”</p><p>Eventually, she had to let it go.</p><p>Or at least pretend she had.</p><p>After a month of trying to game the dream with power naps at odd hours, blackout curtains, and chamomile tea by the gallon, Rio finally came to the conclusion that her soulmate either kept almost the exact same sleep schedule as her… or had died immediately after climbing back through that damn window.</p><p>Life went on.</p><p>She graduated. Started classes at the community college, because they’d offered her a scholarship and was within biking distance.</p><p>And when she thought about the girl in passing it was always with a kind of careful detachment.</p><p>She didn’t tell anyone about the dream. She let Lilia think it had been a one-time blip, some silly birthday fluke. Whenever someone mentioned soulmate dreams—usually with envy or disbelief—Rio would shrug like it didn’t matter.</p><p>“I’m not gonna lose sleep over someone I don’t know.”</p><p>She could say all that now. Almost convincingly.</p><p>But every once in a while, late at night, she'd find herself lingering by the window, her hand resting on the sill, half-expecting to see a girl with a cigarette and a crooked smile step out from the shadows.</p><p>And every time, the yard was empty.</p><p>It stayed that way for eleven months and twenty-three days.</p><p>Then—without warning, without ceremony—she dropped into someone else’s body like slipping into warm water.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>The world around her was dim and golden, lit by low lamps and the shimmer of string lights overhead. Her hands—<em> not </em> her hands—were resting on her knees, fidgeting with the corner of a worn book cover. She could feel the gentle thrum of nervous energy just beneath her skin. </p><p>Finally, her soulmate was awake!</p><p>Wretchedly, she was <em> not </em> alone.</p><p>Another girl sat across from her. Close. Too close. Their knees bumped, and neither moved away. The other girl had sleepy eyes, her dark hair was pulled back loosely, and she was smiling. Laughing, actually. A low, private laugh that made Rio’s stomach twist for reasons she didn’t want to name.</p><p>She couldn’t feel what her soulmate felt. But she could sense it. That fluttery, electric warmth. That thing people meant when they said they liked someone so much it hurt.</p><p>The girl leaned in.</p><p>Rio knew what was coming a second before it happened, and it still knocked the breath out of her.</p><p>Their noses brushed. Her soulmate tilted her chin just slightly. And then they kissed slowly and tentatively, like it was new and unfamiliar. Not fireworks. Not feverish. Just sweet.</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped.</p><p>She wasn’t one of those kinds of people who swore they were saving themselves for their soulmate. But this, seeing <em> her </em> kiss someone else before Rio even knew her name, felt like something sharp and unfair had been lodged just beneath her ribs.</p><p>And maybe it was stupid, maybe it was selfish, but Rio couldn’t help comparing. </p><p>The other girl looked exactly like someone anyone would want to share gentle kisses with. Pretty and polished, probably good at eye contact and remembering birthdays. </p><p>Rio was... not that. She cut her own hair, and blurted out jokes and earnest questions, and knew she was too old to bite her fingernails still, but did it anyway.</p><p>Rio had spent the last year convincing herself the first dream hadn’t mattered.</p><p>She told herself it was a fluke. A glitch in the tether. A one-time flash of someone who would never matter more than the memory of a stranger’s heartbeat in her chest.</p><p>But watching her smile into another girl’s kiss, Rio felt something in her shift. Not snap. Not break. Unraveling like a seam she hadn’t known was holding her together had finally come loose.</p><p>And all she wanted was to reach through the dream and pull that girl away. Not to kiss her. Not even to speak. Just to look her in the eyes and exist in the same moment. To say: I’m here. I’m real. I want to know you.</p><p>Which wasn’t fair. She knew that. There was no claim to stake. No promises to be made or broken. Soulmates didn’t come with guarantees, only possibilities. Only hope.</p><p>And still, it hurt<em>. </em></p><p>It hurt in a way she hadn’t been prepared for. A deep, aching kind that had nothing to do with jealousy and everything to do with being left out. She felt like a ghost in someone else’s story. Like she’d stumbled across a moment she was supposed to be part of, only to find her place already taken.</p><p>And yet… she couldn’t look away.</p><p>She watched her soulmate press her forehead to the other girl’s, eyes fluttering shut like she was memorizing the shape of the world. Watched the other girl smile in that quiet, soft way people did when they felt safe.</p><p>Rio watched it all.</p><p>Because it was the only part of her soulmate she had.</p><p>A flicker of her life. A borrowed heartbeat. A glimpse through someone else’s eyes that both gave her everything and left her starving for more.</p><p>Rio woke with her pillow damp beneath her cheek and her chest hollowed out like someone had scooped a part of her away.</p><p>She lay there, blinking into the dark.</p><hr/><p>The dreams didn’t come often.</p><p>Weeks passed. Months. Sometimes longer. They arrived without rhythm, without warning, like postcards sent from exotic locations that took a few weeks to catch up.</p><p>But each time, Rio held her breath and paid attention.</p><p>There was one where the woman was driving. Rio glanced between the road signs and the speedometer. She was driving faster than she should. A long, empty stretch of highway unfurling endlessly ahead, signs whipping by faster than Rio could make sense of them.</p><p>Her hands gripped the wheel like she was trying not to fall apart. She never spoke out loud to herself, but Rio could hear her sniffle. Could feel the sting behind her eyes.</p><p>She wanted to reach through whatever bound them and say, “Pull over. Just let yourself cry.”</p><p>But the girl just drove until Rio woke up, stifling tears that there was no one around to hear.</p><p>Another time, years later, she was at a party. </p><p>A big, crowded one, loud, laughter bouncing off the walls. People called out when they saw her. <em> “Hey, Aggie!”</em> Like they were happy she’d shown up. Like she mattered to these people. But the woman didn’t smile. Didn’t linger. She moved through them, brushing off greetings with polite nods before finding her way outside.</p><p>She sat alone by the fire for the rest of the night, staring into it. At one point, a pretty girl sat beside her and offered her a drink. She accepted it, murmured thanks, then said nothing else.</p><p>Rio watched from inside her own body, silent and still. </p><p>She tried not to make too many assumptions. That felt unfair. But it was impossible not to wonder.</p><p>About the girl who kissed someone like it was the first safe place she’d ever known—then didn’t kiss anyone at all, at least not in front of Rio, for years.</p><p>About the silence. The stillness. The way she seemed to carry herself with both pride and secret shame.</p><p>Rio didn’t know her name. But she knew her rhythms. The way she touched her fingers to her lips when she was thinking. The way her shoulders tightened just before she turned away. The way she always seemed to be playing with her hair, and never seemed to have cut it.</p><p>And maybe it was projection, maybe it was wishful thinking, but Rio couldn’t help feeling like the woman lived in a very quiet kind of loneliness. A self-imposed solitude, like she didn’t trust the world to be gentle with her, so she kept herself just out of reach.</p><p>Rio didn’t pity her. That wasn’t the right word.</p><p>Her heart ached for her.</p><p>It was like the press of a thumb into a fresh bruise, the hurt a person felt when they noticed a stranger on a bench who looked like they were trying not to cry. Or the way peole did when they recognized something of themselves in someone else’s sadness.</p><p>She tried to imagine what her soulmate might think if she ever fell asleep and saw through Rio’s eyes. If she ever woke in Rio’s skin and saw the clumsy life she’d built. </p><p>Had she seen the way Rio watched the lights dance off Lilia’s suncatchers as she scribbled biochem notes? Had she been caught singing to her succulents when she thought no one could possibly be around? She desperately hoped her soulmate hadn’t seen her extensive Kermit figurine collection.</p><p>Would her soulmate laugh? If she did, would it be mean or fond? Would she be disappointed if she saw Rio in a reflection in the mirror?</p><p>Would the girl, who had been called Aggie but hadn’t seemed to like it very much, be as interested in knowing Rio?</p><p>Rio didn’t have the answer. </p><p>But every time the dreams faded and the silence returned, she whispered the same thing into the dark, just in case her soulmate could somehow hear:</p><p>"You don’t have to be alone."</p><p>But Agatha Harkness had never known anything else.</p><p>Even as a child, loneliness had curled around her like ivy—quiet, clinging, inescapable. It lived in the corners of the house, in the too-quiet dinners and the locked doors and the long silences that filled the rooms of their stately home that had been built for hosting and holding lots of people and laughter.</p><p>She had never dreamed of anyone else’s life.</p><p>Not once.</p><p>And she had stopped dreaming of her own a long time ago.</p><p>Of course, she’d heard about soulmate dreams. Everyone had. It was one of those things you learned about as soon as you could form questions about love. One half asleep, the other awake. A sacred tether. Proof of something meant to be.</p><p>But Agatha knew better.</p><p>She was thirteen the first time she asked her mother about them. There had been a girl at school—Lena something—who’d claimed to see glimpses of a boy in a bookstore, flipping pages in a foreign language she didn’t speak. Everyone had crowded around her at lunch like she was a prophet delivering a holy vision.</p><p>The next morning, she tried to bring it up over tea.</p><p>Evanora didn't look up from her paper. "What are you on about now?"</p><p>“Soulmate dreams,” Agatha said, trying to sound breezy. “I heard that sometimes they happen early. Sometimes even at thirteen.”</p><p>At that, her mother did look up slowly like a cat clocking vermin that had made its way into the house. Her lips twisted into a smirk that never reached her eyes.</p><p>“Oh, darling,” she said. “No one’s cursed you with that kind of luck, I’m afraid.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “But why not?”</p><p>Evanora leaned back in her chair. “Because it’s not real. It’s sentimental nonsense for weak minds who can’t make decisions for themselves. You know what dreams like that do? They make people soft. Desperate. And you—”</p><p>She reached over, brushing a lock of hair behind Agatha’s ear in a show of control, not care.</p><p>“You are not the kind of girl people dream about.”</p><p>Agatha flushed hot and angry. Her tea sloshed in her cup as she set it down harder than she meant to. “My soulmate will love me. That’s what soulmates do<em>. </em>”</p><p>Evanora laughed. Not politely. Not kindly. A sharp, brittle sound, like glass cracking under pressure.</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart,” she said. “You don’t have a soulmate. You’re impossible to love. Be grateful for that. Love only weakens a woman.”</p><p>Agatha remembered every word.</p><p>And in the decade since, she’d made it a point to believe them.</p><p>She grew into the kind of woman who didn't need softness. Who didn’t wait at windows or press her hands to glass. Who learned to quiet the want inside her until it was barely audible.</p><p>Soulmates were fairy tales. Meant for warmer girls with easier hearts.</p><p>She had no illusions about herself.</p><p>She was built of sharp edges and full of biting teeth and tongue.</p><p>And so, when the tether finally snapped into place, it didn’t feel like magic.</p><p>It felt like a cruel joke.</p><p>She wasn’t <em> herself. </em></p><p>The air reeked of antiseptic and iron. Harsh light blasted down from overhead. Agatha blinked as her eyes adjusted and nearly choked on a scream.</p><p>She was looking at a body.</p><p>No, a torso. Open. The skin had been sliced apart with clinical precision and peeled back like some grotesque page in a textbook. </p><p>She was looking inside a body. At glistening muscle, at crimson-streaked gauze, at something sharp and unnatural embedded just beneath a rib.</p><p>She couldn’t breathe.</p><p>But she couldn’t look away.</p><p>“Is this who I’m tethered to?” she thought, dizzy. “Some kind of killer? A butcher? A monster—”</p><p>“Scalpel.”</p><p>The voice was calm. Steady. It cut cleanly through the noise, not harsh but with authority enough to part the chaos.</p><p>And suddenly Agatha realized: this wasn’t a killing.</p><p>It was a rescue.</p><p>She was in an operating room.</p><p>And her soulmate was elbows deep in some unfortunate person performing emergency surgery.</p><p>A heartbeat pounded in her ears, and she couldn’t tell who it belonged to, but the hands moving in front of her weren’t shaking. They were careful. Precise. Gloved fingers worked gently, peeling back layers and extracting something metallic and jagged. Shrapnel.</p><p>“Got it,” the voice said. “Last piece is out. Let’s close.”</p><p>There was no celebration. No fanfare. Just the rhythm of a job well done. Tools being passed. Orders given. The unshakable calm of someone who’d done this a hundred times before and still treated it like it mattered every single time.</p><p>And then, finally, Agatha received her mercy.</p><p>The hands retreated. The gloves came off.</p><p>The room blurred. Shifted.</p><p>Agatha found herself walking into a cramped staff bathroom, fluorescent lights humming above. Her soulmate braced her palms on either side of the sink, leaned forward, and breathed. </p><p>Not dramatically. Not shakily. Just a long, quiet breath. The kind that emptied you out completely so you could take a new one in and keep going.</p><p>She turned on the faucet, washed her hands slowly, methodically. Scrubbed under her nails. Rinsed. Dried. Then splashed cold water on her face and stayed there, dripping and still.</p><p>Agatha felt everything in her still with her.</p><p>Then she looked up.</p><p>Into the mirror.</p><p>And Agatha saw her soulmate’s face for the first time.</p><p>She was about Agatha’s age, maybe a year or two younger, though it was hard to tell with the way exhaustion softened her features and cast deep shadows under her eyes. </p><p>Her dark hair was pulled into a messy bun, strands plastered to her forehead in damp, curling wisps from sweat or water or both. A smudge of something dark, maybe mascara, maybe hours of fatigue, clung just beneath one eye, like she’d rubbed at it without thinking.</p><p>There was a faint crease between her brows, not from worry but from relentless focus. It was as if her face had molded itself around years spent looking closely at things most people looked away from.</p><p>Her lips were chapped, cracked at the center. Her skin wasn’t flawless. Her ears were slightly uneven.</p><p>She was pretty.</p><p>Agatha’s first instinct was to look away.</p><p>But she couldn’t. Not yet.</p><p>The woman leaned closer to the mirror, exhaled slowly, and brushed her knuckles against her brow. Her jaw shifted. A muscle in her cheek twitched as she pressed her tongue against the inside of it.</p><p>And then, without warning, she smiled. Just barely. A twitch at the corner of her mouth, the faintest upward curve that exposed the tiniest gap between her teeth.</p><p>Then the bathroom door slammed open, and Agatha woke with a start.</p><p>She tried to forget.</p><p>After that first dream, Agatha did what she had always been trained to do: she compartmentalized.</p><p>She told herself it wasn’t real. A fluke. The mind playing tricks in the dark. An echo of someone else’s life, misfired across the cosmic void. A slip of fate.</p><p>But the dreams didn’t stop.</p><p>They began to come frequently. Too frequently. Always vivid. Always bloody.</p><p>In one, she found herself hunched over a table beneath surgical lights, her soulmate elbow-deep in someone’s abdomen, calmly suctioning blood as another surgeon handed her a clamp. </p><p>The suction made a grotesque sound, wet and gurgling, as the woman navigated between organs like it was just another Tuesday.</p><p>In another, the woman was soaked in sweat and scrubs, her hands flying with a kind of furious grace as she barked instructions over the screech of a heart monitor. </p><p>“BP’s dropping,” someone called. Agatha’s heart pounded so hard she thought it might break through her ribs. “We’re losing them.”</p><p>“No we’re not.” Her soulmate had said, the calmest voice in the room.</p><p>And they hadn’t. Agatha rested better that night as in her dream she followed the woman from the operating room to a fight with the vending machine. </p><p>She smacked at the glass two times when the coil snagged the bag of Sour Patch Kids and refused to let it drop. Her soulmate eventually gave it up when she was paged to another room.</p><p>Agatha idly wished she could loan her another dollar. Or shatter the glass entirely.</p><p>It was, surprisingly, the most peace she'd felt in days.</p><p>The peace didn’t last, her dreams made sure of it.</p><p>They were relentless and invasive. No warning. No logic. One night nothing, the next a waking nightmare. They hadn’t eased in gently like they were supposed to. There had been no tentative first glimpses. No charming mundanity. Just blood.</p><p>Agatha suspected the frequency had something to do with her soulmate working the late shift. Always lit by fluorescent glare. Always speaking in clipped urgency. Always surrounded by the smell of bleach and the sound of too many monitors.</p><p>She had once imagined soulmate dreams would be if not romantic, then at least something soft. But hers played out like gruesome horror reels.</p><p>It felt cruel. Cosmically ironic.</p><p>What was supposed to be a fantasy tether, a secret window into some half-miraculous promise of belonging, was instead a gallery of the most brutal hours of someone else's life.</p><p>Growing up, her mother had made it clear there were only two respectable paths for a girl with ambition. Doctor or lawyer.</p><p>And because blood had always made her lightheaded, Agatha had chosen law. She didn’t treat wounds.</p><p>She made them.</p><p>Now, she found herself bound to someone who wrestled with death daily.</p><p>And brought Agatha along for the ride.</p><p>She was in a trauma bay. A patient was coding. Their chest was bare, pale, still.</p><p>“Come on,” Her soulmate muttered, sweat dripping down her brow. “Come on, come on, come <em> on </em>—”</p><p>“Dr. Vidal. We need to call it.”</p><p>A name. Finally. Something to call this impossible force of a woman.</p><p>“Charge to two hundred—again!”</p><p>“Rio,” said a calm, older woman from the edge of the room. She stepped forward. Placed a hand gently on her shoulder.</p><p>“You’ve done everything. We need to let them go.”</p><p>Agatha could feel it—the fight in her. The way her hands trembled with the effort of letting go. She stood frozen in the dream, helpless to do anything but <em> watch </em>, feeling every second of it in her bones.</p><p>When Agatha finally woke, her pillow was damp again.</p><p>At first, she tried to rationalize it. Maybe she was dreaming someone else's dream. Maybe this woman was meant for someone kinder, someone more whole. Someone who wouldn’t flinch at the sight of an open body. Someone who didn’t wake up gasping like she was the one who’d lost a patient.</p><p>Agatha didn’t <em> do </em> blood.</p><p>She didn’t do people.</p><p>She didn’t do... <em> connection. </em></p><p>And yet, despite herself, she began to keep track of the dreams.</p><p>She learned her name: Dr. Rio Vidal.</p><p>She learned the way she held a scalpel, pinched between her fingers like a violin bow. The way she cracked dry jokes to keep spirits up, even when her own voice was tight. The way she splashed water on her face like it was a cleansing ritual, a baptism between tragedies.</p><p>And still, Agatha found herself clinging to the memory of that first mirror.</p><p>The way Rio had looked at herself and smiled, just barely, like she was still standing in spite of everything.</p><p>Agatha told herself it didn’t matter.</p><p>She told herself it didn’t <em> mean </em> anything.</p><p>But sometimes, in the quiet hours between one dream and the next, she’d catch herself sketching a face in the margins of her case notes. </p><p>And sometimes, just before falling asleep, Agatha would wonder what it would be like to see those steady hands holding her heart in them.</p><hr/><p>Rio had four glorious days off in a row.</p><p>Four.</p><p>No beeping monitors. No 3 a.m. traumas. No living off of stale cafeteria coffee. Just four uninterrupted days to do something radical like sleep. Or see the sun.</p><p>Day one, she grocery shopped at noon like a functioning adult. Bought produce she actually intended to eat. She smiled at a baby in the cereal aisle. Wore jeans instead of scrubs.</p><p>Day two, she went to the farmer’s market and read half a paperback in a park.</p><p>On the third day, she stayed in bed until ten, then went for a walk without her pager. She made dinner full of ingredients that couldn’t be scavenged from a vending machine.</p><p>But that night, her vacation was rudely interrupted.</p><p>Because of course, now that her schedule had shifted, she was the one asleep while her soulmate who apparently lived a vampire-adjacent life, was very much awake.</p><p>And currently hooking up with someone who looked like she’d been drawn to life from the textbook definition of temptation itself.</p><p>They were in the bedroom of some sleek, modern apartment with too many mirrors, and the woman pressed against under soulmate was stunning. Lean and delicate with red hair and keen hazel eyes. Flawless skin. The kind of gorgeous that made other people momentarily forget their names. </p><p>The kind that made Rio very aware she had gone to bed wearing flannel pajama pants with cartoon characters on them.</p><p>This woman leaned up onto her elbows and pressed kisses down her soulmate’s neck with the kind of intensity that suggested they knew what they were doing. Her soulmate tilted her head just slightly and let out a soft sound.</p><p>Even as Rio tried to tune it out, she couldn’t help but notice things.</p><p>Like how the room smelled like wine and sex.</p><p>Her soulmate’s laugh, low and hoarse from recent use, made something twist uncomfortably in Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Don’t rush me, Wanda. You know I don’t like that.”</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>Rio had never heard a name she immediately hated more.</p><p>She didn’t even know why. Wanda was beautiful. Coordinated. Presumably good at... whatever it was she was currently doing to make Rio’s soulmate sigh like that. And yet the name hit Rio’s ears like a sour note.</p><p>Her soulmate, whose name Rio still didn’t know, was currently arching into Wanda’s touch with an increasing urgency that made Rio's stomach churn.</p><p>It felt invasive. Intimate in a way Rio hadn’t signed up for. She didn’t want to watch. Not this.</p><p>There was something about the way her soulmate moved unhurried and deliberate, like she was used to being the one in control.</p><p>Rio catalogued every detail, like it might be useful later. The small scar on her forearm. The places where she chose to let her lips linger on Wanda’s body. The way she said <em> don’t rush me </em> like it was a boundary, not a flirtatious challenge.</p><p>Rio hated that she noticed. Hated that she cared.</p><p>But more than anything, she hated the feeling growing in her chest. That sharp, bitter thing that had no name and too many teeth threatening to tear out some pivotal artery.</p><p>She was jealous.</p><p>Not just of Wanda but of everything. Of the way her soulmate touched and was touched. Of the ease with which she brought this woman close.</p><p>Her soulmate was rough, until she wasn’t. And when they were done, she pulled Wanda to her chest and whispered soft things against the back of her ear.</p><p>Rio didn’t want to admit that she strained to hear what they were.</p><p>And then, like some final cosmic insult, Wanda fell asleep first.</p><p>Just curled right in like a smug cat, her perfectly manicured hand still sprawled across the woman’s stomach, dead to the world in under five minutes.</p><p>Rio stared, jaw tightening.</p><p>Seriously? After all that? Not even a hand? Not even an offer? Her soulmate lay there, eyes open, blinking slowly at the ceiling.</p><p>She didn’t move.</p><p>She didn’t reach for Wanda.</p><p>And she sure as hell didn’t seem satisfied.</p><p>Her soulmate deserved better. Not just in the cosmic sense. In the basic decency sense. If she was going to be out here getting thoroughly ravished on Rio’s very limited time off, the least she could do was—</p><p>“I wouldn’t have left you like that,” Rio thought bitterly, wishing the woman could hear her. Even though she had no idea who Rio was. Even though, apparently, she didn’t care to find out.</p><p>That part stung more than it should’ve.</p><p>Because as much as Rio didn’t want to admit it, she’d started to hope. After all these years, after the silence, after dream after dream of watching this woman live a life Rio couldn’t reach, she’d started to believe that maybe they’d find each other.</p><p>But this woman, this soul-bound mystery who murmured sweetness into the necks of other women, didn’t seem to be looking for Rio at all.</p><p>And Rio had nothing to go on.</p><p>No city. No job title. Not even a last name. Just a handful of fragmented glimpses—a fancy apartment, a habit of sneaking cigarettes, and a nickname she hadn’t heard since that one house party years ago.</p><p>It wasn’t enough.</p><p>Finally, Agatha fell asleep, and the connection was severed.</p><p>When Rio woke up, she tried not to picture the way Aggie’s lips had pressed into Wanda’s shoulder.</p><p>Tried not to imagine what it might feel like if that same mouth whispered against <em> her </em> skin instead.</p><p>It was pathetic.</p><p>Rio knew that. But in a few hours, she’d be back on schedule. She’d trudge into work. And she would do her best not to think of that woman, and how much better she deserved, at all.</p><hr/><p>Agatha was proud of herself.</p><p>Which wasn’t a familiar feeling, but she felt it all the same.</p><p>She'd started with what little she knew. Dr. Vidal, trauma surgeon, good with her hands, bad at giving up. Someone had called her Rio once.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, she had a complete profile. Dr. Rio Vidal of Boston General. A transfer student to Duke after two years at some no name community college, who went on to graduate top of her class in undergrad and medical school. She’d completed a surgical residency in New York. Recently promoted to trauma lead. There was a glowing, nauseating recommendation from some board member about her “composure under pressure” and “compassionate precision.”</p><p>Some would say it was incredibly lucky that her soulmate lived in the same city. Practically unheard of. A meet-cute waiting to happen.</p><p>If she had anyone to tell, she was sure they’d make quippy little comments like, “Fate’s got your back!” or “At least you don’t have to cross an ocean to find her!”</p><p>Agatha thought it was luck too, but not for the same reason.</p><p>She wasn’t interested in fate. Or romance.</p><p>No, Agatha was on a mission. She wanted the dreams to stop<em>. </em>She wanted her nights back.</p><p>She wanted to sleep without seeing inside the human body. Without the smell of cauterized flesh or the screech of heart monitors or the sight of that steady, steady hand pressing against a still chest like if she just believed hard enough, she could bring someone back.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t asked for any of this.</p><p>She wasn’t going to run down a hospital corridor and collapse into Rio’s arms with some breathless, “It’s you.”</p><p>God, no. She’d rather die. Again, preferably not while dreaming through an active chest tube insertion.</p><p>She just wanted to look this woman in the eyes and say, calmly, politely, and with the full force of her most withering tone:</p><p>"Hi, I believe you're interfering with my circadian rhythm. Kindly knock it the fuck off."</p><p>There may be a tether. Maybe the universe had indeed looped them together like some tragic red thread.</p><p>But hospitals were full of scissors and scalpels, any number of sharp implements to cut clean through it.</p><p>Agatha swept through the front entrance in black sunglasses, a perfectly tailored coat, and an expression that dared the universe to try her.</p><p>The woman at the front desk didn’t so much as blink.</p><p>“Can I help you?” she asked, with the voice of someone who had said that phrase exactly 112 times that day.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said crisply, pulling off her sunglasses. “I’m here to speak with Dr. Vidal.”</p><p>Jen, according to the tasteful little silver name tag pinned to her scrub-green blouse, gave her a tight smile. “Do you have an appointment?”</p><p>“No, but I’m sure she’ll want to see me,” Agatha said, leaning forward just slightly, voice slipping into velvet. “It’s life or death, I’m afraid.”</p><p>Jen’s expression didn’t change.</p><p>“Dr. Vidal’s in trauma. If you’re not a current patient, you need to make an appointment like everyone else. Or try calling her office.”</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly. “Jen, was it?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Jen. I respect your whole no-nonsense gatekeeper vibe. Really, I do. But I’m afraid this is time-sensitive.”</p><p>“And I’m afraid the answer is still no.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “You’re very good at this.”</p><p>Jen nodded. “I know.”</p><p>Agatha let out a dramatic sigh and turned like she was about to leave. She took one step away from the desk, then paused, glancing down at the edge of the lobby rug, which had curled ever so slightly.</p><p>Opportunity.</p><p>She caught her foot under the edge, twisted her body, and went down in a full pratfall.</p><p>One heel flew off. Her coat flared. Her bag went skittering across the tile, contents spewing out in ricochet.</p><p>“Oh <em> fuck! </em> ” she cried, voice echoing in the airy space. “My ankle! Oh my <em> god </em>, what is wrong with this floor? Is this what passes for safety in a hospital?”</p><p>People turned.</p><p>Somewhere, a nurse cursed.</p><p>Jen stood abruptly.</p><p>Agatha, still sprawled artfully on the floor, cradled her ankle and blinked through her best impression of pain-induced tears. “I—I think I heard something snap<em>. </em> This is blatant negligence. I hope your legal team is in house.”</p><p>Jen was already circling the desk, jaw tight. “Okay. Ma’am.”</p><p>“I’m not a ma’am, I’m a victim!”</p><p>Jen crouched down beside her, clearly fighting every urge in her body. “You’re not bleeding. Can you move it?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha lied, curling her lip like she was offended by the very question. “And I really think I need a doctor<em>. </em> One who works in trauma. Ideally someone with a calm voice and very steady hands.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes narrowed. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>Agatha winked. “Yes. Now get me Dr. Vidal.”</p><hr/><p>The moment Rio stepped into the examination room, she knew something was off.</p><p>Not wrong. Just… <em> off. </em></p><p>Her patient was seated primly on the edge of the hospital bed, one leg crossed over the other, perfectly balanced like this was a high-end waiting room and not the fluorescent-lit purgatory of Exam Room 3. </p><p>Her coat was draped over the chair like an afterthought, and the standard-issue hospital gown lay untouched on the side table, still neatly folded.</p><p>She looked up as Rio entered, and her smile was small and sharp and thoroughly unrepentant.</p><p>Rio glanced down at the chart.</p><p>Harkness, Agatha. Presented with a claimed ankle injury after a reported fall in the lobby. Witness note attached from front desk staff: “She tripped over a rug. Dramatically.”</p><p>Rio sighed and set the clipboard aside. “Ms. Harkness,” she said. “Have you had an X-ray done yet?”</p><p>The woman’s smile widened, teeth strikingly white. “I asked the boy who wheeled in the machine to go find a real doctor. I assumed they hadn’t started hiring teenagers for trauma.”</p><p>Rio pinched the bridge of her nose. “That boy’s twenty-four and very much in med school.”</p><p>She pulled up the rolling stool and moved to the bedside. Difficult patients weren’t new. But this one had a unique energy.<em> </em>The kind that usually meant trouble.</p><p>There was something familiar about her, too. But Rio certainly would have remembered her if they’d met. She’d probably have offered to buy her drink, or dinner, or anything that would keep those striking eyes trained on her.</p><p>“Let me see the ankle,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha obliged, swinging her leg off the edge of the bed and placing her heeled foot directly in Rio’s lap.</p><p>The heel pressed into her thigh, precise and intentional.</p><p>“Do be gentle,” Agatha said. “I’m terribly fragile.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond. She slid her fingers along the ankle, palpated the joint, and checked for swelling.</p><p>There was nothing there, not even any redness.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness,” she said, voice tight. “This ankle is fine.”</p><p>Agatha blinked innocently. “You’re certain? I was told I went down very hard.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure you did,” Rio muttered. “And you’ve wasted a trauma slot.”</p><p>“Better safe than sorry,” Agatha said, as if that explained anything. “You never know when a dramatic fall might be the opening act to something….”</p><p>Rio looked up, meeting her eyes fully for the first time.</p><p>And paused.</p><p>There was something there. A flicker. A jolt that ran down the back of her neck like memory or déjà vu.</p><p>“…Have we met?” she asked slowly.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Not exactly.”</p><p>The heel pressed just a little harder into Rio’s thigh.</p><p>Rio exhaled.</p><p>“So what’s the real reason you’re here, Ms. Harkness?”</p><p>She set Agatha’s foot gently back on the floor, ignoring the smug way the woman’s gaze followed her hands.</p><p>“People don’t fake injuries to get into trauma unless they’re hiding something. An infection, an STI, something they’re too embarrassed to say aloud.”</p><p>She leaned back slightly, folding her arms. “Look, I’m a doctor. I’ve seen it all. If you’re here because you sat on something you shouldn’t have, I promise. I’m not here to judge.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long, loaded moment. Then laughed<em>. </em></p><p>It was low and warm and absolutely delightful. The kind of laugh that slinked up Rio’s spine and settled somewhere deeply inconvenient and entirely inappropriate.</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart,” Agatha said, voice silky. “What kind of girl do you think I am? I know better than to play with anything that doesn’t have a flared base.”</p><p>Rio choked, and a very definite flush crept up the back of her neck, blooming pink beneath the collar of her scrubs.</p><p>“I—That’s not what I—”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, clearly enjoying herself. “You were saying something about professionalism, Dr. Vidal?”</p><p>That made Rio pause.</p><p>She looked at Agatha again.</p><p>That voice, the teasing and condescending tone<em>. </em>She’d heard it before like something out of a dream.</p><p>“You…” she started, slowly. “You’re her.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Took you long enough.”</p><p>“You’re my—”</p><p>“Dream girl?” Agatha supplied helpfully, then shrugged. “Technically, you’re the one doing most of the dreaming. I’m just the unwilling voyeur in a nightly bloodbath.”</p><p>Rio stared.</p><p>And tried—<em> really tried </em>—not to think about all the things she’d seen.</p><p>Because now she was looking at <em> her. </em> Not some blurred figure in a dim-lit dream, not a mystery seen through borrowed eyes, but Agatha Harkness <em> , </em> in the flesh. </p><p>Rio’s ears grew hotter.</p><p>Because yes, Agatha had been thrust into dreams of blood and bone and every horrible thing that could happen to a body. But Rio’s dreams of her had been much more personal and private. She’d seen things she wasn’t supposed to. Limbs tangled in silk sheets. The flex of her muscles as she pulled some beautiful stranger into her lap. The sound she made when someone kissed just below her ear.</p><p>She cleared her throat.</p><p>Agatha watched her with amusement so bright it might as well have been a spotlight on Rio’s discomfort and gestured vaguely around the exam room.</p><p> “Anyway. I figured if I had to keep watching you root around inside chest cavities like you’re playing the world’s worst claw machine, we should at least meet.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat again, like that might somehow reset the atmosphere, like the heat creeping up her neck wasn’t a full-body confession.</p><p>“This is totally inappropriate conduct to have with a patient,” she said, stiffly.</p><p>Agatha’s brows arched, intrigued. “We haven’t done anything inappropriate.”</p><p>She tilted her head, gaze sharpening with curiosity, her voice dipping into something silkier. “Unless you’ve thought something inappropriate, Dr.Vidal.”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw tightly. When she opened her mouth again her voice betrayed her, making a small strangled noise that could have been a protest or a prayer.</p><p>Agatha smiled, slow and deliberate. Then, without breaking eye contact, she lifted her leg and placed her heel gently on the edge of Rio’s stool again, right between the space where Rio’s legs were spread. She gave it a small, purposeful tug.</p><p>The stool rolled an inch closer.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, not enough to touch, just enough to <em> loom </em>, and asked softly, like a dare, “What do you see when you dream of me?”</p><p>Rio stared at her.</p><p>At the woman she’d watched through borrowed eyes for nearly a decade. What did she see?</p><p>She saw Agatha drunk on red wine and sadness, muttering into a dark kitchen.</p><p>Agatha kneeling by a firepit, too proud to cry in front of other people but unable to look away from the flames.</p><p>She had seen glimpses of her, beautiful and utterly undone by someone else’s hands.</p><p>Rio saw her alone.</p><p>Again and again. Unreachable. Untethered.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard.</p><p>“I see someone who thinks she’s hard to love,” she said quietly.</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>That knocked the smirk right off her face.</p><p>Just for a second.</p><p>Then she withdrew her foot. Slowly. Smoothly. Like nothing had happened.</p><p>“Well,” she said, folding her hands in her lap, “aren’t you just full of surprises?”</p><p>“So are you,” Rio replied.</p><p>They stared at each other for a long moment.</p><p>Then the intercom crackled to life. “Dr. Vidal to Trauma One. Repeat—Dr. Vidal to Trauma One.”</p><p>Rio was thankful for instinct and muscle memory; they were the only things that could have spurred her from this spot.</p><p>“I have to go.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, perfectly composed again. “Of course you do.”</p><p>Rio turned to go, already halfway out the door, when Agatha’s voice stopped her.</p><p>“Doctor.”</p><p>She paused, hand on the frame.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, that earlier sinful smirk just barely curling back to life. “Thank you for seeing me.”</p><p>There was a loaded pause as she wet her lips.</p><p>Then, with a voice like velvet over steel, she added, “Next time, maybe I’ll tell you about what I see<em>. </em> Not when I dream and see through your eyes.” Agatha smiled and trailed her eyes up and down Rio. “What I see when I dream <em> about </em> you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond.</p><p>Couldn’t.</p><p>She just stood there for a beat too long, every neuron in her brain short-circuiting as her body begged her to stay and her pager insisted she run.</p><p>So she ran.</p><p>But Agatha was not someone who could easily be outrun.</p><p>Rio made it through her trauma call on sheer instinct, her focus was fractured, full of static.</p><p>She kept seeing her.</p><p>It was close to one a.m. by the time Rio collapsed onto her bed, half-dressed, too tired to do anything but toe off her shoes and throw one arm over her face.</p><p>She was too tired to fight the dream when it came.</p><p>It started with warmth. Dim light spilling like honey across smooth floors.</p><p>Agatha was sitting at the edge of her bed, wrapped by soft shadows. She wore nothing but a silk robe, loose and slouching, slipping low off one shoulder. Her legs were crossed at the knee.</p><p>And directly in front of her stood a tall mirror.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t looking at herself. She was looking <em> through </em> the reflection.</p><p>Straight at Rio.</p><p>“Are you watching me?” she asked, her voice low and breathy, just the barest hint of rasp curling at the edges. “I hope you are. I’ve been waiting for you.”</p><p>She let the robe slip the rest of the way down, baring her body with the casual confidence of someone who had long drawn pleasure from being desired. Her hands wandered slowly over her ribs, up her thighs, like she was learning herself again for the first time and wanted Rio to witness every moment of it.</p><p>It wasn’t just what she was doing.</p><p>It was how she held eye contact with herself and Rio by proxy.</p><p>Like she wanted Rio to feel every second of it and knew she would.</p><p>“I’ve thought about this,” she murmured. “What it must feel like… knowing I can’t see you. But you can see me. All of me. And you <em> do </em>, don’t you? You watch.”</p><p>Her voice was a slow pour of heat, spilling into Rio’s chest as Agatha spread her legs wider.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, fingers curling as they trailed low. “I think even if you were here, I’d just make you watch. I think you’d like that.”</p><p>The sound she made next undid something profound in Rio’s spine.</p><p>And when it crested, when Agatha fell back against the sheets with a cry, it wasn’t vague. It wasn’t anonymous.</p><p>It was her name.</p><p>"Rio."</p><p>Cried out in a desperate gasp as her hips jolted and her body bent.</p><p>Then silence. Just the rise and fall of breath. A sated, impossible calm.</p><p>Agatha turned her head lazily toward the mirror, lips parted in complete satisfaction. She raised her hand and drew it to her lips, and Rio desperately wished the tongue that darted out to taste them had been hers.</p><p>“Sweet dreams, handsome,” Agatha whispered, catching her tongue between her teeth as she grinned. “Hope you don’t lose too much sleep over me.”</p><hr/><p>Rio wasn’t sure what she expected when she rounded the block and slipped into the alley behind the office building, but she knew she was right when she saw the side door.</p><p>Old, painted over too many times, no security camera. A smoker’s door, if ever she’d seen one.</p><p>She leaned against the brick, one foot propped behind her, and waited. The air was cold enough to sting, but Rio was used to discomfort. She’d lived in it, worked in it, stitched people shut under worse conditions than this.</p><p>Besides, the thought of catching Agatha off guard was more than enough to keep her warm.</p><p>Sure enough, five minutes later, the door creaked open.</p><p>Agatha Harkness stepped outside like she had somewhere far more important to be, digging one-handed into the deep pocket of a perfectly tailored wool overcoat.</p><p>And then she looked up, saw Rio and the extended fresh pack of Malboros and stopped dead in her tracks.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re a doctor that smokes.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “No, but you do.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her lips twitching like she couldn’t decide if she wanted to smile or sigh. “I don’t.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow. “I’ve seen you, Agatha. You’ve been smoking for at least twelve years.”</p><p>Agatha snatched a cigarette from the pack and held Rio’s gaze as she slipped it between her lips. “I only allow myself one on Wednesdays.”</p><p>Rio’s grin curved slightly wider. “That’s funny because last I checked, it’s Monday.”</p><p>“Tattletale.”</p><p>They stood there for a moment, quiet except for the low hum of traffic in the distance and the flick of Agatha’s lighter.</p><p>She blew the smoke up and away, then turned slightly, eyes gleaming as she asked, “So, what’s up Doc? Had any good dreams lately?”</p><p>She flicked ash to the side, cool as ever, but Rio could see the slight tension in her hand. The way her eyes kept flicking back to her. Like she wasn’t sure what Rio might say next and didn’t know whether she wanted to brace for it or lean into it.</p><p>Rio took a step closer.</p><p>Just one.</p><p>But it was enough to make Agatha still.</p><p>“I came to return the favor,” Rio said quietly. “You showed up in my world. Figured it was time I did the same.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, intrigued. “How come?”</p><p>“Because you’re making it impossible to sleep.”</p><p>“Please. You’re not the one stuck starring in an IMAX medical drama every night.” She blew out a slow stream of smoke. “It’s impossible to get any decent rest when I’m watching you dig around inside someone’s spleen like you’re playing Operation on nightmare mode.”</p><p>Rio huffed a breath through her nose. “Yeah, well, it’s better than being teased all night or watching my soulmate hook up with a rotating cast of lingerie models.”</p><p>She immediately regretted it.</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted, the pleasure blooming on her face wicked and unmistakable. “Oh?”</p><p>Rio groaned. “That’s not… I didn’t mean…”</p><p>“You <em> watch </em> me?” Agatha asked, voice honey-slick. “Perv.”</p><p>Rio gave her a flat look. “I’m literally not able to look away. Trust me, I feel… really conflicted about it.”</p><p>“Mmm.” Agatha tapped the ash again, eyes dancing. “And what exactly do you think about when you see me with someone else?”</p><p>“I think you could do better,” Rio muttered before she could stop herself.</p><p>Agatha blinked once, slowly.</p><p>And then she smiled thoughtfully, something soft unfurling beneath the wicked curve of her mouth.</p><p>Rio cursed under her breath and dragged a hand down her face. “God, would you just quit driving me insane and ask me out like a normal person?”</p><p>Agatha blinked again.</p><p>Then took one last drag from her cigarette before stubbing it out against the brick wall behind her.</p><p>She stepped in close enough that Rio could smell the hint of something sweet underneath the smoke on her breath. Close enough that her voice didn’t need to rise above a whisper when she said,</p><p>“Change your shift.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“Let me stop seeing bodies every night,” Agatha murmured, voice low and sure. “Let me stop dreaming about death. I want to see you somewhere else.”</p><p>There was a pause. Barely a breath between them.</p><p>“And then, if it turns out your life isn’t a total bore,” Agatha added, a smirk tugging at her mouth again, “I’ll ask you out.”</p><p>Rio stared at her.</p><p>Then, finally, she said, “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>“Did you expect anything less? I am your dream girl, aren’t I?”</p><p>Rio stared at her, barely resisting the urge to laugh or scream.</p><p>This woman was unreal<em>. </em></p><p>And Rio was going to have to beg, barter, and probably pick up an ungodly number of weekends just to change her shift.</p><p>All because Agatha Harkness—smirking, impossible, infuriatingly beautiful—had asked her to.</p><p>No. Had dared her to.</p><p>Agatha took a step back, chin tilted like she already knew she’d won.</p><p>Rio exhaled a slow breath and let herself really look at her. The arched brow. The wind-tousled hair.</p><p>“I’ll change the shift,” she said simply.</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>Rio turned and walked away before she could talk herself out of it, her heart beating a little too fast.</p><p>But as she reached the corner and looked back, Agatha was still there.</p><p>In that moment, Rio reconciled the Agatha of her dreams with the one she saw now.</p><p>The one who was real. Watching her like she was someone worth seeing.</p><p>She raised her hand in a little wave, and Agatha returned it.</p><p>And Rio continued her day, boosted by a joyful certainty. She'd see her again soon.</p>
