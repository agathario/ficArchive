      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha Harkness had always been a woman of precision. She built her life on neatly constructed foundations: lectures prepared weeks in advance, research that left no room for uncertainty, and a quiet home where she and her eight-year-old son, Nicky, lived in their own steady rhythm.<br />But all it took was a single second—one lapse in control—for everything to shatter.</p><p>OR:</p><p>Agatha is a Neurology professor at Northwestern. Rio is a paramedic. Rio saves Agatha’s life. Rio also happens to be starting her second year of med school.</p><p>Agatha can’t stop thinking about the paramedic. Agatha is fucked.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“Mama, we’re going to be late!”</p><p>Nicky’s voice sounded through the house as Agatha put the finishing touches on her light makeup. She had promised him they would spend the day at the Lakefront to celebrate his last weekend of summer break. Nicky had woken up at the crack of dawn, his excitement making his little body vibrate with energy.</p><p>Agatha still took her time in finishing her makeup, and then took an appraising look at her reflection in the mirror. Her long brown hair was down, and she wondered if it was time for a haircut as it almost reached the small of her back. She wore a light blue button down that brought out her blue eyes even more and tucked it into her denim shorts, just as Nicky showed up at her door.</p><p>“Moooom,” he whined, and she rolled her eyes with an amused smile. “Come on!”</p><p>“You know, the lake is not going anywhere, mister,” She looked at him through the mirror as he approached her from behind and wrapped his little arms around her waist.</p><p>“But the longer we take to get there, the less time we’re going to have to enjoy it,” he countered, and she chuckled.</p><p>Pulling him in front of her, she bent down to kiss the top of his head. “Go feed Scratchy and we’ll be on our way.”</p><p>Nicky celebrated with a ‘yes!’ and ran out of the room as fast as he could. Agatha shook her head amused at her son’s antics, and took one last look in the mirror, pushing her sunglasses to the top of her head for now.</p><p>Not bad for forty-five, she thought to herself with a smile.</p><p>After checking that they had everything they needed, Agatha put a basket with snacks and drinks in the trunk, before making sure Nicky was buckled in. They lived in Lakeview and it was a 10-15 minute drive to the Lakefront trail. Despite the fact that Nicky had been rushing her, it was still early, barely 9:30, so they’d have plenty of time to enjoy the sunshine and enjoy Nicky’s last weekend of summer break before going back to school.</p><p>Getting in the car, Agatha turned the radio on and was half paying attention to what Nicky was babbling about in the backseat and half paying attention to the song playing softly in the car sound system. Singing quietly to herself, she checked on Nicky through the rearview mirror, smiling when she saw his head bobbing to the song absentmindedly. It was such a beautiful day.</p><p>She didn’t hear the screech of tires, and she barely heard Nicky’s scream.</p><p>And then darkness.</p><p>When Agatha woke, the world was a blur of flashing red and blue, the metallic tang of blood, and the low hum of a voice coaxing her back to reality.<br />
“Hey, stay with me,” someone said, firm but gentle.<br />
She blinked up into dark eyes, strong hands checking for injuries with practiced ease. The woman’s hair was pulled back, curls escaping around her temples.</p><p>“Your name, ma’am?”</p><p>“Agatha,” she rasped, throat dry. “My—my son—”</p><p>“He’s conscious,” the paramedic assured her. “Looks like an arm fracture, but he’s stable. My colleague is working on him out here. We’re taking you both in.”</p><p>Relief coursed through Agatha so quickly she nearly collapsed back against her seat. That was when she realized her head was pounding. Lifting her hand to her forehead, she felt something wet.</p><p>“Yeah, you got a nasty cut there. How are you feeling?” The paramedic asked, securing the C-collar around her neck.</p><p>“I…” Agatha swallowed, trying to assess the extent of the damage. “My head hurts. And my side, I think? My ribs.”</p><p>“Okay, are you nauseous at all?” She asked, pointing a flashlight at her eyes, making Agatha squint against the harsh light. At her negative reply, the paramedic offered a small, comforting smile. “Okay, let’s get you out of here. Hey, Alice! A little help here?”</p><p>It took a few firefighters, but soon Agatha was free of the confines of her trashed car. She still had no idea what had happened, but she was relieved to be alive with what looked like only minor injuries.</p><p>The paramedic—Vidal, according to her name tag—listened to her breath sounds with a stethoscope before smiling.</p><p>“We’ll take you and your boy to the hospital to get checked out, but it looks like you guys got lucky.” She gave Agatha’s arm a comforting squeeze and started wheeling her gurney to the ambulance. “Hey, buddy, look who’s here.”</p><p>“Mama!” Nicky’s voice was full of tears and Agatha had to take a deep breath to keep it together in front of him. “You wouldn’t wake up, mama. I was so scared! And my arm hurts real bad.”</p><p>“I’m right here, my sweet boy. I’m so sorry I scared you,” Agatha reached out and touched Nicky’s good arm when they positioned her next to him. She’d caught a glimpse of his eyes still wide in fear, his body trembling as he cradled his injured arm against his chest. “I’m not leaving you, baby.”</p><p>“You’re bleeding! Ms. Rio said she would take care of you. Are you okay, mama?”</p><p>Agatha frowned at the name, but then followed her son’s gaze to the paramedic that had just jumped into the back of the ambulance with them before closing the door.</p><p>“We should be at Northwestern in five minutes. How are you doing, Nicky?” The paramedic asked with a kind smile and Nicky sniffled. “Does your arm still hurt? Yeah?” She offered a sympathetic look when he nodded, his eyes still so full of tears. Agatha felt gutted.</p><p>“We’ll be at the hospital soon, sweetheart. I’m sure the doctors will make the pain go away really fast.” She tried to comfort her son, but felt so incredibly helpless, being strapped to a gurney, unable to move.</p><p>“You bet. And I bet you’ll get a cool cast too, buddy. So all your friends will be able to sign it.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Nicky’s voice now reflected a bit of curiosity and Agatha was so grateful to this paramedic for keeping him as calm and as comfortable as possible. Agatha’s head was throbbing, and she was starting to feel a bit nauseous from the pain.</p><p>When they finally made it to the hospital, she heard the paramedic present their case to the doctor as both gurneys were unloaded from the ambulance. They were wheeled into the hospital quickly and before she knew it, someone was taking her to get a CT scan, while pushing a consent form into her hands so she could sign off on Nicky’s X-ray.</p><p>It was only a couple of hours later that she saw the paramedic again. Her best friend Wanda had been called in as her emergency contact, and was staying with Nicky while he got a cast on his arm. The paramedic had been right; he did have a fracture. Now she was bored out of her mind in the infirmary as they wanted to keep her for a few hours for observation. They’d given her something for the pain and it was starting to make her feel a little loopy.</p><p>“Hey, I was looking for you. Agatha, right?” The paramedic smiled at her from the doorway, and in her doped up state, Agatha was sure she looked like an angel. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly and offered a small smile. “A bit groggy,” she replied, and touched the bandage that now covered her forehead. “It’s a mild concussion.”</p><p>The paramedic grimaced sympathetically before approaching the bed. “Just take it easy for a few days and you’ll be fine in no time,” she smiled and Agatha returned. “What was the verdict there?” She pointed at the bandage.</p><p>“Twelve stitches,” Agatha sighed, remembering how she had demanded that a more experienced physician did the procedure. She wasn’t about to let a med student practice on her forehead for god’s sake.</p><p>The paramedic whistled, impressed. Agatha laughed tiredly.</p><p>“How’s Nicky?” She asked and Agatha nodded at the room next door.</p><p>“He broke his arm. He’s over there getting his super cool cast,” she chuckled, and the paramedic smiled. “Thanks for keeping him calm and for distracting him, by the way. He got so excited about his cast that he forgot about the pain.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m just glad you guys are okay,” she touched Agatha’s arm for a moment before stepping back. “I should get back. Tell Nicky I said hi.”</p><p>“Thank you for everything, Ms. Vidal,” Agatha reached out, holding out her hand. The paramedic grinned before shaking her hand. Her palm was warm and so, so soft. Agatha felt like she was touching a part of heaven.</p><p>Dear lord, she really was high as fuck.</p><p>“It’s Rio,” the paramedic said, squeezing her hand, and that was when Agatha realized she was still holding it.</p><p>Feeling slightly embarrassed, she nodded. “It was nice meeting you, Rio.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>The doctors let her go with strict orders that she should not be alone for the next twenty four hours. She tried to argue that she was a doctor herself and she knew damn well what she should be doing with a concussion, but the young man who treated her was not impressed and reinforced that she needed someone to wake her up every couple of hours tonight.</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Agatha abided by the doctor's orders and agreed to let Wanda stay the night. If she was honest with herself, it would be great to have someone to watch Nicky as well because she felt so tired after hours in the hospital — as a patient, which was not her preference.</p><p>“Mama, look at my cast! Do you like it? Will you sign it?” Nicky’s excited voice cut through the fog of her medicated mind, and she managed a smile in her son’s direction. Maybe having Wanda stay with her wouldn’t be so bad.</p><p>A few days later, Agatha still felt a bit sore. Nicky had started third grade, and every day he came home with his cast even more populated with drawings and names than the day before. Her ribs were still killing her, but she just braved through it. In her experience, it was probably just bruised and there wasn’t much that could be done.</p><p>However, something that kept coming back to the forefront of her mind was the nice paramedic that had taken care of them. Agatha just couldn’t get that smile out of her head, and for the life of her, she just couldn’t figure out why.</p><p>Sure, it had been a while since she had actively admired someone like that, but still. As far as she knew, she was straight, thank you very much, despite those involuntary thoughts that popped up in her head from time to time that she wouldn’t even allow herself to entertain.</p><p>Still, in the days that followed, Agatha found herself wondering about the paramedic and her beautiful smile. As she got ready for her new semester at Feinberg School of Medicine, she tried to distract herself from her wandering thoughts. After all, she had a long semester ahead of her with new M2 students and new mentees, as the med students started to focus on their main project for the program. She just hoped she would be assigned to students that were actually worth her time this year.</p><p>“You know, you’ve been awfully quiet these past few days. Are you sure you’re okay?” Wanda asked her on the Sunday before she would return to work at Northwestern.</p><p>“Yeah, why?”</p><p>“Just… usually around this time of the year you’re dreading the new students and can’t shut up about it for starters,” her friend chuckled, and she shrugged.</p><p>“I don’t know. I guess the whole accident thing messed me up a bit,” Agatha looked toward her backyard where Nicky was playing with Wanda’s twins Billy and Tommy. “The whole ‘life is short’ and all that, you know? I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m saying,” she laughed at herself, shaking her head. “How about you? I heard you’re taking over a class at Feinberg this semester.” Agatha raised an eyebrow and Wanda laughed.</p><p>“Lilia has a big mouth,” the redhead rolled her eyes and took a sip of her beer. “Yeah, she offered it to me last week. Behavioral Science for your little M2s.”</p><p>“Oh god, does that mean I’m going to have to put up with you at work even more?” Agatha gasped mockingly and Wanda threw a pillow at her.<br />
“Shut up, you love it.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>“Mama, do you really have to go?” Nicky’s voice was quiet as they drove through the streets of Chicago on their way to her son’s school. Her car had nearly been totaled, but her car insurance had thankfully come through in record time.</p><p>Agatha frowned at his tone and searched his eyes through the rearview mirror.</p><p>“Go where, baby?”</p><p>“To work. Can’t you just stay home? Where you’ll be safe?” His voice was still so small, so quiet, that Agatha felt her heart break and understanding washed over her. This was the first time they were going to spend the whole day apart since the accident.</p><p>For the past week, Wanda had taken Nicky to school along with her boys and brought him back home as well, because Agatha was still sorting out her car situation. Nicky obviously felt that the fact that she was home and not behind the wheel kept her safe.</p><p>“Oh, honey, don’t worry. I’ll be at Northwestern all day today, but Aunt Wanda will come pick you guys up and you can hang out with Billy and Tommy for a little bit. And then I’ll be home tonight and we’ll have a special dinner. How does that sound?”</p><p>Nicky shrugged, a worried line still creasing his forehead. “Okay.”</p><p>He was quiet for the next five minutes until Agatha parked in front of his school. It was only when she was helping him out of the car because of his cast that Nicky finally spoke up again.</p><p>“Mama? Do you promise you’ll be careful today? Like pinky promise?” He sounded so serious as his gaze traveled to the bandage that covered the stitches on her forehead. Agatha felt her chest tighten.</p><p>Crouching down in front of him, she touched his cheek. “I pinky promise, baby,” she offered him her pinky finger and smiled when he hooked his own with hers. “Everything will be fine. And I promise I’m okay. Alright?”</p><p>He nodded before throwing his arms around her neck in a tight hug. “I love you, mama.”</p><p>Agatha felt her eyes burn with tears. “I love you too, my sweet boy. So much,” she kissed his cheek and stood up. “Now off you go. Learn lots of new things.”</p><p>He finally smiled and accepted his backpack when she helped him put it on. Agatha waited until he was inside the building before allowing herself to collapse against the side of the car. Taking a deep breath, she brushed away the lone tear that had escaped.</p><p>Everything would be fine. It was a beautiful day, she repeated to herself like a mantra.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha stopped by the café on campus to get an iced coffee, before making her way up to her office in the Department of Neurology. It had been a few weeks since she had last been here, and she admitted that she’d missed it and was more than ready to dive back in.</p><p>Although she did have a private practice, teaching at Northwestern took a big chunk of her time. And as much as she liked to complain about how frustrating some students could be sometimes, she really loved teaching.</p><p>Her first lecture was at 10, and she stopped by the ladies room before making her way to the lecture hall. Looking at her reflection in the mirror, she touched the bandage on her forehead, glad to realize that it didn’t hurt as much anymore. The look on Nicky’s eyes as his gaze focused on her injury still made her chest tighten with anguish.</p><p>They had been so lucky that day. It could have been so much worse.</p><p>As she stepped out of the bathroom, she pulled the strap of her bag higher on her shoulder, as she tried to hold onto her coffee cup and a water bottle with her other hand. Grimacing when it pulled on her bruised ribs, she entered the lecture hall and quickly made her way to the desk in front of a half circle of desks and chairs that went up for at least six levels.</p><p>A few students were already seated, some looking excited and a few of them looking slightly terrified, especially when she met their eyes. Grinning inwardly, she rolled her eyes amused, as she knew her reputation preceded her.</p><p>At ten o’clock sharp, she stepped in front of the desk to face her new students. Second-year medical students — they weren’t as green and bright-eyed as their first-year colleagues, but she couldn’t help but think that they looked younger and younger every year.</p><p>“Good morning,” she started, her voice firm and unwavering. “I’m Dr. Agatha Harkness and this is Neurology-”</p><p>A low gasp distracted her and her eyes followed the sound. Agatha felt her heart skip a beat.</p><p>Standing at the door, wearing a student white lab coat with a laptop bag on her shoulder, was the paramedic whose smile she couldn’t forget.</p>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha was packing up her notes, her back turned for just a moment. Rio hesitated before standing up, and as she made her way to the door, she couldn’t help but smile to herself.</p><p>“Didn’t expect to see you here, Professor,” she paused halfway there, before turning to the woman in front of the desk.</p><p>Agatha straightens, her breath hitching for barely a moment. “Didn’t expect you to be in my class.”</p><p>Rio grins. “Guess fate has a sense of humor,” she stepped closer, hands in her pockets. “So…” she started casually, tilting her head. “Do I at least get a ‘good job’ for not making a complete fool of myself in front of the entire class?”</p></blockquote>

  <p>It was barely 9:30 in the morning, and Rio Vidal was already exhausted.</p><p>A double shift was nothing new—she needed the money, and her student loans weren’t going to pay themselves—but today had been particularly grueling. The last call had turned dangerous when a distressed family member became violent, and all she wanted now was to lie down for thirty minutes and pretend the world didn’t exist.</p><p>She had just closed her eyes when the alarm blared through the firehouse again.</p><p>
  <em>Ambulance 12 and Engine 47, motor vehicle collision with injuries reported. </em>
</p><p>Groaning, Rio pushed herself up, dragging her weary body forward. When she reached their rig, her partner, William Kaplan, held out a steaming cup of coffee.</p><p>“Figured you could use a pick-me-up after that shitshow,” he said with a smirk. Rio sighed in relief, taking the cup gratefully before ruffling his hair. “Jesus, get off me, woman!” he batted her hand away with a laugh.</p><p>“You’re my hero, Kaplan,” she teased, throwing the keys in his direction. “I’ll even let you drive for this.”</p><p>William gasped mockingly, grabbing the keys in midair and holding them close to his heart, but Rio knew he was secretly pleased. He was young, only 23 years old, and had only been working as a paramedic for a few months. And Rio had a strict rule that no rookie was going to take the wheel before she felt they were ready.</p><p>“If I’d known that plying you with coffee was the way to your heart, I would’ve bribed you sooner.”</p><p>Rio laughed, and took a sip of the hot beverage, before hopping up on the rig on the passenger side. “Don't push it, kid. Shut up and drive.”</p><p>Their radio crackled with details: a collision involving a child.</p><p>Rio’s stomach tightened. She hated cases with kids. They made her think of her nieces and nephews—the light of her life. If she knew one thing about her future medical career, it was that pediatrics was out of the question. She didn’t have the stomach for it.</p><p>When they arrived, only one car remained. It had taken a bad hit to the side, the impact crumpling the metal like paper. Police were already on scene, one of the officers informing them that the other driver had fled.</p><p>Rio barely heard him.</p><p>Her eyes were already on the backseat, where a small, terrified boy clutched his arm against his chest, his whole body shaking with sobs.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Steeling herself, she approached.</p><p>“Hey, buddy! My name’s Rio. Can you tell me your name, sweetheart?”</p><p>The boy’s brown hair fell into his wet eyes as he whimpered, “Nicky.” Then, his voice broke completely. “My mom won’t wake up! Please help her!”</p><p>“Okay, Nicky, we’re going to help you both, alright? Where does it hurt, buddy?” She kept her voice gentle, and watched as he took a shuddering breath.</p><p>“My arm hurts really bad,” he tried to keep his voice steady, but it shook anyway. “Mom! Mama, please wake up!”</p><p>Rio felt her heart break for this little boy, hearing such anguish in his voice. He couldn’t be older than nine at most.</p><p>Stepping aside to let the firefighters pry his door open, she waited until they gave her the go ahead to check on Nicky. Once they cleared it, she went into the backseat to check him over.</p><p>“Hey, buddy, look at me,” Rio waited for Nicky to meet her eyes. “We’re going to get you out of here, okay? See my friend over there?” She pointed at her partner, who offered a smile and a wave in his direction. “His name is William, and he’s going to take care of you while we help your mama, okay, sweetheart?”</p><p>Nicky blinked up at her, desperate. “You promise?”</p><p>Something about the way he trusted her, completely and utterly, made her throat feel tight.</p><p>“I promise I’ll do everything in my power to help her,” she replied seriously, and sighed relieved when Nicky finally seemed to accept her promise. “Will, I need a kids C-collar here!” She called out over her shoulder. “Are you hurting anywhere else, Nicky?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I don't think so.”</p><p>“Okay, let’s get this on you,” she said gently, securing the C-collar on him. “We’re going to get you out now, and then I’m going to help your mom, alright?”</p><p>“Okay.” He replied quietly, still sniffling. When they moved him onto the stretcher and accidentally jostled his arm, he let out a painful gasp and started crying again in earnest.</p><p>“I’m sorry, buddy, I know it hurts,” she tried to soothe him. “Will is going to take care of you, okay? I’m going to go check on your mom.”</p><p>Once Nicky was safely in Kaplan’s care, Rio turned her attention to the driver’s seat, where her firefighter friend Alice was prying the door open.</p><p>The woman inside was unconscious, a nasty gash on her forehead bleeding freely, soaking into her dark hair.</p><p>When Alice gave the all-clear, Rio leaned in. “Ma’am? Can you hear me?”</p><p>For a long moment, nothing. Then, a groggy, painful groan. The woman’s eyelids fluttered open, and Rio forgot how to breathe.</p><p>
  <em>Blue.</em>
</p><p>Her eyes were the most stunning shade of blue Rio had ever seen.</p><p>She shook herself, snapping back into medic mode. “Hey, stay with me,” she murmured, steady but gentle, keeping the woman’s head still. “What’s your name, ma’am?”</p><p>The woman blinked sluggishly. “Agatha,” she rasped. Then, panic flooded her face. “My son! Where’s my son?”</p><p>“He’s conscious. Looks like an arm fracture, but he’s stable. My colleague is working on him out here. We’re taking you both in,” Rio reassured her. “I got you, don’t worry.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>She and William dropped mother and son at Northwestern, and before they could return to the firehouse, another call came in. It had been a simple wellness check, but she was grateful for taking a small break for the next couple of hours after that.</p><p>It wasn’t until after lunch, during a quick coffee break, that she found herself thinking about them. Something about the fierce love in Agatha’s groggy voice, the way her hand had lingered on Rio’s, the way Nicky had clung to her every word.</p><p>She found herself at Northwestern again, after dropping off an elderly gentleman that had suffered an acute MI. Rio had spent the entire drive giving him CPR, and she hoped he made it.</p><p>After she handed him off to the doctors, Rio found herself scanning the ER rooms before she even realized what she was doing.</p><p>And there she was. Agatha lay in a hospital bed, looking sleepy and just a little adorable. Rio hesitated for half a second before walking into her room.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Her conversation with Agatha had been entertaining, and she was intrigued when the woman held onto her hand, thumb brushing against her skin absentmindedly, it seemed. Her smile combined with her eyes made her insides turn to goo, and she figured she needed to get the hell out of there. The woman was a friggin’ patient and clearly recovering from a head injury.</p><p>But just as she said goodbye, she spotted Nicky in the room next door, and just knew she had to at least go say hi. The boy had struck a chord deep in her heart, and she couldn’t quite figure out why.</p><p>A redheaded woman was with him, obviously trying to distract him from the pain and the prospect of moving his arm to get his cast.</p><p>“Knock, knock,” Rio said playfully, and smiled when Nicky’s eyes lit up when he saw her.</p><p>“Ms. Rio! Aunt Wanda, that’s the paramedic lady I was telling you about. She saved me and Mama!” Nicky told the redhead excitedly, and Rio couldn’t help but chuckle. “She was like a superhero!”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know about that. But I’m glad to see you’re doing better, buddy. And you’re going to get a super cool cast, huh? Your mom told me all about it,” she approached his bed and pointed at the orthopedic technician preparing his cast on the other side of the room. “What’s up, Johnny? You gonna take care of my boy Nicky here?”</p><p>“Only the best for you and yours, Vidal,” the older man grinned at her.</p><p>Rio shook her head with a laugh, finally looking at the redhead, who was regarding her with a curious expression. “Hi, I’m Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Oh, I’ve heard all about you from this young man here. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Wanda, Agatha’s friend,” she offered her hand for her to shake, and Rio couldn’t help but think about the way Agatha’s touch had lingered just a few minutes ago. “Thanks for taking care of them.”</p><p>“Oh, just doing my job. I’m glad they’re okay,” Rio shook her hand, and stepped away for Johnny to start working on Nicky’s cast.</p><p>She watched as Nicky grimaced at the tiniest movement in his arm, tears rolling down his cheeks silently, and figured the least she could do was try to distract him by helping him select the color of his cast.</p><p>She crouched down beside his gurney, a warm smile on her face. “Alright, buddy, this is a big decision. We have blue, red, green, and even glow-in-the-dark. But be warned, the glow-in-the-dark one? It makes you an official nighttime superhero. You might start fighting crime in your sleep,” she whispered conspiratorially.</p><p>Nicky, still sniffling but intrigued, wiped at his eyes. “Superheroes don’t cry, right?” he asked, his voice wavering, and she felt her chest tighten.</p><p>“Oh, buddy, even superheroes cry. But you know what they do after? They get back up, just like you’re doing,” she offered him a gentle smile. “So what’s it going to be?</p><p>“Glow-in-the-dark! So I can be a nighttime superhero,” Nicky replied immediately, his tears all but forgotten.</p><p>“Excellent choice, sir. I hope you use your powers wisely,” she said, making a show of picking up his selected color. “As you well know, with great power…”</p><p>“Comes great responsibility, I know,” Nicky completed with a solemn tone to his voice, making Rio chuckle.</p><p>When she left the room a few minutes later, her heart felt so much lighter, and she found the strength to keep going about her never ending shift.</p><p>~*~</p><p>A week later, Rio had a shift straight out of the seventh circle of hell. It had been a long night. Rio barely remembered her last meal, only that it had been too rushed to be satisfying. She hadn’t even had a proper break during her overnight shift—just one call after another, a steady stream of chaos.</p><p>By the time she finally got some sleep, she could only manage two hours, her body too tired to stay still for long. But there she was, Making her way to the lecture hall for her very first neurology class of the semester. Her coffee was already half-gone, and she wasn’t sure if it was helping or just adding to the jitteriness settling under her skin. Either way, she was late.</p><p>She pushed the door open quietly, hoping she wouldn’t interrupt, but the second it creaked on its hinges, the entire class turned to look at her.</p><p>“Ah, perfect timing,” came the voice at the front of the room, sending an unexpected wave of recognition crashing through her. It was Agatha Harkness, standing tall and composed in front of the class, her sharp eyes narrowing slightly as they met Rio’s gaze. The professor—legendary in the department, a neurosurgeon and expert in the field of neurology. Rio’s heart stuttered for a second before she reminded herself to breathe. Agatha, the woman she had saved a week ago, was her professor now. How in the world did that even happen?</p><p>The professor’s lips curled up in what seemed like a controlled, polite smile as she adjusted the papers in front of her. “Well, since we have a latecomer, I’ll start again with a quick introduction. My name is Dr. Harkness, and this course is an introduction to neurology, focusing on neuroanatomy, the principles of neurological assessment, and how we approach cases from both a clinical and research perspective.”</p><p>Rio slipped into a seat near the back, trying to make herself as small as possible. The last thing she wanted was to draw attention in front of a room full of future doctors, especially after walking in late. But as Agatha began to speak again, outlining the expectations for the class, Rio couldn’t help but notice the bandage on her forehead. Agatha had been hurt in the accident… She’d remembered the woman’s soft smile and the grip of her hand from when Rio had helped her out of that wreck, but seeing her now, poised and commanding in front of the class, was surreal.</p><p>After a few moments of Agatha running through the course structure, she stopped abruptly and turned toward the board, writing something down. It wasn’t long before Agatha’s eyes flicked over to her.</p><p>“Since we’re speaking about brainstem function today, let’s test some of your knowledge. Who can explain the importance of assessing the brainstem in trauma cases, and why it’s critical for intervention?” She paused, her gaze landing on Rio. “You—yes, you in the back. What do you think?”</p><p>Rio froze. She hadn’t expected to be called on, especially not after the way they’d left things between them. She had barely processed the class’s attention settling on her, let alone the weight of being tested in front of Agatha again, with the full weight of her now professor’s gaze upon her.</p><p>“Well…” Rio cleared her throat, trying to shake the lingering fuzziness from her head. “I mean, the brainstem is the control center for basic life functions, right? If there’s trauma to the brainstem, it could affect breathing, heart rate, even consciousness. If you don’t assess it right away, it could lead to brain death, or you know, irreversible damage.” She rubbed a hand over her face, trying to focus through the tiredness. “So yeah, it’s basically a life-or-death situation if you don’t handle it properly. And you really want to make sure you’re getting the right information early on. You don’t want to miss anything. Especially in trauma cases.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked, but she held her professionalism tight. “Well, that’s a solid answer. If we can start to recognize the signs of brain stem injury in trauma, we can make a plan that’s more effective and tailored to the patient’s condition.” She paused for a moment, as if weighing her next words, before giving Rio a nod.</p><p>Rio felt a flicker of warmth rush through her, but she quickly turned her attention back to her notebook, trying not to feel too much of a connection to those eyes that were still on her.</p><p>The rest of the lecture continued, Agatha diving into more specifics about brainstem functions and how they related to various kinds of trauma. Rio did her best to stay awake, the exhaustion from her overnight shift making it a challenge to keep up. She jotted down notes, but it was hard to focus, especially with Agatha at the front of the room, making the subject seem so effortless. Rio couldn’t help but admire how she commanded the room despite the faint, lingering vulnerability that was still visible around her bandaged forehead.</p><p>By the end of class, Rio found herself lingering, uncertain of what to do next. She hadn’t expected to feel this… drawn to Agatha. She hadn’t expected the rush of adrenaline that came with being in the same space as her, or the unexpected longing that had surfaced in her chest.</p><p>Agatha was packing up her notes, her back turned for just a moment. Rio hesitated before standing up, and as she made her way to the door, she couldn’t help but smile to herself.</p><p>“Didn’t expect to see you here, Professor,” she paused halfway there, before turning to the woman in front of the desk.</p><p>Agatha straightens, her breath hitching for barely a moment. “Didn’t expect you to be in my class.”<br />Rio grins. “Guess fate has a sense of humor,” she stepped closer, hands in her pockets. “So…” she started casually, tilting her head. “Do I at least get a ‘good job’ for not making a complete fool of myself in front of the entire class?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look up. “I expect my students to be competent, Ms. Vidal. I don’t hand out praise for meeting the bare minimum.”</p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh. “Damn. Tough crowd.”</p><p>Finally, finally, Agatha looked at her.</p><p>And there it was again. That flicker of something unreadable behind her carefully constructed walls.</p><p>“In this room,” Agatha said, voice steady but not quite as cold as before, “you’re just another student.”</p><p>A warning, not a statement.</p><p>Rio caught the slight tension in Agatha’s jaw, the way her fingers curled a little tighter around her notebook.</p><p>There was another long pause, and Rio felt the awkwardness settle in. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other before speaking again. “So, how’s Nicky doing?” she asked, her voice gentler now, as if she wasn’t sure how to phrase the question.</p><p>The mention of Nicky caught Agatha off-guard. She hadn’t expected Rio to ask. It took a second for her to compose herself before responding, her voice tinged with affection. “He’s… adjusting. It was hard for him, you know. But he’s strong. He’s getting better each day.”</p><p>A flicker of emotion crossed Agatha’s face before she caught herself, her professional demeanor quickly returning. “Thank you for asking, though. He means the world to me.”</p><p>Rio nodded thoughtfully. “I get it,” she said quietly. “I mean, I know what it’s like to want to protect someone. It’s tough.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a small, appreciative smile, though her eyes seemed distant for a moment. “Yes, it is. But that’s why we do what we do, isn’t it?” she said, her voice firm again. “To make sure others don’t have to experience what we’ve gone through.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a soft smile, the connection between them lingering a little longer than either of them expected. “Yeah,” she said quietly. “That’s the goal.”</p><p>With that, she gave Agatha one last look, unsure whether she’d said too much or not enough. Agatha’s gaze lingered on her for just a beat longer before she cleared her throat, her professional demeanor settling back in.</p><p>“See you next week, Ms. Vidal,” Agatha said briskly, turning to gather her papers. “Preferably on time.”</p><p>Rio gave her a nod, walking toward the door.“Wouldn’t miss it for the world. See you, Professor.”</p><p>As she left the lecture hall, Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to the professor than she’d expected. Agatha had the reputation to be so composed, so serious and inflexible, but today—just for a moment—there had been something else there. It was a blink and you miss it moment. But it was definitely there.</p><p>Something soft.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha sat at her desk, the faint rustle of papers the only sound in the stillness of her office. Her bandage, now more of a quiet reminder than anything else, itched against her forehead, but she barely noticed it. Her thoughts were consumed by the strange pull she felt toward Rio Vidal.</p><p>The encounter had been unexpected, to say the least. Agatha hadn’t been prepared to see Rio again, and certainly not like this—standing in front of her as her med student. The woman who had comforted her in the aftermath of the accident, who had held her hand with that effortless care, someone whose smile she hadn’t been able to forget for the past week, was now someone she was supposed to teach. Someone she had to maintain a professional distance from.</p><p>Agatha shook her head at herself. This was ridiculous. She had always prided herself on her professionalism, on being able to separate her personal life from her work. She had never allowed herself to get tangled up in anything that would jeopardize her career, her reputation, or the stability she’d worked so hard to create.</p><p>And yet, here she was, feeling things she couldn’t explain. At first, she chalked it up to the stress of the accident and the vulnerability she’d felt in the hospital. But now, seeing Rio again, she felt it again. The way her easy grin made her heart flutter. She didn’t quite understand what was happening, but one thing's for certain: it definitely rattled her.</p><p>Whatever this strange pull towards the paramedic was, it made her uncomfortable. She wasn’t used to feeling like this. It was uncharted territory. Growing up, she had been taught to repress anything that didn’t align with the strict expectations placed on her. She’d spent her entire life suppressing any inklings that weren’t part of her professional identity, or part of the expectations her mother had placed upon her. She wasn’t supposed to be attracted to women. At least, that’s what her Evanora Harkness had drilled into her head from a very early age.</p><p>But there was something about Rio—her confidence, her compassion, and from what she’d seen today, a hint of cheeky humor—that made Agatha question everything she’d told herself. It was confusing, disorienting, and, in a weird way, kind of exhilarating. But it was also terrifying.</p><p>Agatha had always been a woman of precision. She’d built her life on neatly constructed foundations: lectures prepared weeks in advance, research that left no room for uncertainty. She could not let a student affect her like that, regardless of what had happened a week before.</p><p>Shaking herself out of it, she told herself to get her shit together. She had a job to do. She had to keep things professional. She had to stay focused on her class, on her work.</p><p>This thing — whatever it was with Rio Vidal — was nothing.</p><p>~*~</p><p>A few days after Agatha’s first lecture, she found herself walking across the university campus with Nicky in tow. It was Friday, and the weight of the week had already started to settle on her shoulders, but she couldn’t afford to slow down. Nicky was bouncing beside her, his excitement from school not quite worn off yet. Agatha had picked him up and had to bring him back to campus so she could finish her office hours.</p><p>Before they made it to her office on the third floor, Agatha thought she’d buy Nicky a hot chocolate and a pastry to tide him over until they got home. They walked into the campus café, and there was Wanda, already sitting at a table near the window, her bright red hair standing out against the backdrop of students moving around. Wanda smiled at them both and gestured to the empty seats across from her.</p><p>“Got the little troublemaker in tow, I see,” Wanda teased, as Nicky immediately slid into the seat beside her.</p><p>Nicky grinned, his energy practically radiating off him. “I’m no troublemaker. I’m a superhero, remember? Ms. Rio said so! With my glow-in-the-dark cast!” He showed her his fully signed and drawn on cast proudly.</p><p>Agatha gave Wanda a slight, tight smile as she sat down beside her, still processing Nicky’s words. The mention of Rio, so casually and full of admiration, had Agatha feeling something unfamiliar stir inside her.</p><p>Wanda laughed and ruffled his hair. “Oh, I apologize, Mr. Superhero. My mistake,” she winked at him before turning to Agatha. “The paramedic seems to have made quite the impression, huh?”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, the door to the café opened, and in walked none other than Rio Vidal.</p><p>She didn’t immediately notice Agatha, her focus on the phone in her hands, but when Nicky caught sight of her, his excitement burst through the door.</p><p>“Ms. Rio!” Nicky practically jumped out of his seat, waving excitedly. “I’m so happy to see you!”</p><p>Rio’s gaze immediately snapped up, and her face broke into a grin when she saw the boy, already half out of his seat. </p><p>“Hey, Nicky! Look at you—glow-in-the-dark cast and all!” She winked at him, moving over to their table with her usual confident but easygoing air. “Love the artwork there, buddy.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, something stirring within her at the sight of Rio smiling at Nicky. </p><p>Wanda’s eyes darted between Agatha and Rio, a curious look in her eyes. Agatha tried her best to keep a professional distance, but the tension was palpable. Rio’s presence in the room shifted the air somehow, and Agatha wasn’t quite sure what to do with it.</p><p>Rio finally turned her attention to Agatha, her grin faltering slightly as their eyes met. It was brief, but Agatha saw the flicker of recognition—of something unspoken passing between them.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness,” Rio said, her voice casual, but there was an undertone of something more. “Didn’t expect to run into you here.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, trying to find her composure again. “I brought Nicky for a little coffee break. Trying to make up for all the hours he’ll be stuck in the office with me.” She couldn’t help but glance at Rio, trying to gauge the energy between them.</p><p>“Sounds like a busy day,” Rio said with a small, almost teasing smile. </p><p>“You have no idea,” Agatha replied, a little too quickly. She felt a rush of heat in her chest, but masked it with a light laugh.</p><p>“What are you doing here, Ms. Rio? Did you come to save someone?” Nicky jumped into the conversation, his eyes looking up at Rio adoringly.</p><p>Rio smiled at him, ruffling his hair. Agatha felt her heart warm. “Nah, today I’m just a student here. Did you know that your mom here is my professor?” She added conspiratorially and Nicky’s eyes widened, turning to his mom for confirmation. Agatha nodded, an amused smile pulling the corner of her lips up.</p><p>“Whoa, for real? You’re going to be a doctor too? Mama says she helps people become doctors,” his voice was so full of wonder and pride that Agatha couldn’t help but feel that tug of love for her child in her chest.</p><p>“Yup, I’m in my second year. Still got two more years to go.”</p><p>“That’s awesome, Ms. Rio. So you’ll get to be a superhero twice over! Saving lives in two different ways. Mama, that’s what I wanna do when I grow up!”</p><p>“Yeah? You’re gonna be a double hero, buddy?” Rio teased, and Nicky nodded eagerly. </p><p>Wanda watched the exchange with an amused glint in her eye. Nicky, oblivious to the subtle undercurrent of tension, was clearly delighted to see Rio.</p><p>“Wanna sit with us, Rio?” Nicky asked excited, the invitation simple and innocent, yet making the room feel somehow smaller. Agatha couldn’t help but notice how comfortable Rio seemed in Nicky’s presence. It made her heart ache, a warmth spreading through her chest that she wasn’t sure how to process.</p><p>Rio locked eyes with Agatha, a questioning look in her eyes. When Agatha gave her a subtle nod, Rio turned to Nicky and nodded with a grin. “Sure. Let me just go get my coffee and I’ll be right back.”</p><p>As soon as Rio left, Wanda leaned in just slightly, catching Agatha’s eye. “So,” she said, her voice a low hum, “This is an interesting development.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, but she swallowed hard, unsure of how to respond. Instead, she turned her focus back on Rio, trying to find her bearings, even as her mind spun with all the possibilities she didn’t want to consider.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>As Rio slid into the seat next to her, Agatha couldn’t help but notice the warmth in the air between them. Her pulse quickened, though she masked it with a polite smile. Rio’s presence felt different now— familiar, yet a reminder of their first meeting, when Agatha had been a patient. But now, seeing her as a fellow academic and with Nicky so excited to see her again, Agatha felt a slight crack in her usual composure.</p><p>Nicky, who hadn’t stopped smiling since Rio arrived, leaned forward eagerly. “Ms. Rio, can you come to my school for a show-and-tell?” he asked, practically bouncing in his seat. “You can tell everyone how you save people, and then you can teach us how to be paramedics too.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, her eyes twinkling. “I’d love to, kiddo. But I don’t think they’ll let me make everyone pretend they’re paramedics. You guys might be too busy saving lives.”</p><p>Nicky grinned, utterly undeterred. “We could do it! You could teach us, and we’d be like superheroes too! Just like you!”</p><p>Rio gave him a playful side-eye. “Maybe we’ll work on our superhero training at a later date,” she said, ruffling his hair before looking over at Wanda. “So, you must be Wanda, right? I think I remember you from the hospital…?”</p><p>Wanda’s smile was wide and warm, clearly enjoying the moment. “Yeah, I’m Wanda Maximoff. Nice to finally meet you properly.” She chuckled lightly. “I’m a professor here too. How’s your first week at school been?”</p><p>“I think I’ve survived,” Rio replied with a grin. “It’s been a bit of an adjustment being back, but I’m getting the hang of it. I think I have you for Behavioral Science tomorrow, right?”</p><p>Wanda nodded. “That’s right. I hope you’ll find it interesting.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened for a second as she processed the information. “I’m looking forward to it. The program here is so good. I heard fantastic things about it before I started last year, but it really surpassed my expectations,” Rio took a sip of her coffee, before continuing. “Dr. Harkness’ class, for example, was just so incredible, honestly. I was really looking forward to neurology, but I admit I was a little intimidated by her reputation and all that. But she definitely knows how to captivate a room.”</p><p>Agatha looked up at the unexpected praise, and for a moment, there was a brief, shy connection between them—Rio’s gaze holding just a little longer than normal. She knew how much her reputation had preceded her, but hearing Rio speak so genuinely made her feel a flush of pride she didn’t always allow herself.</p><p>“I think that’s the goal,” Agatha said, trying to keep her voice even, but her smile softened at Rio’s sincerity. “I want to make the material accessible while still keeping it challenging. But it’s good to hear you liked the class.”</p><p>“Liked it?” Rio chuckled. “I think I could’ve stayed all afternoon, even though I was tired as hell. It’s rare to find a lecture that can keep me hooked like that, especially with everything else I have going on.”</p><p>“Sounds like you’re pretty busy,” Wanda remarked. “The life of a med student and paramedic must be exhausting.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, though her eyes betrayed a trace of fatigue. “It’s a balancing act, for sure. But I’ve always liked a good challenge.”</p><p>Before the conversation could continue, Rio stood up, gathering her things. “I'm so sorry to cut this short, but I’ve got to get to class. It was really nice to meet you properly, Professor Maximoff. And it was so great seeing you again, Nicky. Glad to hear your superhero powers are doing great,” she winked at him, eliciting a giggle. “Dr. Harkness, I’ll see you on Monday.”</p><p>“Bye, Rio,” Nicky called out, still grinning from ear to ear. Agatha gave her a nod, polite and professional, though she couldn’t quite hide the trace of softness in her gaze as Rio walked away.</p><p>Not even five minutes passed before Nicky asked to go choose one of the pastries. Once he was out of earshot, Wanda turned to Agatha, an amused glint in her eye. “What the hell was that?”</p><p>Agatha froze, her hand pausing in mid-air as she reached for her coffee cup. “What do you mean?” she asked, trying to keep her voice casual.</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Come on, Agatha. I’m not blind. You looked at her a little differently just now. And when she was talking about you? That wasn’t just about your lecture. There’s something there.”</p><p>Agatha set her coffee down a little too firmly, her heart racing as she tried to process what Wanda was implying. “No,” she said quickly. “There’s nothing there. She’s a student and… she happened to be the paramedic that took care of me and Nicky. And now I’m just her professor. That’s it.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile widened. “Sure, I’m sure you’re just her professor. But you can’t deny there’s a bit of… I don’t know… spark between you two. And don’t think I didn’t notice the way you looked at her.”</p><p>Agatha felt the heat rising to her cheeks. “It’s not like that,” she muttered, even though she wasn’t entirely sure that was true.</p><p>Wanda leaned back in her chair, studying Agatha with a soft, knowing smile. “Whatever you say, Agatha. But if there is something there, I just want you to know that I’m here if you need to talk. No pressure. Just… don’t bottle it all up.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said a little too quickly, pushing her coffee cup aside. “We should finish our coffee and head back to work.”</p><p>Wanda just shrugged, giving Agatha a knowing glance before taking another sip of her drink. “I’m here if you need me. That’s all I’m saying.”</p><p>As they left the café and walked back toward campus, Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that Wanda had seen something she wasn’t ready to confront. But every time her thoughts returned to Rio, her chest tightened with something that felt both foreign and familiar—something she wasn’t prepared to explore just yet.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha rarely got nervous before a lecture. She had been doing this for years—long enough to know exactly how to command a room, how to keep her students engaged, how to challenge them without discouraging them.</p><p>But as she stood at the front of the lecture hall today, marker in hand, she was acutely aware of Rio Vidal sitting in the crowd. It had been a few weeks since classes started, and September was morphing into October fast. One would think that this weird hyper fixation with Rio Vidal would’ve passed by now.</p><p>She wished she was that lucky.</p><p>It was frustrating, really, how much Agatha noticed her now.</p><p>She scanned the room as she spoke, careful not to linger too long on any one student, but her gaze still caught on Rio more than once. The younger woman looked more awake today, more put together, though there was still a hint of exhaustion in the way she rubbed her thumb absently along the side of her notebook.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to refocus.</p><p>She moved through the first half of the lecture efficiently, walking the class through the hippocampus and its role in memory formation. When she reached a natural pause, she set her marker down and turned fully to the room.</p><p>“For those of you considering specializing in neurology,” she said, “or for those who want a deeper understanding of the field, I’ll be taking on a small number of mentees for your main research project.”</p><p>That got their attention.</p><p>She continued, keeping her tone measured, professional. “Those accepted will work closely with me to refine their focus, develop their methods, and—should their work be of a high enough caliber—submit for potential publication.”</p><p>A low murmur spread through the hall. Some students perked up, whispering to each other, already considering their options.</p><p>Agatha knew what she would see before she even glanced in Rio’s direction.</p><p>The moment she did, though, it nearly knocked the breath from her chest.</p><p>Rio had straightened in her seat, eyes bright with something sharp and eager. There was no hesitation in her expression—just pure, unfiltered determination.</p><p>It was the most awake Agatha had ever seen her look, with laser focus determination.</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>“Those interested,” she continued, keeping her voice even, “should submit a brief proposal outlining their intended focus by the end of the week.”</p><p>She forced herself to look away, to shift her attention back to the broader class.</p><p>But that moment stuck with her.</p><p>She had expected some interest. She had expected students to recognize the value of the opportunity.</p><p>She had not expected Rio Vidal to look at her like that—with something bordering on reverence. Like she had just handed her a precious gift.</p><p>And that was dangerous.</p><p>Because if she let herself think about it too much, she might have to admit how much she liked it.</p><p>As soon as class ended, the usual buzz of conversation filled the lecture hall. Agatha stayed by the desk, pretending to organize her notes as students filtered out, some lingering to chat with classmates, others already deep in discussion about potential research topics.</p><p>She knew she should leave—head back to her office, put some distance between herself and Rio as fast as humanly possible..</p><p>But then, as she reached for her bag, a voice stopped her.</p><p>“Professor Harkness.”</p><p>She didn’t have to look up to know who it was.</p><p>She took a breath before meeting Rio’s gaze.</p><p>Up close, the younger woman’s enthusiasm was even more apparent. She had that same sharp focus from earlier, but now, with everyone else leaving, it felt… more direct.</p><p>“I wanted to ask about the mentorship,” Rio said, shifting her bag onto her shoulder. “You mentioned proposals—I assume you’re looking for something structured? Literature review, methodology, that kind of thing?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yes. It doesn’t have to be exhaustive, but I want to see that you’ve given real thought to your research question and how you intend to approach it.”</p><p>Rio nodded, then hesitated for a beat before saying, “I want to focus on Alzheimer’s.”</p><p>That made Agatha pause.</p><p>It wasn’t an unusual choice. Neurodegenerative diseases were a major area of study, and plenty of students were drawn to them. But something in the way Rio said it—quiet, deliberate—told Agatha there was something personal behind it.</p><p>She studied her for a moment. “That’s a broad topic. You’ll need to narrow your focus.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio exhaled, shifting her weight slightly. “I was thinking about early-onset cases. Genetic predisposition, potential interventions. My grandmother had it. She was diagnosed when I was a teenager, and it progressed fast.” Her voice didn’t waver, but there was something underneath it—something steady, but undeniably raw. “It’s why I wanted to go into medicine in the first place.”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t expected that.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what she had expected, but this—Rio speaking with such quiet conviction—unnerved her.</p><p>Not in a bad way.</p><p>Just in a way she didn’t quite know what to do with.</p><p>She kept her expression neutral. “That’s a compelling reason to pursue it.”</p><p>Rio gave a small, self-conscious smile. “I figured it’d be a good way to stay motivated.”</p><p>Agatha considered her for a moment.</p><p>The responsible thing to do would be to treat this as she would with any student. To offer encouragement, set expectations, and send her on her way.</p><p>But she was still thinking about the way Rio had looked at her earlier.</p><p>And that was a problem.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “If you’re serious about this, I’ll expect a strong proposal.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened. “Wouldn’t dream of turning in anything less.”</p><p>Agatha should have dismissed her then. Let the conversation end, keep things professional.</p><p>But she saw the way Rio’s gaze flickered—just for a second—to her forehead, where the faint line of a scar remained, where the stitches had been a few weeks before.</p><p>Rio hesitated. “How’s your head?”</p><p>Agatha stiffened, surprised by the question. “It’s fine.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look convinced. “I mean, I did pull you out of a car wreck. I feel like I get to ask.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “I appreciate the concern, but I assure you, I’m quite recovered.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a beat longer, then gave a small, knowing smile.</p><p>“If you say so, Professor. I’m glad to hear that.”</p><p>There was something in her tone—something that made Agatha’s pulse tick up, just slightly. But before she could figure out what to do with it, Rio was already turning toward the door.</p><p>“Oh—and say hi to Nicky for me.”</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>Agatha stood there for a long moment, staring at the empty doorway.</p><p>This was going to be a problem.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>A few days had passed since that conversation after Agatha’s class, and Rio had been busier than ever. Between her shifts, classes, and trying to get a head start on her research proposal, she barely had time to breathe. But if she was being honest with herself, the moments she did have to breathe? She spent them thinking about a certain professor with piercing blue eyes and an unreadable expression.</p><p>Which was ridiculous.</p><p>She blamed it on the exhaustion.</p><p>Or the fact that she’d seen Agatha—Dr. Harkness—at her most vulnerable, something most people probably never had. That had to be it. The memory of holding her hand in the hospital, reassuring her that Nicky was okay, wasn’t something she could just forget.</p><p>And yet, despite all her rationalizing, there was something about Agatha that just kept pulling her in, kept her intrigued, and it was something she couldn’t quite define.</p><p>But Rio didn’t have time to dwell on that right now.</p><p>She walked into the lecture hall a few minutes early, sipping on what was probably her third coffee of the day, and scanned the empty room for a decent seat. She preferred sitting toward the middle—not too close to the front where professors could single you out, but not too far in the back where she might be tempted to zone out.</p><p>As soon as she put her things down on her desk, her gaze traveled toward the front of the room, where Agatha was setting up her laptop and notes, apparently having just walked in. She looked as put-together as ever, clad in another navy blue blazer, but Rio wasn’t fooled. She could see the subtle signs of exhaustion as Agatha busied herself turning on her laptop. The faint lines around her eyes, the way she rolled her shoulder slightly as if trying to shake off tension.</p><p>She wondered if she’d been getting enough sleep.</p><p>Before she could stop herself, Rio found her feet moving.</p><p>“What, no dramatic entrance today?” She said casually as soon as she approached the front of the lecture hall.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up at the sound of her voice, and for just a second, something flickered in her expression before she schooled it back into neutrality.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” she greeted smoothly, straightening. “You’re early. That’s surprising.”</p><p>Rio smirked, settling in one of the chairs at the front row. “Guess I’m just full of surprises.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a dry look. “How fortunate for us all.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, taking another sip of coffee before nodding toward Agatha’s laptop. “You ready to convince us all to go into neurology today?”</p><p>Agatha hummed, crossing her arms, but when she spoke, her tone carried a hint of teasing. “If you still require convincing, perhaps you’re in the wrong place.”</p><p>“Touché.” Rio tilted her head. “For the record, I don’t need convincing. Neurology’s my main interest. Always has been.”</p><p>That, at least, seemed to catch Agatha’s attention. “Is that so?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio nodded, stretching her legs out a bit. “Like I said last week, you know? Been wanting to focus my research on Alzheimer’s. My grandmother had early-onset. It was really bad. So it’s, uh… it’s a personal thing. You know?”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, something shifting in her expression—something Rio couldn’t quite place. Then, with a hint of a smile, she said, “A noble pursuit.”</p><p>It was such a simple response, but something about the way she said it made Rio feel seen. Like finally someone was willing to listen to her about this.</p><p>Before she could think too hard about that, Agatha’s gaze flicked back to the podium, and her professional demeanor took over once more.</p><p>“I actually had a chance to read your proposal,” Agatha said casually after a beat, her tone betraying a slight edge of approval. “Impressive work. You’ve clearly put a lot of thought into it.”</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised, a flush creeping up her neck. “Oh, uh—thanks. Yeah, I submitted it early last week.” She paused, hoping her voice didn’t sound as nervous as it felt. “I figured I should get ahead of it, you know, since it’s a topic I’m passionate about.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a small nod. “Well, it shows. Alzheimer’s research is vital, especially with the rising prevalence of early-onset cases. It’s always good to see more students interested in investigating it further.”</p><p>Rio smiled, but she didn’t trust herself to say much more. Something about Agatha’s approval—soft as it was—sent a strange warmth through her. But she pushed it down. She didn’t need to read too much into it.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes momentarily flicked to the side, and Rio noticed her rubbing the back of her neck before letting out a sigh. Now that she was sitting in front of her, Rio could see her tiredness even more pronounced.</p><p>Without thinking, she asked, “Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, eyebrows slightly raised. For a moment, there was a flicker of hesitation before Agatha let out a soft sigh, a subtle sign of vulnerability slipping through her professional façade.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, but her voice held an edge of weariness that hadn’t been there before. “Nicky came down with a fever last night. Nothing serious, just a cold, but I stayed up with him most of the night,” She rubbed her temple, as if trying to stave off a headache. “Being a single parent sometimes means not getting the luxury of sleep.”</p><p>Rio nodded, feeling a rush of empathy. She remembered how worried Agatha had been the day of the accident. She’d seen the protective way she looked at Nicky, how much she cared for him.</p><p>“I hope he feels better soon,” Rio said, her voice gentle. “You’re doing an incredible job with him.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a faint, appreciative smile. “Thank you. I try.”</p><p>Before the moment could linger, the rest of the students started filling in, and Agatha quickly transitioned back into her professor mode. The professional wall went up again, but Rio couldn’t help but notice the slight fatigue in her posture.</p><p>As the class went on, Rio found it harder to focus. Her thoughts kept wandering to the conversation they’d just had, the rare glimpse of vulnerability she’d seen in Agatha. It was hard to ignore the pull she felt toward her, even harder to ignore the fact that Agatha had impressed her not just with her work but with the little things—like the way she cared for her son, or the way she handled herself in the face of exhaustion.</p><p>But for now, she pushed it all aside. They both had a lot of work to do.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio was exhausted, but the adrenaline from the day’s calls kept her moving. It had been a busy shift — emergency calls back to back, with barely any time to eat. The moment she got a break, she plopped down onto the worn leather couch in the firehouse’s break room, kicking off her boots and letting out a long sigh.</p><p>Alice Wu, her best friend and a firefighter, grabbed the spot beside her, not missing the chance to snatch the bag of chips Rio had left half-open on the coffee table.</p><p>“You look like you’re about to collapse,” Alice said, giving Rio a sideways glance.</p><p>“Gee, thanks, friend.” Rio shot her a tired smirk. “I’ve got two hours of sleep in me. I’m fine.”</p><p>“Riiiight. You’ve been working this hard for how many days in a row now?” Alice asked, tossing a chip into her mouth.</p><p>“Too many,” Rio mumbled, closing her eyes for a moment. “But I don’t mind. Keeps me busy. Gives me less time to think.”</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow, clearly picking up on the subtext. “Ah, so it’s not just the calls that have your brain running in overdrive?”</p><p>Rio groaned, rolling her eyes. “I don’t even want to talk about it.”</p><p>“Oh, we’re definitely talking about it,” Alice teased. “Something’s got you distracted. You’ve been acting weird ever since you met your hot professor, Dr. Harkness. What’s going on there?”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily, dropping her head back against the couch. “I don’t know. I’ve been trying to focus on my project and get things together, but… there’s this weird feeling. I can’t shake it. I just want to know if she’ll even take me on as a mentee.”</p><p>Alice leaned forward, eyes narrowing in on Rio. “Wait. You’re still hung up on whether she’s going to mentor you?”</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, the list hasn’t come out yet,” Rio said, running a hand through her hair. “And you know, it’s been a couple of weeks already. I don’t know if she’ll even choose me. What if I’m not what she’s looking for?”</p><p>Alice frowned slightly, though her voice stayed teasing. “You’re overthinking this. You’ve already shown her your research proposal, right? And I’m pretty sure she’s impressed. She’d be lucky to have you as a mentee.”</p><p>Rio gave her a skeptical look. “You think so?”</p><p>“Definitely,” Alice said, giving her a firm nod. “I’ve heard things about this Dr. Harkness from Jen, you know. She was in your professor’s class a couple of years ago, and she says Dr. Harkness usually goes for students that show real drive and passion about their research. And I’m pretty sure you’ve shown her how much you want this.”</p><p>“I hope so,” Rio muttered, a little self-conscious. “I mean, she’s Agatha fucking Harkness. Everyone knows how legendary she is. I’m just… me.”</p><p>“You’re you for a reason,” Alice said with a grin. “And if you get chosen, it’ll be because she sees something in you. Trust me. You’re gonna crush it.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, still not entirely convinced, but Alice’s words did make her feel a little better.</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t know,” she let out a breath, shaking her arms as if she could shake these feelings out of her. “I’m nervous. I just want to know if she’ll take me on. But I also don’t want to push it and make things weird.”</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow. “Weird how?”</p><p>Rio groaned, sinking lower into the couch. “I don’t know, okay? I’m nervous. I can’t just casually ask her about it. It’ll make it way too obvious.”</p><p>Alice leaned back with a knowing look. “And there it is. You’re not just worried about the mentee thing, are you?”</p><p>Rio froze. “What?”</p><p>Alice grinned, unbothered by Rio’s sudden discomfort. “You’re nervous because it’s not just about the research. You <em>like</em> her, don’t you?”</p><p>Rio’s stomach flipped at the question, and she quickly deflected with a forced chuckle. “I just want to get the research done, okay? Can we talk about something else?”</p><p>But Alice wasn’t backing down. “Come on, Rio. I’ve known you forever. You can’t hide shit from me. You’re into her. You’ve got that look on your face, and every time you mention Dr. Harkness, your voice does this weird thing.”</p><p>Rio’s face flushed, and she buried her face in her hands. “It’s not like that. I just… I don’t know what I’m feeling. And I’m definitely not about to go around asking my professor if she’s into women.”</p><p>“Well, you’re not going to know unless you do,” Alice said, leaning in with a playful grin. “Maybe she’s into you too, you know?”</p><p>Rio scoffed, still feeling uncomfortable with where the conversation was heading. “Please, you’re just making assumptions. I don’t even know if she’s into women. I can’t just ask her about that.”</p><p>“Okay, okay. I won’t push you. But just don’t keep avoiding it forever,” Alice said, raising her hands in mock surrender. “You’ll figure it out. I’m sure of it.”</p><p>Rio leaned back on the couch, staring up at the ceiling. “I don’t even know if I can handle it if she doesn’t take me on. I’ll have to find someone else.”</p><p>Alice smirked, tossing another chip into her mouth. “It’ll all work out. But you might want to start figuring out the ‘feelings’ part, too.”</p><p>”Ugh, <em>shut up.</em>” Rio glared at her playfully. “I swear, you’re just here for the drama.”</p><p>“You know it.” Alice grinned.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It felt like the universe was holding its breath when the official list of approved mentees was finally posted. Rio had been checking her email obsessively for the past few days, as if somehow refreshing her inbox would make the results magically appear. But now, with the list in front of her on the university’s portal, her heart was hammering in her chest.</p><p>She leaned in close, trying to steady her breath as she scanned the names. Only five people had been approved.</p><p>And there it was. Her name, near the top of the list.</p><p>
  <em>Rio Vidal.</em>
</p><p>She blinked twice, just to make sure she wasn’t imagining things. But it was there—right under the heading for Agatha Harkness’s mentees.</p><p>Rio felt a mixture of excitement, disbelief, and a tiny pinch of anxiety. She was in. She was going to be working with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Her mind raced. <em>What now? What do I do? Holy shit.</em></p><p>Her hands shook as she quickly closed the page and shoved her phone back into her bag. She needed coffee. Desperately. Maybe a few laps around the campus to walk it off, clear her head, and pretend like she wasn’t about to melt into a puddle of excitement.</p><p>When she got there, the café smelled like roasted coffee beans and fresh pastries, the warmth of the space a welcome contrast to the crisp air outside. Rio stepped up to the counter, her fingers tapping against the strap of her bag as she ordered her usual—black coffee, extra strong.</p><p>Her body was still thrumming with energy, a mix of excitement and nerves. She couldn’t believe it. She was officially one of Agatha Harkness’s mentees. </p><p>Agatha Harkness. </p><p>The thought alone made her heart race, and she had no idea if it was from pure professional admiration or the inconvenient crush she was doing her best to ignore. She was 36 years old. Way past the schoolgirl crush phase. </p><p>Her phone buzzed in her pocket, and she yanked it out, already knowing who it was.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong> </p><p>
  <em>So? Any news yet???</em>

</p><p>
  <em>and try not to combust in front </em>
</p><p>
  <em>of your hot professor.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t stop the laugh that escaped. </p><p>The barista called her name, and she grabbed her coffee, her grip a little tighter than necessary. She needed to walk this off, maybe sit somewhere and let herself process the fact that this was real.</p><p>But then her eyes landed on a familiar figure near the corner of the café.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Seated with a cup of tea in front of her, effortlessly composed as always. The dark blue of her blouse complemented her sharp features, and there was a certain elegance to the way she held her cup, fingers poised just so. It was ridiculous how effortlessly stunning she was.</p><p>For a split second, Rio considered walking the other way. Not because she didn’t want to talk to her—because she did. A little too much, in fact. But she was still buzzing with excitement, and the last thing she wanted was to make a fool of herself.</p><p>But then Agatha looked up, her sharp blue eyes meeting Rio’s with precise timing, as if she’d sensed her presence before even turning her head.</p><p>Rio froze for half a second.</p><p>Then Agatha’s lips curved into the smallest, knowing smile.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, forcing her feet to move. She could do this. She was a professional, damn it.</p><p>“Mind if I join you?” she asked, doing her best to sound casual.</p><p>Agatha gestured to the empty chair across from her. “Please.”</p><p>Rio slid into the seat, wrapping her hands around her coffee cup like it was an anchor.</p><p>“I—uh,” she started, then exhaled sharply and gave herself a mental shake. “I wanted to say thank you. For approving me as a mentee.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, watching her. “You don’t have to thank me. Your proposal was strong.”</p><p>Rio huffed a small laugh. “Still, I won’t pretend I wasn’t refreshing my email every ten minutes waiting for that list to drop.”</p><p>That earned her a slight, amused arch of Agatha’s brow. “I can imagine. It’s a competitive selection.” She tapped the edge of her cup thoughtfully. “But you stood out.”</p><p>The words sent a spark of warmth through Rio’s chest. She cleared her throat. “Well, I promise to make it worth your time.”</p><p>“I don’t doubt that,” Agatha said, then took a sip of her tea.</p><p>Silence stretched for a beat, not uncomfortable, just charged. Rio tried to keep her thoughts in check, but the longer she sat across from Agatha, the harder it was to ignore how striking she was up close.</p><p>She needed to redirect her brain. Fast.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, shifting slightly in her seat, “how’s Nicky? He feeling better?”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened in a way that was almost imperceptible, but Rio caught it. “Yes. Much better, thankfully. He’s back to his usual self—running around, asking far too many questions, and insisting he’s going to be a superhero when he grows up.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Good kid. He’s got the right idea.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “You approve?”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio said easily. “Superheroes save people. Not too different from what I do now.”</p><p>Agatha made a quiet sound—almost like a laugh—but her gaze turned slightly more curious. “Did you always want to be a paramedic?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Not exactly. I mean, I knew I wanted to do something that made a difference. I just took a… longer route to get here.”</p><p>Agatha regarded her for a moment before nodding, as if filing that answer away for later.</p><p>Rio took another sip of coffee, then tilted her head. “And you? Always wanted to be a neurosurgeon?”</p><p>Something flickered across Agatha’s expression—an almost imperceptible hesitation before she answered. “I suppose,” she said. “Though wanting and being expected to are two very different things.”</p><p>Rio caught that, but before she could ask more, Agatha smoothly redirected. “Medicine is demanding, no matter the field. Balancing it with personal life isn’t always easy.”</p><p>There it was. A natural opening.</p><p>Rio leaned back slightly. “Yeah, I bet. Especially for you, with Nicky. Must be tough juggling everything as a single parent.”</p><p>She said it casually, like an observation, but she was watching for a reaction.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “It can be.” She paused, lifting her cup. “But it’s just the two of us. So we manage.”</p><p>Just the two of us.</p><p>Rio filed that information away before smirking. “Well, for what it’s worth, I think you’re doing a hell of a job. Nicky’s a great kid.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her over the rim of her cup, something unreadable in her gaze. But then she nodded, as if conceding. “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio felt the air shift slightly between them. It was subtle, but it was there. And if Agatha noticed it too, she didn’t show it.</p><p>Instead, she set her cup down and said smoothly, “I hope you’re ready for the workload, Rio.”</p><p>Rio blinked at the use of her first name, then grinned. “That’s funny—I was just about to say you can drop the formality and call me Rio.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Then I suppose it’s only fair you call me Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “Deal.”</p><p>The conversation moved forward, but Rio felt it now—the shift. A slow, careful unraveling of whatever this was.</p><p>And she had no idea what she was supposed to do about it.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio stopped in front of Agatha’s office, still feeling the buzz from her cardiology lecture. It had been a long day—class, a rushed lunch, and now this—but despite the exhaustion settling in her bones, anticipation kept her alert. Their first official mentorship meeting. She knocked lightly before stepping inside.</p><p>Agatha was seated at her desk, reading glasses perched on her nose as she flipped through some notes. She looked up at Rio’s entrance, eyes sharp as ever.</p><p>“Rio,” she greeted. “Right on time.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t miss it,” Rio said, lowering herself into the chair across from Agatha’s desk. She was trying not to fidget, but there was something about sitting across from her professor—not just in class, but here, in a setting that felt more intimate—that made her hyper aware of herself.</p><p>Agatha set her notes aside, folding her hands over them. “I had a chance to go through your proposal in more detail. Your approach to studying early-onset Alzheimer’s is ambitious. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction as an early biomarker—have you looked into the studies from UCSF and the Mayo Clinic?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her excitement kicking in. “Yeah. Especially the ones examining how impaired mitophagy—basically, the brain’s ability to clear out damaged mitochondria—correlates with disease progression. UCSF’s recent work with cerebrospinal fluid markers looks promising. If we can reliably track mitochondrial damage in the early stages, we might be able to identify patients at risk before they even show symptoms.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression remained measured, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes—interest, maybe something deeper. “Early intervention is key. If mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the earliest detectable signs, that could open new doors for treatment.”</p><p>“Exactly.” Rio leaned forward slightly. “If we can confirm that mitochondrial stress appears before significant amyloid or tau buildup, it could shift how we diagnose the disease. Right now, PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests mostly detect damage that’s already well underway. But if we catch it earlier, we might be able to intervene before neurodegeneration becomes irreversible.”</p><p>Agatha tapped a thoughtful rhythm against her notes. “Your methodology needs refining, though. Tracking mitochondrial health in living patients is complex—how do you plan to approach that?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “That’s where I was hoping for your insight.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet breath, something like amusement in her eyes. “Clever,” she teased, but instead of immediately moving on to logistics, she tilted her head slightly. “What drew you to this research? Beyond your personal connection.”</p><p>It wasn’t an unexpected question, but the way Agatha asked it—genuine, searching—made Rio pause for a beat before answering.</p><p>“I think…” Rio exhaled, choosing her words carefully. “I’ve always liked puzzles. Neurology is full of them, and Alzheimer’s is one we haven’t solved yet. It’s frustrating, but in a way that makes me want to push harder.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips tilted up, just slightly. “A good answer.”</p><p>Rio felt warmth settle in her chest at the quiet approval. She was about to ask another question when Agatha, almost casually, set her pen down and shifted in her chair.</p><p>“You had a shift last night, didn’t you?”</p><p>The sudden shift in topic caught Rio off guard. “Uh, yeah,” she said, rubbing the back of her neck. “Not too bad, though. A few falls, a dislocated elbow, and one guy who was convinced he was dying of a heart attack but really just overdid it at a buffet.”</p><p>Agatha huffed softly. “That’s quite the range.”</p><p>“You get used to it,” Rio said with a grin. “What about you? Any fires to put out today?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, shaking her head. “Nothing as dramatic. Just students trying to negotiate their grades and an endless stream of emails.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Yeah, I can see how that might be just as exhausting.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a wry look but didn’t disagree.</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment before leaning back slightly in her chair. “I was actually wondering—how do you balance all of this? Teaching, research, surgery, Nicky… seems like a lot.”</p><p>There was a slight pause, just enough for Rio to catch it.</p><p>Agatha’s expression remained composed, but there was something quieter in her voice when she answered, “I manage.”</p><p>Rio nodded, choosing her next words carefully. “Must be nice to have people to lean on when things get overwhelming.” She kept her tone light, but she was watching Agatha closely now.</p><p>Agatha hummed, tilting her head. “I have my friends, of course.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, waiting just a beat.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, then pressed together again, as if choosing her words. “But beyond that, it’s mostly just me and Nicky.”</p><p>That pause again.</p><p>Rio didn’t let the small, ridiculous flicker of satisfaction show on her face. Instead, she just nodded. “Sounds like a full plate.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, a hint of dry amusement in her voice. “That’s one way to put it.”</p><p>For a brief moment, there was a comfortable silence between them. Then Agatha tapped her fingers against the desk once. “Alright, Ms. Vidal. Back to work.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Right. Research first, personal life later.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a knowing look, but there was a ghost of a smile on her lips before she picked up her pen again.</p><p>Maybe this mentorship was going to be even more interesting than she thought.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <p>Agatha had barely poured her coffee when she heard the thunder of small feet barreling down the hall.</p><p>“Mom! Are you ready? We have to go!”</p><p>Nicky skidded to a stop in the kitchen, half-dressed, socks mismatched, and his hair an absolute disaster. His eyes were bright with excitement, practically vibrating where he stood.</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow over the rim of her mug. “You’re the one who isn’t ready.”</p><p>Nicky looked down at himself, then back up at her with a sheepish grin. “I got distracted.”</p><p>“By what?”</p><p>“Dinosaurs.”</p><p>Agatha sighed but couldn’t fight the amused huff that escaped her. “Of course.”</p><p>She took another sip of coffee as Nicky darted back to his room, presumably to finish getting dressed, and let herself enjoy the rare quiet of a weekend morning.</p><p>A weekend off. An entire day with just her and Nicky. No lectures, no mentorship meetings, no endless emails, no surgeries.</p><p>And yet—</p><p>She exhaled slowly, rubbing her thumb against the ceramic of her mug. Almost two months. That was how long Rio Vidal had been occupying far too much space in her thoughts.</p><p>At first, she’d told herself it was just because Rio had caught her at a vulnerable moment, and had quite literally saved her that day with the accident. So, you know, it was just gratitude and a healthy dose of drugs when she was basically thirsting over her in the hospital. Plus, she was really good with Nicky too, and had been so caring with him on the day of the accident. She’d become his personal hero.</p><p>Then, as the days went by and she discovered Rio was her student, she took her incessant thoughts about her to be just about professional interest. Rio was sharp, ambitious, and capable—Agatha had mentored enough students to recognize potential when she saw it.</p><p>But this wasn’t that.</p><p>It wasn’t just admiration. It wasn’t just interest in Rio’s work.</p><p>It was something else. Something less defined, something she hadn’t had the patience – or courage – to untangle.</p><p>Because if she did—if she acknowledged what exactly this fixation meant—then she’d have to face the fact that it wasn’t going away.</p><p>And that was not something she was prepared to do.</p><p>“Okay, I’m ready!”</p><p>Nicky appeared again, this time properly dressed, his coat only half-buttoned in his rush. Agatha set down her coffee, shaking off her thoughts, and grabbed her own coat.</p><p>“Then let’s go,” she said, and Nicky whooped as he ran ahead, already out the door before she could lock up.</p><p>~*~</p><p>A few hours later, Agatha found herself at the Museum of Science and Industry with Nicky. It was one of her son’s favorite spots in the city and she loved that he was so fascinated with science. In fact, he was so much like her when she was at that age — bright eyed, curious and eager to learn — with the exception that Nicky didn’t have the weight of her mother’s expectations on his shoulders, like she did as a child. And that was a blessing.</p><p>It was the sound of laughter—loud, bright, familiar—that made Agatha pause.</p><p>She and Nicky had been wandering through the exhibits for over an hour, stopping whenever something caught his interest. Right now, they were near the giant heart display, where Nicky had insisted on going through the maze-like structure twice, narrating every step like he was on some grand expedition.</p><p>But now, Agatha turned her head, drawn toward the sound.</p><p>And there they were.</p><p>Rio and another woman—shorter than her student, Asian, with red streaks in her hair, a sharp grin on her face as she said something that had Rio laughing, head tipped back slightly, body leaning into the motion.</p><p>It was strange, seeing Rio like this—off-duty, at ease. Not exhausted from an overnight shift, not focused on research or classwork. Just… being.</p><p>Nicky spotted them before Agatha could even process what to do with this encounter.</p><p>“Ms. Rio!”</p><p>And then he was off, sprinting toward her before Agatha could stop him.</p><p>Rio turned just in time to catch the incoming blur of energy in the form of her 8-year-old son. She let out a surprised laugh as Nicky launched himself at her, wrapping his arms around her waist.</p><p>“Hey, buddy!” she said, crouching down to ruffle his hair. “Didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p>Agatha followed at a more measured pace, schooling her expression into neutrality.</p><p>Rio straightened, her lips twitching into a smirk. “Professor,” she greeted, something teasing in her tone. “We keep running into each other. Starting to think it’s fate.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Or just probability.”</p><p>The woman beside Rio raised an eyebrow, glancing between them before sticking her hands in her jacket pockets. Rio looked at her friend, and Agatha caught her rolling her eyes for a brief moment, as if there was some kind of inner joke she wasn’t in on. “Alice, this is Dr. Harkness. She’s my Neurology professor.”</p><p>Alice’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh. The mentor.”</p><p>Agatha caught the emphasis and the way Rio shot Alice a warning look, but she decided—for now—not to address it. Instead, she turned her attention to Alice and inclined her head slightly. “And you are?”</p><p>“Alice Wu,” Alice said, offering her hand. “I work with Rio at the firehouse.”</p><p>Agatha shook it briefly, nodding. “Pleasure.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “Likewise.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Nicky was still bouncing on his feet. “Ms. Rio, we’re looking at the heart exhibit! Have you seen it?”</p><p>“Dude, you can definitely call me Rio. And yeah,” Rio said, crouching again so they were at eye level. “It’s one of my favorites. The circulation maze is fun, right?”</p><p>“Uh-huh! I did it twice. I bet I could do it faster than you.”</p><p>Rio gasped dramatically. “Big words, little dude.”</p><p>Alice hummed. “Oh, now you have to prove yourself.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, watching them. She had always known Nicky was fond of Rio, but seeing them like this—how easily he gravitated toward her, how naturally Rio responded—was different.</p><p>And the worst part was, Agatha didn’t mind it.</p><p>She should suggest they go their separate ways. This was a chance encounter, nothing more.</p><p>But when Nicky tugged on Rio’s hand, already talking a mile a minute about the next exhibit, Agatha found herself saying nothing at all.</p><p>Eventually – after an hour of Nicky dragging Rio around the museum and her student just following him around, looking amused – they ended up at the museum café, settling at a small table with coffee and snacks. Nicky, still buzzing with excitement, had claimed Alice’s attention, proudly telling her about his collection of pressed pennies from various museum machines. Alice, to her credit, played along, listening attentively</p><p>Which left Agatha and Rio, for the first time, with a moment alone.</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of her coffee, watching Rio over the rim of her cup. “You’re good with him,” she noted.</p><p>Rio glanced toward Nicky, who was now excitedly explaining the mechanics of a penny press. “Yeah, well. I’ve had practice.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”</p><p>Rio smirked, shifting in her chair. “I’m the youngest of four. Between my brothers and my sister, I’ve got six nieces and nephews.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Six?”</p><p>“Mm-hmm.” Rio popped a grape from her snack pack into her mouth. “Two of them are still toddlers. One just started kindergarten. The rest are already convinced they know more than me.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a small laugh. “That does explain a lot.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a pointed look. “You talk to Nicky like you actually enjoy it. Most adults tolerate children at best.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “First of all, kids are hilarious. Second, they’re way less exhausting than most adults. They tell you exactly what they’re thinking. No bullshit.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, glancing toward Nicky, who was now gesturing wildly as Alice pretended to be deeply impressed. “I suppose you have a point.”</p><p>Rio took another sip of her coffee, then grinned. “What about you? Were you always the responsible one, or were you a menace as a kid?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a dry look. “I was a delight, thank you very much.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Yeah, sure.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, though there was a flicker of something more complicated behind her expression. “I didn’t have much room to be anything else.”</p><p>There was something in her tone that made Rio pause. She studied Agatha, the sharp edges of her usual demeanor softened just slightly.</p><p>“Guess that explains why you’re so good at keeping everyone else in check,” Rio said, her voice light but thoughtful.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, tilting her head. “And here I thought that was just my natural charm.”</p><p>Rio smirked, but before she could fire back, Nicky’s voice cut in.</p><p>“Mom! Can we get more pennies?”</p><p>Agatha turned toward him, already reaching for her purse. “One more. That’s it.”</p><p>Nicky cheered and dragged Alice back toward the machine.</p><p>Rio watched them go, then leaned back in her chair, glancing at Agatha again. “You know, for someone who claims not to spoil him…”</p><p>Agatha huffed, unable to hide a smile. “Don’t even.”</p><p>Rio just grinned. After a beat, she asked. “So what was little Agatha like as a kid?”</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of her coffee, choosing her words carefully. “There’s not much to tell.”</p><p>Rio didn’t push, but she was watching Agatha closely, something patient and steady in her gaze.</p><p>Agatha exhaled quietly, glancing toward Nicky, who was still grinning as Alice helped him feed another penny into the press. “I suppose… most people know my mother’s name.”</p><p>Rio’s brows lifted slightly, but she didn’t interrupt.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness,” Agatha said, rolling the name over her tongue like something foreign, but saw the flicker of recognition in Rio’s eyes. “World-renowned neurosurgeon. Pioneer in pediatric neurosurgery. Brilliant. Respected.” She let out a quiet breath. “And impossible.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Impossible how?”</p><p>Agatha turned her coffee cup in her hands, watching the way the light caught the ceramic. “She demanded perfection. In everything. Orders were given, and they were to be followed. No exceptions.”</p><p>Rio stayed quiet, listening.</p><p>“For a long time, I did exactly what she expected. Got the best grades, went to the best schools, built the career she had mapped out for me.” Agatha’s lips curved slightly, but there was no real amusement in it. “But then I did something that wasn’t in her plan.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened. “You had Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “When I was suddenly pregnant, she told me I was throwing everything away. That I couldn’t be a single mother and still be excellent.” A sharp exhale. “I told her I’d rather be a mother than be excellent by her definition.”</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>Rio’s voice was quiet when she finally spoke. “And that was it?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tensed slightly around her cup. “We haven’t spoken since. She doesn’t even know him. Said she had no interest in meeting the one thing that would ruin everything she’d worked so hard for me to accomplish. Like my life was her accomplishment, not my own.”</p><p>It wasn’t something she talked about often. Not even with Wanda, who had been there for the fallout. And yet, here she was, telling Rio Vidal of all people.</p><p>What was it about this woman that made Agatha want to let her guard down?</p><p>Before she could dwell on it, she felt something warm cover her hand.</p><p>She looked down, startled, as Rio’s fingers rested lightly over hers.</p><p>It wasn’t much. Barely even a touch. But the warmth of it settled deep, catching her off guard.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything at first. She just let it sit there, a quiet offering of understanding.</p><p>And Agatha—who was so used to standing alone, to holding everything together with sheer force of will—found herself not pulling away.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them moved. Agatha wasn’t sure why she did it—maybe it was curiosity, maybe it was something deeper, something she wasn’t ready to name—but before she could think better of it, she turned her palm up beneath Rio’s.</p><p>The shift was small, but it changed everything.</p><p>Rio’s fingers hesitated for only a second before settling against Agatha’s, their palms meeting properly for the first time since the hospital. Back then, Agatha had been too dazed, too exhausted to think much of it. But now… now she was acutely aware of the warmth of Rio’s skin, the roughness of her fingertips, the steady pressure of a hand that was used to saving lives.</p><p>The contact lingered—not deliberate, not hesitant, just there, as if neither of them saw a reason to move away.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to clear her throat, needing something to ground herself. “So, six nieces and nephews,” she said, a touch wry, though her voice was softer than she intended. “That explains why you’re good with kids.”</p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, the corner of her mouth twitching up. “Yeah. Being the youngest of four means I was basically raised in chaos. Lots of babysitting, lots of scraped knees, and a deeply ingrained ability to negotiate with a five-year-old over bedtime.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “And yet, you still chose to go into emergency medicine. Glutton for punishment much?”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely,” Rio said with a grin. “But hey, at least my patients don’t throw tantrums over not getting the blue cup at dinner.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, her thumb brushing absentmindedly over the side of Rio’s hand. “You’d be surprised.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head, but she didn’t pull away. If anything, her fingers curled slightly, almost instinctively, as if holding Agatha’s hand was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>And the strangest part?</p><p>Agatha let her.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Their conversation flowed easily. But at some point, the casual touch changed. For a moment, Agatha wasn’t sure when their hands had shifted.</p><p>Rio’s fingers had begun a slow, absentminded movement, tracing the lines of Agatha’s palm, gliding up along her wrist before curling lightly around her own fingers. It wasn’t intentional—not really. It felt like a thoughtless habit, the way someone might fidget with a pen or toy with the hem of a sleeve. But it was Rio’s fingertips dancing against her skin, and Agatha could feel every deliberate, unhurried stroke.</p><p>She wasn’t even sure if Rio realized she was doing it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop her.</p><p>She should have.</p><p>Instead, she found herself caught in something weightless, something fragile—like they had slipped into a space that existed outside of reality. The distant hum of the café, the occasional bursts of laughter from other patrons, the sound of her own child’s voice somewhere across the room—it all felt muffled. Like a dream she wasn’t fully awake from.</p><p>She forced herself to focus on Rio’s words, anchoring herself.</p><p>“So why now?” Agatha asked, her voice softer than she’d meant. “Med school, I mean. Why wait?”</p><p>Rio exhaled, her fingers still lazily skimming over Agatha’s palm. “A lot of reasons,” she admitted. “Didn’t have the money, for one. And I guess I just didn’t have the drive.”</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly, watching Rio’s expression shift—not guarded, but thoughtful.</p><p>Rio let out a small, humorless laugh. “I always wanted to do it, but when my grandmother died… it just felt like too much. Like, what was the point? I was exhausted, grieving, and the idea of spending another decade in school felt impossible.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, just let Rio talk.</p><p>“She died seven years ago.” Rio’s voice was steady, but her fingers tightened briefly around Agatha’s own before resuming their slow movement. “And for a while, I just convinced myself that being a paramedic was enough. That I was still helping people. That I didn’t need more than that.”</p><p>Agatha’s thumb moved, just slightly, brushing against the inside of Rio’s wrist.</p><p>Rio inhaled. “But then I started thinking about… genetics. About what happens if my mom…” She trailed off, shaking her head. “That’s what finally pushed me. The idea that maybe, just maybe, I could help figure this thing out before it’s too late.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond immediately. She just let the words settle between them, the weight of them heavy in the space they’d created.</p><p>She understood it—more than Rio probably realized.</p><p>For the first time since this had started, Agatha let herself move. Her fingers flexed slightly beneath Rio’s, then turned, shifting just enough to let her fingertips skim against the inside of Rio’s palm. It was barely anything, a whisper of contact, but she felt Rio react—just the smallest hitch in her breath, just the way her fingers stilled for half a second before continuing their slow, languid tracing.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know what they were doing.</p><p>Didn’t know why she wasn’t pulling away.</p><p>But she wasn’t.</p><p>And neither was Rio.</p><p>The moment stretched, a strange, delicate thing neither of them seemed willing to break.</p><p>Then—</p><p>“Mama! Look, I got a dinosaur!”</p><p>The bubble shattered.</p><p>Agatha and Rio jerked apart so fast it was almost comical, hands retreating as if burned.</p><p>Nicky came barreling toward them, clutching a small stuffed dinosaur in his hands, his face alight with excitement. Right behind him, Alice strolled at a much more casual pace, one brow quirked as she took them in.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what she and Rio looked like just then, but whatever it was had Alice’s lips twitching in an attempt to hold in a laugh.</p><p>“Hey, Professor,” Alice greeted easily. “Hope we’re not interrupting anything.”</p><p>Agatha smoothed her hands against her lap, schooling her expression. “Not at all.”</p><p>Beside her, Rio cleared her throat, reaching for her coffee like it might ground her.</p><p>Alice’s smirk deepened just a fraction.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at Rio.</p><p>And she definitely didn’t think about the way her palm still tingled.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha had spent the entire weekend trying to rationalize what had happened in that café.</p><p>She was a woman of logic, of carefully constructed barriers, of rules she did not break. And yet, the moment Rio Vidal had started tracing lazy, absentminded circles over her palm, she had not stopped her. Had not even wanted to.</p><p>That was the problem.</p><p>She could have chalked it up to the setting—to the quiet space they’d carved for themselves, to the way Rio had been so open, so achingly honest about why she’d finally taken the leap into medical school. It would have been easy to convince herself that it was just the weight of that conversation, just a brief lapse in her usual control.</p><p>Except she couldn’t stop thinking about it.</p><p>About how it had felt—those feather-light touches, the warmth of Rio’s skin against hers, the way neither of them had pulled away.</p><p>About how much she had liked it.</p><p>And now, as she stepped into her lecture hall early Monday morning, she was still trying to decide what the hell she was supposed to do about it.</p><p>She had expected to have a few quiet moments to collect herself before class. To center her thoughts, to shake off whatever lingering haze had followed her through the weekend.</p><p>Instead, she stepped inside and found Rio already there.</p><p>Sitting at one of the desks near the front, elbows propped on the surface, scrolling idly through her phone.</p><p>For once, she did not look exhausted.</p><p>Her uniform of exhaustion—dark circles, weary eyes, the telltale signs of someone who lived in a constant state of overwork—was absent. Instead, she was well-rested, fully alert, and wearing a loose, easy expression that Agatha didn’t think she’d ever seen on her before.</p><p>For a brief moment, Agatha was frozen in the doorway.</p><p>As if Rio’s presence had thrown her off completely.</p><p>She wasn’t sure why she was surprised. Rio was an excellent student. Of course she would be early. Of course she would take this mentorship seriously.</p><p>Except—</p><p>There was something about the way Rio looked up and met her eyes. The way her mouth curled just slightly, like she had been waiting for her.</p><p>Something had shifted.</p><p>They both knew it.</p><p>“Professor,” Rio greeted, voice light. She pocketed her phone and stretched her arms over her head before settling in her chair. “Fancy meeting you here.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, shaking off whatever ridiculous awareness had settled in her bones. She strode toward her desk, setting her materials down with deliberate ease. “Ms. Vidal. You’re early.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Figured I’d get here before the chaos.”</p><p>There was something almost too casual in the way she said it.</p><p>Agatha gave her a measured look. “Did you need something?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, considering. Then, with the same easy confidence that had undone Agatha in that café, she said, “Just wanted to say good morning.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled slightly against her desk.</p><p>It was so simple. So casual. And yet, it carried the weight of something more.</p><p>She should have said something dismissive. Should have moved the conversation away from whatever charged undercurrent had begun to take root between them.</p><p>Instead, her mouth betrayed her.</p><p>“Good morning,” she murmured, softer than she’d meant.</p><p>Rio’s smirk lingered as she leaned back in her chair, stretching her long legs out in front of her. “You know, I think that’s the first time you’ve ever greeted me back,” she said, amusement threading through her voice. “You know, with actual words.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, ignoring the way something in her chest tightened at the statement. “I wasn’t aware you were keeping track.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, all easy confidence. “I notice things.”</p><p>That much was obvious.</p><p>Agatha busied herself with organizing her lecture notes, but her gaze flickered to Rio again, noting—now that it had been pointed out—just how different she looked.</p><p>“Your weekend off must have been good,” she said, keeping her tone neutral. “You actually look well-rested for once.”</p><p>Rio let out a short laugh. “It’s been so long since I got a full eight hours, I almost didn’t know what to do with myself.”</p><p>Agatha hummed. “I imagine it was a nice change.”</p><p>“It was,” Rio admitted. “Didn’t have to deal with anyone bleeding, panicking, or throwing up on me. Pretty rare.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, flipping open her notebook. “I assume you’re talking about your patients and not your coworkers.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I plead the fifth.”</p><p>The corner of Agatha’s mouth twitched despite herself. There was an ease between them, an effortless rhythm that she wasn’t sure how to navigate. She knew she should put some distance between them—re-establish boundaries, remind herself that this was a student-teacher relationship, nothing more.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Her gaze flickered to Rio again, to the relaxed way she sat, to the way she was watching Agatha with that same quiet amusement, like she knew something Agatha didn’t.</p><p>Before she could think of a way to redirect the conversation, the sound of the lecture hall door opening broke the moment.</p><p>Students started trickling in, the spell between them dissipating as the room filled with noise.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, straightening her posture. “Looks like your moment of peace is over, Ms. Vidal.”</p><p>Rio pushed herself up, rolling her shoulders. “Guess so.” But just before she moved to her usual seat, she shot Agatha a look, something teasing but thoughtful. “Good talk, Professor.”</p><p>And then, just like that, she was gone, slipping back into the sea of students as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath, forcing her focus back onto her notes.</p><p>Yes. This was going to be a very, very long semester.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The library was quieter than usual for this time of day, a rare pocket of peace amid the usual academic chaos. Agatha hadn’t planned on stopping—she was only passing through after a meeting—but the sight of a familiar figure slumped over a study table made her pause.</p><p>Rio Vidal sat with her elbows braced on the desk, fingers buried in her dark hair, a deep frown creasing her brow as she stared at her laptop screen like it had personally offended her. A thick nephrology textbook lay open beside her, pages marked with a mess of sticky notes, and a mostly empty coffee cup perched precariously near the edge of the table.</p><p>Agatha hesitated. She should keep walking. She should pretend she hadn’t seen Rio and go on with her evening.</p><p>But then Rio let out a deep, frustrated groan and dropped her head onto the desk with a soft thud.</p><p>Agatha sighed, already regretting her decision as she crossed the distance between them.</p><p>“I doubt that’s helping your paper write itself,” she said dryly.</p><p>Rio’s head shot up, eyes widening slightly before she exhaled, a slow, tired grin pulling at her lips. “Professor.” She leaned back in her chair, stretching her arms overhead with a low groan. “Didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p>“I was on my way out,” Agatha said, glancing down at the mess of notes and the barely blinking cursor on Rio’s laptop screen. “But judging by the look of things, you’re not having a productive evening.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “That’s an understatement.” She rubbed her hands over her face, slumping in her chair. “I swear, I’ve rewritten this thing a dozen times, and it still sounds like garbage. The pathophysiology section is killing me.”</p><p>Agatha pulled out the chair across from her and sat, crossing one leg over the other. “Nephrology?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. Paper’s due tomorrow, and my brain is refusing to cooperate.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, the tension in her shoulders, the way she kept absently rubbing at her temples. “When was the last time you ate something?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Uh.”</p><p>“That’s what I thought.” Agatha shook her head. “No wonder your brain isn’t cooperating.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Didn’t realize you were adding mother hen to your list of titles, Professor.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’d simply prefer not to deal with one of my mentees passing out from sheer stubbornness.”</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh but didn’t argue. Instead, she leaned forward, resting her arms on the table. “You ever had this problem? The whole staring at a paper until your soul leaves your body thing?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “More times than I can count.”</p><p>Rio grinned, like she’d won something. “So even the great Agatha Harkness struggled with deadlines.”</p><p>“I was a student once, Rio.”</p><p>Rio hummed, a teasing lilt in her voice. “Hard to imagine.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, but there was a small, begrudging smile tugging at her lips. Before she could redirect the conversation, Rio ran a hand through her curls, exhaling slowly.</p><p>“I just want to get this right,” she admitted. “I keep thinking about how I wasted so much time before med school, and now that I’m here, I can’t afford to screw it up.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened. “You didn’t waste time,” she said.</p><p>Rio let out a breathy chuckle. “Tell that to all the years I spent not doing this.”</p><p>“You had your reasons.” Agatha hesitated, then leaned forward slightly. “And you’re here now. That’s what matters.”</p><p>Rio met her gaze, something shifting in her expression, something unreadable. And then, almost absentmindedly, she reached across the table, fingertips brushing lightly over the back of Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>It wasn’t a deliberate touch, nothing calculated. Just a soft, fleeting press of warmth.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio murmured, letting her touch linger.</p><p>Neither of them moved.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure who shifted first—who turned their hands just slightly, so their fingers met properly—but suddenly, they were there, touching in a way that felt neither accidental nor entirely intentional. Just… natural.</p><p>Rio’s thumb traced the edge of Agatha’s knuckles, barely there.</p><p>Agatha inhaled, slow and steady, and curled her fingers just slightly in response.</p><p>For a moment, the library, the paper, the looming deadlines—all of it faded into the background.</p><p>Rio was watching her, that easy confidence tempered by something quieter.</p><p>“I should let you work,” Agatha murmured, though she didn’t move.</p><p>Rio exhaled a small laugh, fingers lingering a second longer before finally, gently, pulling away. “Yeah. Probably.”</p><p>The moment passed, slipping between them like something delicate, but not lost.</p><p>Agatha stood, smoothing out her coat, before reaching into her purse and fishing out a granola bar. “Eat, Ms. Vidal. Your paper will be better for it.”</p><p>“Yes, Professor,” Rio accepted the snack, grinning as she saluted lazily.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t bother fighting the smile as she turned and walked away.</p><p>She was in so much trouble.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The next day, Agatha wasn’t expecting to run into Rio again so soon. She had just finished reviewing some notes in her office when she decided to step outside for some air, letting the crisp afternoon cool her mind before her next lecture.</p><p>She had barely made it a few steps down the hallway when she heard a familiar voice behind her.</p><p>“Professor.”</p><p>Agatha turned just as Rio fell into step beside her, a fresh wave of energy in her stride that was a stark contrast to the exhausted student she’d seen last night.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal.” Agatha gave her a once-over, noting the clear eyes, the relaxed posture. “I take it you survived your nephrology paper?”</p><p>“Barely,” Rio said, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “But it’s done. And now I’m officially free for the rest of the day.”</p><p>Agatha lifted a brow. “No shift?”</p><p>“No shift,” Rio confirmed, almost savoring the words. “For once, I actually get to do the whole normal student thing. You know—go to class, complain about class, eat something other than gas station snacks…”</p><p>Agatha huffed, amused. “Sounds revolutionary.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Right? And speaking of food—” She shot Agatha a casual glance, like this was nothing, like this was normal. “I was thinking of grabbing something to eat. You want to join?”</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>It was so… easy.</p><p>Not a request, not a deliberate invitation. Just a simple, almost offhanded suggestion, like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>And maybe it shouldn’t have felt so natural. But it did.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a beat too long, and Rio, catching it, smirked. “I promise it’s not a trap. Just food. I wouldn’t dream of making you socialize against your will.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head. “That’s reassuring.”</p><p>Rio didn’t push. She just walked beside her, easy and comfortable, waiting.</p><p>And Agatha—who had spent far too long ignoring whatever was happening between them—found herself saying, “Fine. But if the food is terrible, I’m blaming you.”</p><p>Rio beamed. “I can live with that.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure when exactly she had stopped fighting this.</p><p>Maybe she hadn’t. Maybe she was still pretending she had a choice.</p><p>But for now, she let herself walk with Rio, step for step, down the hall.</p><p>Once they were outside, Agatha checked her phone as they walked, quickly typing out a message to Wanda.</p><p align="right">
  <strong>
    <em>Agatha</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>Can you pick up Nicky from school </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>and keep him for a bit? I’ll owe you.</em>
</p><p align="left">The response was almost immediate.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Wanda</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Wow. Dr. Harkness is letting loose? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>This I have to see.</em>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smirked, typing back.</p><p align="right">
  <strong>
    <em>Agatha</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>Don’t be dramatic. It’s just food.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Wanda</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Suuure. Just food. Tell your “just food” I said hi.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha locked her phone before Rio could catch her smiling.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, glancing over. “You trust Wanda with Nicky?”</p><p>“With my life,” Agatha said simply. “And his.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “You two go way back, huh?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Since college. We met in our first year, and somehow, she managed to tolerate me long enough that we’re still friends.”</p><p>“Tolerate you?” Rio echoed, teasing. “That sounds dramatic.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a dry look. “Wanda would agree with you. She claims I was insufferable.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I refuse to believe that.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “You’d be surprised.” She exhaled, softening. “She’s Nicky’s godmother. I’m her twins’ godmother as well.”</p><p>Rio’s expression warmed. “That’s nice. You’ve got family that isn’t, you know…” She hesitated, clearly remembering their conversation at the café.</p><p>Agatha nodded once, grateful she didn’t have to elaborate.</p><p>They reached a small deli near campus, the kind of place packed with students during the day but quieter in the late afternoon. They settled into a booth, and Agatha found herself surprised—again—at how easy this was.</p><p>Their food arrived quickly, and their conversation drifted. Rio asked about the twins, and Agatha told her about their chaotic energy, how Wanda claimed they were little geniuses but somehow still managed to get peanut butter on the ceiling. Rio, in turn, told her stories about her own nieces and nephews—about her teenage nephew who thought he knew everything, about her niece who had recently discovered sarcasm and was now unbearable.</p><p>“Sounds like they take after their aunt,” Agatha noted dryly.</p><p>Rio placed a dramatic hand over her heart. “I take offense to that.” </p><p>Agatha merely lifted a brow, and Rio grinned. “Okay, maybe a little.”</p><p>It was easy. That was the problem.</p><p>They tried to keep their distance, but now that the touching had begun, it was impossible to ignore. Agatha’s knee brushed against Rio’s under the table. Rio’s fingers drummed absently on the table, close enough that Agatha could feel the warmth of them. At one point, when Agatha reached for her drink, Rio did the same, their hands colliding for the briefest second.</p><p>And neither of them pulled away quickly.</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>She should be careful. She should.</p><p>But then Rio smirked, tilting her head. “You know, it’s Friday.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “So it is.”</p><p>Rio leaned back, stretching slightly. “And since, for once, I don’t have to work right after class and you don’t have to rush home…” She shot Agatha a look, deceptively casual. “We could take advantage of happy hour.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, just for a second too long.</p><p>Rio caught it, grinning. “It’s just a drink, Professor.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, then—before she could overthink it—sighed. “Fine. But if the drinks are terrible, I’m blaming you.”</p><p>Rio laughed, pushing back from the table. “You’re really big on assigning blame, huh?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, standing as well. “It’s a specialty of mine.”</p><p>They walked out together, too close, their arms brushing. And Agatha, for all her logic and restraint, didn’t move away.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <p>The bar was dimly lit, the kind of place that felt removed from time—warm, but not too loud, with a steady hum of conversation and clinking glasses. It wasn’t packed yet, just a few people scattered at tables, some at the bar nursing drinks.</p><p>Rio let Agatha pick where to sit, and maybe that was a mistake because Agatha chose a corner booth. An L-shaped one. Which meant they weren’t side by side, but they weren’t across from each other either, more like in a perpendicular angle. Rio was going to die.</p><p>She kept her expression neutral as she slid in after Agatha, the leather seat cool under her hands. The distance between them wasn’t much. If she shifted even slightly, she could—</p><p>No. She needed to relax.</p><p>A server appeared, and Agatha ordered an Old Fashioned, because of course she did. Rio went for a whiskey sour, and then they were alone again.</p><p>The air felt charged. Or maybe that was just her.</p><p>“So,” Agatha said, turning slightly toward her. “How long have you been a paramedic anyway?”</p><p>“About ten years,” Rio said, glad for the familiar subject. “Didn’t exactly have the grades or the money for med school right away, but I still wanted to do something in the field.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, considering. “And now?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Now I know I made the right call. I don’t think I’d be as good at this if I hadn’t done that first.”</p><p>Their drinks arrived, and Rio took a sip before continuing. “It changes you, being out there. You see things firsthand that you don’t get in a classroom.”</p><p>Agatha studied her. “And Alice? How did that happen?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “She bullied me into friendship.”</p><p>Agatha lifted a brow, amused.</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh. “I met her on my first day at the firehouse. She used to be an EMT before she switched to firefighting, and she was relentless. Kept correcting me, saying I was too careful.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Too careful?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Yeah. I was trying to be super by the book, and Alice was like, ‘You’ll never keep up in the field if you hesitate.’ So she spent the those first few weeks making sure I didn’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. “Sounds like her.”</p><p>Rio eyed her. “You like her already?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, looking down at her drink. “She seems… reliable.”</p><p>“She is,” Rio said. “She’s my person. And my roommate. We’ve been sharing an apartment for the past couple of years, and thankfully we haven’t killed each other yet.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment, running her finger along the rim of her glass. “It’s good to have someone like that.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>It wasn’t much—just a small shift, a tiny movement—but Agatha’s knee brushed against hers. Rio froze, but Agatha didn’t move away.</p><p>Her heart did something stupid.</p><p>She swallowed, forcing herself to stay cool. “What about you?” she asked, voice only slightly strained. “Did you always know you wanted to be a neurosurgeon?”</p><p>Agatha took a measured sip of her drink. “God, no.”</p><p>Rio waited, watching the way Agatha’s fingers traced idle circles on the tabletop.</p><p>There was something there, something weighty in the way Agatha said it. But Rio didn’t push.</p><p>Instead, she let her hand drift—not far, not quite touching, but close enough that if Agatha wanted to close the gap, she could.</p><p>And after a beat, she did.</p><p>Just the lightest press of her fingers against Rio’s. Shy. Hesitant.</p><p>Rio’s brain short-circuited.</p><p>She was freaking out on the inside.</p><p>But she followed Agatha’s lead, just barely hooking her pinky over Agatha’s, grounding herself in that small, impossible point of contact.</p><p>It wasn’t much. It wasn’t anything, really.</p><p>But God, it felt like everything.</p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, seemed unaware of how the air between them had shifted. She took a slow sip of her drink, her eyes on Rio, but her thoughts appeared to be elsewhere, distant for a moment.</p><p>“I was never supposed to be a neurologist,” Agatha said after a beat, her voice carrying an odd weight to it. It wasn’t quite the tone Rio was used to from Agatha—the steady, confident demeanor now giving way to something more reflective. “I mean, neurology was always there, but my mother… she’s a legend in the field. Evanora Harkness. The neurosurgeon. It was always about living up to that, and I was never going to do it, not in her eyes.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her pulse quickening for a moment, but she didn’t interrupt. She already knew about Evanora—Agatha had mentioned her in passing during their previous conversations—but hearing her talk about her, hearing the slight bitterness in her voice, made Rio want to listen more closely.</p><p>“I wanted to be anything but what she was,” Agatha continued, her gaze distant, fingers tracing the lip of her glass again. “I figured I’d go into something else. Anything else. But in the end, neurology… it found me. I realized it wasn’t because of her. It was because it was the only thing that ever really felt like it made sense to me.”</p><p>Rio could hear the conflict in Agatha’s voice, the way she had wrestled with her career, her calling, while trying to escape from her mother’s towering legacy. The complexity of it was like a puzzle to her, one she hadn’t quite figured out, and Rio could relate to that in her own way—though she wasn’t quite sure how yet.</p><p>“I didn’t want to be my mother’s daughter, you know?” Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head, but there was something vulnerable in the laugh, something Rio wasn’t used to seeing from her. “But in the end, it was her field that felt right. It wasn’t about living up to her, it was about finding something I loved. And it’s been the hardest thing to come to terms with.”</p><p>Rio could feel the honesty in Agatha’s words, the rawness that had surfaced just now. She leaned in slightly, an impulse she couldn’t quite ignore. “I get that,” she said quietly. “Not wanting to follow in their footsteps, only to end up realizing that you do. In your own way, of course.”</p><p>Agatha met her gaze then, eyes soft and searching. “How did you know? That neurology was it for you?”</p><p>“I didn’t really know,” Rio admitted, her voice low. “I kind of… stumbled into it. When I lost my grandmother, I knew I couldn’t keep ignoring the signs. It felt like a wake-up call. But I wasn’t sure if I had the strength for it. I just knew I couldn’t live with wondering what could have been. And even then, it still took me years to actually take the leap and start med school.”</p><p>She exhaled, relieved in some odd way to have said it aloud. She hadn’t talked about her grandmother, not like this, with anyone outside of Alice.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond right away, but Rio could feel her eyes on her, like Agatha was taking her in, trying to understand her a little better. The quiet stretch of time between them was charged, both of them aware of the closeness now—of the shared honesty, and of the way their knees remained casually pressed together under the table.</p><p>After a moment, Agatha smiled, but it was more wistful than Rio was used to. “It sounds like you’ve been through a lot to get here,” she said softly, almost like she was talking to herself as much as she was talking to Rio.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “It’s been a ride.” She leaned back in her seat a little, allowing herself the smallest bit of space between them. It was still too much. The tension between them had built up too much to ignore, but she didn’t know how to ease it. It felt like the slightest movement would tip them into something they hadn’t quite defined yet.</p><p>But when Agatha leaned in, her knee brushing lightly against Rio’s again, the proximity was undeniable. Rio felt herself getting lost in it, the steady rhythm of her heartbeat pulsing louder in her ears as she tried to keep it cool, tried to stay calm.</p><p>“You know,” Agatha said after a beat, her voice a little quieter than before, “there are worse ways to spend a Friday night.”</p><p>But her words weren’t dismissive. It wasn’t like she was trying to change the subject or push the conversation away. If anything, it felt like an invitation—one Rio wasn’t sure how to accept.</p><p>Rio smiled softly, the smallest of chuckles escaping her lips as she adjusted her posture, leaning toward Agatha again. “Maybe,” she said, her tone teasing but thoughtful. “But I definitely  don’t mind this.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked slightly in return, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she tilted her head, her fingers brushing against Rio’s again, more purposeful this time.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said, her voice low, but there was something else beneath it, something she didn’t dare put into words. It felt like something was shifting between them, and she wasn’t quite ready to label it. Not yet.</p><p>Rio noticed the subtle hesitation in Agatha’s voice. She didn’t push it, but she didn’t pull back either. She let her hand stay where it was, her fingers brushing gently against Agatha’s wrist. She couldn’t help but notice how natural it felt—how the warmth of Agatha’s skin seemed to match the warmth of the moment.</p><p>The space between them was small now, but not small enough to dismiss the pull that had been there since they first met. Rio’s heart was in her throat, her mind racing as she tried to keep her cool. But with every brush of Agatha’s fingers, it became harder to breathe evenly.</p><p>Agatha’s hand lingered there, barely making contact but undeniably present. Her gaze flickered between Rio’s eyes and her lips, a familiar tension beginning to build in the space around them, like something was on the verge of happening but hadn’t quite yet.</p><p>“So, you really think you’re ready for med school this time?” Agatha asked, her voice a little sharper than she intended. Rio wondered if it was a question she genuinely wanted to know the answer to, or if it was just a way to distract herself from the way her pulse had picked up from the simple, casual touch.</p><p>Rio leaned in a little closer, her breath hitching as she tried to think of anything else besides the fact that Agatha’s fingers were still gently grazing against hers. “I’m… I think so,” she answered, voice almost too soft. “It’s still scary sometimes. Especially with my completely insane hours as an EMT. But it’s like I’ve made my peace with it, you know?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her thumb lightly running over the back of Rio’s hand without thinking. She couldn’t help it. The way their fingers were so naturally aligned—it felt like they had always belonged that way. Her eyes darted to Rio’s, searching for something she couldn’t quite name.</p><p>“Peace with the fact that you’re going to be saving lives?” Agatha’s words were slow, deliberately teasing, but there was a vulnerability in them that only Rio could see.</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “Peace with the fact that I’m doing something that actually matters.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment, taking in the way Rio spoke, the conviction in her words. Rio always had that energy about her—strong, grounded, despite everything she’d been through. It was almost magnetic.</p><p>The conversation lulled for a moment as they shared a quiet moment together, their hands now fully intertwined on the table. Agatha’s fingers began to gently play with Rio’s, tracing the lines of her palm with barely-there movements, testing the waters.</p><p>Rio bit her lip, trying to steady her breath as she allowed Agatha’s touch to linger. She wasn’t sure if it was the whiskey or the proximity or the undeniable connection that had been building for weeks, but there was something about this moment—about being here with Agatha—that felt different. It felt like the edges of something were about to be crossed, but neither of them was willing to be the one to rush it.</p><p>But even as their fingers danced together, neither of them could deny the magnetism that was starting to pull them closer.</p><p>Rio’s heart was pounding, the sensation of Agatha’s fingertips brushing against hers sending a rush through her. She didn’t know how to label this, how to define what was happening. All she knew was that it felt like they were both standing on the edge of something—something big, something scary—but something neither of them was willing to walk away from.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured softly, her voice almost uncertain, as though she needed the reassurance of hearing her name.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened as she met Rio’s eyes, her fingers pausing for a moment as she tried to figure out the words. But all she could manage was a quiet, “Yeah?”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her fingers tightening slightly around Agatha’s, as though the connection between them needed something to hold onto. “I—” She stopped herself, unsure how to continue, unsure if she even wanted to put words to what was happening.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers brushed lightly over Rio’s once more, her thoughts tangled in the sensation of the moment. She pulled her hand back, her voice quieter, more vulnerable than usual.</p><p>“I don’t know what this is,” she admitted, looking down at their hands. “I’ve never… been with a woman before. I don’t really know what I’m doing, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped a beat at the rawness in Agatha’s voice. She didn’t respond immediately, just letting the words hang in the air between them. There was a quiet understanding there—an acknowledgment of how complex this was.</p><p>“I get that,” Rio said softly, her thumb grazing over Agatha’s wrist absentmindedly. “It’s just… I can’t seem to stop myself from wanting to be close to you. I don’t know why. I just—”</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning back against the booth, running a hand through her hair in frustration. “You’re my student, my mentee. This is a complete mess, Rio. I know I’m supposed to be professional, but I can’t help this pull toward you. And that… scares me. I don’t even know how to process any of it.”</p><p>Rio’s heart twisted. She understood, she did. The boundaries, the roles, the complexities—they were all real. But there was something undeniable between them, something that couldn’t be ignored forever.</p><p>“I’m not asking for anything, Agatha. I just—” Rio paused, her own breath catching. “I don’t want you to pull away because of this. I’m just… I just want to be close to you. That’s all.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, conflicted. She knew Rio wasn’t trying to push her into anything. It was just… complicated.</p><p>“You should be focused on your work. This is… I don’t know how this works. I’m your professor, your mentor. I should be setting an example, not feeling… this.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, understanding the gravity of what Agatha was saying. “I know. But maybe we don’t have to figure it all out right now. Maybe… we just acknowledge that something’s there, and we let it be for now.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her eyes locking with Rio’s. There was something in her gaze, something both cautious and hopeful. She didn’t pull her hand away this time, but instead, she let it stay, fingers resting lightly against Rio’s.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Something’s definitely there.”</p><p>They both sat in that quiet understanding, the tension between them thick and palpable. Neither of them knew what would come next, but for that moment, they didn’t need to. There was time to figure it out. For now, the truth of what was between them was enough.</p><p>~*~</p><p>After a couple of hours in that quiet booth, the conversation between Agatha and Rio had shifted from personal stories to more lighthearted, casual banter. The drinks had come and gone, and neither of them had noticed the time slipping by. There was a natural flow to their interaction now, an ease that had settled between them.</p><p>Agatha leaned back, taking a deep breath, her smile soft but genuine. “I don’t even remember the last time I had a conversation that felt like this,” she admitted, her tone light but sincere.</p><p>Rio smiled back, the warmth of the moment sinking in. “I’m glad we could have it. It’s nice… to talk to someone who gets it.”</p><p>The air around them felt easy, almost familiar, as though the world outside had faded into the background. They hadn’t been in a rush, no pressure to move or go anywhere. It was simply two people, in a booth, sharing stories and letting the night unfold naturally.</p><p>But eventually, the evening did draw to a close. Rio glanced down at her phone and realized the time. “I should probably get going,” she said, feeling a reluctance to end the night. “I told Alice I’d be home early and even make dinner. She’ll probably wonder if I’ve disappeared into the abyss.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, standing up with her. “I think you’ve earned the right to disappear into the abyss for a little while. But yeah, I guess we both should. I still need to pick up Nicky.”</p><p>As they made their way toward the door, Agatha hesitated for a moment, then turned to Rio, her expression shifting slightly. “Hey, by the way… next Friday? It’s my birthday.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed slightly, intrigued. “Your birthday?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied, her voice a little lighter, almost bashful. “It’s on Halloween. So, every year, I throw a small get-together the Saturday after, because, you know, Nicky’s all about his sacred trick-or-treating time.” She chuckled, her tone fond as she thought about her son. “Anyway, I was wondering… if you’d like to come by? I mean, it’s nothing big, just a few friends and some food and drinks, but… I’d really like to have you there.”</p><p>Rio felt a rush of warmth flood through her at the invitation, mixed with something deeper, something unfamiliar but undeniably welcome. She hadn’t expected this, but it felt natural. Like Agatha was offering her something important, a chance to step closer into her world.</p><p>“I’d love to,” Rio said without hesitation, a smile tugging at her lips. “I’ll bring something too, if you want. You can’t have a birthday party without something homemade, right?”</p><p>Agatha grinned, her heart lightening in her chest. “That sounds perfect.”</p><p>As they stood at the entrance of the bar, the night still humming in the air around them, Rio felt a small spark of excitement at the thought of Agatha’s invitation. It was a simple thing, but it felt significant—a gesture that wasn’t just about the birthday party, but about something deeper that was beginning to form between them.</p><p>“I’ll make it work with my schedule,” Rio said with a soft smile, her eyes meeting Agatha’s. “Wouldn’t miss it.”</p><p>Agatha’s face softened, her lips curving into a smile. “I’m glad.” She hesitated for a moment, pulling her phone out of her pocket. “Here,” she said, handing it to Rio. “Why don’t you add your number there, and I’ll send you the details later in the week.”</p><p>Rio took the phone with a small, amused smile. “Sure thing.”</p><p>She quickly saved her contact information, and before she handed it back to Agatha, their fingers brushed for a brief, electric moment. Both of them froze for a second, their eyes meeting again. The contact was innocent enough, but it was still… something. Rio’s pulse quickened, her mind swirling with thoughts that she couldn’t quite organize.</p><p>As Agatha took her phone back, the space between them felt suddenly charged, even though they were just standing there, both waiting for the next step.</p><p>Without thinking too much about it, Rio stepped forward, her movements deliberate but hesitant, until she was standing close enough that she could feel the heat radiating from Agatha’s body. For a second, the world seemed to hold its breath, and then, with a gentle confidence, Rio placed a soft, lingering kiss to Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>She pulled back slightly, searching Agatha’s face for any sign of hesitation or discomfort, and asked, her voice low and a little tentative, “Is that okay?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, seemingly stunned at the unexpected intimacy of the gesture. For a moment, she couldn’t quite respond, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she just nodded, the corner of her lips curling up.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said quietly, her voice steady but with a soft edge to it. “It’s more than okay.”</p><p>Rio smiled, the expression lingering with something both content and uncertain. She gave Agatha one last lingering glance before she turned to leave, her steps slow but purposeful as she made her way to her Uber. </p><p>~*~</p><p>On the following Monday, Rio went straight from her chaotic shift to Northwestern, feeling like she had been hit by a bus emotionally. When she got to the lecture hall, thirty minutes before the class was supposed to start, she felt like she was just about to collapse from sheer exhaustion and grief.</p><p>The room was still empty when Agatha walked in, and for a moment, it felt like the world outside had paused. Rio wasn’t sure if it was just the exhaustion weighing on her or if it was the undercurrent of something else—something that had been growing since their night out on Friday—but the minute Agatha stepped through the door, her presence was magnetic. It made Rio’s heart beat a little faster, even though she wasn’t sure what she was feeling. She’d never been one to lose control over someone’s proximity before, but with Agatha, everything felt different.</p><p>She had come early to class, despite the overnight shift, because she couldn’t shake the feeling that she needed to see Agatha again. But today, she was distracted, her thoughts swirling around the little girl she had lost during one of her calls. A child the same age as her niece, Sophia. She couldn’t help but think of her sister, how she would’ve felt if it were her daughter lying cold on that stretcher.</p><p>When Agatha looked over at her, there was a quiet intensity in her gaze. Rio didn’t expect Agatha to notice, but she did.</p><p>The professor hesitated, then walked down the aisle, her boots clicking softly against the floor. Instead of standing at the podium like usual, Agatha came straight to Rio, sitting down beside her in the first row, her presence filling the space between them. The softness of Agatha’s eyes, her concern—it was almost too much to take in all at once.</p><p>Agatha’s hand brushed against Rio’s wrist, a gentle, almost unconscious move. The touch made Rio’s chest tighten. Her fingers tingled with the memory of Friday night—the lingering way their hands had brushed, how close they had been, the electric charge that had passed between them even when words weren’t spoken.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha’s voice was soft, careful, but still with that underlying strength that Rio had come to appreciate so much. There was no pretense, just a genuine question.</p><p>Rio looked at her for a moment, the weight of her emotions threatening to spill out. She took a slow breath, the words coming unbidden before she could stop them.</p><p>“I lost a kid last night,” Rio said, her voice quieter than usual, as if saying it out loud might make it more real. “She was the same age as my niece.” She exhaled, her chest tight. “It… it gets to you sometimes, you know?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch, didn’t back away. Instead, her hand moved, settling lightly over Rio’s wrist, her thumb brushing softly against the skin. Rio couldn’t help but lean into the touch, the contact grounding her in a way she didn’t expect.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio,” Agatha said quietly, her voice soft but firm, like she truly understood. She didn’t try to say anything else; she just stayed close, her touch a subtle offering of comfort.</p><p>Rio nodded, swallowing against the lump in her throat. She hadn’t expected to feel this… supported. But there it was, the way her fingers lingered on Rio’s skin, the way she didn’t pull away. It felt like more than just empathy—it felt like Agatha caring, and Rio didn’t quite know how to process that yet.</p><p>Agatha’s hand didn’t move away. Instead, it seemed to settle more naturally, like it belonged there. Rio’s heart skipped a beat, her pulse racing under Agatha’s gentle touch. She wasn’t sure if Agatha realized the effect she was having on her, but she couldn’t pull away either. It felt right, even if it was just for this brief moment, just the two of them.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?” Agatha asked softly, her eyes never leaving Rio’s face. “I know it’s not easy, but I’m here.”</p><p>Rio felt her throat tighten again, but this time she didn’t hold back the tears. “I’m fine,” she said, but the words didn’t come out as convincingly as she’d hoped. Agatha didn’t seem to mind.</p><p>“I know it’s not easy,” Agatha said again, her hand still gently resting over Rio’s. “But you don’t have to carry it alone,” she reached out with her other hand to gently brush the lone tear that had escaped.</p><p>For a brief moment, Rio let herself relax into the touch, her heart lightening just a little, as if Agatha’s quiet presence could ease the weight of it all. There was something in Agatha’s demeanor that made Rio feel like she wasn’t just a student, but a person—someone worth caring about.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Rio said finally, her voice quieter. “I just—sometimes it feels like I’m carrying too much, you know?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her thumb still brushing lightly over Rio’s wrist. “I get it. And you don’t have to talk if you don’t want to. But just… know I’m here.”</p><p>The words were simple, but they made Rio’s heart swell with an emotion she wasn’t ready to name.</p><p>The room began to fill slowly with students, and Agatha pulled away. The first few students entered, noticing the two of them sitting close together, but Rio was glad that Agatha didn’t immediately withdraw despite ending their physical connection.</p><p>But as the students filed in, Agatha gave Rio’s shoulder a gentle squeeze before standing up, moving back to the front of the room. Rio let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, her hand still tingling from the contact, the warmth of Agatha’s fingers still lingering on her skin.</p><p>Agatha stood at the front of the room, beginning to prepare for the lecture, but there was something different in the way she looked at Rio. It wasn’t just professionalism; there was a quiet understanding between them now, an unspoken connection that neither of them had to put into words.</p><p>Rio was still reeling from their brief exchange, the sensation of Agatha’s touch still burning on her wrist. She wasn’t sure what to make of it all, but she knew one thing for certain—she couldn’t shake the feeling that things had definitely changed between them. </p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <p>
  <span>The week had passed quickly, each day blending into the next with little more than texts exchanged between Agatha and Rio. They’d started it on Monday evening, when Agatha, still thinking about what Rio had shared in class, decided to reach out.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Hey, Rio. How are you holding up? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio had responded promptly, but Agatha couldn’t stop thinking about it. The next day, she’d checked in again, asking how her day had been. And it continued like that—back-and-forth messages about life, about the challenges Rio faced in the field, about the moments that kept them both grounded. Agatha had found herself looking forward to Rio’s messages, especially when they came late at night, her mind winding down from the day’s tasks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Friday morning, Agatha woke up to the soft buzz of her phone on the nightstand. Groggy, she reached for it and smiled when she saw Rio’s message.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio Vidal</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Happy birthday, Agatha! </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I hope you have an amazing day. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’ll try to swing by your office sometime after Wanda’s class.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart fluttered a little at the message. It had only been a week since their first night out together, yet it felt like so much had shifted between them. She hadn’t expected it, not really, but now she couldn’t help but feel a soft anticipation as she typed her reply.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Thank you! I’ll be around all day. </span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>I’ll give you the details for tomorrow’s get-together </span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>when you swing by my office. </span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>I’ve got Nicky’s sacred trick or treating tonight, </span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>but tomorrow will be fun.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She hit send and set her phone down, just as Nicky burst into the room, his face lit with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama!” he burst into the room, already grinning from ear to ear. “Happy birthday!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed, her heart instantly lighter as he jumped onto her bed, bouncing with energy. She pulled him close, squeezing him tightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, kiddo. Are you excited for today?” she asked, her fingers gently ruffling his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded vigorously, his face lighting up. “Yes! Halloween! And we’re gonna get so much candy!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, feeling a warmth she only ever felt when he was around. “You bet. But first, how about we tackle some special birthday breakfast? You ready for some pancakes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t need any further encouragement, already bouncing off the bed and heading toward the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled softly and followed him downstairs. As she got dressed and ready for the day, she checked her phone one last time. Rio hadn’t replied yet, but Agatha couldn’t help the little flutter in her chest as she thought about her—about their growing connection, and the unspoken things that hovered between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe this year, everything would be different. And maybe, just maybe, Rio could be part of that change.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a sigh, Agatha tucked her phone into her pocket and joined Nicky in the living room, already excited for the day ahead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s office door creaked open just a little while later, and she looked up from her papers to see Rio standing in the doorway, holding a tray with two cups of coffee in one hand and a single flower in the other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Happy Birthday,” Rio said softly, her voice almost like a melody that wrapped around Agatha. Her smile was warm, her eyes a little too knowing, like she had already seen too much of Agatha and liked what she saw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart skipped, and she blinked, trying to keep herself composed, but it wasn’t easy. “Rio, you didn’t have to do this. Thank you.” Her voice came out quieter than she intended, and she stood to take the tray from her, putting it on her desk. The soft light pink carnation caught her eye first, delicate and beautiful in Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged slightly, her cheeks tinged with a faint pink when she offered her the flower. Agatha's smile widened as she accepted it, their fingers brushing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s nothing. I just thought you might like something special for your birthday.” She stepped forward, closing the space between them. Her eyes met Agatha’s for just a moment longer than usual. Then, with a soft exhale, Rio leaned forward and pulled Agatha into a quick but sincere hug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha froze, caught off guard by the warmth of it, and the closeness. Rio’s scent—faintly of coffee and something citrus—was all around her. The hug was brief, but it lingered in the air, sparking something between them. Agatha felt a tightness in her chest, unsure if it was the unexpected tenderness or the tension that had been simmering beneath the surface for days now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Happy birthday,” Rio whispered against her ear, pulling back just slightly, but keeping her hands lightly on Agatha’s shoulders. Her touch was steady but left something unexplained in the space between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t know what to say. The words felt trapped in her throat, and her pulse had picked up. Rio had that effect on her—she always had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Agatha finally breathed out, her voice rougher than she expected. Her gaze locked with Rio’s again, the weight of their shared moments over the past week hanging between them like an unspoken understanding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neither of them moved, both caught in the bubble of unacknowledged want and something else, something more, that was starting to get harder to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha cleared her throat, forcing her attention away for a moment. “This is really sweet, Rio. I—” Her words faltered, her hand curling slightly around the flower stem she was holding. She almost didn’t know what to say, unsure of the boundaries they were now tiptoeing around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gaze softened, a silent question in her eyes. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed, feeling the heat of Rio’s hands still on her, her presence too much to ignore, too much to just brush aside. She wanted to say something that made sense, something that wouldn’t make this weird, but her brain wasn’t cooperating. Instead, she just nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But even as the words left her lips, she wasn’t so sure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tension simmered between them, palpable, as if they were both holding their breath, afraid to exhale.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s fingers moved before she could think better of it, brushing a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear, the touch lingering just a second longer than necessary. She watched as Agatha’s breath hitched, her eyes fluttering shut for the briefest moment. And then, almost without thinking, Rio let her hand drift, her palm cupping Agatha’s cheek gently, the warmth of her skin searing against her own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t pull away. If anything, she leaned into Rio’s touch, her eyes dark and unreadable, lips parted slightly. The air between them was heavy, charged, thick with everything they hadn’t said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then she moved—just barely, just enough. It was the smallest tilt forward, but Rio caught it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt inevitable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s pulse pounded as Rio leaned in, closing the space between them. She hesitated for a fraction of a second, her lips hovering just above Agatha’s, afraid of spooking her, afraid of what this would mean, but unable to stop herself. And then, finally, she let her lips brush against Agatha’s—light, tentative, just the barest whisper of a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled sharply, her hands twitching like she wasn’t sure whether to pull Rio closer or push her away. But she didn’t move away. If anything, she melted just slightly, like something inside her had finally cracked open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A knock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Loud. Sharp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha jerked back so fast she nearly hit the edge of her desk. Her breath caught in her throat, her fingers flexing at her sides as if she could somehow will away the electric charge still running through her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand dropped immediately, her expression shifting from unguarded softness to something more controlled, but Agatha still caught the flicker of frustration in her eyes, the way her breath came uneven.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The knock came again, more insistent this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha forced herself to move, to step away, to shove this—whatever this was—into the farthest corner of her mind. She smoothed a hand over her hair, exhaling sharply as she turned toward the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come in,” she called, and winced at the way her voice was just slightly off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door swung open, and a tall, broad-shouldered student stepped inside, looking determined. Agatha immediately recognized him—Thomas Jordan. One of the students who had applied for her mentorship program but hadn’t made the cut.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor Harkness,” he said, his voice polite but firm. “Do you have a moment?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha inhaled slowly, steadying herself. “I’m in the middle of something,” she said, her voice back under control. “If this is about the mentorship, Jordan, I’ve already made my decisions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Behind her, Rio had taken a step back, her expression unreadable. She didn’t seem flustered, not exactly, but there was still something lingering in the way she was watching Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just wanted to speak with you about it,” Jordan continued, undeterred. “I really think you should reconsider.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled through her nose, already feeling a headache forming. This wasn’t the first time a rejected student had tried to challenge her choices.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t the time or place for this conversation,” she said, keeping her voice even. “If you’d like to discuss it during office hours, you’re welcome to make an appointment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan’s jaw tightened, but he nodded. “Understood.” His gaze flicked to Rio briefly, something unreadable passing over his expression, before he turned and left the office, the door clicking shut behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, pressing her fingers to her temples.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Rio said after a moment, her voice just slightly amused. “That was a buzzkill.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a breath of laughter, shaking her head. But when she looked at Rio again, the amusement faded slightly. Because Rio was still watching her, still standing just close enough that Agatha could feel the ghost of where her touch had been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had been seconds away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The weight of it settled between them, thick and undeniable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for the first time, Agatha didn’t know what to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha barely had a chance to collect herself before Rio moved closer again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was subtle—just a slight shift forward—but it sent a fresh wave of heat up Agatha’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She should step back. Should reclaim the space between them. Should do something to pull herself together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand found her arm, the touch grounding yet unbearably gentle. Then, before Agatha could say anything, Rio leaned in and pressed a slow, lingering kiss to her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha barely contained the sharp inhale that wanted to escape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s lips were warm, her breath fanning over Agatha’s skin as she lingered for just a second too long before pulling away. When she did, she was smiling—soft and knowing, like she could see straight through Agatha’s unraveling composure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I rearranged my schedule,” Rio murmured, her voice just above a whisper. “Picked up a shift tonight instead, so I’ll be able to make it to your party tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed, forcing herself to focus. “You didn’t have to do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to.” Rio’s eyes flickered with something unreadable. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hesitated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every part of her was screaming that this was a terrible idea. That inviting Rio into her space, into her life in this way, was only going to complicate things further.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” she said, her voice quieter than she intended. “I’ll send you the details.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile deepened, and for a brief, reckless moment, Agatha thought she might kiss her again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, she squeezed Agatha’s arm lightly before stepping back, grabbing her coffee cup making her way to the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The office felt unbearably still after she was gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a slow, unsteady breath, pressing a hand to her cheek where Rio’s lips had been.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had been tense all day, and she hated that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t like she hadn’t hosted these get-togethers before—she had. Every year, the Saturday after her birthday, a small group of friends gathered at her place for drinks, food, and easy conversation. It was comfortable. Predictable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, tonight, Agatha had been adjusting the glassware on her bar cart for the third time, barely listening as Wanda talked about something or other in the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was waiting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then, finally, the doorbell rang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky, who had been bouncing off the walls since he got home from trick-or-treating the night before, gasped as if Santa himself had arrived. “I’ll get it!” he shouted, already sprinting for the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha barely had time to tell him to slow down before the door swung open, and there she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio Vidal stood on her doorstep, looking entirely too good in jeans and a deep red V-neck shirt that did unspeakable things to Agatha’s brain, and holding a casserole that smelled absolutely delicious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had expected Rio to look good—she always did, even in scrubs—but this was something else. Agatha’s stomach flipped, and her mouth went dry, and she hated that Wanda was still in the kitchen because she would absolutely notice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she could say anything, Nicky let out a thrilled, “Rio! You’re here!” and practically launched himself at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed as she caught him. “Hey, kid,” she greeted, pulling him into a hug as she balanced the casserole in the other. “I see the sugar rush is in full effect.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mom lets me have as much candy as I want on Halloween!” Nicky declared proudly. “Wanna see how much I got?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. “Obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha, who had managed to recover somewhat from her momentary brain malfunction, cleared her throat. “Let her inside first, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gaze lifted, and when their eyes met, there was something warm, something knowing in the way she looked at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” she said, soft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled. “Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Behind her, Wanda emerged from the kitchen, glass of wine in hand, and arched a brow at the scene in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, look who finally made it,” she said, smirking at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, stepping fully inside. “Didn’t want to miss the birthday festivities.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda’s smirk widened as she took a slow sip of her wine, her gaze flicking pointedly between Rio and Agatha. “Oh, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shot her a look. “Not a word.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say anything,” Wanda said, entirely too innocent, before holding out her hands to take the casserole from her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, amused, just glanced between them like she knew exactly what was happening and was deciding to let it happen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as she handed the casserole to Wanda, Nicky tugged on her hand. “Come on! I wanna show you my candy!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, letting herself be dragged toward the living room, and Agatha let out a slow breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda leaned in, voice low. “You’re so screwed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her eyes briefly before fixing Wanda with a sharp look. “Shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda just let out a knowing laugh and strolled back toward the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes. It was going to be a long night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The party had barely begun, and Agatha already felt like she was teetering on the edge of something dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment Rio stepped inside, it was like the entire atmosphere shifted. Not that anyone else seemed to notice—Nicky was too busy showing off his candy stash, and Wanda was too busy being smug—but Agatha felt it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was because she had spent the entire week texting Rio. Maybe it was because Rio had brought her coffee and a flower and touched her like she was something fragile and precious. Maybe it was because Agatha hadn’t stopped thinking about the almost-kiss in her office, about how she had been the one leaning in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Either way, she was on edge in a way she hadn’t been in years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a steadying sip of her wine as she moved toward the living room. Most of the usual guests had arrived—Wanda, of course, plus the twins, Lilia, and a few other close colleagues. The atmosphere was relaxed, filled with low chatter and laughter. It was normal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except for the fact that Rio was here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she looked so damn good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried not to stare as Rio knelt on the floor next to Nicky, listening intently as he sorted through his candy, dramatically explaining the hierarchy of his favorites.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, but peanut butter cups are obviously the best,” Rio said, shaking her head at Nicky’s ranking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky gasped, scandalized. “No way! Sour gummies are way better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wrong,” Rio said, popping a peanut butter cup into her mouth. “But I’ll forgive you because you’re still young.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky squinted at her, as if trying to figure out whether or not she was worthy of forgiveness. Then, with a dramatic sigh, he tossed a pack of sour gummies into her lap. “Fine. But only because you’re cool.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt something in her chest tighten.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was one thing to know that Nicky had taken a liking to Rio. It was another to witness it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t sure why it made her feel so—so—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No. She wasn’t going to think about that right now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, she turned toward the kitchen, only to be intercepted by Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look stressed,” Lilia commented, sipping her drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled. “I’m <em>fine</em>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia hummed, unconvinced, then glanced toward the living room, where Rio was now very animatedly pretending to be offended by something Nicky had said. “Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha frowned. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia smirked. “Just making an observation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha groaned. “Not you too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean, it’s not every day you invite one of your students to your birthday party,” Lilia mused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s also a paramedic,” Agatha said, as if that helped. "And a friend."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia just looked at her, entirely unimpressed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. “It’s not—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a thing?” Lilia supplied. “Because it kind of looks like a thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t answer, mostly because she had no answer to give. And also because she'd just realized that while Lilia was one of her closest friends, she was also the Chair of Medicine at Norwestern, and this was probably something that would be very much frowned upon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia grinned, clearly enjoying this far too much, and obviously not caring about whatever was going on between her and Rio. “Don’t worry, I won’t say anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shot her a look. </span>
  <span>Lilia just clinked her glass against Agatha’s and wandered off, looking far too pleased with herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was going to be a long night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, when she glanced back toward the living room, where Rio was now sitting comfortably on the floor, laughing at something Wanda said, Agatha couldn’t bring herself to regret inviting her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not even a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the evening carried on, Agatha found herself acutely aware of Rio’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not in an obvious way—Rio blended in easily, laughing with Wanda, listening patiently to Nicky’s never-ending candy monologue, and even humoring the twins when they tried to rope her into their argument about which one of them was the superior soccer player. But still, Agatha felt it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was impossible not to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And maybe that was why she found herself moving toward Rio when she caught her still sitting on the floor, surrounded by children, looking both amused and vaguely trapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” Agatha said, standing over her with a pointed look. “I think you’ve endured enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up at her, lips twitching into something wry. “You saving me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Something like that,” Agatha murmured, offering a hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio took it without hesitation, and Agatha pretended not to feel the warmth that shot through her as she helped her up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Drinks are in the kitchen,” she said, leading the way. “I assume you’re having something stronger than juice boxes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Desperately,” Rio said, rubbing her temple. “I love kids, but they can be exhausting sometimes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Try living with one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. “I have nieces and nephews. I get the appeal of returning them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked, shaking her head as she reached the kitchen. She picked up a bottle of whiskey and raised a brow. “This work?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned against the counter, watching her. “You have great taste.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha poured her a drink, handing Rio her glass before taking a slow sip of her wine. The party was still lively in the other room, but here, in the kitchen, things felt quieter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>More intimate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned a hip against the counter, swirling her drink idly. “So, do you always do something like this for your birthday?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. “Ever since Nicky was born. Halloween is his. I never want to take that from him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled slightly, as if she liked that answer. “And before that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled. “I didn’t really celebrate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s expression shifted—curious, maybe even a little sad—but she didn’t pry. Instead, she took a sip of her drink and murmured, “Well, I’m glad I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers tightened around her glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was too. </span>
  <span>And that, more than anything, was the problem.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The warmth in Agatha’s chest was entirely too much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t the wine. It wasn’t the party. It wasn’t even the way Rio was watching her over the rim of her glass, something thoughtful and unreadable in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was just <em>her</em>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Agatha was in trouble.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She set her drink down, clearing her throat. “You didn’t have to rearrange your schedule for this, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head. “Didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, but Rio just smirked, reaching into her purse that still hung across her body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Actually,” she said, pulling out a small box, “I also got you something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha blinked, taken aback.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio handed it to her, almost sheepishly. “It’s not a big deal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed, her fingers brushing against Rio’s as she took the box. “You didn’t have to get me anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to,” Rio admitted simply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was somehow worse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled and opened the box.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inside, nestled in black velvet, was a sleek, silver fountain pen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She ran a thumb over it, and as she did, she caught the small engraving on the side. <em>AH.</em></span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her initials.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked up, heart in her throat. “Rio—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re always grading or writing something,” Rio said, shrugging, like she hadn’t just given Agatha a gift that made her feel completely undone. “Figured you might like something nice to use.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stared at her, unable to formulate words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was small. It was simple. But it was thoughtful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Too thoughtful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gripped the pen tighter. “I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then, of course, the moment was ruined.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, there you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha and Rio both turned to see Wanda leaning against the kitchen doorway, arms crossed, watching them like a cat that had caught something particularly interesting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha barely resisted the urge to sigh. “Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, don’t stop on my account,” Wanda said breezily, stepping into the room. “I was just wondering where the guest of honor had gone. And now I see she’s been occupied.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shot her a look. “Do you need something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda smirked. “No. Just enjoying the view.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, unbothered as ever, took another sip of her drink. “You’re enjoying something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I definitely am,” Wanda said, then gestured toward the pen in Agatha’s hand. “What’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A gift,” Agatha said, a little too quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio just smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda’s brows lifted. “Oh? How nice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha set the box down, ignoring the way Wanda was very clearly storing this information for later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Wanda said, clapping her hands together, “much as I love crashing a moment, I actually do need to steal the birthday girl for a bit. People are asking for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, then glanced at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tipped her head toward the door. “Go. I’ll be here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was something in the way she said it, something steady, something warm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, before she could overthink it, she touched Rio’s hand, just for a second. Just enough to feel her warmth before she pulled away. </span>
  <span>Rio’s lips parted slightly, surprised, but she didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha forced herself to step back. “I’ll be back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “I’ll be here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then, before Wanda could say anything else, Agatha walked away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her hand still tingled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her heart was still too fast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she had no idea what to do about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha returned to the kitchen, exhaling slowly as she set her empty wine glass down on the counter. The buzz of conversation still carried from the other room, but she allowed herself a brief moment of solitude. She hadn’t expected to feel this… settled tonight. Not with everything that had been brewing between her and Rio. And yet—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You disappeared on me,” Rio murmured, her voice warm with amusement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha lifted a brow. “Wanda said people were asking for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed. “I noticed. You make a very good host.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “I try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped closer, her eyes flickering toward the fountain pen resting beside the wine bottle. “So… did you like your gift?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha picked it up, running her fingers over the smooth surface. “It’s thoughtful,” she admitted. “And personal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, leaning casually against the counter. “So, you liked it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a soft breath, glancing at her from beneath her lashes. “I loved it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something passed between them then—something quiet, but heavy. Agatha was aware of how close Rio was, of how easily she could reach out and touch her if she wanted to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio must have felt it too, because after a beat, she reached for Agatha’s hand, gently brushing her thumb along the inside of her wrist. The touch was light, but deliberate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed. “You’re being bold again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “You bring it out in me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t pull away. Instead, she let herself feel it—the warmth of Rio’s skin, the unspoken thing that had been simmering between them for weeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice softened. “I wasn’t sure if I should come tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tilted her head slightly. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled, the pad of her thumb still moving in slow circles against Agatha’s wrist. “Because I knew I’d spend the whole night looking at you.” Her mouth quirked into a wry smile. “And I didn’t know if I could be subtle about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart did something entirely inconvenient. She should say something to draw the line back where it belonged, but the words didn’t come.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, as if sensing the shift, slowly released her hand. “Happy birthday, Agatha,” she murmured, leaning in to place a lingering kiss on her cheek. And then, before Agatha could think of a single response that didn’t betray everything she was feeling, Rio was already gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood there for a moment longer, staring at the place where Rio had just been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was ridiculous, really, how much she already missed the warmth of her touch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room was filled with laughter and chatter as the children played in the other room. Agatha and Rio were sitting side by side on the couch, a slight electric hum between them. Rio’s arm was casually draped over the back of the couch, fingers lightly grazing Agatha’s shoulder every so often, as if it were nothing more than an absentminded touch. Yet every time, Agatha could feel it, that quiet and deliberate contact that made her heart beat a little faster. Their thighs brushed occasionally, a touch that seemed innocent enough, but in the midst of their conversation, it felt anything but.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Viz, Wanda’s husband, leaned forward, his interest piqued as he looked at Rio. “So, Rio,” he said, taking a slow sip of his drink. “I’ve always wondered—what’s the adventure aspect of your job like? I mean, you’ve had to see some crazy stuff, right? Has there ever been a moment where you thought, ‘This is insane, and I can’t believe I’m doing this’?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, clearly accustomed to such questions. “Oh, definitely. One of the more interesting calls I had was at this… bizarre local festival. Think carnival meets a street fair, but with way more fireworks than should’ve been allowed in a public space.” She leaned back slightly, looking toward Agatha, her voice taking on a playful tone. “So, there was this woman who, at some point, in the midst of all the chaos, got hit by a rogue bottle rocket.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “A bottle rocket? How?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, laughing softly. “You’d think it’s one of those things that only happens in movies, but no. This woman, bless her, was so caught up in the excitement that she turned her head just in time for a bottle rocket to fly straight at her face. She ended up with a singed eyebrow and a slight burn on her cheek.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia let out a small laugh, shaking her head. “How did she react?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She was in shock at first,” Rio continued, “but she insisted she was fine—just a little embarrassed. It wasn’t until we got her checked out that we realized she’d actually had a mild concussion from getting knocked back by the impact of the rocket.” Rio’s eyes twinkled as she added, “We had to convince her that maybe she should go to the hospital and skip the rest of the fireworks. She was adamant, though, that she was going back to celebrate. She didn’t want to miss the finale. We ended up giving her a ride home myself after she stubbornly refused going to the hospital.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See, that’s what I love about you paramedics,” Viz said, leaning back with a grin. “You guys can handle just about anything, even fireworks to the face. I wouldn’t last five minutes in your shoes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged with a small smile. “It’s the job, and you get used to the weirdness. The job’s full of unexpected moments.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of unexpected,” Lilia chimed in, clearly curious. “What’s the weirdest case you’ve ever seen? I’m sure there are plenty of strange ones.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio thought for a moment, her gaze drifting as she considered the question. “Oh, I’ve seen plenty of strange things. But the weirdest one that really stands out recently happened about six months ago.” She let out a slow breath, the memory still vivid in her mind. “It was a call to this downtown apartment building—old, not well-maintained. We get there, and there’s a guy, about in his mid-thirties, completely calm, just sitting on the steps of his apartment building, holding a frozen chicken.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a smile. “A frozen chicken?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “Yeah, he was holding a whole frozen chicken like it was a teddy bear. I asked him what had happened, and he told me—very seriously—that it was a family heirloom and that it had been handed down for generations. Apparently, this chicken had once been part of some absurd ritual in his family where it was meant to ‘bring peace’ to their home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda snorted. “You’re kidding.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “Not at all. He kept saying that he had to take it out and ‘air it out,’ like it was some sort of sacred object. That's why someone called 911, because he was just sitting there holding out this frozen chicken on the front steps of his building. The man was convinced it had spiritual powers—he swore the chicken was the reason his bad luck had started and that he had to reverse it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was he okay?” Lilia asked, her voice laced with concern.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was fine physically,” Rio continued, a small laugh escaping her lips. “But let’s just say I had to gently tell him that there’s no scientific evidence that frozen chickens can reverse bad luck.” She paused for a beat, eyes dancing with mischief. “He took it better than I expected—though, he did insist that I take a picture with the chicken before I left. I think he wanted to prove to his friends that it wasn’t just some delusion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The entire group erupted in laughter, with Viz almost spilling his drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good thing you didn’t end up taking that chicken as a souvenir,” Agatha teased, leaning forward just slightly, her shoulder brushing against Rio’s in the process. Rio, still grinning, let her fingers lightly caress Agatha’s arm, the touch so gentle it could almost have been accidental, yet both of them felt the quiet charge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think my real souvenir was the memory of that guy telling me to ‘respect the chicken’,” Rio replied with a wry smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda leaned back in her chair and asked, "Any others that stick out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave her a thoughtful look, leaning back slightly, still aware of the subtle warmth between her and Agatha. “Well, there was this one time that I was called to a golf course at three in the morning. The guy who called in had a random panic attack on a golf cart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?!” Viz laughed incredulously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her smile turning mischievous. “Yep. He was driving around on the golf cart at three a.m., in the pitch black, by himself—doing laps for no reason—when suddenly, he just froze up. Thought he was going to die. My partner and I got there to find him literally sitting on the ground, sobbing with a golf club clutched in his hands like it was his only lifeline. And when we asked him what happened, he said, ‘I thought I saw the ghost of a golfer that died years ago.’”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The group was laughing now, and even Agatha found herself unable to hold back her amused smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I guess some people are just more spiritually sensitive than others,” she teased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave her a sly look, a twinkle in her eyes as she leaned in slightly. “Maybe so… But I’ll tell you one thing—there’s something about dealing with chaos that makes you feel more alive. Even if it’s as absurd as a man having a panic attack because of a ghostly golfer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile softly, her gaze lingering on Rio. “I think I’m starting to understand chaos a little better these days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave her a soft, knowing smile, fingers absently tracing the curve of Agatha’s arm again. “Good,” she whispered. “It suits you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a brief moment, the world around them faded into the background, and it was just the two of them, caught in an undeniable connection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, as if snapped out of a trance by the sounds of Nicky running around with the twins, Lilia grinned at the obvious tension between them. “Alright, who’s ready for another round of drinks?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha and Rio both laughed quietly, the tension still crackling between them, but for the moment, they were content to let the chaos of the evening carry on around them.</span>

  <p>
  <span>The party had slowed down, the air in the house settling into a comfortable lull as the children played quietly in the corner, occasionally shrieking with laughter. Rio leaned back into the couch, eyes drifting to the doorway and then back to Wanda and Viz who were chatting animatedly with her, their voices light and easy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve seen some wild stuff,” Viz was saying with a grin, clearly impressed by Rio’s stories. “I can’t imagine what it’s like dealing with all that chaos every day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, the sound warm and easy. “It’s part of the job,” she said, her tone light but filled with a deep appreciation for the unpredictability of her work. “You learn to go with the flow—or not at all.” She let her gaze flicker back to Agatha, who had just walked Lilia to the door. Even from across the room, Rio could see the way Agatha’s shoulders had loosened, the tiredness of the night evident in the way she moved, but there was something else—something different about the way she held herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda caught her gaze and followed it, her smile growing. “You two seem to be getting along well,” she said, her voice soft but knowing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced back at her with a small grin. “Yeah, Agatha’s great,” she said, the warmth of her words genuine. She wasn’t sure why, but even with just that short exchange, it felt like the walls between them had been crumbling slowly, like she could finally breathe in a space where things felt just a little bit more real.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment stretched between them until the sound of Agatha’s footsteps returning to the room broke the silence. She came back into the living room, her movements easy, unhurried, as if the night had unfolded just as it should. Her eyes met Rio’s almost immediately, a soft, unspoken understanding between them as she dropped onto the couch beside Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, her heart doing a little flip at the ease with which Agatha settled in. Without thinking, her arm moved to rest once again on the back of the couch, this time letting it fall gently over Agatha’s shoulders, a subtle, comforting gesture. Agatha didn’t stiffen, didn’t pull away—she just melted into the touch, resting her head slightly against Rio’s arm with a quiet sigh of relief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda, who had been watching the entire exchange with a keen eye, raised an eyebrow. The look on her face was impossible to miss, a knowing smirk playing at the corners of her lips. She exchanged a glance with Viz before turning back to Rio and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I think it’s time to call it a night,” Wanda announced, her voice light but full of the unspoken truth that lingered in the air between them. “I can see you two have things to… figure out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, her eyes flicking briefly to Agatha, whose gaze had softened as she looked up at her, still resting against her side. The way Agatha was leaning into her felt so natural, so easy, as if it were the most normal thing in the world. There was no tension, no hesitance. Just the two of them, together, in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I think that’s probably a good idea,” Viz added, chuckling quietly as he stood up to stretch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda’s gaze lingered on them for a moment longer, a soft smile tugging at her lips. “You two have a good night,” she said, the words light but with a knowing look as she moved to grab her coat. “No need to get up, Agatha. We’ll see ourselves out. Enjoy the rest of your night,” she finished with a playful wink, making Agatha roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda and Viz said their goodbyes, taking the twins with them as they left for the night. The door clicked shut, and suddenly, it was just the three of them—Nicky, who was fading fast as he played with toy figures on one of the armchairs, and Agatha and Rio, still sitting close together on the couch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha glanced up at Rio, her eyes holding a quiet warmth as she let out a soft exhale. “Thanks for being here tonight,” she said quietly, her voice holding a thread of something Rio couldn’t quite place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Rio replied, leaning slightly toward her, the quiet intimacy of the moment wrapping around them like a blanket. “I wouldn’t have missed it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted a little, her body relaxing fully into Rio’s side now, the gentle pressure of Rio’s arm around her shoulders feeling so comforting, so right. Rio’s fingers brushed lightly through Agatha’s hair, just a fleeting touch, but it felt so intimate, so familiar, as if they had been doing this for years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were quiet for a few minutes, just enjoying each other’s presence and touch. For once, Rio felt like they were finally heading in the right direction, but she didn’t want to rush Agatha into anything, so she just let things happen. Agatha had fully rested her weight on Rio’s side, and it felt like a slice of heaven, and she wasn’t even exaggerating. Rio placed an affectionate kiss to Agatha’s hair and felt as she sighed contentedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few minutes, Agatha realized Nicky had fallen asleep on the armchair, and let out a sigh, seemingly moving to get up against her will.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I can carry him upstairs if you want?” Rio offered, making Agatha meet her eyes for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure? He’s heavy,” Agatha warned and Rio nodded with a smile. “Alright, then. I appreciate it, really. It feels like I’m getting closer and closer to the point where I won’t be able to carry him anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio carefully picked Nicky up, cradling him in her arms with surprising ease, his small, familiar weight resting against her chest. She glanced back at Agatha, a quiet smile tugging at the corner of her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take him upstairs to bed,” Rio murmured, her voice soft in the quiet of the living room. Agatha nodded, her eyes following Rio as she moved toward the staircase.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Rio climbed the stairs with Nicky nestled securely in her arms, she felt a surge of warmth—both from the closeness with the boy and the unspoken connection she felt with Agatha downstairs. It was as if something had shifted, both between her and Agatha and within herself, something she hadn’t expected but couldn’t deny.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio came back downstairs, she found Agatha standing by the counter, her back turned as she fiddled with something, no doubt checking on the last remnants of the party. The flickering light from the kitchen cast a soft glow over her, making her look both grounded and delicate at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha glanced up as Rio approached, her eyes instantly locking onto hers. There was an unreadable expression there, but Rio saw the warmth beneath it. Agatha gestured to the whiskey bottle on the counter. “Care for a nightcap?” she asked, her voice low, just for Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitated for a moment, but then her own desire for something more—more connection, more time with Agatha—pushed her forward. “Yeah, I’d like that,” Rio replied, her voice steady but the flutter in her chest undeniable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both moved toward the counter, Agatha pouring some whiskey for Rio and another glass of wine for herself. Rio’s heart beating a little faster, the air between them thick with an unspoken tension, the weight of what had been building ever since Agatha had walked back into the room after seeing Lilia off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat down together on the couch again, facing each other, a little closer than before, the space between them shrinking with every passing second. The way their bodies aligned, their legs brushing against each other with every slight movement, made Rio’s pulse race.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a sip of her wine, her gaze flicking over to Rio before she settled in next to her, their thighs brushing again. Rio could feel the heat of Agatha’s body seeping into her own. The need to touch was unbearable now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly, cautiously, Rio reached out, letting her fingers trail lightly along the extension of Agatha’s arm as it rested on the back of the couch. She was testing the boundaries, but she couldn’t help herself—couldn’t fight the urge to feel Agatha’s warmth under her touch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breath caught slightly, the subtle tension in her body radiating through her, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she tilted her head slightly, looking at Rio, a mixture of uncertainty and something else in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart raced, and she asked, almost breathlessly, “Did you like your birthday?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes flickered down to Rio’s lips, her gaze lingering there, as if she couldn’t help herself. She bit her bottom lip, and Rio felt a shiver go down her spine at the sight. It was as if Agatha was caught between wanting to pull back and wanting to lean in, the same conflict that had been brewing between them all night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest tightened with anticipation, the air so thick now that it was almost suffocating. She could feel every inch of Agatha’s proximity, the soft warmth of her body next to hers, the quiet energy that seemed to crackle between them, pushing them closer, even without words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, neither of them spoke. The silence was charged with so much unspoken feeling that it felt as if the room itself was holding its breath. Then, finally, Agatha looked up at her, her lips still caught between her teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did,” Agatha whispered, her voice just above a breath. “More than I expected.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The vulnerability in her voice, the honesty, sent a thrill through Rio. She took a deep breath, her fingers still tracing the edge of Agatha’s arm, her heart hammering in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Rio murmured, her voice barely audible, her eyes searching Agatha’s. She could see the flicker of something deeper in Agatha’s eyes, a yearning that matched her own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In that moment, the pull between them was too much to ignore. The way Agatha’s gaze lingered on her lips, the way Rio felt the electricity in the air, it was impossible to pretend it wasn’t there anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a soft sigh, Rio leaned in just slightly, close enough that she could feel the heat of Agatha’s breath against her skin, but not yet close enough to close the distance entirely. The tension was unbearable, and yet they both seemed to hesitate, each waiting for the other to make the first move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Rio whispered, her voice soft, “I’m glad it was a good birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s response was a quiet hum of agreement, her hand moving to brush against Rio’s where it rested on her arm, the touch light but electric. There was a shared understanding now, something unspoken that was far too strong to ignore, but they both knew there was more to figure out, more to navigate, before they could fully give in to whatever this was..</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She swallowed hard, heart racing in her chest, but she couldn’t seem to stop herself. She leaned in just a fraction, watching Agatha’s eyes flicker from hers to her lips and back, that hesitation finally giving way to something else. It was a pull, an undeniable pull, like a magnetic force that neither of them could resist any longer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio closed the gap, their lips brushing together tentatively at first. A soft, sweet kiss that felt almost like an apology, like they were both saying, Is this okay? But it wasn’t long before it deepened, as if their bodies had been waiting for this moment—waiting for the connection to finally click into place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand slid up Agatha’s arm, fingers finding her wrist and pulling her a little closer. Agatha responded in kind, one hand reaching to rest gently on Rio’s cheek, the touch soft but grounding, anchoring them both in this moment. Rio’s heart was pounding now, every nerve alive with the feel of Agatha’s body now pressed against hers, the taste of her lips, the warmth of her breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kiss lingered, intense and deep, both of them caught in the moment, but Rio could feel the weight of the situation pressing down on her. Agatha had been so hesitant, so unsure, and though the chemistry between them was undeniable, Rio couldn’t bring herself to push for more—not tonight, not when it was clear Agatha was still navigating this new territory.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pulling away slowly, she took a breath and placed a soft kiss on Agatha’s forehead. “I think I should go,” Rio said softly, her voice tinged with regret but also a knowing calm. “We should talk about this… properly, you know? But not tonight. Not like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her eyes dark with desire, but there was understanding there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stood up, and Agatha followed her to the door, as she called for an Uber. Rio paused as she reached for the handle, turning to face Agatha once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped closer, and without a word, she cupped Rio’s face, pulling her into a gentle, lingering kiss goodbye. Rio felt a thrill shoot through her chest at the softness of Agatha’s lips, the way Agatha’s hand rested against her cheek like a silent promise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they pulled apart, Rio offered a small smile, the kind that only deepened as she looked at Agatha. “I’ll text you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be waiting,” Agatha murmured, her voice almost like a promise in itself, before she pulled Rio in for one last lingering kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped out of the door, her breath catching as she made her way down the steps, a giddy feeling in her chest. As soon as she was inside the Uber, she leaned back with a contented sigh, a smile tugging at her lips. Everything felt surreal—like she was in a dream, and she didn’t want to wake up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ride home felt like it took forever, the excitement of the night swirling inside her, making her head spin in the best way possible. When she finally stepped inside her apartment, she was met with the sounds of laughter, the faint hum of music, and the warm presence of her friends.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice was in the living room, practically jumping out of her seat when she saw Rio. “Look who decided to show up!” Alice teased, grinning ear to ear. “How was the party? Or should I say, how was your date with the professor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen, sitting next to her, raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. “You know, I’m really starting to think our girl has been holding out on us,” she teased, nudging Alice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes, grinning at her friends. “What? Just because I had a nice time doesn’t mean—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“—You had a</span>
  <em>
    <span> very</span>
  </em>
  <span> nice time,” Alice interrupted with a playful smirk. “Did you? Huh? Did you kiss her? What happened? Did you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You guys are terrible,” Rio said with a laugh, but there was no hiding the grin that spread across her face. “Yes, we kissed. Happy now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, so there was a kiss!” William, Rio’s partner from the firehouse, chimed in, making the whole group burst into laughter. “Pay up, losers!” He put his hand out waiting for the dollar bills to be deposited there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re killing me,” Rio muttered, but the joy in her heart was clear. She could feel the warmth of her friends around her, the teasing laughter, but none of it could wipe the smile off her face. Her heart was light, and for the first time in what felt like forever, she was genuinely happy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the night went on, they all shared stories and laughed, but Rio couldn’t stop thinking about the kiss, about Agatha’s warmth, about the quiet understanding that had passed between them. It was complicated, yes. But for tonight, that kiss, that feeling of connection, was more than enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And when she finally went to bed, it was with a happy sigh, a sense of peace settling over her as she drifted off to sleep, the thought of Agatha still lingering in her mind like the sweetest kind of dream.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio had never considered herself the type to get butterflies, but as she stepped into the lecture hall, coffee tray in hand, her stomach was a swarm of them. It had been a little over twenty-four hours since she’d last seen Agatha, but she’d been counting the seconds, replaying every stolen touch, every lingering glance, every quiet moment between them at the party.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t sure what this was—what they were stepping into—but the thought of seeing Agatha again made her pulse race in a way she couldn’t deny.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room was still empty, just the way she wanted it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The overhead lights cast a soft glow over the rows of seats, the hush of early morning making everything feel more intimate, like the world had paused just for them. She moved towards the first row, setting the coffee and bag of pastries down on one of the desks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t even thought twice about bringing Agatha coffee. It had been automatic, the same way she had gone out of her way to pick up those pastries—the ones she’d seen Agatha get the first time they had coffee together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled out her phone and sent a quick text.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>I’m already here. Brought coffee and something sweet for you. You have about 30 minutes before your minions start piling in.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="left">
  <span>She set the phone down, heart hammering against her ribs, a small grin playing at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment the message was delivered, she felt the weight of anticipation settle over her. It was ridiculous, really, how much she was looking forward to this, but she didn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She leaned back in her seat, eyes flickering to the door every few seconds, waiting for the moment Agatha would walk in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take long.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Barely five minutes after Rio sent the text, she heard the click of heels echoing down the hall. Her pulse jumped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then Agatha was there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walked in like she always did—composed, sharp, carrying herself with that quiet authority that made even the most arrogant students sit up and pay attention. But the moment she spotted Rio, something shifted. The tension in her shoulders eased, her lips parting just slightly, as if she hadn’t expected Rio to actually be there waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or maybe she had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe she had been looking forward to this just as much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning,” Rio said, grinning as she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes flicked to the tray beside her, taking in the two cups of coffee and the small bag. “You brought me breakfast?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, feigning nonchalance. “Figured you might need it. Thought about getting you something healthier, but then I remembered you having these the last time we got coffee. So.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a soft huff, the corner of her mouth twitching up as she walked closer. She set her bag down on her desk before making her way to Rio, reaching for one of the cups. Their fingers brushed as she picked it up, and neither of them moved away immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heat curled in Rio’s stomach at the brief contact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t have to,” Agatha murmured, studying her with an unreadable expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Rio said, holding her gaze. “Wanted to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, something flickering in her eyes before she took a careful sip of her coffee. Whatever she found in the taste must have pleased her, because she hummed, the sound barely audible but enough to make Rio’s skin prickle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look more rested than usual,” Agatha noted after a beat, eyes sweeping over Rio’s face. “Tell me you actually got some sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “Five whole hours. Practically a luxury.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched a brow, unimpressed. “That’s still not enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Rio admitted, unwrapping one of the pastries and breaking off a piece. “But I’m used to it. Besides, it was a quiet shift. No chaos this time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Miraculous,” Agatha said dryly, but there was warmth beneath the teasing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio popped the piece of pastry into her mouth, watching as Agatha took the seat beside her, the space between them practically nonexistent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neither of them acknowledged it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a slow sip of her coffee, watching Rio over the rim of her cup. Rio could feel her eyes, that sharp, assessing gaze that always made her pulse quicken just a little. She was starting to get used to it, though. Used to Agatha looking at her like she was something worth studying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This morning, at least, she wasn’t being scrutinized for exhaustion. For once, she’d gotten a decent night’s sleep—though she suspected that had more to do with the warmth still lingering from her weekend with Agatha than anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She drummed her fingers lightly against the side of her cup, letting the silence stretch just enough before offering Agatha a lopsided grin. “So, how was the rest of your weekend?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed, setting down her cup. “Pleasantly quiet. And yours?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed a laugh, stretching her legs under the desk. “Oh, you mean after I left your place floating on a cloud?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, though Rio didn’t miss the way her lips twitched. “Yes, after that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, shifting her weight slightly so that her knee just barely brushed against Agatha’s. She took a slow sip of her coffee before resting her arm on the desk, fingers ghosting near Agatha’s wrist. “Well, I got home to what can only be described as a full-blown intervention.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her gaze flicking briefly to their almost-touch before returning to Rio’s face. “Intervention?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mhm.” Rio let her fingers drift a little closer, her touch featherlight as she traced the edge of Agatha’s wrist. “Alice, her girlfriend Jen, my partner William, and a couple of other firefighters were hanging out. The second I walked through the door, it was like a pack of wolves descending.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “And what exactly were they intervening about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed dramatically. “My love life, apparently. Or lack thereof, until now.” She flicked her gaze up to Agatha’s, something playful but sincere in her eyes. “I was immediately interrogated. Where had I been? Why did I look like I had just won the lottery? Did I—” She coughed, lips twitching. “Did I just get laid?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha inhaled sharply, her fingers curling slightly against the desk as she turned her gaze toward her coffee. “Good Lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, tilting her head slightly. “I set the record straight, don’t worry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should hope so,” Agatha muttered, though the way she shifted, the subtle tightness in her jaw—it wasn’t lost on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Although…” Rio trailed off, shifting just slightly so that her knee pressed more firmly against Agatha’s. She let her fingers skim lightly up the inside of Agatha’s wrist, lingering. “Alice was convinced I at least made out with someone. And well…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t finish the sentence. She didn’t need to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, finally meeting Rio’s eyes, and there it was again—that charge between them, humming just beneath the surface. Rio’s heart picked up speed, but she didn’t look away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?” Agatha murmured, tilting her head ever so slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s lips curled into a slow smile. “Mhm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat there, caught in something that neither of them had quite figured out how to name yet. Small touches, careful movements, the warmth of their knees pressed together under the desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, footsteps echoed in the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They pulled apart instantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha straightened, and stood up, smoothing the front of her skirt as she took a sip of coffee, while Rio leaned back in her chair, clearing her throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A second later, the first students walked in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And of course, Jordan was among them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His gaze landed on them almost immediately, his expression unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning, Dr. Harkness,” he said, his tone carefully neutral as he moved toward the second row. Then, after a brief pause, his eyes flicked to Rio. “Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio met his gaze evenly, giving him a slow nod. “Jordan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha, ever composed, barely acknowledged him, already shifting her attention to her notes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Rio could feel it. The shift. The weight of Jordan’s stare. The subtle tension in the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took another sip of her coffee, stealing one last glance at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It would be fine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They would be fine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if Jordan was already watching a little too closely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>

      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I cannot thank you enough for the overwhelming support! I'm just so so glad that you're all as excited about this as I am.<br />I know I've been spoiling you all with daily updates, but that can only happen because I'm already about five chapters ahead, writing wise. But tomorrow I have class in the morning and in the evening, and somehow need to squeeze work somewhere in between. So I may not have time to proofread and post chapter 10. So it'll probably only be posted late tomorrow night or on Friday.</p><p>Also, Rio's assignment topic is my absolute favorite topic in neuro and I loved it so much last semester. Neuroanatomy is amazing and I'm absolutely in love.</p><p>Thanks again and enjoy!</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>As the lecture began, Agatha slipped into professor mode, her voice measured and confident as she walked the class through today’s topic. She had been teaching for years, but today, she was hyper aware of Rio’s presence in the front row. Hyper aware of the way Rio leaned forward, actively engaged, her fingers tapping absently against the edge of her notebook.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Agatha hadn’t been looking for it, she might have missed the way Rio’s shoulders tensed whenever Jordan spoke up in class, his tone a little too clipped, a little too calculated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha, however, missed nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time the lecture was almost finished, she was already thinking ahead, and had prepared an assignment that would push her students to dig deeper. She tapped the board lightly with the end of her marker.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For your next assignment,” she said, scanning the room, “I want each of you to talk about a key neurological structure and explore its role in cognition and behavior. You’ll examine how it impacts emotions, memory, and even disorders related to its dysfunction.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were murmurs throughout the classroom as students jotted down notes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To make it more interesting,” Agatha continued, her eyes flicking briefly to Rio before looking back at the class, “Through a lottery app, I’ve selected topics for each of you, which you’ll find in your inbox by the end of the day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked slightly at that, and Agatha could tell she was intrigued. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the class proceeded as usual, but as the students packed up their things and began filing out, Agatha noticed something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t linger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no teasing remark. No playful smile thrown her way before she left. Instead, she simply glanced at Agatha, offering a small but knowing smile before slipping out the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha frowned slightly, watching her go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, her phone buzzed in her pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled it out, and when she saw the name on the screen, her lips twitched.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Waiting for you in your office.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, shaking her head slightly before tucking her phone away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed the door behind her, exhaling softly as she took in the sight of Rio already sitting in her office. She was lounging in the chair across from Agatha’s desk, one leg crossed over the other, looking far too comfortable for someone who had just come off a night shift.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor,” Rio greeted, her voice carrying that teasing lilt Agatha was coming to expect from her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched a brow, setting her bag down. “You don’t usually wait for me in my office. Especially after leaving without even a word.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed, stepping closer. “Noticed that, did you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I noticed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something thick settled between them — something warm, charged – the tension was undeniable. Agatha felt it wrap around her, pulling her in like a tide she wasn’t sure she wanted to resist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So.” She folded her arms, trying to ground herself. “Limbic system and emotional processing for you. Satisfied with your assignment?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, shaking her head. “I don’t know how you did it, but you somehow managed to give me the best topic in neuro.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “I didn’t do anything, the lottery thing app did all the work.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? Maybe you’re more in tune with me than you think, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words shouldn’t have sent a thrill through her, but they did. Agatha glanced away for a moment, pushing her hair behind her ear. When she looked back, Rio was watching her intently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed. “How was the rest of your weekend?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled a soft laugh, rubbing the back of her neck. “Oh, you mean after my friends spent the entire night roasting me alive?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips twitched. “That bad, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, looking a little self conscious. “Yeah. It’s fine, though. I mean they were teasing me for a reason and they weren’t wrong,” she teased, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “I probably walked in looking like I’d just won the lottery.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their laughter settled into something softer, something closer. Agatha felt the warmth of it linger in her chest, felt the way it shifted something inside her, like a door she hadn’t realized was locked had just been nudged open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Rio’s voice dropped, quieter now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But for real,” she murmured, “I think they were just happy to see me happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t know what to say to that. Didn’t know how to acknowledge the way it made something tighten in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So instead, she reached out, fingers brushing lightly over Rio’s wrist, just a tentative touch—one that Rio responded to immediately. She turned her hand over, fingers skimming Agatha’s palm before linking loosely with hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breath hitched. It was too much and not enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She barely realized she was leaning forward until Rio’s free hand reached up, fingertips grazing her jaw. Agatha exhaled sharply, her lips parting just slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gaze flickered down, and the tension between them crackled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, as if drawn by a force neither of them could resist, Rio leaned in, brushing her lips over hers. Agatha’s fingers curled around Rio’s, holding her there for just a second longer, just enough to let the moment settle between them, before—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A knock on the door shattered the quiet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They pulled apart, Rio exhaling a sharp breath just as Agatha turned, schooling her features into something far more neutral before walking to the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha barely cracked the door open, just enough to see Thomas Jordan standing there with his usual stiff posture and overly serious expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor,” he said, glancing briefly past her shoulder as if trying to see inside. “I had a question about the assignment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha resisted the urge to sigh. Of course he did. “Go ahead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan adjusted his backpack strap. “Are we supposed to just hand in the report, or will there be a presentation component as well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha kept her voice even. “All the information you need will be in the email I’m sending to the class later today. If you have any further questions, you can schedule a meeting during my office hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan frowned slightly, clearly wanting a more immediate answer, but nodded. “Understood. Thank you, Professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded back, offering a polite smile before closing the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned to find Rio already rolling her eyes, arms crossed. “He’s so insufferable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “You don’t even know what he wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed. “I could hear him, you know. You forget that he’s been in my class for over a year now. He’s the guy who corrects people just for fun and thinks he’s so much better than everyone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave her a knowing look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio pointed at her. “See? Even </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, but before she could respond, Rio was already stepping closer, hands settling lightly on her waist, pulling her in with an ease that made Agatha’s breath hitch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” Rio murmured, tilting her head, “where were we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha barely had time to exhale before Rio kissed her again—this time deeper, lingering. Agatha let herself sink into it, unable to stop herself, stop this undeniable chemistry between them, as her fingers tightened on the fabric of Rio’s lab coat, pulling her closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed against her lips, one hand sliding up to cup her jaw, her thumb brushing lightly against Agatha’s cheek. It was slow, unhurried, like they had all the time in the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio finally pulled back, Agatha couldn’t suppress a sound of protest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. “I’d love to stay here and keep making out with you, but I have a couple of errands to run before I head to the library.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched a brow. “You mean you’re going to ply yourself with even more caffeine?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Tempting, but no. I have a cardiology assignment to work on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked, reaching up to fix the collar of Rio’s lab coat. “Good to know you’re prioritizing your studies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s fingers squeezed lightly at her waist. “Don’t worry, Professor. I always make time for the important things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her stomach flip at the way Rio was looking at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, with one last lingering touch to her arm, Rio stepped back, grabbing her bag. “I’ll see you later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched her go, exhaling slowly, pulse still racing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was in so much trouble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Later that week, Agatha found herself in Wanda’s living room, nursing a drink after work. She had stopped by to pick up Nicky, and Wanda had insisted they stayed for dinner. Now, as Viz took the boys out to the backyard to throw some ball around, she finally found herself with a moment alone with her best friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha traced the rim of her glass with her finger, her thoughts swirling just as much as the whiskey inside. Wanda was watching her intently, that look of patient expectation that only came from years of friendship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. “It’s not that simple.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda arched an eyebrow. “It never is. But let’s hear it, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose. “I am grading her. I’m also her mentor, not just her professor. That makes it more complicated.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda nodded slowly, considering. “Okay, that’s fair. But be honest with yourself—would you ever let your feelings affect how you grade her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha frowned. “Of course not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you hold her to a different standard than any of your other students?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would she expect that from you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Agatha admitted, running a hand through her hair. “She’d probably be offended if I did treat her differently. She’s too damn stubborn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda smirked. “Sounds like someone else I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shot her a dry look before sighing again. “I just don’t want to cross a line I can’t come back from.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda tapped her nails against her glass thoughtfully. “Is this really about ethics? Or is it about you being afraid to want this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s throat felt tight, and she stared into her drink like it might hold the answer. When she finally spoke, her voice was quieter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I’ve always been afraid to want this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda’s expression softened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed. “I spent my whole life trying to be exactly what my mother expected me to be. And that didn’t include—” She hesitated, then forced herself to say it. “Women.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt Wanda’s gaze sharpen, but her voice was gentle. “Did you ever let yourself think about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a bitter huff. “I didn’t let myself do much of anything. I shoved it down, focused on my career, and then on Nicky. I built my life the way I was supposed to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda was quiet for a moment, then tilted her head. “And now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled slowly. “Now I feel freer than I ever have, like a weight has been lifted, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda’s lips quirked. “So something has happened between you two.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hesitated, then sighed, a reluctant smile tugging at her lips. “At my party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda’s eyes lit up. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>I knew it</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It wasn’t—” She hesitated, warmth creeping up her neck. “It wasn’t much. We kissed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda grinned like the cat that got the cream. “And?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip, thinking about the way Rio had touched her—gently, carefully, like she was something precious. About how her heart had raced in a way she hadn’t felt in years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And it was…” She shook her head, fighting back a stupidly giddy smile. “It was good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda laughed, delighted. “Oh, look at you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha groaned. “Don’t start.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have never seen you like this.” Wanda’s grin widened. “You’re glowing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I am not glowing</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You absolutely are!” Wanda leaned in. “So, what happened after?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a sip of her drink to buy herself a second. “She brought me breakfast on Monday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda gasped dramatically. “Stop. Breakfast? The romance of it all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t fight the grin that tugged at her lips. “She showed up before class with coffee and pastries. She even got the ones she saw me having when we ran into each other in the café.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda clutched her chest. “Agatha Harkness, you sap.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha groaned and rolled her eyes. “This was a mistake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, this is the best thing that’s ever happened to me,” Wanda said gleefully. “You, giddy over a woman? I never thought I’d see the day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, laughing despite herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda nudged her foot with her own. “Listen, Ags. I get the concern, I do. But from what I’m seeing? This isn’t just some passing thing for you. This means something. And from what I saw at your party, the way she looked at you, treated you? This isn’t just some fling for her either. Rio is a smart cookie and she wouldn’t just jump into this, with how complex this thing is, just for the hell of it, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, staring at her drink again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda reached over, squeezing her hand. “So, be careful. Be smart. But don’t be afraid to be happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha met her gaze, something settling in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the first time in a long time, she thought maybe—just maybe—she could be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Saturday, Agatha hadn’t planned to be out for long. She and Nicky had spent the morning at the museum, then wandered into a street fair they’d stumbled upon on their way home. The air smelled like roasted nuts, cider, and freshly baked bread, the crisp air of the fall season making it all the more inviting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Nicky happily munched on kettle corn, Agatha found herself texting Rio. It had become a habit — small check-ins, jokes, things that made her think of her. They hadn’t seen each other since Monday as both had been incredibly busy this week, and though it had only been a few days, it was ridiculous how much Agatha had felt the absence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How’s your Saturday so far?</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Eventful. Nicky dragged me to the museum, and now we’re at a street fair. My arms are full of things I didn’t plan on buying.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Classic. What’d he con you into this time?</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>A dinosaur book, and a bag of kettle corn the size of his torso.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He’s got taste. Where’s this street fair?</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Why? You planning on stalking me?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Always</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes but felt warmth bloom in her chest. She was about to type a reply when Nicky suddenly tugged at her sleeve.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mom! Look, it’s Rio! Over there!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head snapped up, her stomach flipping before she even registered where he was pointing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And there she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stood by a food truck, her head thrown back in laughter at something Alice had said. She looked absolutely gorgeous — jeans, boots, and a fitted deep green sweater under her leather jacket. The sight of her, casual and relaxed, made something tighten in Agatha’s ribs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she could react, Nicky took off running.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned at the sound of his voice, her face lighting up just in time for him to crash into her. She let out a surprised laugh, crouching down. “Whoa! Hey, kid! Didn’t know I’d be running into my favorite Harkness today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha followed at a more measured pace, schooling her features even as her pulse hammered in her throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, well,” Rio grinned as she stood, sliding her hands into her jacket pockets. “Fancy meeting you here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice, standing beside her, glanced between them with a smirk. “Wow, what are the odds, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Chicago’s a big city.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile was all mischief. “And yet, here you are. Stalking me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes. “You wish.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked up at Rio excitedly. “Can you come with us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitated for the first time, glancing at Agatha, as if waiting for permission.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, shaking her head fondly. “Rio probably has plans already, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. “Actually, I don’t. Me and Alice were just hanging out. We were about to go home, to be honest,” her grin was teasing but hopeful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great, so now you can come with us, right? Please, it’ll be fun!” Nicky insisted, and Rio looked at her again. Agatha nodded, an amused grin on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure, why not?” Rio replied casually, but even she could hear the slight giddiness in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice snorted. “You two are ridiculous.” Agatha shot her an exasperated look, but Alice only winked before stepping back. “I’ll leave you lovebirds to it. See you at home, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Subtle,” Rio muttered under her breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha ignored the heat creeping up her neck. “What were you even doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Day off,” Rio said, falling into step beside her. “Alice and I were just grabbing food. Thought I’d have a rare, relaxing Saturday. And then—” she nudged Agatha’s shoulder playfully “—you appeared to torment me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha fought back a smile. “Oh, how tragic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They wove through the street fair together, stopping to browse little stalls. Nicky dragged them toward a booth selling handcrafted wooden puzzles, and Rio crouched beside him, listening intently as he explained which one he wanted. Agatha found herself watching them, a strange, unfamiliar warmth settling in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt easy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, when Rio straightened and shot her a look—soft, searching—Agatha didn’t fight it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hadn’t expected to spend her afternoon like this—walking side by side with Rio through the street fair, Nicky happily bouncing between them. It felt domestic in a way that made her heart trip over itself if she thought about it too much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, she couldn’t bring herself to put distance between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t anything obvious. Not really. But Rio’s presence had a way of filling up the space around her, drawing her in without even trying. She walked close enough that their arms brushed occasionally, and every time it happened, Agatha had to force herself not to react.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Nicky had taken full advantage of Rio’s enthusiasm. He had her crouching at almost every stall, helping him inspect everything from polished stones to tiny model airplanes. He talked nonstop, and Rio, for her part, seemed to be enjoying every second of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At one point, she even threw Agatha a grin over her shoulder. “Is he always like this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “Only when he likes someone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile softened at that as she looked back down at Nicky, who was currently debating whether to get a tiny wooden fox or a dolphin. “Good to know I made the cut.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried not to let that mean something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, they found themselves in front of a coffee stall. The scent of freshly brewed espresso filled the air, and without thinking, Agatha glanced up at the menu. Before she could even open her mouth, Rio turned to the barista and said, “A black coffee, another one with a splash of vanilla and a hot chocolate, please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha blinked at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio just smirked. “I pay attention.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That did something to Agatha’s chest that she absolutely refused to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they had their drinks, they found a small bench under a tree, where Nicky happily dug into his hot chocolate, his legs swinging back and forth. Rio settled beside Agatha, leaning back with an easy sort of confidence that made her look like she belonged there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Rio said, sipping her coffee. “Aside from being dragged to a museum and bribed into this fair, how’s your day been?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Bribed? Please.” Rio gave her a knowing look. Agatha took a slow sip of her coffee, as if considering. “It’s not that terrible, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. “Neither is the company.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, letting the moment settle. It had been a while since she felt this… light. Not just because of Rio, but because she wasn’t wearing the weight of work, of responsibilities, of expectations so heavily today.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced at Rio. “What about you? Doing anything else today besides running into me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed, tilting her head slightly. “Nah. Just planned to relax. Maybe catch up on some reading.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Reading? For fun?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. “Shocking, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very. I didn’t think you even had time for stuff like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, then nudged her playfully. “What about you? Any wild Saturday night plans?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m a mother to an eight-year-old and a professor. Wild doesn’t exactly apply to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed. “Please. I’ve seen you at work, Dr. Harkness. You terrify grown ass humans on a daily basis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “And yet, here you are, voluntarily spending time with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gaze flickered, something unreadable passing through her expression. Then, before Agatha could dissect it, she grinned. “Guess I like living on the edge.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Agatha could formulate a response, Nicky perked up beside them. “Rio, can we go look at the toy swords again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shot Agatha a look. “Toy swords?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. “It’s a phase.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky tugged at Rio’s sleeve insistently. “Please?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, already standing. “Alright, kid, let’s go find your future weapon of choice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha just shook her head, watching as they wandered off toward one of the stalls again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was dangerous. This feeling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But for now, she allowed herself to enjoy it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Nicky had picked out his toy sword — a wooden cutlass with intricate carvings on the handle — he was already fully immersed in an imaginary battle, darting ahead and swinging it through the crisp autumn air. The soft glow of streetlights flickered on as the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the pavement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha and Rio followed at a more leisurely pace, their hands tucked into their coat pockets, the warmth of the day giving way to the first hints of a chilly evening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, aside from grading and keeping me in line, what do you actually do for fun?” Rio asked, her voice light, teasing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha made a sound that was half a scoff, half amusement. “You think I have time for fun?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled. “I think you should.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, tilting her head slightly as she considered it. “I read. I cook. I try to get Nicky outside as much as possible before the cold settles in and he refuses to leave the house.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “Sounds </span>
  <em>
    <span>wild</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she deadpanned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shot her a look. “You’re really set on this idea that I should be some kind of party animal, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a party animal, necessarily,” Rio bumped her shoulder lightly. “But I don’t know. You’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness</span>
  </em>
  <span>. A legend. I just assumed you had some secret life. A jazz club membership, a hidden talent for poker, super powers…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Sorry to disappoint. I’m tragically boring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I refuse to believe that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave her a pointed look. “And what about you? What do you do for fun when you’re not saving lives and keeping your classmates entertained with stories about chaotic bodily functions?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Wow, you really do listen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she was smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Rio continued. “On my rare days off? I sleep. I watch dumb TV with Alice. Sometimes I go running. Mostly, I just exist in a state of exhaustion and hope for the best.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “That’s terrible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re one to talk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Agatha could respond, she felt it—light at first, barely there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The brush of Rio’s fingers against hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It could have been an accident, a momentary slip. But then it happened again—deliberate this time—and before Agatha could even think about pulling away, their fingers slid together, disappearing between the folds of their coats like a quiet secret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was ridiculous, really, how much warmth bloomed from something so simple.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t comment on it. She just held Agatha’s hand, her thumb grazing over her knuckles in an absent, thoughtful motion, as if it were second nature. As if it had always been this easy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Agatha?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She let it happen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, she let Rio’s arm drape lazily over her shoulders, let herself lean in slightly, let herself want. It was stronger than her, this magnetic pull she felt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked like that for a while — soft touches, fleeting brushes, quiet things that made Agatha’s pulse hum under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time the sun had fully set and the fair had begun winding down, she knew they weren’t ready to let the night end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky was still full of energy, swinging his sword at imaginary enemies, his laughter bright against the cool air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hesitated. She should say goodnight. She should keep this simple.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she wanted more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We could head back to my place,” she said, keeping her voice even, casual. “If you want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio raised a brow. “For?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled. “I don’t know. Coffee? Wine? A movie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio studied her for a moment, and Agatha felt her heartbeat stutter when Rio’s lips curved into that slow, knowing smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Rio said, her voice softer this time, something warm settling behind her eyes. “I’d like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And just like that, the night wasn’t over.</span>
</p><p><br />

  <p>
  <span>The door closed behind them with a soft click, and Rio exhaled, feeling an almost tangible shift in the atmosphere as they entered Agatha’s home. There was a quiet comfort here, an inviting kind of warmth that felt both familiar and new at the same time. Nicky’s laughter echoed through the hallway as he ran past them, brandishing his toy sword like a warrior preparing for battle. Rio’s heart softened at the sound — she couldn’t help but smile. It was rare to see Agatha this at ease, and she felt fortunate to witness it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Rio removed her shoes by the door, Agatha turned to her with a smile. “Make yourself at home,” she said, her tone easy as she headed toward the kitchen. “I’ll pour you some wine. Red, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perfect,” Rio replied, glancing around the living room while she made her way toward the couch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How  was your last shift?” Agatha asked from the kitchen, the sound of wine pouring into a glass making Rio’s body relax even more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stretched her legs out and leaned back against the couch, closing her eyes for a second. “Better than usual. Quiet night, so I actually got some sleep.” She paused, letting the relaxation settle in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been a long week, and this quiet evening with Agatha felt like the perfect escape. They had fallen into a comfortable silence after the last conversation, both of them enjoying the warmth of each other’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Rio began, her voice light, “you’ve asked about my days off, but I don’t think I’ve ever asked you how you unwind after a busy week. I’m guessing ‘binge-watching medical documentaries’ is out of the question?” She asked with a teasing tone to her voice as Agatha sat down next to her, handing her a glass of wine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled softly, her thumb grazing Rio’s arm where it rested on the back of the couch. “As much as I love a good brain surgery marathon, I try to leave work behind when I can. I usually spend time with Nicky, or I’ll get caught up in something more…mindless.” She hesitated, then added, “But I’ll admit, sometimes, it’s nice to do nothing at all for a change.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her fingers absently tracing patterns on her wine glass. She could tell Agatha was holding something back, but she didn’t press. Instead, she let her mind wander back to the past, to things she hadn’t thought about in a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a moment, Rio finally spoke, her voice subdued. “Sometimes I wish I could just stop time for a bit, you know. Not worry about work, not worry about what’s coming next. Sometimes, when you’re going through something… this…moment when everything just falls apart, and you’re left standing there trying to piece things back together. But you still have to keep going anyway because life doesn’t stop just because you’re feeling down. You know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned slightly, sensing the shift in Rio’s tone. She reached out instinctively, her fingers brushing Rio’s. Rio didn’t pull away, so Agatha let her hand linger there, feeling the warmth between them. “What happened?” Agatha asked gently, the concern evident in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gaze flickered to the floor, her lips pressing together in a tight line before she spoke. “A few years ago…right around the time my grandmother died. I was in a relationship with a woman. We were together for about a year. At the time, I thought she was the one.” She paused, her voice dropping. “But things didn’t go as planned. It was like everything came crashing down at once. My grandmother was gone, and this woman—well, she ended up leaving, too. I just wasn’t enough, I guess. Or my truckload of issues and grief were too much for her to handle, I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of unspoken hurt. Agatha didn’t say anything immediately. Instead, she moved closer, her fingers softly brushing against Rio’s arm, urging her to continue. Rio didn’t flinch, and it felt easier to speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I put everything into that relationship,” Rio continued, her voice barely above a whisper. “And in the end, I learned the hard way that sometimes, no matter how much you care, it’s just not enough for someone else. She left, and I was left picking up the pieces while I watched my grandma fade away. It was one of the loneliest times in my life.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha squeezed her hand, her voice filled with quiet understanding. “I’m sorry. That sounds… incredibly hard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up at her, offering a small, grateful smile. “It was. But I guess…I don’t know, it taught me a lot about myself. About how I deal with loss and how I let people in.” She glanced at Agatha, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s hand again before resting there. “I still have trust issues, though. I don’t really let people get too close. Not like that. Not unless I feel comfortable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart ached for Rio, for the vulnerability she was allowing herself to show. It made Agatha want to pull her closer, to erase the pain that Rio had been holding onto for so long. But she didn’t. She stayed in her place, listening, offering support.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a long moment, Rio broke the silence again, her voice hesitant. “So, um… what about you? You’ve been pretty open about your life, but… I guess I’ve never asked about Nicky’s father. Is there a story there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly recovered, taking a deep breath before she spoke. “Yeah, there is. A very short one,” she said softly, her fingers lightly tracing Rio’s hand. “It’s not exactly a fairytale. His father… well, I met him at a neurology congress. He was charming, smart, the kind of guy you’d expect to be at a conference like that. We had a couple of drinks, talked about work, and one thing led to another.” She paused, collecting her thoughts. “When I found out I was pregnant, I told him. And he… he said, ‘Have a nice life.’ That was it. I never heard from him again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked in surprise, her heart sinking for Agatha. “That’s… harsh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave a wry laugh, though there was no humor in it. “Yeah, it was. But honestly, it wasn’t much of a loss. Nicky and I have been doing just fine without him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand gently, her thumb brushing over the knuckles in a comforting gesture. “It sounds like you’ve been doing a great job. You and Nicky, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled, her eyes softening as she looked at Rio. “Thank you. I try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They fell into a companionable silence for a moment, both lost in their thoughts, their hands still intertwined. It was a moment of peace between them, of connection that neither of them had expected, but both were beginning to cherish.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Rio spoke, her voice low and warm. “I’m really glad we’re doing this. Getting to know each other… like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked up at her, her smile genuine. “Me too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for a moment, the weight of their pasts didn’t matter. All that mattered was the present. Just the two of them, sitting close, their hands touching, the quiet of the evening wrapping around them like a comforting embrace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha and Rio sat there, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. Nicky had been unusually quiet, his toy sword discarded on the floor as he curled up on the couch with his blanket, eyes flicking between the TV screen and the two women.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few moments of calm, Nicky looked up from his blanket with wide eyes. “Can we watch a movie?” he asked, his voice laced with that childlike enthusiasm that could melt anyone’s heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha and Rio exchanged glances, both of them smiling. “Sure,” Rio replied, her voice soft and warm. “What do you want to watch, Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky gave a dramatic sigh and flopped down next to Rio, his blanket covering most of the couch. “Something action-y, like superheroes. Or maybe pirates,” he added with a mischievous grin, clearly in the mood for adventure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, adjusting herself on the couch to make room for Nicky. “Pirates, huh? Alright, I’m in. What about you, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha, who had been looking at her phone, paused for a moment before grinning. “Pirates it is,” she said, getting up to grab the remote. “I’ll go make some popcorn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky cheered and immediately climbed onto the couch next to Rio. He snuggled up to her with his blanket, looking up at her with such childlike expression, that Rio gave him a soft smile, her hand gently brushing his hair as he settled in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha returned to the couch with popcorn, and put the bowl on Rio’s lap. Then she sat down beside Rio, her arm naturally resting over the back of the couch, lightly touching Rio’s shoulder as she settled in next to her. The intimacy of it felt comfortable, almost natural, and Rio leaned into the touch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, what’s the deal with these pirates?” Rio asked Nicky, trying to keep things light and playful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked up at her, his eyes sparkling with excitement. “They’re the coolest! They fight on ships and find treasure!” He paused, clearly deep in thought. “Also, they usually have swords. Lots of swords.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh softly, reaching for the remote to queue up a movie. “I think I know which one we’re watching,” she said, and before long, the movie began, a familiar pirate adventure flashing on the screen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They settled into a comfortable rhythm as the movie played. Nicky occasionally piped up with commentary, his voice bright and full of energy. Rio laughed at his excitement, her hand still resting on his shoulder as he leaned into her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the movie progressed, Rio could feel her body relaxing further into the couch, Agatha’s presence beside her grounding her. The room was filled with Nicky’s soft chatter and the action-packed sounds from the film, but for Rio, the most significant noise was the quiet, tender connection between her and Agatha—the subtle brush of fingers against each other, the gentle squeeze of a hand when Nicky wasn’t looking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while, Nicky yawned and curled up against Rio’s side, his eyelids drooping. It wasn’t long before his small, steady breaths signaled that he’d fallen asleep. Rio smiled down at him, brushing a few stray locks of hair from his forehead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked over at Rio with a soft smile, her voice barely above a whisper. “He’s out cold.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her heart full as she watched the peaceful expression on Nicky’s face. “He’s adorable. I could get used to this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand slid from the back of the couch to rest on Rio’s shoulder, her fingers gently grazing her skin. “I’m glad you’re here,” Agatha murmured, her voice softer now. “I like having you around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned her head slightly, her eyes meeting Agatha’s. “I like being here,” she said, her words carrying a weight that was hard to ignore. She didn’t need to say more; the connection between them, the softness of the moment, said it all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The movie ended, and the soft glow of the TV screen filled the room. Nicky remained asleep, cuddled up with his blanket, while Rio and Agatha shared a moment of quiet contentment. They didn’t rush to move, staying close as the world outside seemed to fade away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let her fingers graze Agatha’s arm, a small touch, but one that felt like a promise of something more. And Agatha responded, her hand gently brushing Rio’s, a silent invitation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while, Rio stretched, feeling the warmth of the room and the comfort of Agatha’s presence settle around her. “I should probably head out,” she said softly, trying not to disturb the peaceful atmosphere.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, her arm tightening around Rio’s shoulders for a moment before pulling back. “You don’t have to leave,” she said, her voice quiet, but the longing in it clear. “Stay a little longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, her heart light. “Alright. If you’re sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her fingers lightly grazing the back of Rio’s hand. “I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so they sat together, the world outside forgotten for now, as they watched over Nicky, their quiet bond growing stronger with each passing moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had just left to put Nicky to bed, tucking him into her arms with a soft kiss on his hair and whispering to Rio that she’d be right back. Rio watched her disappear up the stairs, taking the moment to refill their glasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The house was quiet, wrapped in the kind of stillness that came with the late hours. The soft glow from the fireplace flickered across the walls, making everything feel warmer, more intimate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha returned, Rio looked up, offering her a glass with an easy smile. “Thought you might need a top-up,” she said, voice low and teasing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha accepted it, their fingers brushing for just a second. It was barely a touch, but Rio felt it like a spark against her skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Agatha murmured, settling beside her again. The space between them felt smaller than before, like the room itself had shrunk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio took a sip of her wine, watching Agatha over the rim of her glass. She looked different like this—softer, more unguarded. It made Rio’s chest feel tight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shifted slightly, her knee brushing against Agatha’s. The touch was light, almost accidental, but Agatha inhaled sharply. That reaction sent a slow, steady heat curling through Rio’s stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She let her fingers drift over the back of Agatha’s hand, testing, waiting. Agatha didn’t pull away. Instead, she exhaled, a shaky kind of breath, and turned her hand over, letting their palms press together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never thought I’d… feel this way about a woman,” Agatha admitted quietly. Her eyes were on their hands, her fingers tracing slow, uncertain patterns against Rio’s palm. “I didn’t even let myself think about it for so long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio squeezed her hand gently, grounding her. “I get it,” she said, voice steady. “I think I always knew. But even then, it wasn’t easy.” She hesitated, then admitted, “It took me a long time to be okay with it. But I never questioned it. And I never doubted it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked up at her then, something unreadable in her gaze. “I don’t know how you did it,” she murmured. “I wish I’d been as strong as you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “You are strong, Agatha. You just don’t give yourself enough credit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled softly, like she was letting go of something heavy. “With you… it’s different. I feel like I can finally breathe. You know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart did something unsteady in her chest. “You don’t have to figure it all out right now. It’s a process,” she said, voice softer than she intended. “We don’t have to be anything you’re not ready for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was quiet for a moment. Then, slowly, she tugged at Rio’s hand, closing the distance between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kiss started slow, hesitant. Like they were both still learning the shape of this, of them. Rio let herself sink into it, into the warmth of Agatha’s lips, the way her breath hitched when Rio tilted her head just slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t sure who moved first — who deepened the kiss, who made that soft, needy sound — but suddenly it wasn’t tentative anymore. It was warm and heady, Agatha’s fingers curling into the fabric of Rio’s shirt, pulling her closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let her hands drift, one settling on Agatha’s waist, the other sliding up her arm, feeling the warmth of her skin through the thin fabric of her sweater. Agatha was solid beneath her touch, yet she trembled slightly as Rio’s fingers traced higher, stopping just below her jaw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They broke apart just long enough to catch their breath, but neither of them pulled away. Agatha’s eyes were darker now, her lips slightly parted, and Rio had never seen her like this — so undone, so unguarded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand slid up Rio’s chest, fingers toying with the collar of her shirt. “I don’t want to stop,” she admitted, voice barely more than a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed hard, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s cheek. “Then don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, something shifting between them. She leaned in again, this time with more certainty, her body pressing just slightly into Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And just like that, the space between them disappeared entirely as Rio encouraged Agatha to straddle her. Once Agatha settled on her lap, her core pressed into Rio in the most delicious way, she let a low groan escape. Rio felt the sound reverberate straight to her core, as she splayed her hands on Agatha’s ass to pull her closer, to bring her hips closer to hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If anyone asked her, Rio would definitely say this was her definition of heaven. The way Agatha ground her hips against hers instinctively — seeking any and all pleasure she could get — did the most wonderful things to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They kissed deeply, all tongues and teeth, their bodies seeking a way to just melt into each other in search of release. Rio tried to keep her head semi-clear, her hands slowly traveling to the button of Agatha’s jeans. Her fingers dove inside the thick fabric just slightly, before tugging on her shirt and pulling it up until Agatha lifted her arms so she could slide it off and then throw it somewhere behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sight of Agatha’s creamy skin on display as her chest heaved with her heavy breathing was something Rio would never forget. Agatha wore a purple lace bra that proudly displayed her hard nipples through the see-through fabric. Rio first brought her hands up and gently ran her fingers through her nipple, squeezing it with care. When Agatha moaned, she felt empowered and didn’t hesitate to replace her fingers with her tongue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment her tongue touched the hard nub, Rio felt the heat between her legs increase as Agatha moaned again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, you’re so hot,” she murmured, peppering her chest with kisses. But then the small rational part of her brain caught up with her, and she realized they were still in the living room. “Hey, maybe we should take this upstairs?” Rio whispered in her ear, her hands running over her sides, delighting in how Agatha was trying to suppress a moan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nuzzled against her neck, letting her tongue taste the skin right over where her pulse was hammering like a hummingbird’s wings. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmhm. Yeah, we should—” Rio delighted as she watched her usually so composed professor try to pull herself together, clearing her throat. “We should take this to the bedroom, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, pulling her into a deep kiss, tongues dancing in the most delicious way again for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lead the way,” she murmured, watching as Agatha tried to regulate her breathing and then finally, stood up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sight of Agatha in only her see-through bra and jeans, seeing her hard nipples pressing against the fabric, was enough to bring Rio to her knees. But she took a deep breath and accepted Agatha’s outstretched hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They barely made it five steps in before Agatha pressing Rio against the wall, claiming her mouth with hers with a ferocity that nearly made Rio stumble. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, if you keep this up, we’re not going to make it to your bed, professor,” she teased, feeling her brain nearly short-circuiting. Agatha looked at her with dark eyes and a lust-filled grin, before pulling her by the hand the rest of the way up the stairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment Agatha pushed her through a door, all bets were off. She took the time to lock the door behind her, before coming back to Rio, claiming her lips in another searing kiss. Rio wrapped her arms around her waist, pulling her in as close as humanly possible. As her hands explored her back, Rio opened her bra, stepping back for just a moment so Agatha could take it off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taking a moment to appreciate the glorious view in front of her, Rio groaned in delight, before slowly reaching out to brush the tips of her fingers against Agatha’s rosy nipples.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re so beautiful, Agatha. So perfect.” Her hands traveled to Agatha’s jeans again, flipping the button open. “May I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At Agatha’s nod, she slowly pulled her zipper down, before pushing her jeans down her hips. Agatha was wearing a simple pair of black panties, and the contrast against her skin was driving Rio insane. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She ran her hands down Agatha’s side, down her ass, squeezing it in her hands as her mouth played with Agatha’s nipples, her tongue gently teasing them over the fabric. When she let out a moan, Rio groaned in satisfaction, feeling her own panties dampen at the sound. This was all she ever wanted — to hear this sound for the rest of her life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The way Agatha was so responsive to her touch, so vocal, had Rio finally letting her fingers slowly travel to the heat between Agatha’s legs. At the first touch, both moaned, and Rio felt a surge of pride at how damp her underwear already was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Straightening up, Rio captured Agatha’s lips with hers in a deep kiss as she slowly teased her clit with a barely there touch. When Agatha’s hips bucked into her hand, instinctively chasing more friction, Rio grinned into the kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Patience, beautiful” she teased, chuckling when Agatha groaned in frustration and shot her a pointed look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop teasing me, Rio,” she whined, hips trying to chase her hand again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Rio only swept her up in another kiss, before turning her around and walking her backwards until Agatha’s legs hit the bed. “Lie down for me,” she encouraged, her voice just a murmur in her ear. And the way Agatha shivered at that had Rio grinning proudly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once Agatha complied, Rio crawled up towards her, covering her body with hers as she kissed her again, hands tracing the expanse of Agatha’s skin. Peppering kisses down her neck, then her collarbone, and chest, she took her time to gently suck on her nipples one more time, now that she knew how sensitive they were. Agatha’s hand found its way to her hair to keep her there and Rio groaned again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, when she had Agatha bucking her hips up again, she moved on from her breasts to slowly place a trail of open mouthed kisses down her stomach until she reached the edge of her black panties. The heat and the smell of Agatha’s arousal made her nearly delirious with desire, and she let her tongue run over her slit, still over the fabric.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, Rio, please,” Agatha’s needy moan hit her like lightning, the way she was so turned on getting to be nearly unbearable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Settling herself on the bed, she pressed her hips down on the mattress, trying to find any kind of friction to take some of the edge off before she exploded. Agatha moaned frustrated again as Rio placed kisses down her inner thigh, over her mound, her hands flying to Rio’s hair again to guide her back to where she needed her the most.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio ran her tongue over fabric again, delighting in the way Agatha moaned, and then finally pushed the fabric aside, being presented with the feast of Agatha’s wet heat. Before continuing, she encouraged Agatha to lift up her hips so she could slide her panties down her gorgeous toned legs, before settling back into position. Letting her fingers gently run through her folds, Rio moaned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So wet for me, gorgeous. Look at that. So beautiful,” she whispered, and Agatha whined, which quickly turned to a moan when Rio applied a bit more pressure to her clit. “I want to make you feel so good, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, Rio,” she whined again, and Rio finally complied, running her tongue over the extension of her slit, making Agatha moan loudly. “Fuck!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m getting there,” Rio replied cheekily, making Agatha let out a breathless laugh. Then she dived back in, allowing her tongue to explore her folds, groaning at her delicious taste. “God, you taste even better than I imagined.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha moaned again, her hips chasing Rio’s mouth involuntarily, her breathing becoming ragged with each passing moment. When Rio gently sucked on her clit, Agatha gasped, and had to cover her mouth with her own hand, as Rio relentlessly flicked her bundle of nerves with her tongue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio felt that Agatha was getting close, she slowly slid a finger in, testing to see if it was something she would like. Agatha moaned loudly again, and Rio slid another, curling them up, and that made Agatha completely lose control. Her moans were loud, but music to Rio’s ears. As she fucked Agatha with her fingers, she finally looked up, only to be met with the most gorgeous view. Agatha was holding herself up on her elbows, watching her, her mouth open in pleasure, cheeks flushed, eyes heavy-lidded and dark with lust, and that was nearly enough to make Rio cum on the spot, without even being touched.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, you feel so good, baby. You’re taking me so well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s answering groan was enough to make her nearly collapse in a puddle of desire and lust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, don’t stop,” Agatha moaned, letting herself fall back on the bed, hands flying to Rio’s hair to guide her back to her heat. “God, Rio, don’t stop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio got the message and immediately let her tongue run over clit again, sucking it while she curled her fingers inside, and that was the breaking point for Agatha. Her body froze, a silent scream expressed on her beautiful face, only to be followed by waves and waves of spasms as her orgasm washed over her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was an image that would be forever engraved in Rio’s brain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio woke up to the soft glow of morning light filtering through the curtains, casting the room in a warm golden hue. She blinked a few times, adjusting to the quiet, her body still heavy with the remnants of sleep. And then she felt it—Agatha, curled up against her, warm and soft, her breathing slow and even.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a contented sigh, sinking deeper into the mattress. Last night had been… everything. She had taken her time with Agatha, savoring every touch, every quiet gasp, every way Agatha’s body responded to her. She had wanted Agatha to feel worshipped, to know without a doubt that she was safe, cared for, wanted. And she had. Rio could still feel the ghost of Agatha’s fingers tracing her back, still hear the way her name had fallen from Agatha’s lips like a prayer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned her head slightly, taking in the sight of Agatha sleeping beside her. Her dark hair was tousled, a few strands falling over her face. Her lips — God, those lips — were slightly parted, her breathing deep and even. She looked so peaceful, so soft in a way Rio wasn’t sure anyone else got to see. It made something deep in Rio’s chest tighten with affection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t believe how happy she felt. How natural this was. Like it was always meant to happen. She had been with people before, but nothing had ever felt quite like this. This felt… inevitable in the best way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Smiling to herself, Rio carefully reached out, brushing a stray lock of hair from Agatha’s cheek. Agatha stirred at the touch, a soft hum escaping her lips before she slowly blinked awake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmm,” Agatha murmured, her voice still thick with sleep as her eyes fluttered open. “You’re awake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, propping herself up on one elbow as she looked down at her. “You’re very observant, professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a small laugh, her lips curving into a sleepy smile. “Mmm, don’t call me that right now,” she mumbled, her voice still scratchy from sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, leaning down to press a soft kiss to Agatha’s shoulder. “Okay, what should I call you, then?” she teased, her voice low.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached up, running a lazy hand through Rio’s messy curls before pulling her closer. “Just Agatha,” she murmured, her lips brushing against Rio’s in a way that sent warmth flooding through her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed, deepening the kiss slightly, keeping it slow, lazy, like neither of them were in a hurry to be anywhere else. She could do this forever — wake up beside Agatha, kiss her slow and deep, exist in this little bubble where nothing else mattered but the warmth between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Knock, knock, knock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mom?” Nicky’s voice came from the other side of the door. “Why’s your door locked?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stiffened immediately, eyes going wide. Rio barely had time to pull back before Agatha was scrambling to sit up, running a hand through her hair like that would somehow make her look less disheveled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh... one second, sweetheart!” Agatha called out, voice pitched just a little too high.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip, trying to stifle a laugh as Agatha turned to glare at her. “Don’t you dare,” Agatha mouthed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio just smirked, stretching her arms over her head before flopping back onto the bed, just admiring the view as Agatha looked around her room naked. “You should probably go see what he wants before he thinks you’re hiding something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shot her one last warning look before grabbing her robe from the chair and pulling it on. She cleared her throat, trying to sound as casual as possible. “I’ll be right there, honey!” she called, moving toward the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, biting her lip as she watched Agatha try to compose herself. As Agatha unlocked the door and stepped out into the hallway, Rio couldn’t help but think—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yeah. She could definitely get used to this.</span>
</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha moved around the kitchen in a steady, almost meditative rhythm as she cooked. Nicky sat on a stool beside her, watching intently as she flipped pancakes and scrambled eggs. He had been in charge of mixing the batter, his small hands careful as he stirred, but Agatha took over when it came time for the hot pan.</p><p>The morning was slow and easy, warmth filling the space between them. But Agatha’s mind kept drifting — kept replaying last night. The quiet intimacy, the way Rio had been so attuned to her, so patient, so undeniably present. It had been… more than she ever expected, more than she even thought she could have.</p><p>She caught herself smiling as she plated the eggs. It wasn’t just the physical closeness that had taken her breath away — it was the way Rio made her feel seen, the way she made space for Agatha in a way no one ever had before.</p><p>The sound of footsteps descending the stairs pulled her out of her thoughts. She turned to see Rio walking into the kitchen, looking effortlessly beautiful despite the slightly rumpled edges of her clothes. Her hair was still tousled from sleep, and she met Agatha’s gaze with a small, warm smile.</p><p>“Morning,” Rio greeted, her voice still carrying the rasp of sleep.</p><p>Nicky turned to look at her, blinking in surprise. His eyes flicked to Agatha in clear confusion, as if trying to piece together why Rio was here at breakfast time.</p><p>“Hey, buddy,” Rio said with an easy grin, slipping into one of the chairs at the table.</p><p>Nicky glanced back at Agatha, who kept her voice casual as she said, “Rio stayed over because it got late last night. We were talking a lot, and it made more sense than her driving home in the middle of the night.”</p><p>Nicky processed that for a moment, then shrugged. “Oh. Okay.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, leaning her arms on the table. “You okay with me sticking around for pancakes?”</p><p>Nicky nodded, grinning. “Yeah! Mom makes the best pancakes.”</p><p>Rio winked. “Good to know.”</p><p>Breakfast was easy, full of light conversation and laughter. Rio teased Nicky about his favorite soccer players, stole a bite of his pancake just to hear him protest, and shared stories about the firehouse. Agatha watched it all unfold, sipping her coffee, feeling something settle in her chest—something content. Something she wasn’t sure she was ready to name.</p><p>After breakfast, they lingered in the living room for a while. Nicky built something elaborate with his Legos while Rio and Agatha just hung out, their knees bumping occasionally, their conversation flowing easily. But eventually, Rio checked the time and let out a small sigh.</p><p>“I should get going,” she said, stretching. “I’ve got a shift tonight, and I still have a few things to do at home before then.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, pushing down the small pang of disappointment. “Of course.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her jacket, but before she could slip it on, Agatha stepped closer. Her hand brushed over Rio’s wrist, just enough to make her pause. “Last night was…” She hesitated, searching for the right words. “Amazing,” she finally settled on, a quiet certainty in her voice.</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, her eyes holding something deep, something knowing. She reached out, tucking a stray curl behind Agatha’s ear. “Yeah,” she murmured, a slow, lazy smile tugging at her lips. “It really was.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, and before she could overthink it, she leaned in, pressing a lingering, unhurried kiss to Rio’s lips. It was different from last night, slower, steeped in the warmth of the morning and the quiet understanding between them. When she pulled back, Rio just looked at her for a moment, her thumb brushing lightly against Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Rio promised.</p><p>Agatha nodded, watching as Rio turned to Nicky, who was now setting up a game to play on his Xbox.</p><p>“See you later, Rio!” Nicky called, with a bright smile on his face.</p><p>Rio grinned and walked over to him. “Later, kiddo.” She held up her hand for a high-five, which Nicky returned with enthusiasm. Then, with one last glance at Agatha, she squeezed her hand as she passed by her, and then she was out the door.</p><p>Agatha lingered for a second before turning back to the kitchen, wiping down the counters and putting away the last few dishes. Nicky reappeared a few minutes later, kicking his soccer ball lightly against the floor.</p><p>“That was nice,” he said casually. “Having breakfast with Rio.”</p><p>Agatha turned to look at him, considering his words for a moment before asking, “Do you like Rio?”</p><p>Nicky nodded immediately. “Yeah, she’s cool. And funny. And nice.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, leaning back against the counter. “Yeah, she is.”</p><p>And as she stood there, letting the quiet settle around them, she realized how much those words meant.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>Monday morning arrived, and Agatha’s mind buzzed with a mix of excitement and anxiety. She had sent Rio a quick text while sipping her coffee.</p><p>Agatha</p><p>How was your shift? If you’re able to get to Northwestern earlier today, I’ll have breakfast ready for us.</p><p>She set the phone down, finishing her coffee and starting to organize her papers for the day. The thought of seeing Rio again brought a flutter to her chest. It had been less than a day since they’d seen each other, but already, Agatha was eager for their next moment together.</p><p>A few minutes later, her phone buzzed.</p><p>Rio </p><p>I’ll be there in 30 minutes. And don’t worry about breakfast, I can grab us something on the way.</p><p>Agatha smiled at the text but quickly typed back, her fingers moving across the screen as she shook her head at Rio’s usual insistence on providing for everyone else.</p><p>Agatha</p><p>No, I’ve got it this time. You don’t need to worry. See you soon.</p><p>She put the phone in her coat pocket, and made a quick run to the café on campus to grab them something to eat. She carefully selected the pastries she had seen Rio favor, and got her black coffee and her own to go, a flutter of butterflies excitedly flapping their imaginary wings in her stomach. </p><p>Not even thirty minutes later, Rio walked into the lecture hall. The moment Agatha saw her, however, her heart sank a little. Rio’s usual vibrant energy was dimmed, replaced by a tired slouch, her eyes shadowed and distant.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said, her voice soft but full of concern. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio offered a half-smile but didn’t quite meet her eyes. “I’m fine,” she said, but the words were strained. “Just… a tough shift is all.”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, her hands instinctively reaching out to touch Rio’s arm, just a light contact, grounding her. “What happened?” she asked gently.</p><p>Rio hesitated, the weight of her words clearly pressing down on her. “We had a patient last night, a GSW,” she began, her voice shaking slightly. “And one of his buddies pulled a gun on me and Will.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart stopped for a moment. She felt a rush of protectiveness toward Rio. “Oh my god, are you both okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded but looked away, her jaw tight. “Yeah, but… it was scary. Especially for Will. He’s only 23, and he’s never had to deal with anything like this before. I just kept thinking, what if something happened to him? What if we don’t make it out of here? What if he doesn’t? What would I tell his family?”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, and she reached out, cupping Rio’s face with both hands, forcing her to look up. “You don’t have to carry all of this on your own, Rio. You’re doing everything you can. And you’re there for Will, helping him through it. That’s what matters.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted as if she were going to respond but stopped herself, inhaling deeply. Then, before Agatha could say anything else, Rio closed the space between them, her lips finding Agatha’s in a soft, comforting kiss.</p><p>The kiss was simple, tender, but it held more meaning than either of them could put into words. When they pulled away, Rio’s eyes were soft, but there was still something guarded there.</p><p>“I’ll be okay,” Rio murmured, almost as if she were reassuring herself.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said softly. “And I’m here, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded and took a deep breath, her shoulders relaxing a little. “I just needed… this.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, brushing a stray lock of hair from Rio’s face. “Let me take care of you.”</p><p>Rio offered a tired but grateful smile. “You already do.”</p><p>Agatha walked over to the small breakfast spread she had prepared. It wasn’t much—just a few pastries and some fruit she brought from home, but it was enough for them to have a quiet moment before the class started. She set down a plate in front of Rio and slid into the chair next to her.</p><p>They sat in silence for a few moments. Rio had finished her food quickly, though, and was staring down at her coffee cup as if she were lost in thought.</p><p>“I keep thinking about Will,” Rio said quietly. “How fragile life is, you know? I don’t want anything bad to happen to him. But what if I can’t always protect him?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart ached for her, knowing how deeply she cared for her colleagues, for the people she worked with. “You don’t have to protect everyone all the time,” Agatha said gently. “You’re human, too. And no one expects you to carry everything.”</p><p>Rio met her gaze, her eyes soft and full of vulnerability. “I’m just scared sometimes, you know? I’m not sure how much longer I can keep doing this. It gets exhausting.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said, feeling the weight of Rio’s words, knowing she didn’t have an easy job. “But you don’t have to shoulder it alone. You’ve got people who care about you. You’ve got me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened even more, her hand reaching across the desk to rest on Agatha’s. She gave it a gentle squeeze, a silent acknowledgment of the support Agatha was offering.</p><p>Then, as the silence stretched between them, Rio’s phone buzzed. It was a reminder about class. They both looked at the time and realized it was almost time for students to start trickling in.</p><p>“We should probably get ready,” Agatha said reluctantly, standing up. “Class is almost here.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said with a small smile, standing up with her. She took a deep breath, still looking a little shaken but steadier now, thanks to Agatha’s presence. “Thanks for breakfast. I really needed this.”</p><p>“Anytime,” Agatha said, squeezing Rio’s shoulder. “Don’t forget, you don’t have to carry it all by yourself.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly as they both prepared to face the flood of students. “I won’t forget. I promise.”</p><p>Rio placed a gentle kiss to Agatha’s lips, before making her way to her usual spot. The first students began trickling into the lecture hall, but for a brief moment, the world around them seemed a little less overwhelming.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha was sitting at her desk in her office a couple of days later, going over a few papers when she heard the knock. Nicky was completely engrossed in his book by the window, and barely looked up. She’d had to pick him and bring him back to Northwestern so she could finish her office hours, but at this point, he was already used to it.</p><p>She called out, “Come in,” expecting it to be one of the students with a simple question about the assignment.</p><p>But when the door swung open, it wasn’t the usual polite knock-and-enter from a student. It was Thomas Jordan, his gaze immediately locking with hers as he stepped inside with a look of quiet determination. His demeanor immediately put Agatha on edge.</p><p>“Professor Harkness,” Jordan said, his voice smooth but laced with an undertone that immediately set her instincts on alert. “I just wanted to clarify the presentation requirements for the assignment.”</p><p>Agatha straightened in her chair, offering him a tight smile. “Everything you need to know is in the email I sent last week,” she replied coolly, her mind already anticipating where this conversation might be headed.</p><p>Jordan didn’t move, his posture stiff and his eyes not leaving her. “Right, of course. But actually, there’s something more important I wanted to discuss — something more pressing.” He took another step into the room, and Agatha’s gut tightened. “I was hoping we could revisit the mentorship decision.”</p><p>She felt the shift in the air, the slight pressure in his voice. It was more than a student simply asking for clarification; this was an attempt at leverage, a challenge.</p><p>“I’ve already made my decision, Jordan, as I’ve already told you several times,” Agatha said firmly, her tone unwavering. “I approved five students for the mentorship. My decision is final.”</p><p>Jordan’s eyes narrowed, the tension in his body rising as his tone shifted. “With all due respect, Professor, I think you made a mistake,” he said, his voice dropping a notch. “Rio Vidal? She’s not even that good and she’s exhausted 90% of the time, can barely keep up in classes. I’m the one with the qualifications and availability. Do you know who my father is? I’m a legacy here. I deserve that mentorship, and I know you know it.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. She could feel his frustration rolling off him in waves, the way he was slowly closing the space between them, trying to intimidate her with his presence. His gaze was unrelenting, and for a brief moment, she wondered if he had ever actually cared about the mentorship or if this was just about proving himself to her.</p><p>“I’ve already made my decision,” she repeated, her voice steady despite the rising tension. “You’re a bright student, but I’ve made the choice to mentor Ms. Vidal and the other students as their research proposals were excellent and in line with my area of research. I’m not reconsidering. I suggest you look for another mentor next semester.”</p><p>Jordan stepped closer to her desk, and Agatha instinctively stood straighter, the air between them thick with unspoken threats. “You don’t understand, Professor,” he said, his voice low and menacing now. “If you just give me a chance, I could do so much more than her, than any of them. You might want to think about that, before you lose out on the opportunity to work with someone who can truly make a difference. Someone who actually deserves that spot.”</p><p>The words were sharp, cutting through the air like a threat, and Agatha’s heart rate spiked. There was something in his demeanor now—something darker, more insistent—that made her stomach churn. He wasn’t just disappointed; he was angry, and his anger was directed at her.</p><p>Her hand tightened around the edge of her desk, and for the first time, she felt the weight of his intimidation. This wasn’t just a student disagreeing with a decision; this was someone trying to manipulate her, to push her into backing down.</p><p>“I have made my choice, Mr. Jordan,” she said one last time, her voice cold but firm. “And I won’t be swayed. I don’t care who your father is, as you’re the one enrolled in this program, not him.”</p><p>Jordan seemed to consider her for a moment, then nodded stiffly. “Fine,” he muttered. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you.” With that, he turned sharply and walked out, his footsteps heavy, the door closing behind him with a definitive snap.</p><p>Agatha stood still for a moment, her heart pounding in her chest. She hadn’t realized how shaken she was until the door clicked shut. She had dealt with challenging students before, but there was something about the way Jordan had entered her space, his body language so aggressive, that made her skin crawl. And that last part — “Don’t say I didn’t warn you” — echoed in her mind.</p><p>Nicky glanced up from his book, sensing the change in the atmosphere. “Is everything okay, Mom?”</p><p>Agatha forced a smile, her voice a little too tight. “Everything’s fine, sweetie. I just need a quick break, okay?”</p><p>She took Nicky’s hand and guided him out of the office. They walked to the nearby café, and Agatha ordered them both hot chocolate, trying to shake off the unease that had settled in her chest. She needed to clear her head, needed to reset.</p><p>As they sipped their drinks in silence, Agatha’s phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, finding a message from Rio:</p><p>
  <strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Hey beautiful! How’s your day going? Hope everything’s good.</em>
</p><p align="right">
  <strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>I’m okay. Just had a run-in with Jordan. He’s been pushing me on the mentorship thing. I’m feeling a little shaken, honestly.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Are you okay? Did he do anything to you? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Want to talk later?</em>
</p><p align="right">
  <strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>I’ll be fine. I just need to process this. But yes, maybe later. Let’s catch up.</em>
</p><p>After a few more minutes, Agatha felt a little more composed, but the knot in her stomach remained. Once Nicky had finished his drink, they headed back to the building. Agatha’s mind was still reeling from her encounter with Jordan. She knew she needed to talk about it, but she wasn’t sure who to turn to.</p><p>As she walked through the hallways, she ran into Wanda, who noticed immediately that something was off.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said, raising an eyebrow. “What happened? You look like you’ve just seen a ghost.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, glancing around to make sure Nicky wasn’t paying attention. “It’s a student, Thomas Jordan. He came into my office hours, tried to pressure me again about the mentorship. I’ve told him several times that my decision was final, but he… he hasn’t taken it well. The way he was acting — it felt more like a threat than a request.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression darkened. “A threat? Are you serious?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied quietly, her voice shaken. “He got way too close to me, started speaking in that way — like he was warning me, you know? I don’t know. It really rattled me. I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but it didn’t sit right with me.”</p><p>Wanda placed a hand on her shoulder, her eyes serious. “You’re not overreacting, Agatha. That doesn’t sound like just disappointment. That sounds like intimidation. You need to keep an eye on him. And report him if necessary.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, grateful for Wanda’s support. “I will. I just need to clear my head, but I’ll be okay.”</p><p>They exchanged a few more words before Agatha headed back to her office. Despite her efforts to push it out of her mind, Jordan’s words lingered, like a shadow she couldn’t quite shake.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha was still on edge by the time she got home. Even as she went through the familiar motions of her evening—making dinner, helping Nicky with his homework—her thoughts kept circling back to Jordan. The way he had walked into her office like he owned the place, the tone of his voice, the way he hadn’t even tried to mask his frustration. She didn’t like it.</p><p>She had just changed into a pair of purple sweatpants and sweater, and was pouring herself a glass of wine when the doorbell rang.</p><p>Frowning, she set the bottle down and made her way to the door, peering through the peephole. The sight of Rio standing on the other side made her breath catch for a second. She held a pizza box in one hand and a six-pack of soda in the other, her usual easy smirk in place.</p><p>Agatha opened the door, and before she could say anything, Rio grinned. “I come bearing gifts,” she announced, lifting the pizza slightly. “And good company. And—” her eyes scanned Agatha’s face, taking in the tightness in her expression, “—a much-needed distraction, from the looks of it.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, stepping aside. “You didn’t have to come all the way here.”</p><p>Rio stepped inside, toeing off her boots as if she had done it a hundred times before. “Sure I did. You sounded off earlier. And I'd like to think that I know you a little bit by now, and I figured you’d rather stew in something alone than admit you need someone to talk to.” She shot her a knowing look before setting the food down on the kitchen counter.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, but she couldn’t fight the small smile forming on her lips. “I don’t always stew.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Mhm. Sure. Now, where’s my favorite kid?”</p><p>Right on cue, hurried footsteps came down the stairs, and Nicky appeared in the hallway, his eyes lighting up the second he saw Rio.</p><p>“RIO!”</p><p>She barely had time to brace herself and hand the pizza and the soda to Agatha, before he barreled into her, wrapping his arms around her waist.</p><p>“Whoa, buddy,” she laughed, ruffling his hair. “I was gone for, what? A couple of  days? Did you miss me that much?”</p><p>Nicky pulled back, grinning. “Yeah! Are you staying for dinner?”</p><p>Rio nodded at the pizza box with a wink. “Thought I’d bring dinner, actually.”</p><p>Nicky gasped. “Pizza?!” He turned to Agatha, eyes wide with excitement. “Mom, can we eat in the living room and watch a movie?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head with fond exasperation. “I suppose we can make an exception tonight.”</p><p>Nicky cheered and took off toward the couch, already rattling off movie choices.</p><p>Agatha leaned in closer to Rio, lowering her voice. “I should probably warn you — the last time he picked a movie, it was two hours of talking cars.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I can survive that.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “You say that now.”</p><p>They settled in for the evening, Nicky wedged comfortably between them as he pressed play on an animated movie he’d clearly seen before, judging by the way he kept quoting lines before they even happened.</p><p>Agatha felt herself gradually relax. She stole occasional glances at Rio, who seemed perfectly at ease, laughing at Nicky’s commentary and sneaking her extra slices of pizza.</p><p>By the time the credits rolled, Nicky was yawning against Rio’s side, his head drooping slightly.</p><p>“Alright, kiddo,” Agatha said, brushing his hair back. “Time for bed.”</p><p>“But Rio just got here,” he mumbled sleepily, blinking up at her.</p><p>“I’ll see you soon, bud,” Rio assured him, ruffling his hair. “Promise.”</p><p>With a dramatic sigh, Nicky got to his feet. “Fine.” Then he threw his arms around Rio again. “Night, Rio.”</p><p>“Night, little man.”</p><p>Agatha guided Nicky up the stairs, waiting until she heard him settle into bed before heading back down. When she entered the living room, Rio was already clearing the empty plates, stacking them neatly before reaching for the wine bottle.</p><p>“Figured I’d pour us another glass,” Rio said, holding up the bottle. “Unless you’re kicking me out now?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, running a hand through her hair. “No,” she said, surprising even herself with how easily the answer came. “Stay.”</p><p>Rio smiled, pouring the wine. “So, now that the kiddo’s asleep… want to tell me what’s really going on?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a fraction of a second before finally sinking onto the couch beside her.</p><p>Rio handed her a glass, their fingers brushing. “It’s Jordan, isn’t it?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. </p><p>Rio frowned, concerned “What did he do?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “It’s not what he did, it’s how he did it. He just walked into my office, demanded another chance at the mentorship, and when I said no, he—” she hesitated, fingers tightening around her glass. “It was the way he looked at me, the way he spoke. Like it wasn’t over. And he mentioned you by name, like I was favoring you over him or something crazy like that.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. “That guy gives me a bad feeling.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I can handle it. But I have to be careful. We both do.” She turned to look at Rio, her expression serious. “We have to be careful about… this.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow, amusement flickering in her eyes. “This?”</p><p>“You know what I mean,” Agatha muttered. “Our… relationship.”</p><p>At that, Rio’s lips curved into a slow, teasing grin. She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping into something softer, more playful. “So we’re in a relationship, huh?”</p><p>Agatha groaned, bringing a hand to her forehead. “That’s what you took from all that?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, clearly enjoying herself. “I mean, you said it. Not me.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the warmth in her chest was undeniable.</p><p>Rio’s teasing softened into something more genuine. “Look, I get it,” she said, reaching out to brush her fingers lightly against Agatha’s knee. “I know we need to be very discreet. But I also don’t want you to feel like you’re in this alone. Whatever happens, I’ve got your back, Agatha.”</p><p>The sincerity in her voice made something in Agatha’s chest tighten. She exhaled slowly, then, after a brief hesitation, let her hand slide over Rio’s, intertwining their fingers.</p><p>“I know,” she murmured. “And I appreciate that. More than you know.”</p><p>They sat like that for a moment, fingers loosely linked, before Rio smirked again. “Still doesn’t change the fact that you called this a relationship first.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head, but she didn’t let go of Rio’s hand.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio let their hands rest together for a moment, tracing her thumb over Agatha’s knuckles absentmindedly. The room felt warm, settled in a way that made her want to stay right here, with Agatha curled up beside her, for as long as possible.</p><p>Then, as if reading her mind, Agatha exhaled and leaned back slightly. “Thanksgiving is next week.”</p><p>Rio huffed, running a hand through her hair. “Yeah. At least this year I won’t be working endless calls of indigestion. I’ll be heading back to my parents’ place. Whole family’s coming—my brothers and my sister, their partners, nieces, nephews. It’s always chaos.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “That sounds… nice.”</p><p>“It is.” Rio smiled at the thought of it. “Loud. Messy. But nice. My mom always makes way too much food, and my dad pretends to complain about it while sneaking extra servings.” She chuckled, then turned to Agatha. “What about you?”</p><p>“I usually spend it with Wanda and Viz and the kids.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “That sounds fun.”</p><p>“It is. We keep it small — Wanda does most of the cooking, and I attempt to contribute in ways that don’t involve me actually cooking.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Smart. Stay in your lane.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>A pause. Then, Rio glanced at her hesitantly. “You ever spend it with just Nicky?”</p><p>“Once or twice,” Agatha admitted. “Back when he was younger. I never wanted him to feel like he was missing out, though, so we started spending it with Wanda’s family instead.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a second before saying, “You think he’d like meeting my family?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the question. “You want him to?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, but there was something careful in the way she did it. “I mean… my mom loves kids. And my family? They’d adore him.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, and Rio held her gaze, letting the words settle between them.</p><p>After a beat, Agatha exhaled, tilting her head. “Are you inviting me to Thanksgiving, Ms. Vidal?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I don’t know. Am I?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, but there was an undeniable softness in her expression. “I think we should… take things one step at a time.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Fair enough.”</p><p>“But…” Agatha hesitated, then squeezed Rio’s hand gently. “Maybe next year.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “I’ll hold you to that.”</p><p>The room fell quiet again, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It was the kind of quiet that came with knowing you were exactly where you were supposed to be.</p><p>And then, slowly, Rio let her hand slide up Agatha’s arm, fingertips tracing a slow, deliberate path. Agatha shivered slightly at the touch, her breath hitching as Rio leaned in, just enough to let their noses brush.</p><p>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s jaw, tilting her face up, and then, just like that, they were kissing. Slow and unhurried, like they had all the time in the world.</p><p>Rio deepened it, her fingers curling around Agatha’s wrist, pulling her just a little closer. Agatha responded in kind, tilting her head to deepen the kiss even more, her lips soft and warm against Rio’s.</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s, smiling slightly. “So,” she murmured. “What’s your plan for the rest of the night?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her fingers brushing against the nape of Rio’s neck. “You tell me.”</p><p>Rio smirked, pressing another lingering kiss to Agatha’s lips. </p><p>Agatha let out a soft breath, her fingers still resting against the nape of Rio’s neck. There was something unspoken in the way she looked at her, a quiet deliberation, as if she were deciding whether to let herself want this as much as she did.</p><p>Rio, patient but sure, traced her thumb along Agatha’s jaw, letting her gaze drop to her lips before meeting her eyes again.  “I think I can come up with something,” she murmured, her voice warm and teasing.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a quiet laugh, but her grip on Rio tightened, as if anchoring herself. “You’re very confident.”</p><p>“Only when I know what I want.”</p><p>Something shifted then — so subtle it was almost imperceptible, but it was felt in the way Agatha leaned in, in the way her breath hitched when Rio’s hand slid to her waist, fingers pressing just enough to keep her close.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, and then, with careful intention, she reached for Rio’s hand, threading their fingers together as she stood. There was no hesitation as she gently tugged Rio along, leading her toward the dimly lit stairs.</p><p>Rio followed without question, the air between them humming with something both new and inevitable.</p><p>When they stepped into Agatha’s bedroom, the space felt different — like it had been waiting for this moment. The glow from a lamp cast soft shadows against the walls, the faint scent of lavender lingering in the air.</p><p>Rio leaned in, kissing Agatha slowly, thoroughly, until she felt her relax into it, her grip on Rio’s hand loosening only to slide up her arm, fingertips pressing into her skin like she was memorizing the shape of her.</p><p>Then, just as Rio was about to deepen the kiss, Agatha murmured against her lips, “Stay with me tonight.”</p><p>It wasn’t a command. It wasn’t even a request. It was an offering.</p><p>Rio smiled against her mouth, pressing one last lingering kiss to her lips before whispering, “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha had never been particularly reckless. She was measured, careful — always thinking two steps ahead. But with Rio, those instincts unraveled like sand slipping through her fingers.</p><p>She could feel it now, in the way Rio kissed her — slow, deliberate, like she had all the time in the world. As if Agatha were something to be treasured, not taken for granted.</p><p>It was disarming.</p><p>Rio’s hands mapped over her with quiet confidence, fingertips tracing over the fabric of her shirt before slipping beneath, pressing warm against her back. Agatha exhaled sharply at the contact, her grip on Rio tightening in response.</p><p>She should slow down.</p><p>She should think.</p><p>But then Rio was tilting her head, lips brushing just beneath her jaw, a slow, teasing drag of her mouth that sent heat curling low in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure when the shift happened — when the hesitation gave way to something deeper, more certain. Maybe it was in the way Rio looked at her, warm and patient, waiting without expectation. Or maybe it was the way Agatha’s hands had found their way to the hem of Rio’s shirt again, fingers curled there, feeling the slow, steady rise and fall of her breath.</p><p>She swallowed, steadying herself before meeting Rio’s gaze. “Let me.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, amusement flickering in her eyes, but she didn’t tease—not this time. She simply nodded.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, letting her fingers slip beneath the fabric, skimming along the warmth of Rio’s stomach before she pushed it up, slowly, deliberately. She had never done this before — not like this, not with a woman — but she wanted to learn. She wanted to get it right.</p><p>Rio lifted her arms without question, letting Agatha pull the sweater over her head and toss it to the floor. The sight of her, bare except for the lace of her bra, made Agatha pause, fingers hovering just above her skin.</p><p>Rio smiled softly, reaching up to brush a stray strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “You don’t have to be careful with me,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “I don’t want to get this wrong.”</p><p>“There’s no wrong way,” Rio said, her voice low, reassuring. “Just whatever feels good.”</p><p>Agatha let that settle before trailing her hands over Rio’s shoulders, down the curve of her arms, mapping out the shape of her. It was intoxicating — the warmth of her, the way she reacted to every slow press of Agatha’s fingertips.</p><p>She leaned in, pressing a kiss just below Rio’s collarbone, feeling the subtle hitch of her breath.</p><p>“I want to make you feel good,” Agatha admitted, voice quiet but certain. “If you’ll let me. If you’ll teach me.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, her fingers tightening briefly around Agatha’s waist before she nodded, a slow, lazy smile tugging at her lips. “Yeah,” she murmured. “I can do that.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding before pressing her lips to Rio’s again — this time with intent, with purpose.</p><p>And Rio let her.</p><p>Agatha took her time.</p><p>She traced the slope of Rio’s shoulders, the dip of her spine, mapping out the warmth of her skin with deliberate, measured hands. She could feel Rio’s heartbeat beneath her fingertips, steady but quick, anticipation thrumming between them like a live wire.</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s hands drifted lower, finding the waistband of her jeans. Agatha glanced up, waiting for any sign of hesitation, but Rio only nodded in wordless permission.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha unbuttoned them, dragging the denim down over strong thighs, revealing smooth, golden skin inch by inch. Rio helped, kicking them off until they pooled forgotten on the floor, leaving her in nothing but deep blue lace.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, but she didn’t look away.</p><p>Rio was beautiful — stunning in a way that almost felt unfair — but it wasn’t just that. It was the way she looked up at Agatha now, soft and steady, sitting on the edge of Agatha’s bed, as if she was giving her something she rarely gave.</p><p>Trust.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, sliding her hands back up Rio’s arms, letting them rest against her jaw as she leaned in, pressing another slow, lingering kiss to her lips. She could feel Rio’s hands now, warm against her hips, fingers tracing absent circles over the fabric of her shirt.</p><p>Then, Rio pulled back just enough to murmur, “Your turn.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her stomach twisting with something both foreign and familiar. She wasn’t self-conscious — she never had been — but this was different. She had spent so much of her life keeping herself guarded, wrapped in layers of control, of distance.</p><p>But Rio had a way of unraveling her without even trying.</p><p>Rio reached for her hand, guiding her gently until Agatha was standing between her legs, Rio’s hands settling against her waist. She looked up at her, gaze steady, waiting.</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, then, with careful fingers, she pulled her shirt over her head.</p><p>Rio hummed in quiet approval when she saw that Agatha wasn’t wearing a bra, her hands already finding their way to Agatha’s back, skimming along her spine as if she had been waiting to do it all night.</p><p>She leaned in, pressing a kiss just above Agatha’s navel before glancing up at her with a teasing smile. “You’re gorgeous, professor.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, shaking her head even as warmth curled in her stomach. “Flattery will only get you so far, Ms. Vidal.”</p><p>Rio grinned, hands slipping lower, fingers playing at the waistband of Agatha’s sweatpants. “Guess I’ll have to work a little harder then.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply as Rio made quick work of pushing it down her legs with practiced ease.</p><p>For once, Agatha let herself be guided.</p><p>Agatha felt the cool air against her skin as her sweatpants slipped down, pooling at her feet. She stepped out of them slowly, steadying herself with a hand on Rio’s shoulder, but Rio didn’t move — not yet.</p><p>She was still seated at the edge of the bed, still looking up at Agatha with that quiet, focused intensity, her hands warm where they rested at Agatha’s hips. It sent something thrumming low in Agatha’s stomach, the weight of being seen so openly, so thoroughly.</p><p>Rio traced slow circles against her skin with her thumbs, gaze trailing over her with unhurried appreciation. “You’re something else,” she murmured, almost to herself.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, shaking her head with a quiet huff. “I thought you were supposed to be teaching me,” she said, voice dry but unsteady at the edges.</p><p>Rio grinned. “I am,” she said, hands smoothing over Agatha’s waist, up her ribs. “Lesson number one: let me admire you a little bit.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but whatever sharp remark she had planned dissolved when Rio leaned in, pressing a slow, open-mouthed kiss to her stomach. The heat of her lips against sensitive skin sent a shiver through her, and Agatha felt her fingers tighten against Rio’s shoulders in response.</p><p>Rio hummed at that, pleased, and Agatha felt the curve of her smile against her skin before she pressed another kiss, higher this time.</p><p>“See?” Rio murmured against her. “You’re already a good student.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, trying to keep some semblance of composure, but Rio was making it difficult — deliberate hands, teasing mouth, a kind of patience that was more maddening than rushing ever could be.</p><p>Then, Rio’s fingers curled around the waistband of Agatha’s underwear, and she looked up, waiting.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for half a second before nodding, reaching for Rio’s jaw, tilting her face up for another kiss as Rio slowly, carefully, eased the last layer from her hips.</p><p>She was standing bare before her now, and Rio took her time looking. Not just at her body, but at her — at Agatha, in all her hesitations and contradictions, in all the places she had never let someone linger before.</p><p>Agatha had always been careful with control.</p><p>But tonight, she was choosing to let it go.</p><p>She reached for the clasp of Rio’s bra, her fingers brushing the soft skin of her back, savoring the feel of the delicate warmth there. Slowly, she unclasped it, her gaze locked on Rio’s, silently asking permission. Rio’s answer was in the slight arch of her back, the way she lifted her arms without a word.</p><p>Agatha eased the fabric from her body, sliding it off her shoulders with care, then tossing it aside. Rio was breathtaking, her body framed by nothing but the soft lace of her panties, her skin glowing in the low light.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha just looked.</p><p>Her breath caught at the sight, at how effortless Rio made it look to be completely exposed, to be unguarded in a way that Agatha still wasn’t sure she understood.</p><p>But that would come later, when they had time to explore all of this, all the things Agatha had never allowed herself to ask for.</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha let her hands trace down Rio’s sides, feeling the curve of her hips, the rise of her chest as Rio’s breath quickened. Her fingers skimmed lightly over the soft fabric of Rio’s panties, and Agatha could feel the way Rio shivered under her touch, her skin breaking out in goosebumps as she drew her touch lower, just enough to make Rio gasp.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” Agatha murmured, voice barely above a whisper, but the words felt like a promise.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her hands finding Agatha’s waist again, fingers curling into the bare skin of her hips as Agatha’s hands slid to the waistband of Rio’s panties. She didn’t need to look up to know the question was there in Rio’s eyes: Are you sure?</p><p>Agatha nodded, leaning in for a brief kiss before drawing the fabric down, guiding Rio’s legs one at a time as she slid the panties off. Agatha savored the moment — the way Rio’s body responded to her touch, the way the air between them seemed to crackle with anticipation.</p><p>“Stand up,” Agatha said softly, her voice barely above a breath. “I want to see you.”</p><p>Rio rose to her feet, and Agatha stood with her, guiding her gently back toward the bed. She paused only for a moment to take in the sight of her — completely bare, completely exposed, and looking at Agatha like she was the only thing that mattered in that moment.</p><p>Agatha’s heart raced, and her breath caught in her throat. </p><p>“Lie down for me,” she murmured, her voice almost unrecognizable in the hushed air.</p><p>She reached for Rio’s shoulders, guiding her back to the bed gently, and as Rio lay down, Agatha hovered above her for just a moment, tracing her fingertips over the soft curve of Rio’s body, over her chest, the rise of her stomach, the way her skin seemed to shiver with every touch.</p><p>Agatha took in the sight of her, completely vulnerable now, and it made her pulse spike. This was a moment she had never thought she would experience — touching, learning, feeling — but with Rio, it felt right. She felt right.</p><p>Agatha’s touch became more deliberate, more purposeful, as she leaned down to kiss Rio again, slow and deep. She wanted to feel every inch of her, wanted to taste the sweetness of her skin, the tremor of her breath against her lips. She wanted to give her something she had never given anyone else — her complete attention, her complete devotion.</p><p>And as Rio’s hands slid into her hair, pulling her closer, Agatha finally understood. This was what it meant to let go.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t hold back the quiet groan that escaped her as she kissed Rio again, deeper this time, her lips parting to taste the soft warmth of her mouth before trailing kisses down her neck. Her skin was like silk, warm under Agatha’s touch, and she wanted to savor every inch of her. She could feel Rio’s breath hitch as she moved lower, the heat between them rising with each touch, each kiss that seemed to spark something inside Agatha — something she hadn’t even known was there.</p><p>Her lips found the soft curve of Rio’s chest, trailing slowly down between the valley of her breasts. Agatha pressed a kiss to the center of her chest, lingering there for a moment before her lips moved lower, pausing just above Rio’s nipple. She could feel the tension in Rio’s body, the way her chest rose and fell, waiting.</p><p>Agatha smiled against her skin, her breath warm before she flicked her tongue over the hardening nipple. Rio’s body tensed, and she let out a soft, breathless moan that sent a thrill through Agatha’s veins. The sound was addicting, and Agatha wanted to hear more.</p><p>She took her time, swirling her tongue slowly around the nipple, savoring the way Rio’s body responded to each flick and tease. She couldn’t help but delight in the soft whimpers and moans that slipped from Rio’s lips. The sound of Rio wanting her, the way her body arched just a little toward her, was intoxicating.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss against her skin, moving to the other nipple, repeating the slow torture, teasing it with her tongue before gently circling it with her lips. Rio’s hands were tangled in Agatha’s hair now, tugging her closer, and Agatha responded by pressing herself against Rio, her own body aching for the contact.</p><p>Each moan, each sound of pleasure that escaped Rio’s lips drove Agatha wild. She could feel herself losing control, caught between the desire to keep teasing, to keep driving Rio crazy, and the overwhelming urge to give in, to let her own need take over. But for now, she stayed focused on Rio, on the way her body reacted to her touch, savoring the way the world seemed to narrow down to just them — just this.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio gasped, her voice low and needy.</p><p>That was all it took to send Agatha’s heart racing, and she pulled back just enough to look at Rio, her fingers still lightly tracing the curve of her chest. “You’re so perfect,” Agatha whispered, her voice thick with desire and affection. “I want to make you feel good.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes locked onto hers, dark with desire. “God, you already are.”</p><p>Agatha moved lower, placing open mouthed kisses down Rio’s toned stomach. When she reached the patch of dark curls, she stopped, suddenly insecure how to proceed. Tentatively, she slowly ran a finger over Rio’s folds, delighting in how much her ministrations were affecting her.</p><p>“Is this okay?” She asked, hesitant, but Rio only moaned, so Agatha did it again, finding her clit and applying a bit more pressure.</p><p>“More than okay,” Rio breathed finally, her face flushed, eyelids heavy with desire. “You can circle it with your fingers, just like you’d do to yourself.</p><p>Agatha did so experimentally and grinned when it elicited a groan from Rio. She was so wet and that made Agatha’s mouth water, proud that she was the one causing such a response in a woman like Rio. She massaged her clit for a moment, changing pressure and speed to see how it affected Rio. </p><p>The moans that it elicited and the way her name fell from Rio’s lips like a prayer were making her nearly unbearably turned on, and she could feel how absolutely drenched she was as she squeezed her thighs together to try and alleviate some of the building pressure.</p><p>Then she decided to be bolder, encouraged by Rio’s reaction. Lowering her head, she gently touched her tongue to Rio’s folds, running over her slit until it found her clit, just as she remembered Rio doing it to her. Her taste exploded in her mouth deliciously and she moaned, feeling even more impossibly turned on when that got a loud moan from Rio.</p><p>“God, just like that Agatha,” Rio groaned, as she tried to keep her eyes open as Agatha lapped at her clit. </p><p>But when she sucked on it gently, Rio threw her head back in such a beautiful painting of pure bliss that Agatha decided then and there that this was her new favorite thing. </p><p>She kept at it, Rio’s moans like music to her ears until she felt a shift as her hips started chasing Agatha’s mouth involuntarily, her breathing quickened, and just like that, she knew Rio was close.</p><p>Agatha was so turned on, her own clit throbbing so much that she had to grind her hips against the mattress just to get some kind of friction so she wouldn't  spontaneously combust. As it was, she felt that she could probably cum without Rio even touching her. </p><p>Who knew giving pleasure was such a turn on?</p><p>When Rio’s breathing hitched as Agatha hit a specific spot, she knew it was about to happen, so she redoubled her efforts.</p><p>“Yes, just like that. Just like that. Don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t—”</p><p>Then a long moan erupted, Rio’s legs shook around Agatha, and she could not feel prouder of herself for causing this unbelievably gorgeous scene. She kept licking at Rio’s folds for another moment, before placing kisses over her thighs, over her mound, and then settling there, chin resting on Rio as she watched her lover come down from her orgasm.</p><p>When Rio opened her eyes again, a lazy smile on her lips, she reached for Agatha, pulling her up until their lips met. Agatha could still taste Rio’s desire on her tongue, and the thought of what she had just done caused her to nearly cum on the spot.</p><p>“Damn, look at you,” Rio breathed, after a deep kiss. “That was incredible. You’re a natural.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha asked, feeling proud but slightly self conscious.</p><p>“My legs are still shaking, Agatha. God,” she pulled her in for another kiss, flipping her over so she was now on top. “It was amazing, trust me.”</p><p>Then she pressed her body against Agatha’s, her pussy grinding on hers slowly.</p><p>“But now it’s your turn.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <p>The shrill sound of the alarm cut through the early morning stillness, but Rio barely stirred, just groaned and hit the snooze button with a lazy slap before burrowing deeper into Agatha’s warmth. Her arm tightened around Agatha’s waist, pulling her close as she buried her face against the soft skin of her neck.</p><p>“Too damn early,” Rio mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.</p><p>Agatha huffed out a quiet laugh, shifting slightly against the sheets. “I don’t disagree.”</p><p>She reached for Rio’s hand, bringing it to her lips for a slow, lingering kiss. Rio hummed in appreciation, her grip around Agatha’s waist loosening just enough for her to turn over and face her.</p><p>Their eyes met, and Rio felt that now-familiar warmth spread through her chest. Agatha looked softer like this—her usually sharp gaze still hazy with sleep, her hair slightly tousled, her lips curved into the faintest smile.</p><p>Rio took her in, fingers tracing along the curve of her hip, then up over the dip of her waist. “Morning,” she murmured, letting her nose brush against Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet hum in response, her own fingers sliding up Rio’s arm in slow, lazy strokes. “Morning.”</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, exchanging soft kisses, their hands idly exploring in the slow, unhurried way that came after a perfect night. Rio let herself get lost in it—the warmth of Agatha’s skin beneath her fingertips, the way Agatha melted into every touch like she belonged there.</p><p>Her thoughts drifted, hazy and content. She hadn’t expected last night to be so… perfect. She’d known it would be good — she and Agatha had undeniable chemistry, after all — but it had been so much more than that. Agatha had let herself be seen in a way Rio hadn’t expected, had let Rio take care of her with a kind of trust that felt intimate in a way that had nothing to do with sex.</p><p>She hadn’t known how much she’d needed that — needed to be with someone who wanted her just as much as she wanted them.</p><p>Agatha’s lips pressed to the corner of her mouth, pulling her out of her thoughts. “What are you thinking about?”</p><p>Rio smiled against her lips. “Last night.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, brushing another kiss to Rio’s jaw. “Mmm. Me too.”</p><p>Rio was about to pull her in again when the alarm went off a second time. She groaned in protest, but Agatha only laughed and shifted to sit up.</p><p>“No,” Rio whined, reaching to pull her back down. “Stay.”</p><p>Agatha swatted at her arm playfully. “I have to get ready for work.”</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically, flopping onto her back with an exaggerated groan. “Fine.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly, reaching for her phone to silence the alarm for good. “What about you? What classes do you have today?”</p><p>Rio stretched her arms above her head, letting out another groan before answering. “Wanda’s behavioral science class at ten. Then nephrology at two-thirty.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, brushing a hand over Rio’s stomach before moving to stand. “And then?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head back against the pillow, watching her with a lazy grin. “Then I’m off for the rest of my Friday.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “That sounds dangerous.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Oh, it is.”</p><p>Agatha only shook her head, amused, before heading toward the bathroom. As she disappeared behind the door, Rio sighed, stretching once more before rolling onto her side.</p><p>Yeah. She could definitely get used to this.</p><p>As Agatha turned on the shower, Rio followed her inside, slipping her arms around her waist and pressing a kiss just below her ear. Agatha shivered, tilting her head slightly as if to welcome her in, and that was all the encouragement Rio needed.</p><p>What started as a simple, sleepy embrace quickly turned into something else entirely.</p><p>By the time they emerged, steam curling around them in the cool morning air, Agatha was smiling in that soft, unguarded way that made Rio’s chest ache.</p><p>“I’ll make breakfast,” Rio offered, drying off as Agatha stepped into her closet to get dressed.</p><p>Agatha shot her a look, amused. “Are you sure? You haven’t had much sleep.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I’ll manage.”</p><p>She threw on a pair of sweats and a hoodie Agatha offered her and padded downstairs, still warm from their morning together. But as soon as she stepped into the kitchen, she pulled up short.</p><p>Nicky was already there, sitting at the counter with a glass of orange juice, rubbing his eyes sleepily.</p><p>For a second, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Then Nicky blinked up at her, clearly confused. “Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s mind raced for an excuse. Shit. She should’ve expected this.</p><p>“Oh. Uh, hey, buddy,” she said, forcing a casual smile. “Morning.”</p><p>Nicky tilted his head. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, then shut it. Think, think—</p><p>Then, suddenly, she remembered the excuse Agatha had given him last time.</p><p>“It was really late last night,” Rio said, rubbing the back of her neck. “So I just stayed over.”</p><p>Nicky seemed to accept this after a beat, taking another sip of his juice. “Oh. Okay.”</p><p>Crisis averted.</p><p>Rio exhaled in relief and moved toward the fridge. “You hungry? I was about to make some breakfast.”</p><p>Nicky perked up at that, nodding eagerly. “Yeah!”</p><p>She started pulling out eggs and bread, keeping her movements easy, natural.</p><p>A few minutes later, Agatha walked in, freshly dressed, hair still damp from the shower.</p><p>Rio glanced up at her, then—casual as anything—said, “Yeah, so I was just telling Nicky it was too late to drive home last night, so I ended up staying over.”</p><p>Agatha stilled for just a fraction of a second. Then she nodded, catching on immediately. “Right,” she said smoothly. “It was late.”</p><p>Nicky, completely oblivious to the exchange, just swung his legs under the counter. “Rio’s making breakfast,” he announced.</p><p>Agatha smirked, her gaze flicking to Rio. “Is she now?”</p><p>Rio winked. “Hope you’re hungry.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, leaning against the counter. “I could eat.”</p><p>And just like that, the morning fell into an easy rhythm.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, watching Agatha move through the kitchen with sharp focus, already a step ahead of herself, her mind clearly running through everything she needed to do before leaving.</p><p>She looked good like this — efficient, put-together, sleeves rolled up just so. But Rio wasn’t really paying attention to any of that. No, she was enjoying something else entirely: the way Agatha kept sneaking glances at her.</p><p>And Rio knew exactly why.</p><p>She smirked, tugging at the hem of the hoodie she was currently wearing — Agatha’s navy hoodie, oversized and ridiculously comfortable. Paired with a pair of old but perfectly worn-in gray sweatpants, it was a dangerously casual look. But Agatha’s expression said it was also a problem.</p><p>Agatha huffed softly as she grabbed her coffee. “You know, you shouldn’t look that good in my clothes.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk widened. “What can I say? I make anything look good.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was no real annoyance there, just quiet exasperation — and maybe a little appreciation, if Rio was reading her right.</p><p>She stretched lazily, arms lifting above her head as she stifled a yawn. “You know,” she said as she let them drop, “if you’re in a rush, I can take Nicky to school.”</p><p>Agatha barely glanced at her, still caught up in her schedule. “I still need to—”</p><p>“I have my car here,” Rio cut in smoothly. “I’ll drop him off and then swing by my place to grab my things before heading to Northwestern.”</p><p>That made Agatha pause.</p><p>Finally, she turned to really look at Rio, considering.</p><p>It made sense. It would save her time. And Rio could already guess how much Nicky would love the idea.</p><p>After a moment, Agatha sighed, relenting. “Alright. That would actually be really helpful.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk softened into something more satisfied.</p><p>Agatha turned toward the living room. “Nicky! Change of plans. Rio’s taking you to school.”</p><p>“Okay!” came the quick reply, followed by the sound of him thundering upstairs for his backpack.</p><p>As soon as he was out of sight, Agatha turned back to Rio, stepping closer without hesitation. Before Rio could say anything, Agatha cupped her face and kissed her — a brief, warm press of lips, full of quiet gratitude.</p><p>When she pulled back, her voice was softer. “You’re too good to me.”</p><p>Rio brushed her thumb along Agatha’s jaw, grinning. “Don’t forget it.”</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>The morning traffic was surprisingly light, and Rio relaxed into the drive, one hand resting lazily on the wheel while the other adjusted the volume on the radio. She and Nicky had been going back and forth about the best superhero, but now he had gone quiet in the backseat, staring out the window, his feet kicking idly against the seat in front of him.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, he said, “I like that you and my mom are spending more time together.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers flexed around the steering wheel.</p><p>She glanced at him through the rearview mirror, caught off guard by how casual he sounded — like it was the most normal thing in the world.</p><p>A warmth spread through her chest despite the sudden spike of nerves. She cleared her throat. “Yeah?”</p><p>Nicky nodded. “Yeah. You’re fun.”</p><p>Rio let out a small breath, smiling despite herself. “Well, I really like your mom.”</p><p>Nicky shifted in his seat, tilting his head. “What, like a girlfriend, you mean?”</p><p>Rio’s stomach plummeted.</p><p>Her grip tightened on the wheel as she focused on the road, suddenly hyper aware of the weight of the moment. Shit.</p><p>She forced herself to breathe through the initial wave of panic, to think.</p><p>Because, honestly… what did she say?</p><p>She and Agatha hadn’t even figured that out yet. Was it too soon to put a label on it? Would Agatha even want that?</p><p>But this was Nicky — Nicky, who wasn’t asking with judgment, just curiosity.</p><p>After a beat, Rio inhaled deeply and went with, “What if it was like a girlfriend?”</p><p>Through the mirror, she saw Nicky narrow his eyes at her playfully, as if considering, then shrug. “That’d be cool.”</p><p>And just like that, he dropped the subject entirely, humming along to the song that had just come on the radio.</p><p>Rio let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding, a slow grin creeping onto her face.</p><p>Yeah. Cool was a good start.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio was still feeling a little jittery by the time she pulled into her parking spot. Even after a few deep breaths, her mind kept circling back to Nicky’s question. It had been so innocent, so casual — but it meant something. And if he was already thinking about it, there was a good chance he’d bring it up with Agatha.</p><p>She needed to tell Agatha before that happened.</p><p>As soon as she stepped inside her apartment, she was tugging her phone out of her pocket, already halfway composing a message in her head when—</p><p>Thud.</p><p>A small pillow smacked her right in the chest.</p><p>Rio startled, snapping her head up to find Alice lounging on the couch, looking at her with mild amusement.</p><p>“Welcome back, loser,” Alice greeted. “You walked right past me.”</p><p>Rio blinked, taking in the scene — Alice in sweats, a coffee mug in hand, her laptop open but abandoned on the coffee table.</p><p>“You’re home?” Rio asked dumbly, still coming down from her spiraling thoughts.</p><p>Alice snorted. “Clearly.” Then she narrowed her eyes, studying Rio more closely. “Okay, what’s up with you?”</p><p>Rio hesitated. She could just brush it off, but Alice wasn’t the type to let things go. Besides, Rio kind of wanted to say it out loud.</p><p>She sighed, dropping onto the couch beside her best friend and letting her head fall back against the cushions.</p><p>“Nicky asked me if I was his mom’s girlfriend today.”</p><p>Alice choked on her sip of coffee. “What?”</p><p>Rio groaned, covering her face with her hands. “Yeah. Just… out of nowhere. He said he liked that Agatha and I were spending more time together, and when I told him I really liked her, he just hit me with a ‘what, like a girlfriend?’”</p><p>Alice was silent for a beat. Then she burst out laughing.</p><p>Rio scowled, tilting her head to glare at her. “Oh, sure, hilarious for you.”</p><p>Alice wiped at her eyes, still grinning. “I mean, it is pretty funny. The kid’s got instincts.”</p><p>Rio huffed, shaking her head. “I panicked. I didn’t know what to say.”</p><p>“So what did you say?”</p><p>Rio sighed. “I asked him, ‘what if it was like a girlfriend?’ And he just shrugged and said that’d be cool.”</p><p>Alice let out an impressed whistle. “Damn. Bold move.”</p><p>Rio scrubbed a hand down her face. “I just — he caught me off guard, okay? And now I have to tell Agatha before he says anything to her.”</p><p>Alice nodded, her grin softening into something more thoughtful. “Yeah, probably a good idea. But honestly? Sounds like the kid’s already on board.”</p><p>Rio let that sink in, and despite everything, a small smile tugged at her lips.</p><p>Maybe Alice was right.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio had always liked Wanda’s classes. The discussions were engaging, and behavioral science was fascinating in a way that felt tangibly useful to her work in medicine. Unlike some of the more theory-heavy subjects, this one felt applicable — something she could actually use in real-life situations.</p><p>Right now, the topic had shifted to subconscious biases and emotional reactions — how people responded to situations they weren’t prepared for.</p><p>“Unexpected feelings often lead to instinctive defenses,” Wanda was saying, her tone even but deliberate. “Sometimes it’s avoidance, sometimes it’s dismissal. Sometimes it’s hostility. The mind works hard to protect us from things we’re not ready to face.”</p><p>Rio, chin propped in her hand, turned that over in her mind. She’d seen it firsthand — patients, colleagues, even herself. Emotional processing wasn’t just a theoretical concept; it dictated everything from bedside manner to life-or-death decision-making.</p><p>It also explained a lot about Agatha.</p><p>How she used to stiffen when things felt too personal. How she controlled every interaction with razor-sharp precision. How she tried to pull away when something hit too close to home.</p><p>And yet—</p><p>Rio smirked a little. “So, basically, when people start acting weird, it’s because they’re freaking out about something they don’t know how to deal with?”</p><p>A few students chuckled, and Wanda smiled. “That’s one way to put it.”</p><p>“Sounds like some people go full panic mode,” Rio mused, keeping her tone light, even as something deeper stirred beneath the words. “Get all stiff, overly formal. Pretend something isn’t happening when it obviously is.”</p><p>More laughter rippled through the class, and Rio grinned—but then—</p><p>A shift in the air.</p><p>Movement near the door.</p><p>She glanced over—</p><p>And there stood Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched before she could stop it.</p><p>For a second, she thought she might’ve conjured her out of sheer will, but no — Agatha was very much real, standing at the edge of the lecture hall, holding a couple of binders and a box. Her blue eyes flicked toward Rio, composed as ever, but there was something there — a flicker of amusement, sharp and knowing.</p><p>Wanda, naturally, had noticed.</p><p>Rio, for the first time since stepping into this class, actually felt flustered.</p><p>“Excellent observation, Ms. Vidal,” Wanda said, tone just a little too pleased. “Of course, recognizing these reactions in others is one thing. Recognizing them in yourself is another matter entirely.”</p><p>Rio forced herself to look back at Wanda, keeping her expression carefully neutral.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know, professor,” she said, mustering up an easy grin. “I think some people are very obvious.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, shaking her head as she moved the conversation forward. But Agatha chose that moment to step fully into the room.</p><p>“Apologies for the interruption,” she said smoothly, holding up the binders. “I believe you asked for these?”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes flickered with interest. “Ah, perfect timing.” She took the binders, then glanced at the box Agatha was holding. “And that would be…?”</p><p>“Your brain,” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>A few students exchanged looks. Rio arched an eyebrow.</p><p>Wanda, utterly unfazed, smirked. “How generous of you, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh and set the box down on Wanda’s desk before lifting the lid. Inside was a detailed plastic model of the human brain, with color-coded structures that could be taken apart and reassembled.</p><p>A murmur of interest spread through the class.</p><p>Rio leaned forward, already intrigued.</p><p>“This should help with your upcoming assignment,” Agatha remarked, glancing at Wanda before her eyes briefly flickered to Rio. “Since I imagine some of you are more visual learners.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, picking up a section of the model. “Excellent. This will give us a hands-on look at the limbic system, which, as we were just discussing, plays a key role in emotional processing.”</p><p>Rio caught the way Agatha’s mouth twitched ever so slightly before she took a step back, clearly ready to make her exit.</p><p>“Well, I’ll leave you to it,” Agatha said, nodding to Wanda before sparing Rio one last look.</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, only now realizing she’d been gripping the edge of her desk.</p><p>Wanda, who never missed anything, gave her a knowing look before addressing the class again.</p><p>“Now,” she said, gesturing to the brain model. “Let’s take a closer look.”</p><p>Rio did her best to focus.</p><p>But damn if it wasn’t hard.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio was waiting outside Agatha’s office, arms crossed as she tried to calm the fluttering nerves in her stomach. Jordan was standing beside her, pretending to look at his phone but clearly waiting for an opening to say something.</p><p>“Guess the teacher’s pet’s here early, huh?” Jordan said, his voice casual but with a clear edge of sarcasm.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but kept her gaze ahead, not giving him the satisfaction of a reaction. “Do you need something, Jordan?” she raised an eyebrow, her tone cool and formal.</p><p>Jordan merely shrugged. “So you and Dr. Harkness are getting pretty close, huh?”</p><p>Rio glanced at him sharply, but before she could respond, the door to Agatha’s office opened. Agatha stepped out, her attention shifting immediately to Jordan.</p><p>“Mr. Jordan, you’re early for your meeting. Come on in,” she said, her voice polite but firm.</p><p>Rio gave a small nod as Agatha motioned for Jordan to enter. She remained outside, stewing over Jordan’s comments. What does he think? That he can just say whatever he wants?</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as the door clicked shut. She had been ready to talk to Agatha about Nicky’s question, but now she just felt irritated, unsure if she should bring it up right away or let things settle.</p><p>After a few minutes, the door opened again, and Jordan stepped out, clearly irritated. It didn’t take long for  Agatha to pop her head outside, catching Rio’s eye immediately. She gave Rio a small, apologetic smile.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” Agatha said. “Jordan can be a bit relentless.”</p><p>Rio smiled back, though she still felt a little on edge. “It’s fine. I just—”</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha asked, her voice warm and understanding. Rio took a breath, finally letting go of the irritation as she walked into Agatha’s office.</p><p>“Yeah, I just need to tell you something,” Rio said, her tone softer now that they were alone. “It’s about Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed, a sudden wave of concern crossing her face. “What happened?”</p><p>Rio exhaled and sat down in one of the chairs, trying to push aside the discomfort she still felt. “This morning, he asked me if I liked you… as a girlfriend.”</p><p>Agatha froze for a moment, blinking at her in surprise. “What?”</p><p>Rio chuckled nervously. “Yeah. I wasn’t sure how to answer, so I thought I should just tell you before he says anything to you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked again, then burst out laughing. The sound was rich and warm, completely unexpected but easing the tension in the room. “He asked you that?” she repeated, shaking her head in disbelief.</p><p>Rio smiled sheepishly. “Yeah. He’s very direct.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head again, amusement still flickering in her eyes. Then, her expression softened, and she leaned in slightly. “But listen, Rio…” Her voice lowered a bit, her eyes locking with Rio’s. “I don’t care about labels. I just care about us.”</p><p>Rio felt a knot in her stomach loosen, but she rushed to speak before Agatha could continue. “I mean, I didn’t know how you felt about labels or whatever, so I didn’t want to—”</p><p>“Rio, hey,” Agatha interrupted softly, her hand gently reaching for Rio’s. “That’s a label I could get behind. If that’s what you want too.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart race, her breath catching as she looked into Agatha’s eyes. She smiled slowly, the relief overwhelming. “Okay,” she whispered, the weight of the conversation settling between them but in a way that felt right.</p><p>~*~</p><p>After her nephrology class, Rio felt the weight of the week finally lifting a little. She pulled out her phone and texted Agatha.</p><p align="right">
  <strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>Hey, how about joining us for a drink tonight? Alice, Jen, and Will are coming too, and I think it could be fun for all of us to hang out. Let me know if you’re free.</em>
</p><p>She pressed send, leaning back in her seat. A few minutes later, her phone buzzed with Agatha’s reply.</p><p>
  <strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Sounds good! Let me check with Viz if he can keep Nicky for a bit after soccer practice. I’ll let you know soon.</em>
</p><p>Rio smiled, excitement bubbling up at the thought of spending more time with Agatha outside of their usual setting. Just as she was about to put her phone down, another message came through from Agatha.</p><p>
  <strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>By the way, would it be alright if I brought Wanda too? She’s been asking about you.</em>
</p><p>Rio felt her stomach flutter at the thought of Wanda joining them. She and Wanda had shared a couple of casual conversations, and the idea of Agatha wanting her friend to join them only seemed to signal how comfortable Agatha was getting with the idea of them spending more time together.</p><p align="right">
  <strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>Of course! The more the merrier. I’ll text you the address. Let me know when you’re on your way.</em>
</p><p>Rio set her phone down and let out a small sigh of contentment. It felt good to have plans, to know there would be space for laughter and lightheartedness that evening. It had been a stressful week for both of them, and the thought of just enjoying the evening together was a welcome reprieve.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio arrived at the bar feeling lighter than she had in a long time. Maybe it was the easy way things had settled between her and Agatha after their conversation earlier that day — when she’d told Agatha that Nicky had asked if she liked his mom as a girlfriend, and Agatha hadn’t objected. She’d expected hesitation, maybe even a deflection, but Agatha had only let the words settle between them without resistance.</p><p>That meant something.</p><p>She spotted Agatha and Wanda easily, already seated at a booth near the back. Agatha looked stunning, as she always did, but there was something softer about her in this moment—her shoulders a little more relaxed, the dim bar lighting catching on the edges of her smile. Rio didn’t think she’d ever get used to the way Agatha looked at her now, not with distance or guarded politeness, but with familiarity. With affection.</p><p>As soon as Agatha met her gaze, Rio felt her own smile forming, something instinctive. She walked toward them, heart picking up speed, and slid into the booth beside Agatha, their bodies naturally gravitating toward each other.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio murmured, leaning in to press a slow, warm kiss to Agatha’s cheek. Her hand found Agatha’s thigh under the table, fingers resting there like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, barely audible, but Rio felt it against her skin. “Hey,” she answered, turning just slightly so their faces were closer. “You look—” Agatha paused, eyes scanning her, taking her in. “Beautiful.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled. “I was about to say the same thing.”</p><p>Wanda, sipping her drink, raised an eyebrow. “You two are adorable. Sickening, but adorable.”</p><p>Rio let out a soft laugh, but it didn’t deter her from staying close to Agatha, from letting her thumb trace absentmindedly along the inside of Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“They’ll be here soon,” she said, glancing toward the entrance.</p><p>As if on cue, the door swung open, and Alice walked in with her girlfriend, Jennifer, and Will. Alice immediately spotted them and waved in that exaggerated, look at me way she always did.</p><p>“There they are,” Alice called as she strode over, clapping a hand on Rio’s shoulder. “Hey, stranger.”</p><p>Rio grinned and nudged her with her elbow. “Took you long enough.”</p><p>Alice ignored her and turned to Agatha. “Good to see you again.”</p><p>Agatha gave a small nod. “Likewise.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, turning to Jennifer and Will. “Alright, let’s make this official. Agatha, Wanda — this is Jen, Alice’s girlfriend, and Will, my partner from the firehouse.”</p><p>Jen smiled warmly, extending a hand. “It’s great to meet you both.”</p><p>Will shook Agatha’s hand, offering a friendly grin. “Nice to finally meet you. Rio talks a lot about you.”</p><p>Rio groaned, already knowing where this was going. “Okay, not in a weird way.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved, interest flickering across her face. “Oh?”</p><p>Alice leaned in, all too eager. “Oh yeah. She’s been talking about you nonstop since—”</p><p>Rio shot her a sharp look, and Alice smirked but let it go. For now.</p><p>They ordered drinks, the conversation slipping into an easy rhythm, but the teasing wasn’t over yet.</p><p>“So,” Wanda mused about an hour into their evening, giving Alice a curious look. “You mentioned something about the museum?”</p><p>Alice grinned, clearly delighted to have an audience. “Oh, you don’t know the half of it. Nicky was so into the exhibits that I had to keep him occupied for, what, forty minutes? Just so these two could have some alone time.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Wait — you did that on purpose?”</p><p>Alice scoffed. “Uh, yeah. You think I didn’t notice the whole vibe you two had going on? Please, I knew exactly what was happening. And Nicky? That kid was so locked in on that heart exhibit, I could’ve left him there for hours.”</p><p>Wanda snorted, shaking her head. Even Agatha smirked, clearly amused.</p><p>“I did notice you were keeping him busy for a while,” Agatha admitted, sipping her drink. There was a teasing glint in her eyes, subtle but unmistakable.</p><p>Alice shrugged, looking very pleased with herself. “I mean, you two needed some alone time to sort out your shit, right?”</p><p>Rio exhaled, shaking her head, but she couldn’t fight the warmth spreading through her chest. She leaned back against the booth, her knee brushing against Agatha’s under the table.</p><p>Alice, for once, seemed to shift into something more genuine. She watched them for a moment, expression thoughtful. “I’ll admit,” she said, voice quieter now, “I was a little worried you two were in over your heads.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha still slightly beside her, though her expression remained neutral.</p><p>Alice continued, her gaze flicking between them. “But… I see it now. You two make sense.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha, and for the first time tonight, there was something solid there — something unspoken, but understood.</p><p>“We’re figuring it out,” Rio said softly, her fingers grazing Agatha’s under the table.</p><p>Alice studied them for a beat longer, then nodded. “Good.”</p><p>The conversation shifted, flowing into stories from work, casual banter, and shared laughter. But through it all, Rio felt something different tonight.</p><p>She felt settled.</p><p>Because Alice was right. They were in deep. But for once, that didn’t feel like a bad thing.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>The night stretched on in easy conversation and laughter, drinks dwindling as the stories got better — especially when Alice started digging into Rio’s early days as a paramedic.</p><p>“—and this rookie right here,” Alice gestured at Rio, who groaned dramatically, “once tried to outmuscle a very intoxicated patient into sitting still for an IV. Guess how that went?”</p><p>Will, Rio’s current partner, grinned. “Oh, this is gonna be good.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “He threw up directly on her. Head to toe. I’ve never seen a person look so personally betrayed in my life.”</p><p>Will burst into laughter, practically doubling over. “No way.”</p><p>“It was disgusting,” Rio muttered, shaking her head. “And Alice here did not help. She just stood there, laughing.”</p><p>“I was supervising,” Alice said, deadpan. “And now you have a great ‘humble beginnings’ story. You’re welcome.”</p><p>Agatha, sitting beside Rio, smirked over the rim of her wine glass. “I do appreciate a well-crafted narrative.”</p><p>Rio shot her a look. “Et tu, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha gave a slow, deliberate shrug.</p><p>Will was still grinning. “I’m just glad I know all this now. I will be using it against you.”</p><p>“Great,” Rio muttered. “This is the worst night of my life.”</p><p>“Oh, please,” Alice nudged her. “You love the attention.”</p><p>At the other end of the table, Wanda checked her phone and sighed. “Alright, some of us actually need sleep.”</p><p>“Already?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Yes, already.” Wanda directed her gaze at Agatha. “Nicky’s all set for the night, so don’t rush. Take your time, enjoy yourself. Just text me when you’re on your way to get him.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, grateful. “Thank you, Wanda.”</p><p>“Of course,” Wanda said, sliding out of the booth. “Enjoy yourselves.”</p><p>The group lingered for a while longer, but eventually, the night started winding down. Will left first, then Alice and Jen, Alice shooting Rio one last smirk before disappearing into the night.</p><p>That left just the two of them.</p><p>Stepping outside the bar, the night air cool against her skin, Agatha exhaled softly. Rio was beside her in an instant, hands tucked in her jacket pockets.</p><p>“So,” Rio murmured, glancing around. “Uber?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Uber.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha fiddled with her phone, a comfortable silence stretching between them. </p><p>She turned slightly, studying Agatha in the dim glow of the streetlights. “You know,” she murmured, voice dipping lower, “I really like seeing you like this.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Like what?”</p><p>“Relaxed,” Rio said, letting her fingers graze Agatha’s wrist. “Happy.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, something flickering across her expression — surprise, maybe. Understanding. Her gaze dropped briefly to Rio’s mouth before she met her eyes again.</p><p>And then, before either of them could overthink it, Rio took a step forward and pressed Agatha against the cool brick of the bar.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to react before Rio’s lips were on hers — firm, certain, stealing the breath from her lungs. She gasped softly against her mouth, her hands finding Rio’s waist, pulling her closer as she melted into the kiss.</p><p>It was different from their first. No hesitation. No questions. Just a slow, deep certainty, the weight of the night pressing in around them.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Agatha exhaled, her forehead resting lightly against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio smirked. “You make me want to do reckless things.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet laugh. “That was reckless.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hummed. “Not sorry.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, arms still around Rio’s waist. She let out a contented sigh.</p><p>Rio pushed a strand of her hair behind her ear, “You know… when I told you what Nicky said about the girlfriend thing?”</p><p>Agatha's expression softened. “Yeah?”</p><p>“You didn’t object.”</p><p>A slow smile tugged at Agatha’s lips. “Neither did you.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a beat, then, almost shyly, she admitted, “No. I didn’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s  grip on her tightened, just slightly. “Do you want to object?”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, something settling in her chest as she shook her head. “No,” she said, quiet but sure. “I don’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s  smile widened, a warmth flickering behind her eyes. “Good,” she inhaled deeply before glancing down at her phone. “Come home with me?”</p><p>Rio’s brows lifted slightly, but then a slow, easy grin spread across her lips. “Yeah,” she said. “I’d like that.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, relieved, before pulling up the Uber app.</p><p>“You keep looking at me like that, Vidal,” she murmured without looking up, “and I might have to reconsider inviting you over.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “No, you won’t.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, but she didn’t argue.</p><p>A few minutes later, the Uber arrived, and they slid into the backseat together. The drive to Wanda’s was quiet, filled with an easy anticipation. Agatha sent a quick text letting Wanda know they were on their way, and Rio watched the way her fingers moved over the screen, something oddly domestic about it.</p><p>When they reached Wanda’s, Agatha barely had to knock before the door swung open.</p><p>Wanda stood there, arms crossed, eyes flicking between them with an amused smirk. “Well, well,” she drawled. “Look who finally decided to call it a night.”</p><p>“Don’t start,” Agatha warned, stepping inside.</p><p>Rio just grinned. “Hey, Wanda.”</p><p>“Hey, Rio.” Wanda smirked. “Have fun?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look. “Nicky?”</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “He’s on the couch, passed out. Viz got them all settled after soccer practice.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair. “I appreciate it.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes flicked to Rio, her smirk deepening. “You ready for an early morning? That kid’s got more energy than should be legally allowed.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I can handle it.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Wanda clearly didn’t believe her, but she stepped aside.</p><p>Agatha moved to the couch, kneeling beside Nicky. “Nicky, sweetheart,” she murmured, brushing his hair back.</p><p>He stirred, blinking up at her. “Mom?”</p><p>“Time to go home, baby.”</p><p>Nicky yawned, rubbing his eyes before noticing Rio. “Rio.”</p><p>“Hey, bud,” Rio said softly. “You ready?”</p><p>He nodded, still groggy, as Agatha helped him up. She grabbed his backpack, giving Wanda a grateful look. “Thanks again.”</p><p>Wanda smiled. “Don’t mention it. Have a good night, you guys.”</p><p>As they stepped outside, Nicky curled up against Agatha’s side, half-asleep before they even reached the waiting Uber.</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eye, and in the quiet hum of the ride home, she reached over, lacing their fingers together.</p><p>Agatha squeezed back.</p><p>Tonight, everything felt exactly as it should be.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <span>Wednesday evening came too quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned against the lockers at the firehouse, scrolling through her phone while the rest of her shift wound down. The station was still buzzing with activity—someone was messing with the coffee machine in the kitchen, a couple of the guys were finishing reports, and Alice was loudly debating something with William near the engine bay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tuned it all out, her focus entirely on her phone as she typed out a message.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Just confirming—your plan is still to leave after your shift?</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Yep. Gonna power through and drive straight there. Should get to my parents’ place around 9ish.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That’s a long day.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>I’ve had longer</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grinned, knowing exactly how Agatha would react to that—probably shaking her head, maybe even rolling her eyes a little. And sure enough, a moment later—</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Still. Be careful on the road.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Always.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The conversation stretched into easy back-and-forth messages. They made tentative plans to see each other over the weekend once Rio was back in town. She’d be working Friday, but maybe they could grab dinner on Saturday. And if not, definitely Sunday.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time she threw her duffel bag over her shoulder and headed out to her car, she was still smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few hours later, Rio stepped into her parents’ house and was immediately wrapped in the familiar warmth of home. Her mom pulled her into a hug, her dad clapped her on the back, and before she even made it to the kitchen, one of her brothers was already trying to wrestle her into a headlock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was chaos. Loud, overwhelming, wonderful chaos.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She spent the rest of the evening catching up with her family — helping her mom sneak extra seasoning into a dish, listening to her dad talk about his latest garage project, and bickering with her brothers over who was washing the dishes. Her sister Gabriela, of course, was the ringmaster of it all, stirring up trouble and dodging responsibility at every turn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Rio finally got a moment to herself, it was late, and she was sprawled out on her childhood bed, scrolling through her phone. She was about to text Agatha when her phone buzzed first.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Incoming video call: Agatha.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A grin tugged at her lips as she swiped to accept, and then Agatha’s face filled the screen, slightly grainy but still just as stunning as ever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Rio greeted, her voice already softening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey yourself,” Agatha murmured, a small smile on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted, getting more comfortable against her pillows. “Just got exiled to my room for a bit. Too much chaos in the kitchen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “You? Running from chaos? I don’t believe it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes, about to retort, when suddenly there was a blur of movement behind her — a mess of dark hair and a wicked grin as her sister Gabriela all but launched herself onto the bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ohhh,” Gabriela sing-songed, peering at the screen, “is this the girlfriend?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned, trying to shove her away. “Gabi, seriously—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Gabriela was already grinning wide. “Hi! You must be Agatha. I’m Gabriela, everyone’s favorite sibling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an amused brow. “Oh? I was under the impression that was Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela gasped dramatically. “She told you that? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lies. Slander</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned again. “Please ignore her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no, don’t ignore me,” Gabriela insisted. “I have questions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio made a strangled noise. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>do not</span>
  </em>
  <span> have questions—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, but I do,” Gabriela countered, eyes dancing. Then she leaned in closer to the camera and whispered, “Blink twice if you’re in this under duress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha actually laughed, and Rio buried her face in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hate you,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you love me,” Gabriela corrected smugly before turning back to Agatha. “It’s nice to meet you. And don’t worry, I won’t actually interrogate you. Yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate that,” Agatha said, thoroughly entertained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela, still lounging on Rio’s bed, leaned in toward the screen with a conspiratorial grin. “Sooo, how did you two meet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha glanced at Rio, whose expression was already screaming oh no.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At Northwestern,” Agatha said smoothly. “I’m her professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela’s eyes widened. “Wait, </span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” She whirled on Rio, smacking her arm. “You didn’t tell me that part!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned, rubbing her temples. “Because I knew you’d be like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela cackled. “Oh, this is so much better than I imagined.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s not just my professor,” Rio muttered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha, enjoying this far too much, took pity on her. “Technically, we met before that,” she said, tilting her head. “Rio pulled me out of a wrecked car.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela’s mouth dropped open. “Wait. Wait. You—” She turned to Rio. “You saved her life, </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> she’s your professor? This is straight-up a soap opera. Tell me there was dramatic eye contact. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tell me</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned. “I was literally just doing my job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And yet,” Gabriela mused, looking back at Agatha, “here you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips twitched. “Here I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela shook her head in awe. “Unbelievable. You’re living in a romance novel, baby girl,” she ruffled Rio’s hair, much to her utter embarrassment. “I’m a little jealous, to be honest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave Agatha a long-suffering look. “You see what I deal with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled. “I think it’s charming.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela grinned. “Oh, I like her. She’s smart </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> hot!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned again as Gabriela dramatically flopped off the bed and walked out, still laughing to herself. “Bye, Agatha! It was nice to meet you,” she called out over her shoulder before closing the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “I have to say, I like her too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure you do,” Rio huffed, but there was warmth in her eyes as she let her head tip back against the pillow. “I miss you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s teasing faded into something softer, something real. “I miss you too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The house was quiet that morning, the kind of stillness that only came after a long night of family and food. Most of the household was still sleeping off the previous night’s Thanksgiving feast, but Rio had never been the type to sleep in, even when she wanted to. Not when her mind was tangled in thoughts of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She found her mother in the kitchen, already making coffee, the rich aroma filling the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re up early,” her mom said, glancing over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave a half-hearted shrug as she pulled out a chair at the kitchen table. “So are you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother hummed, setting down two mugs before sitting across from her. She didn’t say anything else, just took a slow sip of her coffee and gave Rio that look — one that had always made her feel like a kid caught sneaking cookies before dinner. Like her mom could see straight through her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled, rubbing the back of her neck. “I, uh… there’s something I wanna tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother just nodded, waiting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitated, fingers drumming against the ceramic of her mug. “I’m seeing someone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The slow, knowing smile that spread across her mom’s face was both comforting and terrifying. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Rio huffed, shaking her head. “Her name’s Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mom tilted her head slightly. “Agatha.” She let the name settle before taking another sip of coffee. “Tell me about her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio ran a hand through her hair. “She’s… incredible. She’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>brilliant</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The kind of person who walks into a room and everyone just knows she’s the smartest person there. Sharp as hell, but also—” She sighed. “She’s got this softness under all of it, you know? Even if she tries to hide it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mom’s smile grew. “You’re already completely gone for her, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a dry laugh. “I think I was from the start.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mom’s gaze softened. “How did you meet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitated for a second, then decided there was no point in holding back now. “I was the one who got the call about her accident,” she admitted. “She and her son — his name is Nicky — were in a car crash. Nothing too serious, but I was the paramedic on scene. I pulled her out of the wreck. That’s how we met.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother blinked, surprised. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Dios mío</span>
  </em>
  <span>. That’s a hell of a way to meet someone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Rio breathed out a small laugh. “And then a week later, I walked into class and there she was—my professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That made her mother’s eyebrows rise. “Your professor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not just my professor,” Rio murmured, voice quieter now. “My mentor, too. She’s overseeing my research project.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mom sat back slightly, absorbing that. “That’s complicated, </span>
  <em>
    <span>mija</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” Rio dragged a hand down her face. “That’s what I keep telling myself. That it’s too complicated, too risky. But I can’t—” She exhaled shakily. “I can’t help it. I tried to fight it, I really did. But then she’d look at me, or say my name a certain way, and it was over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother watched her carefully. “And how does she feel about you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed. “She’s scared, too. I know she is. She tries to keep a distance sometimes, keep things professional, but then she’ll just…break. Like the way she kisses me when she thinks too hard about it. Or the way she’s letting me in, little by little. And then there’s Nicky — her kid is amazing, Mom, and I—” She let out a shaky breath, pressing her fingertips to her temple. “I’m already in too deep. I don’t know how to not feel this way anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother reached across the table, taking Rio’s hand in hers. Her grip was warm, steady. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Mija</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she said gently. “Loving someone is always a risk. But if she makes you happy, if you trust her, then let yourself have this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked down at their joined hands, swallowing past the tightness in her throat. “But what if I get hurt?” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother gave her hand a small squeeze. “Then you get back up. But you don’t run from something good just because you’re scared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a shaky exhale.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a moment, her mom gave her a teasing smirk. “I’m gonna need to meet this woman properly, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a watery laugh. “Yeah. I figured.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother sat back, nodding as if she’d made up her mind. “I like her already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You don’t even know her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother smiled knowingly. “I know </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And I see the way you talk about her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t fight the small smile that tugged at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother took another sip of coffee before leveling her with a look. “She’d better be worth all this stress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a breath of laughter, shaking her head. “She is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mom’s eyes twinkled. “Good.” Then she grinned. “And if she’s as brilliant as you say, I’m sure she already knows she’s got a very protective Puerto Rican mother to win over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. “I’m never telling her that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mom just laughed, patting her hand. “Too late. I am meeting her. And when I do, I’ll tell her myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, shaking her head, but she was smiling. “Great.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Rio crossed into Chicago city limits, exhaustion was beginning to creep in. The long drive, the emotional weight of the past few days, and the knowledge that she had a shift coming up soon all pressed against her, making her shoulders ache.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled into the firehouse parking lot just as her phone buzzed in the cupholder.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Back in one piece?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, grabbing her phone as she killed the engine.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">

</p><p align="right">

  <span>.</span>
</p><p>

  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Somehow I doubt that.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed out a quiet laugh, running a hand through her hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Get some coffee. Be safe</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Always. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stared at that last message for a second, then tucked her phone away and stepped into the station, the familiar hum of the place washing over her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Rio sat on the bench in the locker room, rolling out the tension in her shoulders, she pulled out her phone and sent a quick message.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Shift’s over. Finally.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She leaned back against the cool metal of the lockers, letting out a slow breath as she waited. It had been a long night, but not the worst she’d ever had. Still, exhaustion clung to her limbs, making her crave a hot shower and something decent to eat. A few hours of decent sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How was it?</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Not bad. A few calls. Nothing too crazy.</span>

</p><p>

  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Good</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a brief pause, and then another message came through.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Have you eaten?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked, already suspecting where this was going.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Haven’t had the chance yet</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m making breakfast. You should stop by</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio raised an eyebrow, biting back a grin. Casual. Like it wasn’t a big deal. But the fact that Agatha was inviting her over first thing in the morning, after everything that had happened between them before Rio left for Thanksgiving? Yeah. It felt like something.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>You’re cooking for me now?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t get used to it</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Too late. Be there soon.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabbed her bag and slung it over her shoulder, already feeling lighter as she headed for the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio parked in front of Agatha’s house, shutting off the engine and taking a second to just sit there. The sky was still tinged with the last traces of dawn, the crisp morning air visible in the breath she exhaled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was exhausted, sore from a long shift, but the anticipation buzzing under her skin was enough to keep her moving. It had only been a few days, but it felt longer. Too long.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking her head at herself, she grabbed her bag and stepped out of the car, making her way up the steps. Before she could knock, the door swung open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood there, wrapped in a soft-looking sweater, her hair a little messy like she’d only run her fingers through it. Her lips parted slightly, like she’d been expecting Rio, but still wasn’t prepared for the sight of her standing there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, leaning against the doorframe. “Hey, Professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed, but her lips twitched. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm, you missed me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but Rio caught the way her gaze lingered, the warmth in her expression. She stepped back, opening the door wider. “Come inside before you freeze.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped in, the warmth of the house immediately sinking into her skin. It smelled like coffee and something fresh, something good. She glanced toward the kitchen. “You actually cooking or just putting together something fancy from a box?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave her a dry look. “I’ll have you know, I am perfectly capable of making a decent breakfast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked, toeing off her boots. “Guess I’ll be the judge of that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, but there was something softer in her expression now, something unguarded as she watched Rio settle in like she belonged there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t think — she just acted. With Agatha this close, her warmth sinking into Rio’s skin, her voice quiet and unguarded, there was only one thing left to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She closed the distance, pressing her lips to Agatha’s in a kiss that was soft, lingering, the kind that said I missed you without needing any words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha melted into it almost instantly, her fingers curling around Rio’s sweater, pulling her just a fraction closer. It wasn’t rushed or desperate—just a slow, aching relief, like drinking water after a long shift, like coming home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally broke apart, neither of them stepped back. Agatha’s forehead rested against Rio’s, their breaths mingling in the small space between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, hands still resting on Agatha’s waist. “That a good enough hello?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed out a small laugh, shaking her head. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio murmured, brushing her thumb over Agatha’s hip. “But you like me anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t deny it. She just let out a small sigh, a quiet hum of contentment, and Rio was about to kiss her again—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio barely had time to turn before Nicky came bounding toward her, full of excitement. She stepped back just in time, just enough to make it look like nothing had happened—though Agatha’s slightly flushed cheeks were a dead giveaway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky crashed into Rio, hugging her tight. She laughed, lifting him slightly before setting him back down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, buddy!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were gone for </span>
  <em>
    <span>forever</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Nicky said dramatically, looking up at her with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Rio said, ruffling his hair. “But I’m back now. And I hear there’s breakfast?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s face lit up. “Yeah! Mom made eggs, bacon and French toast!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced at Agatha, raising an impressed eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha crossed her arms, unimpressed. “Yes, Rio. I know how to cook. You’re well aware of that by now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked, like she wasn’t entirely convinced. “Guess we’ll see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky didn’t give her a chance to tease further, grabbing her hand and tugging her toward the kitchen. “Come on! Before it gets cold!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio followed, catching Agatha’s gaze over Nicky’s head. Agatha just shook her head, exhaling a laugh, but there was no hiding the warmth in her expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yeah. Rio had missed this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a few days later, and the early morning was freezing, a flurry of snowflakes falling as Rio walked from her car to the cozy cafe near the firehouse. The bell above the café door jingled as she stepped inside, rubbing at her tired eyes. It was early, just past six, and she’d barely managed to drag herself here after her shift. She just wanted caffeine — something hot and strong to keep her upright until she could crash for a few hours.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was just waiting for her order when she heard it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her heart stumbled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned slowly, almost unwillingly, and there she was — Sam.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Rio just stared. It had been nearly seven years, but the sight of Sam still hit like a gut punch. She looked almost exactly the same — sharp hazel eyes, a familiar dimple in her cheek, the same confident stance. Except now, there was something softer in her expression, something hesitant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, Rio thought bitterly. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Now</span>
  </em>
  <span> you hesitate?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow,” Sam breathed, looking her over. “I—I wasn’t sure it was you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio forced a shrug, keeping her face blank. “Well. It is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sam let out a breath, shifting on her feet. “You look good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, shaking her head. “Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sam flinched, and for a brief second, Rio saw something like regret flicker across her face. But it didn’t matter. Nothing Sam felt now could erase what she’d done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seven years ago, Rio needed her. She’d been drowning in grief, barely holding herself together as her grandmother — one of the most important people in her life — slipped away to Alzheimer’s. And Sam had left. She’d walked away when Rio had needed her the most, had chosen distance instead of staying, had told Rio she couldn’t handle it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had abandoned her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now? Now she wanted small talk? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck, no. Fuck her.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio said again, sharper this time. “Whatever you’re about to say? I don’t want to hear it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sam exhaled, rubbing the back of her neck. “Look, I know I messed up—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Messed up?” Rio let out a humorless laugh. “You left me, Sam. You walked away while I was watching my grandmother die.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sam’s face tightened. “I wasn’t in a good place either, Rio. You weren’t the only one hurting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s jaw clenched. “No, but I was the one left behind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sam swallowed, looking down for a moment before meeting Rio’s gaze again. “I am sorry,” she said quietly. “I know it doesn’t change anything, but I need you to know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio inhaled slowly, forcing herself to keep steady. She believed Sam was sorry. But that didn’t mean it mattered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Rio said, voice flat. “But I don’t need that from you anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sam’s expression flickered, but she nodded. “I get it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And with that, Rio turned back to the counter, grabbing her coffee as soon as it was ready. She didn’t look back as she walked out the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sat in her car, her exhaustion had been replaced by something else — an old ache she thought she’d buried. Her muscles felt tight, her throat raw from holding back everything she hadn’t said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wanted to shake it off, to push it aside, but instead, she found herself pulling out her phone and opening her messages. She knew it was too early, but she couldn’t help herself. She needed this. Needed her.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>You up?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha responded almost instantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha </b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I am now. What’s wrong?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitated. She almost brushed it off, almost told her it was nothing. But then she remembered what her mother had told her — don’t run from something good just because you’re scared.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Can I come over?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A brief pause. Then—</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Of course. Come.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled, already grabbing her keys. She didn’t know what she needed right now, but she knew where she wanted to be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The city was still waking up as Rio pulled onto Agatha’s street. The early morning haze clung to the pavement, the air crisp with the lingering bite of autumn. She drummed her fingers against the steering wheel, trying to shake the lingering weight of her conversation with Sam.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had thought she was over it. Thought she had made peace with the way things had ended. But seeing Sam again had ripped something open, and now, all she could think about was how easily someone who claimed to love her had left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And how different it felt with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t know what she was doing, not really. She and Agatha were still figuring it out. But she trusted Agatha in a way she hadn’t trusted anyone in a long time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She parked, climbed out of the car, her body already moving on instinct. Agatha had barely gotten the door open before Rio was there, stepping inside, the warmth of the house wrapping around her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took one look at her face and softened. “Come here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let herself be pulled in, Agatha’s arms wrapping around her without hesitation. The warmth of her, the steadiness—it was like exhaling after holding her breath for too long.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a while, neither of them said anything. Agatha just held her, hands smoothing over Rio’s back in slow, grounding strokes. It wasn’t rushed or demanding. Just there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Agatha murmured, “Talk to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled against her shoulder, then pulled back just enough to meet Agatha’s gaze. “Ran into my ex this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s brows pulled together. “The one who—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A flicker of something passed through Agatha’s eyes — understanding, maybe even anger on her behalf — but she didn’t push. She just traced her fingers along Rio’s jaw, a quiet invitation to keep going.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She said she was sorry,” Rio continued, voice rough. “And maybe she meant it, I don’t know. But it doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t fix it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Agatha agreed softly. “It doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed, shaking her head. “I thought I was over it. But seeing her just—” She exhaled sharply. “It messed me up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha studied her, then reached up, brushing a loose strand of hair from Rio’s face. “You don’t have to be over it,” she said. “Someone you trusted hurt you. That doesn’t just disappear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s throat tightened. “But I am over her. I don’t want her back. Ever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips curved slightly. “I know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And somehow, that simple acknowledgment made something inside Rio unwind. She let out a breath, some of the tension easing from her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stood there for a long moment, just looking at each other. And then, without thinking, Rio reached out, cupping Agatha’s face in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t move, didn’t pull away. She just let her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hate that she made me afraid,” Rio admitted, voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands came up to rest over Rio’s, her thumbs sweeping gently across her knuckles. “What are you afraid of?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a quiet, almost broken laugh. “That I’m gonna lose something good again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression softened, something deep and warm settling in her gaze. She leaned in, pressing the faintest of kisses to Rio’s forehead, lingering there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going to lose me,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s breath hitched. She closed her eyes, letting herself sink into the moment, into the feeling of Agatha’s lips against her skin, of her steady presence grounding her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled back just enough to look at her again, searching Agatha’s face for any sign of hesitation. But there was none. Just quiet certainty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t overthink it. She just kissed her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t desperate or rushed. It was slow, lingering — an unspoken promise between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for the first time since running into Sam, Rio felt like she could breathe again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips were soft against hers, the kiss slow and steady, like neither of them were in any hurry to let go. Rio tilted her head, deepening it just a little, her fingers curling at Agatha’s waist. There was something grounding about this — about the way Agatha gave herself over to the moment, to Rio. No second-guessing, no hesitation. Just them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally parted, their foreheads touched, breaths mingling in the quiet space between them. Agatha’s hands settled on Rio’s arms, a gentle weight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay?” Agatha murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a breath, nodding. “Yeah.” She huffed a small laugh, pressing her thumb against the corner of Agatha’s mouth. “You always ask me that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched a brow, her lips twitching. “And?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “I like it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression softened. She shifted, fingers trailing lightly along the inside of Rio’s wrist. “You don’t have to be okay all the time, you know,” she said. “You don’t always have to power through.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something tightened in Rio’s chest. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha searched her face for a moment, then nodded, accepting that for now. “Come on,” she said, voice gentle. “Let’s get some coffee in you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let Agatha tug her toward the kitchen, watching as she moved around the space, making the process look effortless. She filled the silence with the small things — asking how Rio’s shift had gone, whether she’d managed to eat, little details that, somehow, made Rio feel more seen than anything else had in a long time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha slid a mug toward her, Rio wrapped her hands around it, savoring the warmth. “Thanks,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha just hummed, watching her over the rim of her own mug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a while, they just sat in comfortable silence, the early morning light slipping through the windows, painting soft gold across Agatha’s face. It was easy — the kind of quiet that didn’t demand anything, that just was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Rio realized she needed this. Needed her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while, she set her mug down and exhaled. “I meant what I said before,” she admitted. “I don’t want to lose this. I don’t want to lose you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha met her gaze, something unreadable passing through her expression. Then she reached across the table, her fingers brushing lightly over Rio’s hand. “Then don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed, her heart beating a little too fast. “Is it that simple?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave a small, wry smile. “Nothing about this is simple, Rio. We know it’s not. But it’s ours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something in Rio settled at that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned her hand over, lacing her fingers through Agatha’s, and let herself hold on.</span>
</p><p>

  <p>Agatha watched as Rio sat at the kitchen table, fingers idly tracing patterns against her mug. She had barely taken more than a few sips of her coffee, her shoulders heavier than usual, the weight of the morning — and everything that had come before it — settling deep into her bones.</p><p>It wasn’t just exhaustion from her shift. Agatha could see it in the way Rio blinked a little too slowly, in the tension at the corners of her mouth. The run-in with her ex was still clinging to her.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, setting her own mug down. “Why don’t you just stay?” she murmured.</p><p>Rio blinked, looking up at her. “Stay?”</p><p>“You’re exhausted,” Agatha said, leaning against the counter. “Just go upstairs, get some sleep. I’ll wake you when I get back.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her jaw tensing for a moment like she was gearing up to protest. Always so stubborn. But then she sighed, running a hand down her face. “I don’t want to—”</p><p>“Be a bother?” Agatha finished for her, arching a brow.</p><p>Rio gave her a sheepish look, rubbing the back of her neck. “I just—”</p><p>Agatha reached for her hand, squeezing gently. “Just stay,” she repeated, softer now.</p><p>Rio hesitated a beat longer, but her body betrayed her. The sheer exhaustion in her muscles, the way her eyes drooped slightly, the way her fingers curled instinctively around Agatha’s — it all gave her away.</p><p>“…Okay,” she finally murmured, barely more than a breath.</p><p>Agatha tugged on her hand, guiding her up the stairs and into her bedroom. The room was dim in the early morning light, the bed neatly made, untouched since she’d woken up with Rio’s text. Agatha let go of Rio’s hand and moved to the dresser, pulling out a pair of sweatpants and an oversized shirt—one Rio had worn before, soft with age.</p><p>She set them on the bed before turning back to find Rio already peeling off her hoodie, her movements sluggish but practiced.</p><p>Something about the way she moved—the way exhaustion weighed her down but didn’t break her — made something in Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>She stepped forward before she could think twice about it, wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist from behind, pressing her forehead between her shoulder blades. She felt Rio sigh, her whole body sinking into the embrace like it was second nature.</p><p>Agatha tightened her arms, pressing a kiss between Rio’s shoulder blades, then another against the side of her neck. Just holding her there, wanting nothing more than to take away the weight pressing down on her.</p><p>Rio sighed again, this time almost contentedly, before turning in Agatha’s arms. Her hands found Agatha’s waist as she leaned in, pressing a soft, grateful kiss against her lips. It wasn’t rushed or deep, just there — a quiet thank you, a moment of surrender.</p><p>Then, without another word, Rio climbed into bed, burrowing under the duvet with a muffled groan.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, shaking her head as she gathered her own outfit for the day before heading into the bathroom.</p><p>By the time she emerged, hair damp from her shower, Rio was already fast asleep.</p><p>And that’s when it hit her.</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>The realization was quiet at first, settling in the back of her mind.</p><p>Then it bloomed.</p><p>Something warm and terrifying all at once.</p><p>
  <em>She loved her.</em>
</p><p>It wasn’t a question, wasn’t a maybe. It was a truth, sitting heavy in her chest like it had been there for longer than she’d realized.</p><p>She had a momentary jolt of panic — a brief, instinctual what the hell am I supposed to do with this? But then she looked at Rio again, at the peaceful rise and fall of her breathing, at the way she had curled into herself like she was finally safe enough to let go.</p><p>And suddenly, it didn’t feel so terrifying after all.</p><p>She exhaled, shaking her head at herself before turning toward the door.</p><p>Nicky would be up soon.</p><p>And for now, that was enough.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Before leaving for work, Agatha made her way back to the bedroom. The room was still quiet, the curtains drawn just enough to let in a sliver of  the soft morning light.</p><p>Rio was curled up under the duvet, her breathing steady, her face finally relaxed in sleep. She looked soft like this — no weight of exhaustion dragging down her features, no lingering tension in her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha lingered in the doorway for a moment, just watching her.</p><p>Then, without thinking, she stepped closer, sitting lightly on the edge of the bed. She reached out, brushing a strand of dark hair away from Rio’s face, fingers barely grazing her cheek, before pressing a gentle kiss to her hair.</p><p>Warmth spread through her chest, full and steady.</p><p>It had been a long time since she had felt something like this — if she ever truly had before.</p><p>She let herself sit there for a beat longer, taking in the sight of Rio safe in her bed, before finally standing and making her way downstairs.</p><p>~*~</p><p>A few hours later, just as she was finishing up a consultation, her phone buzzed on her desk.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong> </p><p>
  <em>Hey, I’m making lunch. If you have time, stop by.</em>
</p><p>Agatha felt a small smile tug at her lips before she even realized it.</p><p>Her fingers hovered over the keyboard for a second before she typed back.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha</strong> </p><p align="right">
  <em>I’ll be there soon.</em>
</p><p><strong>Rio</strong> </p><p>
  <em>Good. I’ll make extra.</em>
</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha</strong> </p><p align="right">
  <em>You better.</em>
</p><p>Tucking her phone away, Agatha gathered her things and headed out.</p><p>When she arrived, the scent of something savory filled the air. She stepped into the kitchen to find Rio standing at the stove, stirring a pan, looking far more awake than she had that morning. She was still in the oversized shirt and sweatpants Agatha had given her, her hair slightly mussed from sleep.</p><p>Rio looked up at the sound of footsteps, offering a sheepish smile. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, arms crossing over her chest. “You’re supposed to be resting.”</p><p>“I did rest,” Rio countered, nudging at the food with a spatula. “For hours, actually. Woke up starving, so I figured I’d make something before heading to the library.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flickered over Rio, taking in the way she was still in the oversized shirt and sweatpants she had left for her. The sight sent something warm curling low in her stomach.</p><p>Rio glanced around as if suddenly realizing what she’d done, then let out a small laugh, rubbing the back of her neck. “Hope you don’t mind that I just — y’know — made myself at home.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, lips twitching. “No, I don’t mind.” Her voice was quieter now, softer. “I like coming home to you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked up to hers at that, something shifting in them before she turned back to the stove, focusing intently on the food. “Yeah, well. Figured I owed you breakfast after letting me crash here like a total mess.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, leaning against the counter beside her. “You weren’t a mess,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio let out a small, disbelieving huff but didn’t argue. Instead, she plated the food, nudging Agatha’s hip with hers. “Sit down, professor. I’ll make you a plate.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but did as she was told, settling at the table as Rio brought over two plates of steaming stir-fry.</p><p>They ate together, conversation easy, the morning’s weight feeling more distant now.</p><p>At some point, Rio glanced up between bites. “How’s your day been?”</p><p>Agatha wiped the corner of her mouth with her napkin. “Busy. I had a consultation this morning.”</p><p>Rio’s brows lifted slightly. “Oh, yeah? At the hospital?”</p><p>“No, my practice.”</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised. “Your practice?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly. “I see private patients twice a week. Mostly consults, post-op care, and a few long-term cases.”</p><p>Rio let out a low whistle. “Damn. And here I thought your schedule couldn’t possibly get busier.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Surprised?”</p><p>“Not really,” Rio admitted. “You’re kind of a machine.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, reaching for her water. “I prefer ‘highly disciplined.’”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Of course you do.”</p><p>They finished eating, the easy rhythm between them settling into something comfortable.</p><p>As Rio stretched, checking the time, she sighed. “I should head out soon.”</p><p>Agatha gathered the dishes, glancing at her. “I’ll go with you. I have a meeting at Northwestern.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>As they stepped out into the crisp Chicago afternoon, Rio twirled her keys around her finger, glancing over at Agatha. “You good with me driving?”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Should I be concerned?”</p><p>Rio smirked, unlocking the car. “I’m an excellent driver, professor.” She shot Agatha a teasing glance before slipping into the driver’s seat.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but climbed in, settling into the passenger seat as Rio started the car. The engine rumbled to life, and soon they were weaving through the streets of Chicago, the city buzzing around them.</p><p>The drive was smooth, the kind of comfortable silence that neither of them felt the need to fill. Agatha found herself watching Rio in the quiet moments — the way she kept one hand on the wheel, the other tapping absently against the gearshift, the faint concentration in her brow as she navigated the traffic.</p><p>When they pulled onto Northwestern’s campus, the place was already teeming with students. Rio eased the car into a parking spot, shifting into park before letting out a small breath. “Alright. Made it in one piece.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, unbuckling her seatbelt. “You’re very proud of yourself, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio shot her a grin. “A little.”</p><p>They stepped out of the car, and as they started towards the main building, Agatha felt it — a shift in the air, the distinct sensation of being watched.</p><p>She followed the prickling at the back of her neck, her gaze sweeping the campus before landing on a familiar figure in the distance.</p><p>Jordan.</p><p>He stood near the entrance, his expression thunderous, his gaze locked onto them.</p><p>A shiver ran through Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Rio, beside her, was still oblivious, focused on adjusting her bag strap as they walked. Agatha hesitated for only a second before schooling her expression, forcing herself to look away.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what unsettled her more — the way Jordan was staring at them, or the quiet, inevitable sense that this wasn’t the last time she’d feel his eyes on her.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha spent the afternoon buried in work, which was exactly what she needed to shake the lingering unease that had settled over her after earlier this afternoon. She had three back-to-back meetings with her mentees, each one at different stages of their research projects, and she gave them her full attention, pushing them to refine their ideas and plan their next steps.</p><p>By the time she wrapped up the last meeting, she let herself lean back in her chair, exhaling slowly. Three down, two to go. Rio and her other mentee were scheduled for the next afternoon.</p><p>The thought of Rio tugged at something in her chest. She had been carrying herself differently since this morning — quieter, a little withdrawn, the weight of that run-in with her ex still pressing against her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha pulled out her phone before she could overthink it.</p><p align="right">
  <strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>How’s the library treating you?</em>
</p><p>A few minutes passed before Rio’s response came through.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong> </p><p>
  <em>Still here. My laptop and I are in a deeply toxic relationship at this point.</em>
</p><p>Agatha smirked, shaking her head.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha</strong> </p><p align="right">
  <em>Have you eaten?</em>
</p><p>This time, Rio’s response was quicker.</p><p>
  <strong>Rio</strong>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>…Do a granola bar and a questionable cup of coffee count?</em>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She didn’t even bother with a response before grabbing her coat.</p><p>The café was only a short walk from campus, and by now, she knew exactly what to order. She got herself a latte and grabbed a black coffee for Rio, along with a croissant and one of those chocolate chip muffins Rio always gravitated toward when they were together.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Agatha stepped into the library, scanning the rows of tables until she spotted her.</p><p>Rio was hunched over her laptop, one hand in her hair, her brows furrowed as she stared at whatever was on the screen. A half-empty cup of coffee sat forgotten at the edge of the table, and Agatha didn’t even have to get closer to know it was cold.</p><p>Shaking her head, she approached, setting the coffee and the bag of pastries on the table without a word.</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise, glancing up. When she saw Agatha, her face lit up, a slow smile spreading across her lips.</p><p>“Oh,” she said, eyes dropping to the coffee. “Well, hello there.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, raising an eyebrow. “A granola bar and whatever that was—” she nodded at the abandoned cup “—is unacceptable.”</p><p>Rio hummed, already reaching for the latte. “You’re starting to sound a lot like my mother.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, shaking her head. “I’ll take that as an insult.”</p><p>Rio just grinned, pulling the pastry bag closer. “You check on all your mentees like this, professor?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Don’t flatter yourself.”</p><p>Rio let out a soft laugh, taking a sip of her coffee. “Mm. You know, I was going to share my groundbreaking insights for our next meeting tomorrow. But now? I’m not sure.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I think I’ll survive.”</p><p>Rio hummed again, clearly amused. “We’ll see.”</p><p>Agatha sat down across from her, watching as Rio tore off a piece of croissant and popped it into her mouth. She was still tired — Agatha could see it in the way she moved, the slight slump in her shoulders — but some of the tension from earlier had faded.</p><p>That was enough.</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her own coffee, glancing at the open laptop screen. “What are you working on?”</p><p>Rio immediately angled it away from her, shooting her a look. “Oh, no. No, no, no, no. You, of all people, should know I can’t show you that.”</p><p>Agatha arched her brow. “You do realize I’m going to grade it eventually?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, breaking off another piece of croissant. “But I need to maintain an air of mystery.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “And here I thought you were an open book.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Not when it comes to your assignments.”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head, watching as Rio took another bite of food.</p><p>After a moment, she spoke again. “Are you free tonight?”</p><p>Rio quirked an eyebrow. “Why? You trying to get me into bed again?”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath of laughter, shaking her head. “Subtle.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I try.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, leveling her with a look. “I was thinking dinner. And just…spending time together.”</p><p>Something shifted in Rio’s face at that, something softer, but she didn’t look away this time.</p><p>After a beat, she nodded. “Yeah,” she said quietly. “I’d like that.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>The drive to pick up Nicky was quiet, but comfortable. Agatha still felt the lingering warmth of Rio’s soft thank you from earlier, echoing in her chest like a steady hum. She glanced at Rio from the corner of her eye, watching as she absentmindedly drummed her fingers against her thigh, lost in thought.</p><p>When they pulled up to the soccer field, Agatha spotted Nicky immediately — his curls bouncing as he slung his bag over his shoulder, his face lighting up the second he saw them. He ran toward the car at full speed, skidding to a dramatic stop right in front of her.</p><p>“Can we get burgers?” he asked, breathless with excitement.</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “We’ll see.”</p><p>Before she could say anything else, Rio crouched slightly, resting her hands on her thighs as she grinned at Nicky. “How about this — I’m starving, you’re definitely starving, and your mom worked all day. I say we go out, eat too much food, and call it a win.”</p><p>Nicky gasped, spinning back to Agatha with hopeful eyes.</p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head. “Fine. But you are eating vegetables.”</p><p>Nicky groaned, dramatically throwing his head back, and Rio draped an arm over his shoulder as they walked toward the car. “We’ll suffer together, kid.”</p><p>Agatha felt something loosen in her chest at the easy way Rio handled Nicky. It was seamless, effortless in a way Agatha hadn’t even realized she wanted until now.</p><p>The restaurant was warm and busy, filled with the sounds of clinking dishes and quiet conversation. Nicky had devoured his burger and run off to the kids’ area, leaving Agatha and Rio alone at the table.</p><p>Agatha was just about to finish the last of her drink when a familiar voice called her name.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness?”</p><p>She looked up to find a broad-shouldered man approaching the table, his expression bright with recognition.</p><p>“Mr. Gallagher,” she said, straightening slightly.</p><p>Gallagher grinned. “I wasn’t expecting to run into you here. It’s been, what — almost a year?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Agatha agreed. “How have you been?”</p><p>Gallagher beamed. “Better than I ever expected. My wife and I just got back from a trip to Italy, which — if you’d told me two years ago I’d be able to do that, I wouldn’t have believed you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a genuine smile tugging at her lips. “It’s good to hear you’re back to doing the things you love.”</p><p>Gallagher scoffed, shaking his head. “Dr. Harkness, you saved me. That tumor — no one wanted to touch it. Every surgeon I saw turned me away. Said it was too risky.”</p><p>He gestured to her, his voice full of something close to awe. “And then you took one look at my scans and said, ‘I can do it.’ Just like that. And you did.”</p><p>Agatha felt a flicker of discomfort at the attention, but nodded nonetheless. She had long since accepted that she would never enjoy moments like these, no matter how often they happened.</p><p>“You did the hard part,” she said simply. “Recovery takes strength.”</p><p>Gallagher let out a laugh. “Still as humble as ever.” Then, as if just noticing Rio, he turned to her. “Oh, hello. Sorry for the intrusion.”</p><p>Rio smiles, shaking her head. “No worries. It’s always great to hear about Agatha’s accomplishments.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled quietly, bracing herself for Rio’s inevitable teasing, but when she looked at the younger woman, Rio wasn’t smirking.</p><p>Instead, she was watching Agatha with something soft in her expression. Something akin to pride and affection. Agatha felt something shift in her chest—small, subtle, but there.</p><p>She barely had time to analyze it before Gallagher bid them goodbye, leaving them alone again.</p><p>Rio leaned back in her seat, finally smirking now. “Didn’t know I was sitting across from a legend tonight.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Don’t start.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “No, really. He made it sound like you pulled off the impossible.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, swirling the last of her drink in her glass. “It was difficult, yes. But not impossible.”</p><p>Rio studied her. “I bet that’s why you love it.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Love what?”</p><p>“Surgery,” Rio said. “The challenge of it. Figuring out how to do what others think can’t be done.”</p><p>Agatha felt a slow smile pull at her lips. “It is a puzzle,” she admitted. “One I never get tired of solving.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, looking down at her hands. “I can’t wait to get to that part.”</p><p>Agatha watched her for a long moment. She could see it — the hunger, the ambition, the way Rio wanted this.</p><p>“You’ll get there,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio glanced up, her smile small before she asked, “Do you let students watch your surgeries?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “When I can. I was actually thinking about trying to set up a surgical observation for the class in a month or two.”</p><p>Rio’s brows lifted. “Seriously?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Don’t get ahead of yourself. I still need to clear it. But yeah, you guys will be in Neuro II by then, so it’s always a good teaching opportunity.”</p><p>Still, Rio grinned, excitement lighting up her face. “That’s incredible.”</p><p>Agatha hummed. “We’ll see.”</p><p>She let her gaze linger on Rio for a moment longer than necessary, watching the way her eyes shone with enthusiasm.</p><p>It was dangerous, how easy it was to want to indulge her. To want to keep her close.</p><p>And yet, Agatha knew she wasn’t ready to stop.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The house was quiet, save for the steady hum of the heater kicking in. Nicky had barely made it up the stairs before mumbling a sleepy goodnight, leaving Agatha and Rio alone in the kitchen, the night stretching out before them.</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, fingers drumming idly against the surface. “You know, I think this is the first time I come here and Nicky isn’t more than ready to play..”</p><p>Agatha smirked, sipping her wine. “I don’t think he’s ever been this tired. We wore him out.”</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh. “Kid plays hard. I respect it. And I can relate, too. I used to be like that growing up.”</p><p>She took another slow sip of her drink, her movements unhurried, loose in a way that only came with the rare luxury of unwinding. The air between them felt different now — settled, but charged in a way neither of them seemed inclined to disrupt just yet.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly. “Did you play any sports?”</p><p>Rio shot her a quick grin. “Soccer, just like Nicky. Played all through high school, then a bit during college.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Let me guess — you were the star player?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “I was good. Fast. Played forward, scored a lot of goals. But star player?” She took another sip of wine, considering. “I had my moments.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Why do I feel like that’s an understatement?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Maybe.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, then asked, “So why’d you stop?”</p><p>Rio glanced at her over the rim of her glass, then exhaled through her nose, setting her drink down. “Tore my ACL when I was twenty. Pretty bad.”</p><p>Agatha felt something shift in her chest. “That’s a difficult injury to come back from.”</p><p>Rio let out a short laugh. “Yeah, no kidding. I tried, though. Rehab, training, the whole thing.” She drummed her fingers against the counter. “But I wasn’t the same after. Couldn’t move the way I used to.”</p><p>Agatha watched her carefully. There was a familiar weight in Rio’s voice — the quiet resignation of someone who had lost something before they were ready.</p><p>“And that’s when you shifted to medicine?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio nodded, glancing down at her glass. “Guess I figured if I couldn’t play, I’d find a way to fix the people who still could.”</p><p>There was something unspoken beneath the words, something Agatha recognized. That sharp, quiet ache of watching a door close before you were ready.</p><p>She let the silence sit between them for a moment before saying, “It suits you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked, but she didn’t look up. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha took a step closer, just enough to reach out and trace the edge of Rio’s glass with her fingertip. “You care about people more than you let on.”</p><p>Rio finally met her gaze, something flickering behind her eyes. “That so?”</p><p>Agatha hummed. “It is.”</p><p>The space between them felt smaller now. Warmer.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching her carefully. “Is this the part where I thank you for dinner?”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “You already did.”</p><p>Rio smirked, setting her glass down. “Maybe I wanted to say it again.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the shift now — subtle, intoxicating. Her pulse thrummed in her throat as Rio stepped in, close enough that she could smell the faint hint of her perfume, something warm and grounding.</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered down to her lips, lingering. “You tell me when to stop,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her pulse hammering against her ribs. She should say something. A quip, anything. </p><p>But when Rio leaned in, her breath ghosting over Agatha’s skin, all she could do was tilt her chin up and whisper, “Don’t stop.”</p><p>And then— </p><p>Rio kissed her like she’d been waiting all night for it, like the weight of holding back had finally tipped over into something unstoppable. Agatha didn’t hesitate — not this time. She met her halfway, fingers tangling in the hem of Rio’s shirt as she pulled her closer, swallowing the soft sound Rio made when their bodies pressed together.</p><p>They knew the risks, the consequences. But it didn’t matter. Not when Rio’s hands were sliding up her back, not when Agatha was leaning into her touch like she’d been craving it for days. Because she had.</p><p>Agatha broke the kiss just enough to murmur against Rio’s lips, “You keep kissing me like that, we’re not making it out of this kitchen.”</p><p>Rio grinned, breathless, hands slipping lower to grip her hips. “I don’t see the problem.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet laugh, shaking her head before kissing her again, slower this time. Deliberate. She traced her fingers up the back of Rio’s neck, felt the way her pulse kicked up under her touch. It was intoxicating, the way Rio reacted to her. The way she could pull a shiver from her just by dragging her nails lightly against her skin.</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, leaning into her. “Upstairs,” she murmured, voice rough.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Impatient?”</p><p>“Very.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled but didn’t argue, just let Rio take her hand and lead her through the dimly lit house, her heart hammering all the way up the stairs.</p><p>They barely made it to the bedroom before Rio was kissing her again, deeper this time, her hands sliding under Agatha’s blouse, fingertips tracing the warm skin at her waist.</p><p>Agatha exhaled against her lips, letting herself fall into the sensation of it — of Rio pressed against her, of the deliberate way she moved, confident yet careful, like she knew exactly what Agatha wanted before she even asked.</p><p>The door shut behind them with a quiet click, and Agatha barely had time to register it before Rio was walking her backward toward the bed.</p><p>“You sure?” Rio murmured against her jaw, her lips brushing soft and warm over her skin. It wasn’t hesitation — it was a formality, a ritual between them now.</p><p>Agatha curled her fingers in the fabric of Rio’s shirt, tugging her impossibly closer. “I wouldn’t have let you get this far if I wasn’t.”</p><p>Rio let out a quiet laugh, low and knowing. “Good.”</p><p>And then she guided Agatha onto the bed, settling over her with a slow, steady press of warmth, her mouth trailing along Agatha’s throat, over the rapid beat of her pulse.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, let herself sink into it, into Rio’s touch, into the way she moved like she wanted to memorize every inch of her. They didn’t rush — there was no need to. This was different from the last time, from the urgent, desperate need that had pulled them together before. This was something deeper, slower, something that felt dangerously close to indulgence.</p><p>And Agatha — who had spent so much of her life denying herself — wasn’t ready to stop.</p><p> Rio took her time, moving with deliberate care, like she was committing every inch of Agatha to memory. Her lips traced a path down Agatha’s throat, lingering at the hollow of her collarbone before dipping lower.</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, her fingers threading through Rio’s hair, nails scraping lightly against her scalp. She felt Rio smile against her skin at that, and the warmth of it sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p>“You’re awfully quiet tonight,” Rio murmured, her lips brushing just beneath Agatha’s ear.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a soft laugh, tilting her head back. “Would you rather I narrate?”</p><p>Rio huffed, grinning. “I wouldn’t mind knowing what’s going on in that brilliant head of yours.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip in her hair tightened, just enough to pull a quiet sigh from Rio’s lips. “Right now?” She smirked. “Not much beyond you.”</p><p>Rio made a sound low in her throat, something pleased and teasing all at once. “Good answer.”</p><p>She kissed her again, slower this time, drawing it out. Agatha let herself sink into it, let herself be touched, unraveled, loved.</p><p>She didn’t think about the risks, not tonight. Didn’t think about what would happen if someone found out, or what it would mean for them if they weren’t careful.</p><p>Tonight, Rio moved with purpose, her hands and lips tracing slow, heated paths over Agatha’s skin. There was no rush, no urgency—just the steady unraveling of restraint between them. Agatha let herself sink into it, into the warmth of Rio’s body pressed against hers, the quiet sounds she made when Agatha touched her in just the right way.</p><p>She hadn’t expected this. Not just the intimacy, but the way Rio handled her — like she was something to be cherished, like there was nowhere else she’d rather be. It sent something sharp and aching through Agatha’s chest, something dangerously close to longing.</p><p>Rio kissed her way back up, hovering just above Agatha’s lips, her breath warm and uneven. “You good?”</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes, finding nothing but open affection in Rio’s gaze. No doubt, no second-guessing — just her. Just them.</p><p>She swallowed, her fingers trailing over Rio’s back, slow and deliberate. “I’m more than good.”</p><p>Rio grinned, dipping down to press a lingering kiss to the corner of her mouth. “Then let me take care of you.”</p><p>Agatha could’ve argued, could’ve pushed back with a teasing remark, but the truth was — she wanted to let go. Wanted to let Rio touch her, hold her, love her in the quiet way she always did, whether with her hands or the way she looked at her like she was the only thing that mattered.</p><p>So she did. She let Rio take care of her. And for the first time in a long time, Agatha let herself be wanted without fear.</p><p>There was only this. Only Rio.</p><p>Agatha had never been particularly self-indulgent. Even in moments like these, she was used to maintaining control, to keeping some part of herself guarded. But with Rio, it was impossible.</p><p>Because Rio didn’t just touch her — she worshiped her.</p><p>Every kiss, every brush of fingertips over bare skin was deliberate, reverent, like Rio had all the time in the world to memorize every inch of her. And it was overwhelming, this feeling of being adored so thoroughly, of being unraveled piece by piece without hesitation.</p><p>Agatha had thought she knew pleasure, had thought she understood her own limits. But Rio kept pushing her past them, coaxing sounds from her that she would’ve never let escape with anyone else.</p><p>She wasn’t used to being taken apart like this, to someone giving without expectation, to being the one left breathless and undone. </p><p>But Rio… Rio was relentless. She moved with the kind of certainty that came from knowing exactly what she was doing, from paying attention, from learning Agatha’s body like it was something worth studying.</p><p>And god, it was intoxicating.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into the sheets, her head tipping back against the pillows as another sharp wave of pleasure rolled through her. She felt Rio’s smile against her skin, a quiet, satisfied hum following close behind.</p><p>“You’re stunning like this,” Rio murmured against her thigh, her voice low, rough with affection. “Completely wrecked for me.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a shaky breath, trying to find something clever to say, something that would keep her grounded. But nothing came. Nothing except Rio’s name, slipping past her lips in a way that was almost desperate.</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, dragging her lips higher, pressing a kiss just above her hip. “I love hearing you like this,” she admitted, and Agatha knew it was true. Knew that Rio was basking in every reaction, in every sound, in every way Agatha came undone beneath her hands.</p><p>It was terrifying, how good Rio was at this. At making her feel so thoroughly adored, at stripping her down to nothing but sensation, at making her forget — for just a little while — that there was anything outside of this moment.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t afraid. Not tonight.</p><p>Tonight, she let herself drown in it.</p><p>Agatha’s breath quickened, each exhale sharper, more ragged as Rio’s hands, her mouth, her body — everything about her — pushed her closer. It was like Rio could sense every shift in her, every tiny flicker of need. And Rio responded in kind, giving, taking, never rushing, but never letting her linger in the space between desire and fulfillment for too long.</p><p>Agatha could barely hold on to the threads of her thoughts as Rio’s lips trailed up her body again, her touch deliberate, coaxing her toward the edge. Agatha’s chest heaved, her pulse throbbing in time with the heat building inside her, wrapping her up, tightening her stomach, stealing the breath from her lungs.</p><p>“Rio…” The word came out on a gasp, almost a plea, and Rio didn’t need any more invitation than that. She pressed a kiss to Agatha’s neck, a slow, deep kiss that seemed to reach right into her bones, and with it, a rush of pleasure that made Agatha’s whole body tremble.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into the sheets, her legs shaking, as she felt herself nearing that point of no return. Rio was like fire, like a storm that was impossibly gentle and relentless at the same time. She had this way of making Agatha feel both completely out of control and totally anchored, all at once.</p><p>And when Rio shifted again, her touch soft but certain, a quiet, knowing smile on her lips as she looked up at her — Agatha lost it.</p><p>Her body arched into Rio, her head thrown back, the sound of her name spilling from her lips in a ragged whisper as everything inside her seemed to snap. It was electric, overwhelming, and yet there was something almost painfully sweet about the way Rio held her through it, as if she had all the time in the world to watch Agatha fall apart for her.</p><p>Agatha let herself go completely, surrendering to the wave of pleasure crashing over her, feeling it pulse through her veins, leaving her breathless, undone. She clung to Rio’s shoulders, her heart pounding in her chest, her body still trembling in the aftershocks.</p><p>When she finally came down from the high, still shivering in the aftermath, Rio stayed close — her hands gentle now, tender as she kissed the sweat from Agatha’s brow, her lips soft and loving against her skin.</p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved as she tried to catch her breath, her heart still racing, her mind a swirl of scattered thoughts and emotions. She didn’t know how to articulate it, how to say what was left unsaid between them, but in this moment, Rio didn’t need any words to know.</p><p>Agatha reached up to touch her face, her fingers trembling as she brushed a strand of hair from Rio’s forehead. “I—” she started, then faltered, unsure of how to say what she was feeling.</p><p>Rio just smiled softly, leaning in to kiss her again, slow and easy, like they had all the time in the world. And for the first time in what felt like forever, Agatha allowed herself to believe that maybe — just maybe —this was exactly where she was meant to be.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha woke slowly, the warmth of another body pressed against hers grounding her before her mind fully caught up. The weight of Rio’s arm draped around her waist was solid, her face tucked into the crook of Agatha’s neck, breathing deep and even in sleep. Their legs were tangled beneath the sheets, bare skin brushing, and Agatha exhaled softly, letting herself just be in the moment.</p><p>She had woken up alone for years. She had gotten used to it, convinced herself she preferred it. But now — this — the warmth of Rio curled into her, the way their bodies naturally fit together, the soft, unconscious grip of Rio’s fingers against her side — this was something else entirely.</p><p>Something she hadn’t realized she wanted.</p><p>Her hand slid up Rio’s back in slow, lazy strokes, memorizing the feel of her. She was still marveling at the fact that this incredible woman had completely changed her life in a matter of a couple of short months. That she had let her in, had trusted her, had chosen her, again and again.</p><p>She was in love with Rio Vidal.</p><p>Completely. Irrevocably.</p><p>The thought settled heavily in her chest, but not in a way that made her want to run. No, it was something else entirely.</p><p>Rio stirred against her, a quiet sigh slipping past her lips before she nuzzled closer. Her alarm blared seconds later, making her groan sleepily, tucking her face further into Agatha’s neck like she could block out the noise.</p><p>With a deep sigh, Rio reached out blindly, slapping at her phone until the sound cut off. She let out a quiet grumble, then turned her face back into the warmth of Agatha’s skin, lips brushing against her collarbone in a way that sent a slow, lazy heat curling in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>“Five more minutes,” Rio mumbled, voice thick with sleep.</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, fingers dragging up and down the bare expanse of Rio’s back. “You have class, sweetheart.”</p><p>“Mmm. Don’t care. Rather stay here.”</p><p>Agatha felt her chest tighten at that — at the warmth, the closeness, the way Rio made it so impossibly easy to want to stay in bed all day, tangled up in each other. But she knew Rio. Knew how much she cared about her studies.</p><p>With a quiet sigh, Agatha smoothed Rio’s hair back and kissed her temple. “You’ll regret it if you miss it.”</p><p>Rio groaned but finally shifted, lifting her head slightly, blinking down at Agatha with sleep-heavy eyes. She studied her for a moment, then exhaled, dragging her fingers lazily over Agatha’s ribs.</p><p>“Before I forget, I’m going to my parents’ this weekend,” she murmured, voice still thick with sleep.</p><p>Agatha blinked, her hand stilling against Rio’s back. “Oh?”</p><p>“It’s my dad’s birthday,” Rio said, voice quiet. “I figured I should go for the weekend. I should be back Monday morning in time for class.”</p><p>Agatha searched her expression, taking in the soft fondness there. Rio loved her family. Agatha had always known that, had seen glimpses of it in the way Rio spoke about them, the way she lit up when she mentioned her nieces and nephews.</p><p>It wasn’t a big deal. Just two days. And yet, something about the thought of waking up without Rio beside her next weekend made Agatha’s chest tighten in a way she wasn’t entirely prepared for.</p><p>She swallowed, smoothing her fingers along Rio’s side. “That sounds nice.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, studying her. “You okay with that?”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Of course. It’s your family.”</p><p>Rio smiled, soft and warm. “Yeah.” She hesitated for a second, then nuzzled a little closer, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin. “I’ll miss you, though.”</p><p>The words did something to Agatha — made her breath catch, her chest tighten in that helpless, inevitable way that only Rio seemed capable of pulling from her.</p><p>She hesitated, just for a moment, then let her fingers trace along the curve of Rio’s jaw, tilting her face up so their eyes met. “I’ll miss you too.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, and for a second, neither of them moved. Then she leaned in, pressing the gentlest, most unhurried kiss to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Agatha exhaled into it, her hand sliding up into Rio’s hair, holding her there for a moment longer.</p><p>It was only two days. Forty-eight hours.</p><p>But she was going to feel every single one of them.</p><p>~*~</p><p>It turned out that Agatha didn’t see Rio at all after that Thursday morning. Their busy schedules kept them apart, and by the time Saturday morning rolled around, Agatha was already feeling her absence deeply. </p><p>The house felt quieter than usual without Rio there. Agatha tried to busy herself with work, with Nicky’s school projects, but her thoughts kept drifting back to Rio. She had no idea why it felt so strange with Rio gone for only a few days. She’d spent plenty of time without her before, but this was different. There was something about the space Rio had filled in her life that made everything feel a little off when she wasn’t around.</p><p>By the time Saturday night came, Agatha had barely realized how much she needed the distraction until Wanda texted her, suggesting they meet up for dinner. Wanda had a sixth sense when it came to knowing when Agatha needed to be pulled out of her head. Agatha agreed, and before long, she was seated at a cozy restaurant with Wanda and Lilia, a glass of wine in hand.</p><p>The conversation flowed easily — banter, jokes, a few stories about Nicky and the twins — but there was a part of Agatha’s mind that kept circling back to Rio. It wasn’t just the missing pieces of their time together; it was the sudden awareness of how much Rio had come to mean to her. She found herself idly twirling the stem of her wine glass, lost in thought, when Wanda’s voice pulled her back into the present.</p><p>“So,” Wanda said, her tone light but with a hint of knowing in her eyes. “I take it you and Rio are getting pretty serious, huh?”</p><p>Agatha froze, a faint flush coloring her cheeks. She hadn’t meant to talk about this, but the way Wanda said it made her feel like maybe it was time to admit it.</p><p>“I, uh… yeah, I guess so,” Agatha said, her voice quieter than usual. She took a sip of her wine to cover the awkwardness, trying to gauge Wanda’s reaction.</p><p>Lilia, ever the direct one, didn’t let the moment pass without pressing further. “You guess so? That’s a pretty vague answer for someone who’s already spending this much time with her. What’s going on there, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing a hand over her face. She hadn’t realized how much she’d been holding back until that moment. “It’s complicated,” she said, her voice low. “We’re not just… casual. I know that. But everything feels so new. I don’t know if I’m ready for how much this is changing things.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow, leaning in a little. “Changing things? You mean, like… the whole ‘relationship’ thing?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a bit of a laugh escaping her. “Yeah. It’s hard to keep my guard up around her, you know? I’m not used to this. To… wanting someone so much, but also being scared of what happens next.”</p><p>Lilia’s expression softened, and she took a sip of her wine before offering a thoughtful reply. “You’re scared of being vulnerable. You don’t let anyone in like this, not really.”</p><p>Agatha felt her chest tighten. “Exactly. I’ve always kept people at a distance. I guess I’m just afraid of what might happen if things go too far.”</p><p>Wanda shrugged, setting her glass down with a small clink. “You know, Agatha, you’re not the only one who feels that way. But that doesn’t mean you stop. You take the chance. Don’t let fear make you miss out on something good.”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “Look, you’ve spent so much of your life being the one in control, the one who calls the shots. You can’t expect it to be the same with Rio. But that doesn’t mean you have to hold back. You deserve to let someone in.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath, looking at her two friends. There was something in their expressions —soft, encouraging— that made her feel like maybe it was okay to feel this way. Maybe it wasn’t as scary as she’d made it out to be.</p><p>“I’m just…” Agatha began, shaking her head slightly. “I don’t want to screw it up. Rio means a lot to me. And I think she’s starting to mean more than I ever expected.”</p><p>Wanda smiled. “You’ve already got the hard part figured out, Agatha. You’re already being honest with yourself. Now it’s just about taking the leap. You’ve got this.”</p><p>Lilia raised her glass, nodding in agreement. “To taking chances.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, clinking her glass with theirs. “To taking chances.”</p><p>The restaurant had settled into a comfortable hum around them, the low murmur of other patrons blending with the occasional clink of silverware. Agatha felt herself relax slightly, the warmth of the wine making it easier to ignore the strange, unfamiliar weight in her chest — the one that had been there since Rio left.</p><p>She wasn’t expecting Wanda to bring up Rio so directly, but in hindsight, she should have known. Wanda had always had a knack for sniffing out things Agatha wasn’t ready to talk about. And Lilia? She was just as perceptive, but more measured. It was why Agatha wasn’t entirely surprised when the conversation took a more serious turn.</p><p>“You know I’m happy for you, right?” Lilia said, swirling the wine in her glass before fixing Agatha with a steady gaze. “But as much as I’d love to sit here and just gossip about your love life, I’d be a bad friend if I didn’t bring up the elephant in the room.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning back in her chair. “Let me guess — the ethics of it all?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “The ethics of it all.”</p><p>Wanda, who had been content to just sip her wine and watch the conversation unfold, raised an eyebrow. “You knew this was coming.”</p><p>“Of course, I did,” Agatha muttered. “I’ve been thinking about it since—” She hesitated. Since the night she let Rio kiss her. Since the first time she realized she wanted more.</p><p>Lilia, ever direct, pressed on. “Agatha, I trust your judgment. You’re one of the best professors in the department, and I know you’re not the type to give a student special treatment. But if someone else raises concerns? If a student complains about favoritism, or if the university catches wind of it?” She shook her head. “It might not matter what your intentions are. It might be out of my hands.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, running a hand over her face. She knew Lilia was right. She’d spent years navigating academia, she understood how fragile reputations could be. And yet, she had still let herself fall into this with Rio — deep, fast, and completely.</p><p>“So, what are you saying?” Agatha asked, her voice quieter now.</p><p>Lilia leaned forward, her expression unreadable. “For now? I’m willing to look the other way. I haven’t seen anything inappropriate, and unless someone formally raises a complaint, I don’t have a reason to intervene. And I do want you to be happy.”</p><p>A beat of silence stretched between them.</p><p>“But if something does come up,” Lilia continued, “you need to be prepared for the fallout. And if I were you, I’d start thinking about whether you’re willing to keep this going once the semester is over. Because that’s the cleanest way out of this mess.”</p><p>Wanda, who had been quiet for longer than usual, finally spoke. “You knew this was risky, Agatha. But you didn’t stop yourself.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet, humorless chuckle. “No. I didn’t.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened. “Then I think the real question isn’t about ethics. It’s about whether you think she’s worth the risk.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “She is.”</p><p>Lilia studied her for a moment, then nodded. “Then be smart about it. Because the second anyone thinks you’re giving Rio an advantage — whether it’s true or not — that’s when things get ugly.”</p><p>Agatha knew that. She had always known. But hearing Lilia say it so plainly made the reality settle heavier in her chest.</p><p>Still, she didn’t regret it.</p><p>She just needed to be careful.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The weekend had felt too long without Rio. Agatha understood, of course, but that didn’t stop her from feeling the absence. They hadn’t been able to carve out any time together outside of quick messages or stolen moments.</p><p>It was Monday morning before she got to speak to Rio again, briefly, just before class started. The sound of the phone ringing pulled her from her preparations in the lecture hall.</p><p>“Good morning,” Agatha greeted, smiling as she answered.</p><p>“Morning,” Rio’s voice came through, a little strained, like she was rushing. “Sorry, I’m stuck in traffic. I’m gonna be a little late.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze shifted to the door of the lecture hall as she heard students starting to trickle in. “Take your time, just don’t make a habit of it,” she teased.</p><p>“I won’t. I’m almost there.” Rio’s voice softened. “I’ll see you soon, yeah?”</p><p>“Of course. See you soon.”</p><p>She hung up and put the phone on the desk, only to feel a tension coil in her stomach when the first student entered. Jordan. He didn’t greet her, didn’t even acknowledge her presence as he made his way to a seat, only watched her from across the room.</p><p>A cold shiver ran down her spine, but she pushed it down, focused on the task ahead.</p><p>She’d have to take it in stride. She couldn’t let him affect her like this. He was just a disgruntled student — it wasn’t like she’d never dealt with his kind before. </p><p>Time passed, and when Rio finally walked in, it was nearly twenty minutes later. She looked up at Agatha with wide, apologetic eyes. “I’m so sorry. Traffic was awful.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, the corners of her lips pulling into a teasing smile. “Well, Ms. Vidal, it’s nice of you to finally grace us with your presence.”</p><p>Rio winced slightly, a sheepish grin tugging at her lips. “Sorry again, I’ll try to be better next time.”</p><p>“It’s alright,” Agatha replied softly, though she couldn’t help but feel the soft flutter of relief at seeing her. “Take your seat.”</p><p>As the lecture progressed and they moved toward the end, Agatha felt herself getting more and more excited. There was something thrilling about the idea of bringing her students into the OR, especially the ones who had potential. When she spoke about the upcoming surgery, the class listened intently.</p><p>“In about a month or two, you’ll have the chance to observe a surgery,” she said, glancing around the room, letting the anticipation settle in. “And two of you will get the privilege of being in the OR with me.”</p><p>Gasps and murmurs filled the room.</p><p>She continued, “In order to be considered, you’ll need to do well on your presentation. I’ll be evaluating each of you, alongside three other colleagues from the Neurology department. This is your chance to make an impression if neurology is the specialty you’re aiming for.”</p><p>The excitement in the room was palpable, but Agatha’s eyes immediately flicked to Rio, noticing the spark of amazement in her gaze. There was something so real about the way Rio’s excitement radiated; it made Agatha feel proud, in a way she couldn’t quite explain.</p><p>When class finally ended, Agatha locked eyes with Rio before she left, and tapped her phone on the desk, hoping she’d get the message. She waited until all her students had left before quickly typing out:</p><p align="right">
  <strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>I’m waiting for you in my office.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the smile that tugged at her lips as she stepped into her office. The space was comfortable, familiar — just as it always had been before Rio entered her life. She set her things down, trying to focus on the pile of papers she had to grade, but her mind kept drifting back to Rio, to their shared moments, and the undeniable pull she felt toward her.</p><p>She hadn’t even sat down yet when she heard the door to her office open, and a moment later, Rio was standing there, her warm smile spreading across her face. But there was something else in her eyes, a dangerous glint that sent a shiver through Agatha’s body. She slowly closed the door, locking it with purpose.</p><p>Before Agatha could react, Rio was on her, pushing her gently but firmly against her desk. Agatha’s breath caught as Rio pressed her body close, the heat between them instantly noticeable, the space between their lips charged with a kind of longing that hadn’t been there before.</p><p>The kiss came quickly, fiercely — Rio’s lips crashing against hers in a way that stole her breath, leaving her dizzy and desperate. Agatha’s hands instinctively went to Rio’s back, pulling her even closer, if that was possible, when Rio’s thigh pressed between her legs. Agatha’s body responded almost involuntarily, a groan slipping from her throat as their bodies met in an intimate, urgent embrace.</p><p>Rio’s hands roamed, pulling Agatha even deeper into the kiss, but as the tension built, they broke apart, both of them gasping for air. Agatha’s heart raced, her body still humming with desire, and she couldn’t help but look at Rio’s flushed face, the hunger still evident in her eyes.</p><p>“I missed you,” Rio murmured, her voice low, filled with an edge of vulnerability that was rarely there. She rested her forehead against Agatha’s, eyes softening as the intensity of the moment shifted into something more tender. “I missed this… missed you.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at the confession, the words settling in her heart like a warm embrace. She let her hand gently caress Rio’s cheek, feeling the heat from their kiss still radiating off both of them.</p><p>“I missed you too,” Agatha replied, her voice thick with emotion. She could feel the truth of it deep in her bones. These last few days without her had been hard — harder than she had expected. The longing had only grown stronger in her absence.</p><p>Rio smiled, her eyes locking onto Agatha’s, the connection between them undeniable. They stood there for a long moment, sharing that quiet, intimate space between them, knowing that they didn’t need to say much more. Their bodies still hummed with desire, and it was clear — this was what they both needed.</p><p>“I think,” Rio began, her voice teasing, “you owe me some time, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Time?” she asked, her fingers still gently tracing patterns on Rio’s skin.</p><p>Rio leaned in closer, their lips just brushing as she whispered, “To make up for those four days.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched at the thought, but she couldn’t deny the excitement building inside her. Four days. Far too long.</p><p>“Then we’d better not waste any more time,” Agatha replied, her voice low and filled with the same hunger that burned through both of them.</p><p>Before Rio could answer, Agatha pulled her in again, her lips crashing against hers as she felt the office just fade away as they slipped into their bubble. The world outside didn’t matter, not when Rio was this close, this real.</p><p>As they finally pulled apart, their breath still coming in quick, heated bursts, Agatha found herself unable to tear her gaze away from Rio. Her heart was pounding in her chest, and the weight of the last few days without her — without this — felt almost unbearable now that they were face to face again.</p><p>Agatha reached up slowly, her fingers gentle as they tucked a stray lock of Rio’s hair behind her ear. Her touch lingered for a moment longer than necessary, feeling the warmth of Rio’s skin beneath her fingertips, the softness that made her heart ache with affection.</p><p>“I missed you,” Agatha whispered, her voice rough from the intensity of their kiss. Her heart felt impossibly full as she continued, “So much. These past four days… they’ve been so long without you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, a tender smile tugging at the corners of her lips. She didn’t say anything at first, just pressed a small, affectionate kiss to Agatha’s forehead in response. It was enough.</p><p>Agatha lingered there for a moment, breathing in the scent of Rio’s hair, letting the warmth of her presence fill the space between them. But she knew they couldn’t stay like this forever, and as much as she didn’t want to break the moment, there were still things that needed to be said.</p><p>Finally, Agatha sighed, taking a step back, but keeping her hands firmly on Rio’s shoulders. “We do need to talk about something,” she said, her tone shifting slightly, though the softness still lingered.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, a playful glint still in her eyes. “What’s on your mind, Professor?” she teased, her hands still resting on Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha smiled, grateful for the way Rio could lighten the mood even in the midst of everything. “This surgery thing, I hope you know how big of an opportunity it is,” she said, her voice a little more serious now. “And I know how much you want this, how much it means to you, but I wanted to make sure it wasn’t a one-person decision.” She paused, meeting Rio’s gaze seriously. “I made sure it’s a group decision, so there won’t be any accusations of favoritism. We can’t risk that. </p><p>“I know,” Rio murmured, pushing a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear.</p><p>“You’re going to have to bring your A-game if you really want this. It’s not going to be easy, but I believe in you.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened as she took in Agatha’s words, and for a brief moment, Agatha could see the flicker of doubt in her eyes. But that quickly melted away, replaced by the fire Agatha knew all too well. Rio nodded, her posture straightening. “I’ll bring it,” she said, her voice full of quiet determination. “I won’t let you down.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her chest swelling with pride. She believed in Rio too — more than anything — and hearing that confidence in her voice made it all the more real.</p><p>“I know you won’t,” Agatha whispered, brushing her thumb lightly against Rio’s cheek before stepping back a little. “And you’ve got this. Just make sure to take this seriously. It’s an opportunity to make a big impression, not just on me, but on others in the department. This could be huge for you. For your research as well.”</p><p>Rio nodded again, her eyes locked on Agatha’s, a hint of excitement bubbling just beneath the surface. “I’m ready. I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>The conversation lingered between them for a moment longer, but Agatha couldn’t help but feel a wave of affection for Rio once again. Rio was ready. She knew it as well as she knew anything.</p><p>She just had to make sure they did this right.</p><p> </p>

  <p>
  <span>Rio was staring at her reflection in the locker room mirror, trying to shake off the weight of the nerves creeping up on her. She had barely slept, surviving on a mixture of caffeine and the few hours she managed to catch in the break room after her shift. Her mind raced, running through her notes and mentally rehearsing the presentation she had been preparing for weeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was ready. She knew she was ready. But as the clock ticked closer to the time she had to present, self-doubt started to claw at the edges of her confidence. What if she forgot something? What if Agatha was disappointed?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice, noticing Rio’s tense posture, leaned against the locker beside her, arms crossed. “You’re fine,” Alice said, her tone light but firm. “You’ve been working your ass off on this. You’re Rio fucking Vidal, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a shaky laugh, rolling her shoulders in an attempt to shake off the unease. “Yeah, I know. But you know how it is…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Alice interrupted, her grin widening. “I don’t know, because I’m not the one who’s about to rock that room. You are. Now, go do it. You’ve got this, and Agatha’s gonna be so damn proud of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, finally feeling the weight of her nerves loosen a little. Alice always had that effect on her — a grounding presence when Rio’s thoughts ran wild. “Thanks, Al.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She quickly finished getting ready and headed out to her car, where she plugged in her phone to make the drive to campus. As soon as she was in the car, she dialed Agatha’s number, letting the phone ring until she heard the familiar voice on the other end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey babe,” Rio said, the words slipping out before she could stop them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a pause, followed by Agatha’s teasing voice. “Did you just call me babe?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip, suddenly aware of what she had said. “Uhh… yeah, I did. Is that okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s laugh echoed through the phone, a sound that made Rio’s heart skip. “Of course it is,” she said, the warmth in her voice undeniable. “I like it. Just didn’t expect it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt herself smile, a soft flush creeping up her neck. “Well, I didn’t expect to call you that either, but… it feels right. You’re kinda my good luck charm, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s voice softened, her affection clear. “I’m proud of you, Rio. You’re going to nail this, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart fluttered at the simple reassurance. It felt like all her nervous energy had been funneled into the warmth of those words. “Thanks, Agatha. Really. I’m… I’m so glad you’re here with me through this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got this,” Agatha repeated, her voice steady and confident. “Now go show them what you’re made of. I’ll be there soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With those last words of encouragement, Rio’s nerves settled enough for her to focus on the drive ahead. The sound of Agatha’s voice was all she needed to remind her that she could do this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was ready. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a deep breath, trying to steady the nerves still lingering in her chest. She’d gotten a coffee and pastries for Agatha, hoping to surprise her and make the morning a little brighter before their busy day ahead. It was a little thing, but she felt like Agatha deserved something special. The idea of walking into class and finding the lecture hall empty was just the small moment of peace Rio needed to calm herself before the presentation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she walked into the building, she took a moment to check the hallway — thankfully, no one else was around. She gave a small, hopeful smile and continued down the corridor, her heart beating a little faster now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she pushed open the door to the lecture hall, her eyes landed on Agatha, who was standing with her back to the door, arranging her things on her desk. She looked effortlessly beautiful, just as she always did, and Rio felt a flutter in her chest. It had been only a few days since they’d seen each other, but in moments like this, the distance felt longer than it really was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, beautiful,” Rio said, her voice soft, but enough to make Agatha turn around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression shifted from surprise to a bright, genuine smile. Rio’s heart melted at the sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha said, her tone warm with affection. “You’re early.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “Well, I had a little time to kill, so I thought I’d stop by the cafe and get us some breakfast. Thought you might like something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She placed the coffee tray and bag of pastries on Agatha’s desk, the quiet click of the bag being set down the only sound between them for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked at her, her smile not fading. “You’re too good to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced back at the hallway one last time. No one in sight. Her pulse quickened, the desire to feel Agatha close overpowering her usual composure. Without thinking too much about it, she crossed the space between them in long, purposeful strides.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Agatha could say anything else, Rio pulled her into a kiss — a quick, but powerful one. She felt Agatha’s warmth, the way she melted into the kiss, and the taste of her lips was exactly what Rio needed to push past the remaining nerves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally pulled apart, Agatha’s hand lingered at the back of Rio’s neck, both of them breathing a little heavier than before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, I missed you,” Rio murmured softly, her forehead resting against Agatha’s for just a moment before she pulled back to look at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s smile softened, her eyes holding a depth of emotion that made Rio’s heart beat faster. “I missed you too,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a few seconds, neither of them said anything, both of them still wrapped up in the afterglow of the kiss. Then, Agatha broke the silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you ready for the presentation?” she asked, her tone more professional, but still carrying a trace of that warmth that made Rio feel so incredibly loved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio took a deep breath, feeling the last remnants of her nerves settle. “Yeah, I think so. I’m ready. Just… want to do my best for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s gaze softened, her hand moving to touch Rio’s cheek. “You’re going to do great. You’ve worked so hard for this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood up, her heart racing, but when her name was called, she forced herself to take a deep breath. She glanced quickly at Agatha, whose gaze met hers with an encouraging smile. It was small, but it was enough to steady her nerves. With her shoulders squared and her thoughts in order, Rio made her way to the podium.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning, everyone,” she began, her hands briefly touching the podium before she found her rhythm. “Today, we’re discussing the limbic system, a complex set of structures located in the brain, deeply involved in our emotions, memory, and even certain behaviors. At the core of the limbic system are key structures like the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gestured to the slides behind her as the images of the brain and its various sections lit up the screen. Her voice grew steadier as she talked about the amygdala, its role in processing emotions and fear responses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The amygdala is particularly significant when it comes to the processing of emotional memories. It’s often linked to anxiety disorders and PTSD, where hyperactivity in this area of the brain can lead to exaggerated emotional responses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio moved smoothly into the next slide. “The hippocampus, on the other hand, is primarily involved in memory formation. Damage to this area, especially in conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, can lead to serious memory impairments and cognitive decline.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she spoke, she kept her focus on her slides and the material in front of her, but every now and then, she’d glance over at Agatha, who was watching her with an encouraging expression. It was just enough to keep her grounded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her confidence continued to build as she delved into the potential pathologies tied to the limbic system. She mentioned the role of these structures in depression, bipolar disorder, and other mental health issues, moving seamlessly between topics and theories.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And while we’ve discussed some of the common pathologies associated with the limbic system,” she concluded, her voice stronger now, “there is still so much we don’t fully understand. The relationship between the limbic system and our emotional states is complex, and understanding how its dysfunction can lead to both mental health disorders and neurodegenerative diseases remains one of the most exciting challenges in neurology today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She paused for a moment, looking out at the professors and her peers, before giving her closing statement. “As we continue to explore the limbic system’s full range of influence, we open up more potential for treatment and intervention. By understanding these processes more thoroughly, we can move closer to more effective therapies for everything from anxiety to Alzheimer’s, and even beyond.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart was still pounding in her chest, but now, it was with the adrenaline of having finished strong. She gave a small smile and finished, “Thank you for your time. I’m happy to answer any questions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stepped back from the podium, feeling a rush of relief as the room went silent for a moment before the applause started. Rio found Agatha in the front row, her eyes full of pride, and the weight that had been on Rio’s shoulders finally lifted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she returned to her seat, Rio allowed herself to breathe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was sitting in her car, her hands gripping the wheel as she stared out the window at the snow-covered campus. It was done. Her presentation was finished, and though she was exhausted, a wave of relief washed over her. She had pulled it off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She quickly typed a text to Agatha. </span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>I’m outside if you want to grab lunch. Let me know when you’re done!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>After sending it, Rio leaned back in the seat, closing her eyes for a moment. Her mind was still racing, but she forced herself to calm down. It was over. She had done well. She could breathe again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few minutes later, Agatha walked out of the building, her dark blue coat swaying as she moved toward the parking lot. Rio couldn’t help but smile as she watched her, feeling that familiar pull in her chest. When Agatha got into the car, Rio couldn’t help but let out a soft sigh at how effortlessly beautiful she looked, even after a long day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Agatha greeted, her voice soft and warm as she slid into the seat next to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Rio replied with a grin. “I think I’m finally starting to relax. It’s all over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned to her, her eyes filled with pride. “You were amazing in there, Rio,” she said sincerely. “I’m so proud of you. You really knocked it out of the park.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart fluttered at the praise, and she smiled, feeling lighter. “Thanks. I was nervous in the beginning, but once I got going, I felt good. I’m just glad it’s done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s gaze softened as she looked at her, her smile turning tender. “You didn’t just do good, you were</span>
  <em>
    <span> brilliant</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I couldn’t be prouder.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest tightened at the words. She had worked so hard for this, and hearing Agatha’s praise made it all feel worthwhile. But it wasn’t just the praise—it was the way Agatha looked at her, as if she were something truly special.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a beat of silence before Agatha’s expression softened even further, something deeper in her eyes now. She reached over, brushing her hand lightly over Rio’s, sending a shiver of warmth through her. Agatha’s voice was quieter, almost hesitant, but filled with meaning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re incredible, Rio,” Agatha said softly, her gaze unwavering. “I don’t know how I got so lucky to get to love someone like you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words slipped out before Agatha could stop them, and as soon as they did, she froze, her breath catching. She hadn’t meant to say it, not so soon, not like this. But now that it was out there, she couldn’t take it back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes widened slightly, a soft gasp escaping her as the weight of Agatha’s confession settled between them. The air was thick with the rawness of it, and for a moment, neither of them spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha blinked, apparently surprised by her own vulnerability, but she didn’t back away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Rio smiled, her expression gentle but full of something deeper. “I love you too,” she whispered, her voice barely above a breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, and for a second, it felt like the world stood still. The moment was fragile, but it was also perfect. She reached out, brushing her fingers gently over Rio’s cheek, as if to make sure this wasn’t a dream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes softened, and she let out a quiet breath, feeling a weight lift from her shoulders. “You’re amazing, you know that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, her heart full, and nodded. “I do now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s gaze softened. “Lunch? I’m starving, and I think we deserve a celebration.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, her smile widening. “Yeah, I’m starving too. Let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned in for a kiss then, slow and sweet, savoring the moment. When they pulled apart, she looked at Rio with a newfound tenderness, something unspoken but understood between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just so you know,” Agatha said with a teasing smile, “I always thought you were incredible. But now, I’m definitely more convinced.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, her heart light and her nerves finally easing. “Good,” she said, feeling the warmth in Agatha’s gaze wash over her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they drove off together, the world seemed a little brighter, a little more right. Because they were in it, together, and that was all that mattered now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant, the noise of the bustling crowd around them dimming as Rio took a moment to look at Agatha. The way she was absentmindedly stirring her drink, the slight furrow in her brow — it made Rio’s heart swell. Everything with Agatha felt so natural now, like they’d always been in each other’s lives. But there was still one thing Rio needed to ask her about, and she couldn’t ignore it anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So… Christmas is coming up,” Rio started, trying to sound casual as she toyed with her glass of water. She glanced up at Agatha, her nerves creeping in. “I was thinking… maybe you and Nicky could come with me to my family’s house on Christmas Eve. We do a big dinner every year, and my parents really want to meet you. I’d love for you to be there. Both of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She watched Agatha’s face carefully as the words left her mouth, waiting for any reaction. It was a big step, she knew that. But Rio had never felt more certain about anything in her life. She wanted Agatha there. She wanted her to be part of this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha blinked in surprise, and Rio could see her hesitation almost immediately. “I… I don’t want to intrude,” Agatha said softly, and Rio’s stomach twisted. “I mean, I don’t want to impose or anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no,” Rio rushed to say, shaking her head. She couldn’t let Agatha feel that way. “Babe, I love you,” she said, the words coming out without thinking, but she meant them more than anything. “This isn’t about you imposing. My family’s been asking about you for weeks now. They’re excited to meet you. And Nicky too. It’s important to me that you’re there. I want to share this with you. You and Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest tightened at the vulnerability in her own voice, but she couldn’t stop herself. It was the truth. She wanted this. She wanted to be with Agatha on Christmas, and she wanted her to be part of her family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried to keep her tone light, but there was no hiding the seriousness in her words. “And if you don’t want to stay over, that’s totally fine. We can stay in a hotel or whatever. I just… I want to be with you, and I want us to have Christmas together. If that’s something you want too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t say anything at first, and Rio held her breath, unsure of what she’d say. She could feel the weight of the moment, could feel her heart pounding as she waited.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Agatha spoke. “I’d like that,” she said softly, her voice quiet but sure. “I’d really like to be with you, Rio. And with your family. I’ll be honest, it feels like a huge step, but I think… I think I’m ready for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart skipped a beat, and she felt a rush of relief flood her. She hadn’t realized how much she needed to hear that until now. Her face broke into a smile as she reached across the table to take Agatha’s hand, squeezing it tightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really?” Rio asked, a little breathless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her smile soft and warm. “Yeah, really. Let’s do it. Let’s spend Christmas together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s entire body relaxed as she felt the tension melt away. “I’m so glad,” she whispered, squeezing Agatha’s hand tighter. “You have no idea how much this means to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes softened, and she smiled back at her. “It means a lot to me too, Rio. I’m looking forward to it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After they finished their lunch, Agatha gathered her things, preparing to leave for Northwestern. Rio, however, was looking at her with a weary expression, her exhaustion from the shift and presentation still lingering in her features.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I really should go to the library and work on the stuff we discussed for my research project,” Rio said, biting her lip. “But honestly, I’m beat. I was thinking about just heading home instead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked at her with understanding. “I get it,” she said, giving Rio’s hand a gentle squeeze. “You’ve been working so hard. You should take a break.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes softened as she met Agatha’s gaze. “Want to stop by later? We can have dinner. You, me, and Nicky.” She smiled, a little shy but hopeful, as if she wanted to make sure Agatha didn’t feel pressured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart swelled at the thought of spending the evening with them. “I’d love that,” she said, returning the smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They settled their check, and as they stepped outside into the crisp air, Rio offered Agatha a ride back to Northwestern. The car was warm, the quiet hum of the engine accompanying their comfortable silence. But as they drove, Agatha’s hand slid over to Rio’s thigh, the touch simple but electric. When she finally parked in the university’s parking lot, it didn’t take long for their hands to find each other, and without warning, Rio leaned over to kiss Agatha deeply, their lips colliding with a passion that had been building between them all day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kiss grew hotter, deeper, and Agatha had to pull back, her chest heaving as she caught her breath. “If we don’t stop now, we’re going to do something we definitely shouldn’t be doing on campus,” she whispered, a little breathless, though her voice was thick with desire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s lips were swollen from the kiss, her face flushed, but she smiled at Agatha’s words. “Yeah, probably not a good idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha cupped her cheek gently, pressing one last kiss to her lips. “I love you, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart fluttered at those words, her smile widening immediately. Covering Agatha’s hand with hers, she kissed her palm. “I love you too”.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled into her parking spot, her mind still buzzing from the kiss in the car. The way Agatha’s lips felt against hers, the heat that shot through her body — it was intoxicating. She let out a slow exhale, shaking off the feeling as she stepped out of the car and made her way inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The apartment felt emptier than usual. The silence was almost deafening without Agatha’s soft laughter, without the shared glances and stolen touches. Rio paused in the doorway, just letting the stillness wash over her. It was strange, but she didn’t mind the quiet. She had time to think, time to prepare for when Agatha and Nicky would finally come over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked around, realizing the place could use a bit of tidying up. It wasn’t a mess, but things weren’t exactly in their proper places. She couldn’t have Agatha and Nicky coming over to chaos, could she? She sighed, taking off her jacket and throwing it over the armchair before grabbing the vacuum.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she moved through the apartment, she thought about the way Agatha had looked at her earlier, after the presentation. Proud. Happy. Rio had known Agatha was proud of her, but hearing those words — hearing her say it, with that look in her eyes — it made Rio’s heart warm. And when Agatha had slipped out the words “I love you,” Rio felt a rush of emotion flood her chest. It had been unexpected, unplanned, but it felt right. She hadn’t hesitated when she said it back, and now it was still lingering in the air, like a promise that would only grow stronger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of her phone ringing broke her out of her thoughts. She paused, fingers hovering over the vacuum’s switch before she checked the screen. It was Alice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart skipped. She hadn’t even realized how much she needed to talk to someone until now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” she greeted, grinning as she set the vacuum aside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Alice’s voice was all too knowing. “How did the presentation go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s grin grew wider as she leaned back against the counter. “It went great. Really great, actually. Agatha told me I did awesome.” She could feel her cheeks heat up. “And, uh… she told me she loves me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a pause on the other end of the line, followed by a surprised “What? Wait, for real?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at Alice’s enthusiasm. “For real. I couldn’t believe it either. It just kind of slipped out, but then she said it again, and… yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s so cute,” Alice said, her voice full of excitement. “I knew it. You two are totally in love. I mean, come on, it’s obvious.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled. “I didn’t mean for it to happen so fast, but it feels… it feels right, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so happy for you, Rio,” Alice said, her tone softening. “You deserve someone who makes you feel like that. You’ve been through a lot. It’s time for something good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled at the reassurance. “Yeah… it feels like something good, something real. I invited her over for dinner, and I can’t wait for her to come over later. I want to make tonight special. I’m cleaning up and making everything nice so we can just… be together, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That sounds perfect,” Alice said with a grin in her voice. “You’ve got this. I’ll just stay at Jen’s tonight so you guys can have the place to yourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a soft laugh. “I appreciate that. You’re always welcome to hang out, but tonight’s for us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll leave you two to it then,” Alice teased. “Go get your girl.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio ended the call, her heart still fluttering from the words exchanged, the connection that was deepening with each passing moment. She glanced around, satisfied with her progress. The apartment was coming together nicely, and she couldn’t wait to see Agatha again, to have them all together. It was going to be a good night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabbed a few last-minute things to finish up, humming to herself as she worked. Everything felt just right. Everything felt like it was falling into place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha and Nicky arrived at Rio’s apartment later that evening, Rio felt a mix of excitement and nervousness bubble in her chest. It wasn’t their first dinner together — it wasn’t even their first time eating as a group — but this was different. This was Rio’s space, and that somehow made everything feel a little more intimate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio opened the door just as Agatha was about to knock, and Nicky bounced in behind her, eyes wide with curiosity. Rio smiled at the sight of them, trying to hide her nervousness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” she greeted them, stepping aside to let them in. “Come on in. Dinner’s almost ready.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave her a warm smile. “It smells amazing in here,” she said, her eyes quickly scanning the apartment with approval.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Rio replied, feeling her nerves settle just a little. “I didn’t want to overdo it. But I figured I should at least make it nice for you guys.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Definitely succeeding,” Agatha teased, stepping inside, Nicky following closely behind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky immediately looked around, taking in the space. “This is where you live, Rio?” he asked with curiosity, glancing around the living room, which was cozy and welcoming, though definitely a little lived-in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it is,” Rio replied with a grin. “It’s not much, but it’s home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded sagely, as if the place were exactly what he expected. His gaze then drifted to the dining table, and he turned to Rio with a bright grin. “Can I help set the table?” he asked, eager to pitch in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled softly. “Of course, buddy. Go ahead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Nicky busied himself with the table, Agatha and Rio exchanged a look. Agatha’s gaze softened as she watched Nicky, her love for him shining through in the way she looked at him. Rio’s heart did a little flip, and she couldn’t help but smile to herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You two make a great team,” Rio said quietly, just loud enough for Agatha to hear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned to meet her gaze, and Rio could see the affection in her eyes. “We do,” Agatha agreed, her voice full of warmth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart skipped a beat, but she didn’t have time to dwell on it before Nicky called out, “I’m done! All set!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grinned. “You’re quick, I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You gotta be when you’re this good,” Nicky replied with a mischievous grin, making Rio chuckle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With everything ready, they all sat down to eat, and the conversation flowed easily. Nicky talked about school, Agatha talked about work, and Rio shared little anecdotes about her day. The tension Rio had felt earlier began to fade as they settled into the easy rhythm of conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Midway through dinner, Agatha glanced around, then asked, “So where’s Alice tonight? She not home?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio paused before answering, feeling her cheeks warm slightly. “She’s making herself scarce tonight. She’s got her own plans. She was happy to let us have the place to ourselves. And…she’s happy for me too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded with a soft smile, clearly understanding. The three of them continued eating, and Rio felt an overwhelming sense of contentment. They’d had dinners together before — several times — but this felt different. This was her home. It felt like a milestone, a small but meaningful one. Agatha and Nicky, in her space, sharing this quiet evening together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After dinner, they lingered at the table for a while, sipping on drinks and talking. Rio felt more at ease than she had expected, the weight of any earlier nerves long gone. She had to admit, having Agatha and Nicky in her world like this was exactly what she had always imagined — yet so much better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the evening wound down, Agatha and Nicky offered to help clean up, but Rio insisted she had it covered. She was happy to do it herself, to keep the rhythm of the night moving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks again for coming over,” Rio said with a smile, feeling her heart swell. “I know it’s a little different from usual, but I’m glad you’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled warmly at her, her hand gently brushing Rio’s. “I’m glad we’re here, too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the night wore on, the three of them continued to chat and enjoy their time together. Nicky, ever the energetic kid, was now sprawled out on the couch, watching a cartoon while munching on a cookie Rio had left for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while, the sound of his soft breathing filled the room, and Rio noticed that Nicky had finally dozed off, his small body curled up comfortably in the cushions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha caught Rio’s gaze and gave her a soft smile. “Looks like we have a moment to ourselves,” she murmured, her voice warm and quiet, careful not to wake Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled back, feeling a gentle rush of affection for Agatha as she leaned against the counter. “I guess we do,” she said, her voice low.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stood in the comfortable silence for a few beats, both savoring the peacefulness of the moment. Rio felt the space between them draw tighter, the air filled with an unspoken understanding. Then, as if drawn by a magnetic pull, they moved toward each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand reached up to gently brush Rio’s cheek, and without thinking, Rio leaned into the touch. Their lips met softly at first, a lingering kiss that held the weight of all the moments they had shared. It wasn’t rushed. It was everything they had quietly been waiting for — just a moment to breathe each other in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally pulled apart, Rio smiled up at Agatha, a soft blush tinting her cheeks. Agatha’s expression was tender, though there was something deeper in her eyes, a quiet resolve that Rio couldn’t quite place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha paused, her thumb gently grazing Rio’s lips. “I’ve been thinking,” she started, her voice soft but steady. “I want to tell Nicky about us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, her heart skipping a beat. She hadn’t been expecting that. “Are you sure?” she asked, her voice quiet but earnest. “I mean, I’m okay with it, but… it’s a big step, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded slowly, her gaze never leaving Rio’s. “I know. But I think it’s time. He’s already noticed something is different between us. I don’t want to hide it from him. I want to be honest with him, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart swelled at the thought of Nicky knowing. “I want that, too,” she whispered, feeling a rush of affection for Agatha. “I think it’ll be good for him to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned in once more, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s forehead. “Thank you for being okay with it,” she said quietly. “I just wanted to make sure you’re comfortable with it, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, smiling up at her. “I’m ready when you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stood there for a moment, letting the quiet settle around them. Rio felt a sense of peace she hadn’t known she needed — this was the next step, and it felt right. She was ready. And it looked like Agatha was, too.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>It was a quiet Saturday morning, the house filled with the comforting scent of coffee and the soft clinking of Nicky’s spoon against his cereal bowl. Agatha sat across from him, her hands wrapped around her coffee mug as she watched him eat, working up the nerve to say what had been on her mind for days.</p><p>They had plans to meet Rio for lunch and then go Christmas shopping, and the thought of spending the day together, all three of them, made her chest warm. But if they were going to do this — really do this — then it was time to be honest with Nicky.</p><p>She took a slow, steady breath. “Hey, sweetheart,” she started, setting her mug down. “There’s something I want to talk to you about.”</p><p>Nicky looked up from his cereal, blinking at her with curious blue eyes. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated only for a second before she smiled. “You know Rio and I have been spending a lot of time together, right?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” He took another bite, chewing thoughtfully. “I like her. She’s fun.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile softened. “Me too.” She cleared her throat. “I like her a lot, actually. More than just a friend. She’s my girlfriend.”</p><p>Nicky froze mid-bite, then set his spoon down with a soft clink. He looked at her with wide eyes, then suddenly grinned. “Ooooh! So that’s why I saw you kissing on the lips the other day.”</p><p>Agatha choked on her coffee. “You—when—” She shook her head, eyes widening. “How did you—?”</p><p>Nicky shrugged, completely unfazed. “You thought I was sleeping, but I saw it in the reflection on the TV.” He smirked like he had just solved a great mystery. “I knew it!”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a laugh, running a hand down her face. “Right. Of course.”</p><p>Nicky picked up his spoon again. “So does that mean she’s gonna be around a lot more?”</p><p>Agatha let out a relieved breath. “If that’s okay with you, yes.”</p><p>He considered that for a moment, then shrugged. “I mean, I already like her. She’s cool. And she’s really nice to me.” He scooped up another bite of cereal. “As long as she still plays video games with me sometimes.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, warmth blooming in her chest. “I think that can be arranged.”</p><p>Nicky grinned and went back to eating like nothing had changed, and Agatha just sat there, watching him, a weight lifting from her shoulders.</p><p>She reached across the table, ruffling his hair affectionately. “Thanks, sweetheart.”</p><p>“For what?” he asked through a mouthful of cereal.</p><p>She shook her head, smiling. “For being you.”</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>As soon as they arrived at the café where they were meeting Rio, Nicky spotted her first. She was standing near the entrance, scrolling through her phone, bundled up in a dark blue coat that made her look effortlessly gorgeous, even in the freezing weather.</p><p>Without hesitation, Nicky sprinted ahead of Agatha, nearly slipping on the icy sidewalk in his excitement. “Rio! Guess what!” he called out, his voice bright with excitement.</p><p>Rio looked up just in time to catch him as he barreled into her, wrapping her arms around him with an amused laugh. “Whoa there, buddy! What’s up?”</p><p>Nicky pulled back just enough to look up at her with a wide grin. “I know you’re my mom’s girlfriend!”</p><p>Agatha, who had just caught up to them, groaned, covering her face with one hand. “Oh my God, Nicky.”</p><p>Rio blinked, clearly caught off guard, before breaking into a grin. “Oh yeah? Who told you that?” she teased, her gaze flicking to Agatha with obvious delight.</p><p>Nicky puffed out his chest like he had just cracked the case of the century. “She did. At breakfast. But I already knew because I saw you guys kissing.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up as she turned to Agatha, who looked like she was mentally weighing the pros and cons of disappearing into the snow.</p><p>“You saw us?” Rio asked, trying not to laugh.</p><p>“In the reflection on the TV,” Nicky confirmed proudly. “You guys thought I was sleeping, but I wasn’t.”</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, leveling a look at Rio. “Say nothing,” she warned, though there was a hint of amusement in her voice.</p><p>Rio, of course, grinned like she had just won the lottery. “Oh, I wouldn’t dream of it.” She leaned in slightly, voice dropping into something warm and teasing. “Girlfriend.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t fight the small, helpless smile that tugged at her lips.</p><p>“Are we eating or what?” Nicky asked, already tugging Rio toward the entrance. “I’m starving.”</p><p>Rio laughed, reaching back to take Agatha’s hand in hers, giving it a gentle squeeze before letting go. “Yeah, let’s get inside before we all freeze.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, shaking her head fondly as she followed them in. This day was already off to a chaotic start, but she wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>As they stepped inside the café, the warmth was a welcome contrast to the biting cold outside. Nicky marched ahead, already scanning the place for an empty booth, while Rio hung back just enough to fall into step beside Agatha.</p><p>“So,” Rio whispered, leaning in slightly, her breath warm against Agatha’s ear. “The kid caught us, huh?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look, though it lacked any real bite. “Apparently,” she muttered.</p><p>Rio grinned, nudging her playfully with her elbow. “And here I thought we were being so discreet.”</p><p>“We were discreet,” Agatha whispered back, eyes flicking toward Nicky, who was now climbing into a booth near the window. “It’s not my fault my son has the observational skills of a detective.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, her fingers grazing the back of Agatha’s hand before pulling away. “Well, I think it’s kind of cute. He was so proud of himself back there, you should’ve seen his face.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head as they approached the booth. “I did see it. It’s the same face he makes when he’s smug about winning at Mario Kart.”</p><p>“Ah,” Rio said knowingly, sliding into the booth across from Nicky. “So I should be worried about what he’s gonna do with this information.”</p><p>Agatha only hummed as she settled in next to Nicky, who was already busy inspecting the menu.</p><p>Rio smirked, keeping her voice low. “You know, if he’s this sharp now, we’re never gonna get away with anything.”</p><p>Agatha leveled her with a look. “Stop acting like you’re planning crimes.”</p><p>Rio raised her hands in mock innocence. “Hey, I’m just saying. The kid’s got skills.”</p><p>Nicky, oblivious to their exchange, looked up from his menu. “Are you guys whispering about me?”</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a quick glance before Rio grinned. “Nope.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said at the same time.</p><p>Nicky narrowed his eyes at them suspiciously before shrugging and turning his attention back to his menu. “Well, okay. I’m getting burgers.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled as she leaned back against the seat, her foot nudging lightly against Rio’s under the table. She knew she’d have to deal with the teasing looks Rio was undoubtedly going to give her for the rest of the day, but she also knew — despite her embarrassment — that she wouldn’t change a thing.</p><p>As much as she had worried about how Nicky would take the news, he was fine. Happy, even. And that made all the difference.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>As they strolled through the mall, the scent of cinnamon and pine lingering in the air, Nicky practically buzzed with excitement. His small hand swung in Agatha’s as he kept pace between her and Rio, his eyes darting between the twinkling lights and festive storefront displays.</p><p>“So we’re really spending Christmas with Rio’s family?” he asked, looking up at Agatha with wide, eager eyes.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, who smiled warmly before answering. “Yeah, buddy. You and your mom are gonna get the full Vidal family experience.”</p><p>Nicky grinned. “Are there any kids?”</p><p>“Oh, so many,” Rio said dramatically, stuffing her hands into the pockets of her coat. “Let’s see… there’s Sofia, she’s five, then there’s Mateo—he’s eight. And then there’s Josephine, who’s nine, and then her brother James and her sister Julia are teenagers already.. Oh! And little Oliver, he’s three.. But don’t be fooled, he may be the youngest, but he’s the boss of everyone.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened. “That’s so cool! Do they like video games?”</p><p>“Mateo loves them,” Rio confirmed. “And Julia is really good at chess if you’re into that.”</p><p>“I beat Mom at chess all the time,” Nicky boasted, grinning up at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Twice. In the last six months.”</p><p>“Still counts,” he said smugly.</p><p>Agatha chuckled before glancing at the nearby shops. “Alright, we should probably focus. What do you think your parents would like?”</p><p>Rio considered for a moment before guiding them toward a cozy little boutique filled with handcrafted goods. After some browsing, they settled on a set of beautifully painted ceramic mugs, perfect for Rio’s parents, who were avid coffee drinkers. Along with it, they picked out a bag of high-quality coffee beans from a local roastery. Thoughtful, simple, and useful.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, adjusting the bags in her arms. “Now I have some top-secret shopping to do, so I’ll meet you guys back at the food court in, say, twenty minutes?”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Top-secret, huh?”</p><p>Rio winked. “Very classified. You could come with me, but then you’d ruin the surprise.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Fine, go do your classified shopping.”</p><p>Nicky waved enthusiastically. “Get something cool!”</p><p>Rio ruffled his hair before slipping away into the crowd, leaving Agatha and Nicky to wander on their own.</p><p>As they walked through the mall, Nicky looked up at Agatha, his expression thoughtful. “It’s really cool that Rio is your girlfriend now.”</p><p>Agatha felt warmth spread through her chest, her grip on his hand tightening slightly. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he said easily. “I mean, you guys were really obvious with the kissing and stuff, you know?” he teased, his eyes sparkling with mischief.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but chuckled, ruffling his hair as they turned a corner—only to nearly collide with someone.</p><p>“Excuse me—” Agatha started, but the words died in her throat as she took in the person standing in front of her.</p><p>Evanora Harkness.</p><p>
  <em>Her mother.</em>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t seen her mother in years, but it didn’t matter. The moment their eyes met, it was like she was ten years old again, standing in a hospital hallway under the too-bright fluorescents, waiting for another reprimand, to hear just how she had failed this time, how disappointed her mother was..</p><p>Evanora stood in front of her now, poised as ever, dressed in a perfectly tailored winter coat, her sharp gaze raking over Agatha like she was looking for flaws.</p><p>“Agatha,” Evanora said smoothly, as if they were nothing more than polite acquaintances who had simply drifted apart. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p>Agatha schooled her expression, instinctively straightening, as if she were about to be graded on her posture, her presence. “Mother,” she said, her voice even, careful.</p><p>She felt Nicky shift beside her and tightened her grip on his shoulder, pulling him protectively behind her..</p><p>Evanora’s gaze flicked to him, the corner of her mouth curling — not quite a sneer, but something dangerously close. “And the boy,” she said, as if he were nothing more than an afterthought.</p><p>Agatha felt her stomach turn. She still remembered the way Evanora had spat out the word mistake when she’d told her she was pregnant. <em>You’ve ruined everything I’ve built for you, Agatha.</em></p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha said, voice firmer now, protective. “My son.”</p><p>Evanora hummed, studying him, as if she were assessing something she didn’t particularly care for. “Yes. I recall.”</p><p>Nicky, oblivious to the weight pressing down on Agatha’s chest, gave a small, polite wave. “Hi.”</p><p>Evanora didn’t return the greeting. Instead, she turned her gaze back to Agatha, her expression unreadable. “And where is his father?”</p><p>It was a calculated jab, one Agatha had seen coming from a mile away.</p><p>“Not relevant,” she said, jaw tight.</p><p>Evanora exhaled sharply through her nose, the closest thing to a laugh she would ever allow herself. “Of course.”</p><p>Agatha knew that tone, knew the layers underneath it, the things unsaid. <em>Of course, because you wouldn’t know how to make the right choice if I handed it to you on a silver platter.</em></p><p>“Mama,” Nicky said, tugging at her sleeve. “We should go. We’re meeting Rio soon.”</p><p>Evanora’s brow arched at the name, a flicker of something in her gaze — disapproval, interest, the calculation of how this new piece fit into the puzzle she thought she knew.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin. “Yes. My girlfriend.”</p><p>She didn’t shrink under her mother’s gaze. Not this time. Not ever again.</p><p>Evanora’s expression barely shifted, but Agatha knew her well enough to know that whatever was coming would be something that would be cutting.</p><p>“Interesting,” was all she said. Not I’m happy for you. Not I hope she treats you well. Just interesting.</p><p>Agatha felt her nails dig into her palm, anger stirring in her ribs. But before she could respond, before she could decide whether it was worth it to even fight this—</p><p>“Hey,” a familiar voice called out, light, teasing. “Didn’t I say my shopping was top secret? Are you guys stalking me? You’ll ruin the surprise!”</p><p>Agatha turned, and there was Rio, rounding the corner with a playful smirk — until she saw Agatha’s face.</p><p>The shift was immediate. The teasing glint in Rio’s eyes faded, her posture straightening.</p><p>“Hey,” she said again, softer this time, cautious.</p><p>Agatha’s throat was tight, but she forced herself to breathe. She wasn’t a child anymore. She wasn’t standing in that hospital hallway. She was here, in the present, with her son, with the woman she loved.</p><p>And Evanora Harkness had no power over her anymore.</p><p>If Agatha repeated it as a mantra she might even believe it.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked between Agatha and the older woman, tension crackling like a live wire between them. Her playful demeanor was gone, replaced by something sharper, more alert.</p><p>“Hey,” she said again, voice low as she stepped closer, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s wrist. “Everything okay?”</p><p>Evanora turned her gaze on Rio, eyes cool and assessing, like she was looking at an insect she was considering crushing under her shoe.</p><p>“I don’t believe we’ve been introduced,” she said, her tone smooth but utterly devoid of warmth. “Dr. Evanora Harkness.”</p><p>Rio straightened, still feeling the tension rolling off Agatha in waves. “Rio Vidal,” she said, keeping her voice steady. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Evanora’s lips curved into something that was almost a smile, but not quite. “I hear you’re my daughter’s girlfriend,” she said, voice dripping with condescension. Then she let out a quiet, mocking laugh. “Like she couldn’t stoop any lower. You just had to prove me wrong, didn’t you, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She just stood there, silent and stiff, her expression blank in that way that meant she was barely holding herself together.</p><p>And that was enough for Rio to see red.</p><p>“I don’t give a shit who you are,” Rio said, stepping forward, placing herself firmly between Agatha and Evanora. “But I do know that you have no business saying a damn thing about Agatha.” Her voice was low, controlled, but filled with unmistakable anger. “Your daughter is the most incredible person I’ve ever met. She’s brilliant, she’s kind, and she’s worked her ass off for everything she has, without your help.” She scoffed. “You should be ashamed of yourself for what you’ve done to her.”</p><p>Evanora’s lips parted, as if she were about to respond, but Rio wasn’t interested in hearing another word.</p><p>“We’re done here,” she said sharply, turning to Agatha and grabbing her hand. “Come on, love.”</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t said a word, her expression unsettlingly blank. Nicky looked up at her uncertainly, then at Rio, before taking her other hand.</p><p>And just like that, Rio pulled them both away.</p><p>Agatha moved numbly beside her, her body obeying the motion without truly registering it. Her brain was oddly detached, floating somewhere outside of herself, analyzing the way her emotions had shut down completely — a textbook limbic system response. Her amygdala was quiet, no fear or anger making it fire. Her hypothalamus had kicked in, sending out a full-body response, shutting down everything that wasn’t necessary for immediate survival.</p><p>Survival.</p><p>That’s what this felt like.</p><p>She barely registered it when Rio led them into a more secluded corner of the mall, away from the holiday crowds. She barely felt it when Nicky let go of her hand, murmuring something about needing the bathroom.</p><p>But she did feel it when Rio wrapped her arms around her, holding her tight.</p><p>It was like a floodgate breaking.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, and suddenly everything crashed back in — rage, hurt, humiliation, love, everything all at once. Her hands clutched at Rio’s jacket, her forehead pressing against Rio’s shoulder as a shudder ran through her body.</p><p>Rio’s arms tightened around her. “I got you,” she murmured. “I got you, baby.”</p><p>And for the first time in years, Agatha let someone else hold the weight for her.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s sharp inhale against her shoulder, felt the way her hands clenched into the fabric of her jacket. She pressed a steady kiss to Agatha’s temple, keeping her close, keeping her grounded.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio murmured. “You can let go, my love.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head almost immediately, swallowing hard before taking a deep, shaky breath. “Not in front of Nicky,” she whispered, voice raw.</p><p>Rio nodded, understanding.</p><p>A little to the side, Nicky stood watching them, brows furrowed with concern. “Are you okay, mama?” he asked, voice small.</p><p>Rio turned to him, schooling her expression into something reassuring. “Yeah, kiddo,” she replied before Agatha could say anything, forcing a smile. “Everything’s fine.”</p><p>But he didn’t look convinced. He glanced at Agatha again, then back at Rio. “I still gotta go to the bathroom,” he said, hesitating.</p><p>Agatha straightened slightly, visibly trying to pull herself together. “Rio, can you take him?” she asked, her voice quieter now.</p><p>“Of course,” Rio said without hesitation. She squeezed Agatha’s arm gently before turning to Nicky. “Come on, bud.”</p><p>Nicky lingered for another second, his big eyes flicking back to his mom like he wanted to say something, but then he just nodded and followed Rio.</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily as soon as they were out of sight. She hated this. Hated that, even after all these years, Evanora still had this power over her. Hated that a single encounter could reduce her to this.</p><p>She pressed her fingers to her temple, trying to push back the migraine that was already creeping in.</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio and Nicky returned. Rio’s expression was carefully neutral, but there was something in her eyes — concern, protectiveness, barely concealed anger — that made Agatha’s throat tighten all over again.</p><p>“We good to go?” Rio asked, her voice softer now.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah. Let’s go.”</p><p>The drive back was quieter than usual, Nicky occasionally sneaking glances at his mom, clearly still worried. Agatha did her best to act normal, but she could tell he wasn’t buying it.</p><p>By the time they got home, her phone buzzed with a message from Wanda.</p><p>
  <strong>Wanda</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Twins want a playdate. Nicky up for it?</em>
</p><p>Relief washed through her. She needed time. Just an hour or two to sit with everything, to recover from the emotional whiplash of the day.</p><p>She turned to Nicky. “Hey, sweetheart. Wanda just invited you over. Want to go play with Billy and Tommy for a bit?”</p><p>Nicky’s face lit up. “Yeah! Can I?”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio met her eyes, understanding instantly. “I’ll take him,” she said quietly.</p><p>Agatha gave her a small, grateful nod.</p><p>As Rio and Nicky left, Agatha finally let herself sink onto the couch, pressing the heels of her hands into her eyes.</p><p>Finally, she could breathe.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat on the couch for a few minutes, her hands pressed against her temples as she tried to push the suffocating weight of everything that had happened out of her mind. Her mother’s words still rang in her ears, a constant buzz that made it hard to think clearly. There was a sharp ache in her chest, a familiar tightness that had been there for years, but this time it felt different. This time, it wasn’t just about her mother’s rejection; it was about the fear of it affecting everything she had with Rio.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again, and Agatha glanced down at the message from Wanda. It was short, but the words hit her harder than she expected.</p><p>
  <strong>Wanda</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Rio is on her way back. She told me what happened. You’re amazing, Agatha. I’ve got Nicky for as long as you need. Whatever you need, okay?</em>
</p><p>Agatha stared at the message for a moment, her eyes stinging. Wanda had always been there for her, but this… this felt different. Wanda didn’t just see the doctor, the professor, the mother. Wanda saw her. And right now, that made all the difference.</p><p>With a shaky breath, Agatha replied.</p><p align="right">
  <strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>Thanks, Wanda. I’ll be okay. Just need some time to breathe. You’re a good friend.</em>
</p><p>She set the phone down and leaned back against the cushions, allowing herself a few moments to just sit in the quiet. The only sound in the room was the soft hum of the living room heater, but it felt far away. She thought about how she’d gotten here — how much had changed in such a short time. From the loneliness of the last few years to finding someone like Rio… It felt like she was on the verge of something huge, but it was so damn hard to shake the shadow of her mother’s rejection.</p><p>She knew she had to work through it, for herself, for Rio, for Nicky.</p><p>Minutes later, she heard the door open softly, followed by the familiar sound of Rio’s footsteps. She straightened up a little, willing herself to get it together. Rio stepped inside, and for a moment, everything else faded. Rio’s presence was like a balm for Agatha’s racing thoughts.</p><p>“How’s he doing?” Agatha asked, trying to sound casual, though she could feel the tightness in her chest again.</p><p>“He’s good,” Rio replied with a soft smile. “He’s excited to play with the twins, so I think we’re in the clear.”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. She didn’t know how long she’d be able to keep pretending everything was fine. Rio’s gaze softened when she saw the look on her face, and without saying a word, she crossed the room to sit beside her.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked gently, her voice full of concern.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, unsure of what to say. She didn’t want to unload everything onto Rio, but she could feel herself breaking down again, the raw emotion threatening to spill out.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha whispered, her voice tight. “I just… I hate how she still has so much power over me.”</p><p>Rio’s hand found hers, squeezing it tightly. “You don’t need her approval, Agatha. You’re already amazing just the way you are. And I’m here. I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, trying to push down the tears. “I know. I just… I don’t want to be afraid of her anymore.”</p><p>Rio pulled her into a gentle hug, and Agatha let herself melt into it for a moment, allowing the comfort of Rio’s touch to calm the storm inside her.</p><p>“Take all the time you need,” Rio murmured. “We’re in this together, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, taking a shaky breath. “Yeah… together.”</p><p>She felt a little better just saying it out loud. The weight wasn’t entirely gone, but it was lighter with Rio there.</p><p>It wasn’t long before Agatha’s phone buzzed again, this time from Wanda.</p><p>
  <strong>Wanda</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>You’ve got this, Agatha. Take care of yourself, and remember, I’ve got Nicky for as long as you need. And you’re amazing. Don’t let anyone, not even her, make you forget that.</em>
</p><p>The sincerity in Wanda’s message made the knot in her throat almost unbearable.</p><p>Agatha’s body felt heavy with exhaustion, both physical and emotional, but it was the weight of the emotional turmoil that made her feel like she couldn’t breathe. She sat there for a moment, eyes closed, trying to gather the strength to pull herself together. She knew Rio was still next to her, but the words felt stuck in her throat. The ache from her mother’s cruel words was so deep that it felt like it would never go away.</p><p>But the pressure inside her chest was too much to bear, and before she could stop herself, the dam inside her cracked. A sob broke free, shaky and ragged, and Agatha buried her face in her hands. She hadn’t allowed herself to break down like this in years, especially not in front of anyone. Her mother had taught her from a young age that vulnerability was a weakness, that she had to be strong and composed at all times, especially as a woman in her field. She had learned how to hide everything — her pain, her fear, her hurt. But now, with Rio sitting beside her, with Rio holding her, the walls came down.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio’s voice was soft but firm as she wrapped her arms around Agatha. She pulled Agatha close, not hesitating, not trying to fix anything, just holding her, steady and unwavering.</p><p>It was everything Agatha had never allowed herself to have. A safe space. A person who didn’t expect her to be anything but who she was.</p><p>“I… I hate it, Rio,” Agatha choked out between tears. “I hate that she still has this power over me. She always made me feel like I wasn’t enough. Like I had to prove myself all the time. <em>All the time.</em> I could never relax, I always had to be ready.” Her voice trembled as she spoke, a rawness to it that she hadn’t shown in years.</p><p>Rio held her tighter, her hand gently brushing Agatha’s back in soothing circles. “You don’t have to prove anything, babe. Not to her, not to anyone. You’re more than enough. You’re the most amazing person I know.”</p><p>“But she—” Agatha’s voice cracked again, and she swallowed hard, fighting to hold herself together. She was scared of what would happen if she didn’t. But Rio was patient, just holding her, letting her cry it out.</p><p>“You don’t have to push it down anymore,” Rio whispered. “Not with me. Not ever again. I’ve got you, my love. I’ve got you. You’re safe.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders shook, but the weight in her chest began to lift ever so slightly with Rio’s words. She let herself lean into Rio’s embrace, allowing herself to break down completely. She had never allowed herself this freedom, never let herself feel the raw pain in its entirety, because her mother had drilled into her that vulnerability was weakness, and weakness led to failure.</p><p>And failure was unacceptable.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t pushing her away. Rio wasn’t telling her to pull herself together. She was simply there. Agatha had never experienced anything like it—never let herself be this real with someone. It was terrifying and beautiful all at once.</p><p>“I’ve got you, Agatha,” Rio repeated, her voice full of love and strength. “You’re safe with me. You’re not alone, baby. You’re not alone anymore, I promise.”</p><p>And for the first time in her life, Agatha allowed herself to believe it. She wasn’t alone. Rio was there, her rock, her anchor. Agatha’s tears were softer now, more like the quiet aftermath of a storm, as Rio held her, letting her cry until there was nothing left to say.</p><p>When the sobs had finally subsided, Agatha took a deep, shaky breath and pulled back a little, wiping her eyes. She could feel the tears still wet on her face, but there was a sense of relief she hadn’t expected.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said hoarsely, her voice raw, but she felt lighter now. Rio had seen her at her weakest, but all she saw was strength.</p><p>Rio smiled, brushing a stray hair from Agatha’s face. “You don’t need to thank me. You don’t have to carry this alone anymore, love.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, really looked at her, and for the first time, the future didn’t feel like a daunting mountain to climb. With Rio by her side, maybe she could finally start to face the scars her mother had left behind and heal.</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha whispered, the words slipping out before she could even stop them. It was as if, in this moment of rawness, it felt natural, as if it was the only truth that mattered.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, and she cupped Agatha’s cheek gently. “I love you too. So much.”</p><p>They shared a quiet moment, both of them letting the silence between them speak louder than anything else. Agatha had always had to face her demons alone, but now, she wasn’t alone anymore. Rio was with her, and somehow, that made everything seem just a little more bearable.</p><p>The pain wasn’t gone, and maybe it never would be, but with Rio, Agatha knew she could face it—and maybe, just maybe, she could finally let go of the past.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <p>
  <span>The soft morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Rio lay awake, staring at the ceiling, her arm draped over Agatha’s waist as she listened to the steady rhythm of her breathing. Agatha was still asleep, curled toward her, her body warm beneath the sheets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted just slightly, careful not to wake her, and let her fingers trace lazy, absent patterns along the bare skin of Agatha’s back. She moved slowly, reverently, feeling every dip and curve, the way the muscles beneath her fingertips rose and fell with each steady breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But her mind wasn’t nearly as peaceful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t stop thinking about yesterday. About her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Evanora Harkness. That horrible, cold woman who had looked at Agatha with such disdain, like she was nothing. Like she was still some foolish child waiting to be scolded and corrected.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clenched her jaw, her fingers stilling against Agatha’s skin for a moment before she forced herself to relax. The anger she felt now was just as sharp as it had been in the moment—a seething, protective rage. But she didn’t want to hold onto that right now. Not while she had Agatha here, safe and warm in her arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, she focused on her, on the woman beside her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her fingers resumed their slow, soothing path, moving down along the curve of Agatha’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She thought about last night. About the way Agatha had looked at her, voice low and rough when she’d whispered, “Make me forget. Just for a little while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Rio had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had touched her with devotion, had kissed away the tension, replaced it with pleasure, with love. Had taken her time, whispering soft reassurances against her skin, letting her feel nothing but warmth and need and safety.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because she loved Agatha. Fiercely, deeply. And she would never let that woman—or anyone else—make her feel like she was anything less than extraordinary.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted closer now, pressing a lingering kiss to Agatha’s hair. Agatha stirred, letting out a soft sigh as she stretched slightly, her body pressing instinctively toward Rio’s warmth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A moment later, her lashes fluttered open, and she blinked sleepily at Rio, a faint crease of confusion between her brows before she fully registered where she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Agatha murmured, voice raspy from sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Rio said softly, her fingers still tracing slow circles against Agatha’s back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled deeply, her eyes searching Rio’s face, and Rio knew she was remembering too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay?” Rio asked, her voice careful, gentle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a moment before answering, shifting onto her back and staring at the ceiling. “I don’t know,” she admitted quietly. “It still feels… heavy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, reaching up to brush a few strands of silver-streaked hair from Agatha’s face. “That’s okay,” she murmured. “You don’t have to be okay yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned her head then, meeting Rio’s gaze. There was something vulnerable there, something unguarded that Rio rarely saw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I meant what I said,” Rio continued softly. “She doesn’t get to touch you anymore. Not her words, not her presence, not anything. Not if I have anything to say about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A ghost of a smile flickered at the corners of Agatha’s lips, and Rio leaned in, pressing a slow, reassuring kiss there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she pulled back, Agatha exhaled again, closing her eyes for a moment before opening them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio just tucked her in closer, holding her like she was something precious. Because she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the first time in what felt like forever, Rio had four whole days off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Four whole days with no firehouse calls, no lectures or study sessions. Just Christmas, family, and—most nerve-wracking of all—introducing Agatha to the people who had shaped her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her hands gripped the steering wheel as she pulled up in front of Agatha’s house, her stomach doing an odd little flip. She knew Agatha was willing to do this, that she wanted to be there for Rio, but she also knew what a big step this was for her. Agatha didn’t do family gatherings, didn’t do warmth and chaos and open affection—at least not the way Rio’s family did. And yet, she was doing this anyway. For her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thought made something tighten in Rio’s chest—an overwhelming mix of gratitude and love.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She parked, took a breath, and stepped out into the biting cold, pulling her coat tighter around her. She had barely made it up the steps when the front door swung open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s grin was wide as he threw himself into her arms, nearly making her lose her balance. She laughed, ruffling his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, kiddo! You excited?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! We’re finally going!” He bounced on his feet. “And Mom made me pack and repack my bag like three times already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Sounds about right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she straightened, her gaze drifted past Nicky, landing on Agatha in the kitchen. Even from a distance, she could see the tension in her shoulders, the way her fingers fidgeted with something on the counter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew that tension. Felt it in her own bones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, she just watched. God, she loved her so much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then she nudged Nicky toward the hallway. “Go grab your coat, buddy. I’ll be right there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he scurried off, Rio walked toward the kitchen, her boots barely making a sound against the hardwood floor. She didn’t say anything at first, just leaned against the counter beside Agatha, close enough that their arms brushed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” she said softly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled slowly, her fingers still fidgeting with the straps of a tote bag. “Hey,” she murmured back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head, searching Agatha’s face, taking in the faint crease between her brows, the way she kept adjusting things that didn’t need adjusting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hesitated for half a second before offering a small, tight smile. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed, unconvinced. “Liar.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That earned her a look, but Rio just smirked, bumping their shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, it’s not too late to turn around. We could stay here, order takeout, watch Christmas movies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled a soft laugh, shaking her head. “No, you want to do this. And I said I’d come with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but only if you’re comfortable with it,” Rio reminded her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha finally met her gaze then, and something in her expression softened. There was still hesitation there, but beneath it, there was something else too. Something warm, something sure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m nervous,” she admitted, voice quiet. “But I want to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “Then we’ll go.” She paused, letting her fingers trail lightly along Agatha’s jaw. “And for the record, my family is going to love you. Just like I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a breath, but there was a faint pink to her cheeks, and Rio counted that as a win.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before either of them could say anything else, Nicky’s voice echoed down the hall. “I’m ready!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, amusement flickering in her eyes as she picked up the tote bag. “Let’s do this, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And with that, they stepped out into the cold, into something new, something theirs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The drive was peaceful, the highway stretching ahead of them as soft holiday music played in the background. Nicky sat in the backseat, flipping through a book, while Agatha sat beside Rio, one hand resting on her thigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had settled into a comfortable silence when Rio, keeping her eyes on the road, asked casually, “So… any news on the surgery we’re supposed to watch in January?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could feel Agatha’s eyes flick toward her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Still scheduled as planned,” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed. “And… do we have results yet on who’s getting to scrub in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Agatha narrow her eyes at her, a knowing smirk tugging at her lips. “You know I can’t say anything yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed dramatically. “Yeah, but if you could—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t.” Agatha cut her off smoothly, but there was amusement in her tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced at her with a lopsided grin. “Not even a hint?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, but there was a playful gleam in her eyes. “Nice try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed, turning her attention back to the road. “Fine. Be all professional about it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a soft chuckle. “It’s still up in the air, if it makes you feel better. My colleagues haven’t sent in their evaluations yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clicked her tongue. “Slackers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed in agreement, then smirked. “Besides, wouldn’t want to get your hopes up too much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped, placing a hand over her heart. “Wow. That’s cold, Professor Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha just leaned back, looking thoroughly pleased with herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky, not looking up from his book, muttered, “You guys are so weird.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nearly choked on a laugh, and Agatha reached back to tickle his legs, a small chuckle escaping her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And just like that, the nerves from earlier faded, replaced by something light, something easy. Something that felt a lot like home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio waited a beat, then glanced at Agatha again, turning on the full force of her best wide-eyed, innocent look. “Okay, okay. But can you at least say your top five picks?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed out a laugh, shaking her head. “You’re relentless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, keeping her face as angelic as possible. “I’m just a humble student, eager for knowledge.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha lifted a skeptical brow. “You’re incorrigible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Determined,” Rio corrected, flashing a grin. “So… top five?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled through her nose, as if considering it, before tilting her head. “Well, if I had a list—which I’m not saying I do—it wouldn’t necessarily be ranked.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed. “But you do have a list?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “I didn’t say that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped, feigning offense. “Oh my God. I’m not even on it, am I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky piped up from the backseat without looking up, “She never said that either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio threw a hand in the air. “Thank you, Nicky! At least someone has my back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha just smirked, looking entirely too entertained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio narrowed her eyes at her before sighing dramatically. “Fine. I’ll just suffer in suspense.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned in slightly, lowering her voice. “I will say… you might be a strong contender.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio whipped her head toward her so fast she nearly swerved. “What?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eyes on the road, Vidal,” Agatha said smoothly, though she was clearly amused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned. “You’re killing me, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked, sitting back in her seat, looking entirely too smug. “Good to know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As they pulled up in front of her parents’ house, Rio felt that familiar warmth settle deep in her chest. No matter how long she’d been away, no matter how much time passed, coming home always felt the same. Safe. Comforting. Like she could breathe a little easier just by being here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, as always, her mother was already at the door before Rio had even cut the engine, a bright, welcoming smile on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her entire body relax at the sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria Vidal was, in many ways, Rio’s mirror image—same dark eyes, same expressive face, same way of holding herself like she was always ready to pull someone into a hug. She waved enthusiastically, practically vibrating with excitement, and Rio could already hear the warmth in her voice, even from this distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But beside her, Agatha had gone tense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced over, seeing the tightness in her jaw, the way her fingers curled slightly against her thigh like she was steeling herself. Without thinking, Rio reached over, squeezing her thigh gently before taking her hand in hers. She brought it to her lips in a soft kiss, lingering just a second longer than necessary, hoping to ground her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a slow, steady breath, then nodded once, just barely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned back to the front of the house, catching the way Nicky was watching Gloria with wide, curious eyes. He stepped out to the car, but stayed close to Rio’s side, unusually quiet, and she could tell he was feeling just a little shy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She ruffled his hair, grinning when he swatted at her hand, and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. “Come on, buddy,” she murmured, leading him toward the house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha met her at the passenger side, and Rio watched as she took one last deep breath, squaring her shoulders like she was stepping into an OR instead of into a warm, welcoming home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave her fingers one final squeeze before letting go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s gonna be fine,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, but Rio didn’t miss the flicker of nerves in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Gloria stepped onto the porch, hands already reaching out for Rio, and there was no more time to worry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment Rio set foot on the porch, Gloria pulled her into a tight, warm embrace, her familiar perfume wrapping around Rio like a second layer of comfort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Mi amor</span>
  </em>
  <span>, you’re finally here!” Gloria exclaimed, squeezing her tight before pulling back just enough to hold her face between her hands. She studied her like she always did, as if making sure she was eating enough, sleeping enough, taking care of herself. Then she kissed her cheek and finally let her go, only to immediately turn her attention to Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you must be Nicky!” she said, eyes twinkling with warmth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky hesitated for just a second, glancing at Rio as if for reassurance, and Rio gave him a little nod. That was all it took for him to step forward, offering a small but polite, “Hi.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you’re even cuter than Rio said you were,” Gloria said, crouching slightly so she wasn’t towering over him. “I hope you brought your energy, because there are a lot of kids inside, and I have a feeling they’re going to want to play with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that, Nicky perked up. “Really?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria nodded. “I’ve got four grandbabies running around in there, and they’ve been dying to meet you ever since Rio told us you were coming. And we’re still missing two kids, but they’re going to be here soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was enough to make Nicky visibly brighten, and he cast a quick, excited look at Agatha before turning back to Gloria. “Okay,” he said, with a little more confidence this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria grinned, clearly already smitten, but when she straightened, her gaze finally landed on Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t miss the way Agatha subtly tensed beside her again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a brief second, Gloria simply took her in, the way mothers do when they already know something is different, something is important. Then her smile softened, and she reached out, resting a gentle hand on Agatha’s arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you,” she said warmly. “You must be Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed, nodding once. “I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria’s smile grew. “It’s so good to finally meet you. Rio talks about you all the time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes flicked to Rio, something amused yet slightly overwhelmed in them, but Rio looked a bit sheepish.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Mamá</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she groaned, a blush creeping up her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria laughed, then squeezed Agatha’s arm before finally stepping aside, gesturing for them all to come in. “Come, come! It’s freezing out here, and we’ve got food, drinks, and enough noise to keep you on your toes all night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they stepped inside, the warmth of the house immediately enveloped them, along with the distant sound of laughter, children playing, and the unmistakable hum of a house filled with love.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And as Rio helped Agatha out of her coat, she leaned in, whispering softly in her ear, “See? You’re already a hit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, rolling her eyes, but when she turned to glance at Rio, there was something softer in her gaze. Something grateful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Rio knew, right then and there, that this Christmas was going to be perfect.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio barely had time to brace herself as she stepped into the living room before two small bodies crashed into her legs, nearly knocking her off balance. She let out a surprised laugh as she looked down, finding Sofia and Mateo clinging to her, their little faces beaming up at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aunt Rio!” Sofia shrieked, squeezing her tight. “We missed you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We missed you so much!” Mateo echoed, his arms wrapped around her waist like he was trying to fuse himself to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, crouching down so she could hug them properly, kissing the tops of their heads. “Missed you guys too, </span>
  <em>
    <span>cariños</span>
  </em>
  <span>. What’ve you been up to? Wreaking havoc, I bet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sofia giggled, nodding proudly. “We made Christmas cookies, and we only burned a few!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s an improvement from last year,” Rio teased, ruffling her hair. “I bet they taste great.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They really don’t,” Mateo whispered conspiratorially, and Rio had to bite her lip to keep from laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she could say anything else, a shadow loomed over her, and then she was being yanked up into a crushing hug, her feet briefly lifting off the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Finally decided to visit, huh?” came Victor’s deep voice, warm with affection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio barely had time to hug him back before he released her just enough to ruffle her hair, like she was still a damn five-year-old. She groaned, shoving at his chest as she tried to fix the mess he’d made.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jesus, Vic, I’m not a kid,” she grumbled, even as she fought back a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor just smirked. “You’re still the baby sister. That’s never changing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, I could still outrun you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor chuckled, clearly unbothered. “Keep dreaming, kid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Rio could fire back, movement in the corner of her eye caught her attention, and she turned just in time to see Gabriela approaching, already rolling her eyes at their sibling antics.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You two done?” she asked dryly, hands on her hips. “Or should we wait for you to start wrestling in the middle of the living room again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted, rolling her eyes. Gabriela’s gaze, however, immediately flicked to Agatha, and a slow smile spread across her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, well, well” she said, stepping forward, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “So this is the famous Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha, to her credit, didn’t look as panicked as Rio thought she might. She stood tall, composed as ever, though Rio could see the slight tension in her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled quietly, reaching out to gently take Agatha’s hand in hers, lacing their fingers together before giving it a reassuring squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gabi,” she said, tilting her head. “<em>Be nice</em>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela just grinned. “Oh, I am always nice. But you know how much I love getting to know your special someones.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned, already regretting all of her life choices. “God, someone get me a drink,” she sighed dramatically but didn’t let go of Agatha’s hand as she turned back to her family. “Alright, alright, before my sister scares you off, let’s do this properly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She squeezed Agatha’s fingers gently, then gestured toward her siblings. “Agatha, this is my oldest brother, Victor—he’s the one who thinks messing up my hair is an acceptable greeting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor grinned, reaching out to shake Agatha’s hand. “Gotta keep her humble,” he said, then gave Agatha an appraising look. “Good to meet you. You must be pretty special if you got this one to bring you home for Christmas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched an eyebrow, a small, polite smile on her lips. “I’d like to think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor chuckled. “I like her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes before turning to Gabriela. “And this troublemaker here is my sister, Gabriela. You guys met a few weeks ago when she rudely interrupted our call. She’ll pretend she’s all put together, but she’s actually the worst.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela gasped in mock offense, placing a hand over her chest. “I am a wonderful older sister.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Yeah, yeah. Anyway, these two”—she gestured toward the two kids still hanging off her—“are her little monsters, Mateo and Sofia.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sofia beamed, but Mateo’s attention had already shifted, his eyes lighting up when he spotted Nicky standing close to Agatha, watching the chaos unfold with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Mateo said, pointing at Nicky. “How old are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky blinked, a little taken aback by the sudden attention. “Um… eight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mateo’s entire face brightened. “Cool, me too! You wanna play Mario Kart? We got the new one, and I bet I can beat you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked up at Agatha, silently asking for permission, and when she gave him an encouraging nod, he turned back to Mateo with a competitive little smirk. “I don’t know… I’m pretty good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mateo gasped. “No way! Come on, we’ll see.” He grabbed Nicky’s wrist and started pulling him toward the den where the gaming setup was. “I’ll let you be Yoshi.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched as Nicky hesitated only for a second before following Mateo eagerly, already chatting excitedly. Sofia ran after them, giggling, and within moments, it was like Nicky had always been there, like he was just another one of the kids in the family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned back to Agatha, catching the way her lips parted slightly, like she was almost startled by how easily Nicky had been swept up into the madness. Her eyes were soft, unreadable, and Rio had to fight the urge to kiss her right then and there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, she gave Agatha’s hand another squeeze, voice low and warm as she said, “Told you they’d love him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced around the room, then turned back to Victor with a smirk. “So, where are your monsters? Hiding?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor let out a long-suffering sigh. “Teenagers,” he rolled his eyes, as if that explained everything. “James is on his way—he’s bringing his </span>
  <em>
    <span>girlfriend</span>
  </em>
  <span> to meet Mom. Julia and Josephine are upstairs doing… whatever it is preteens do these days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela snorted. “Jo is nine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor rolled his eyes. “Try telling her that. She wants to do everything Julia does. If Julia so much as breathes a certain way, Jo has to do it, too. It’s exhausting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, shaking her head. “Sounds about right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor narrowed his eyes at her. “You say that like you weren’t the same way with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I was not</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabriela and Victor both gave her identical unimpressed looks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, maybe a little,” Rio admitted, shrugging. “But come on, I turned out great.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor sighed. “Yeah, yeah. Anyway, I’ll go check on them in a bit. James should be here soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded before glancing at Agatha, who was watching the exchange with an amused little smile, still holding onto Rio’s hand. There was something warm in her gaze, like she was taking it all in, letting herself relax into it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio bumped her shoulder against Agatha’s. “Welcome to the madness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned as she stepped into the kitchen, the warmth and delicious aroma of simmering spices wrapping around her like a familiar embrace. The scent of roasting pork and fresh cilantro filled the air, and she could already spot trays of empanadas and tamales waiting on the counter. It wasn’t even evening yet, but Gloria Vidal was always ahead of the game when it came to feeding an army—which was what Christmas Eve in the Vidal household usually felt like.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walked up to her mother and pressed a quick kiss to her hair before turning to Agatha with a teasing smile. “If you want to survive the madness, alcohol is the way forward, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head, but before she could say anything, Gloria turned from the stove, wooden spoon in hand, and raised an eyebrow at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you actively trying to scare her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Nah, just preparing her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria gave Agatha a warm, knowing smile. “She’s being dramatic.” Then, with a slight tilt of her head, she added, “But also not wrong. The house is only going to get louder from here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha, to her credit, didn’t look deterred. If anything, she seemed almost… intrigued. Like she was watching something rare unfold in front of her, something she had never quite experienced herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio squeezed her hand. “So, wine? Beer? Something stronger?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha considered for a moment before arching an eyebrow at her. “What are you having?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “Oh, I’ll be hitting the tequila once the cousins start showing up, but for now? Wine sounds good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria chuckled as she turned back to her cooking. “You always start out saying that, but we all know how this ends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped in mock offense. “I am a picture of moderation, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mamá</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh-huh.” Gloria didn’t even turn around as she said it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit back a smile. “Wine sounds perfect,” she said, and Rio immediately went to grab a bottle and two glasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she poured, she glanced at Agatha, who was taking everything in—the bustling kitchen, the warmth, the easy teasing between Rio and her mother. There was something soft in Agatha’s expression, something almost hesitant, like she wasn’t sure how to let herself settle into this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio handed her a glass and gently bumped their knuckles together. “Welcome to the family chaos, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria wiped her hands on her apron and turned to face Agatha, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. “So, tell me about your life, sweetheart,” she said casually, leaning against the counter. “What’s it like being a professor, a surgeon, and… well, whatever else you’ve got going on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled, shifting a bit awkwardly but warming to Gloria’s relaxed demeanor. “It’s a lot, that’s for sure,” she began, shrugging lightly. “Being a professor is great—challenging, but rewarding. Watching students go from knowing nothing to actually grasping complex stuff is kind of amazing.” She glanced at Rio, who was leaning against the doorframe, watching her with a soft smile. “I mean, I don’t know if I’m changing the world, but I like to think I’m helping them think in a way that could.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria chuckled and waved a hand dismissively. “Oh, don’t be modest. I bet you’ve got a few world-changers in there, just waiting to happen.” She reached for a bottle of wine and popped the cork. “And what about the surgeon part? I assume you’ve got stories?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes playfully, her voice becoming more animated. “Oh, I’ve got stories. Some good, some… terrifying. It’s definitely not the kind of job where you just walk in and have a normal day. There’s always something unexpected, something urgent. But, I’ll admit, I love the adrenaline of it. There’s just nothing like it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria poured herself a glass of wine and leaned in, her eyes gleaming. “Sounds like you live for the thrill, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed, the tension from earlier slowly melting away. “I guess you could say that. There’s something about the pressure that pushes me to do my best. It’s intense, but… it feels right.” She hesitated, glancing over at Rio. “I’m good at it, and that’s what matters to me. It’s hard, but I love it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave her a proud smile, her hand slipping into Agatha’s with the quiet support that only she seemed to provide. Agatha gave her a brief, thankful glance before returning her focus to Gloria.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Gloria said with a wink, “sounds like you’ve got your hands full. Teaching and surgery both? How do you keep it all together?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled softly, her shoulders relaxing a little. “Honestly? I don’t know if I do. But I make it work. And I have a really good support system. My son, Nicky…” She smiled at the thought of him. “He keeps me grounded. He’s my constant. And Rio.” She turned to Rio, a softer smile on her face. “She’s been my rock too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gloria raised an eyebrow, her expression shifting slightly, but still playful. “I can see that. You two seem really good for each other.” She paused, then added with a wink, “You must be, if you can survive all of this chaos and still love each other.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed, a warm feeling blooming in her chest. “I think we’re doing alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Gloria said, pouring another glass of wine, “you’re certainly welcome here. You know you’ve got a place with us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Gloria,” Agatha said quietly, touched by the warmth in the older woman’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile widened, and she gave Agatha’s hand a quick squeeze. “See? Told you she’d like you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt herself relax even more, knowing she was finally starting to feel at home here, with Rio, her family, and all the chaos that came with them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Checking that Nicky was fully entertained with Mateo and Sofia, Rio let him know that she and Agatha were going upstairs and that if he needed anything, to just call her mom in the kitchen. Nicky nodded, almost absentmindedly, his gaze never leaving the TV as he intensely played Mario Kart. Rio chuckled, ruffling his hair before pulling Agatha towards the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they ascended, Rio glanced over at Agatha, sensing a subtle tension in her. “You good?” she asked gently. Agatha gave her a small, reassuring smile, but Rio could tell she was still adjusting to the hustle and bustle of her family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they reached the top of the stairs, Rio led Agatha to her childhood room. The door creaked open, and Agatha stepped in, taking in the sight of Rio’s past life on full display. Her soccer trophies were lined up proudly on the shelves, old posters adorned the walls, and photos from her childhood captured moments of laughter and memories that felt distant now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow,” Agatha murmured, taking it all in as she stepped further inside. She looked at Rio, amusement dancing in her eyes. “You were a </span>
  <em>
    <span>serious</span>
  </em>
  <span> soccer player, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, a grin tugging at her lips. “Yeah, I was obsessed with it for a while. Thought I’d go pro for a minute there.” She glanced around the room, her gaze lingering on a photo of her with a medal around her neck from a tournament win. “Funny how things change.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. “So, no pro career, but a very decorated high school and college athlete, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed softly. “Yeah, I guess you could say that. It was the one thing I was really passionate about, but you know how life goes… It had to take a backseat to everything else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her expression thoughtful. “I get that. The things we think are our future sometimes end up… not fitting anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitated for a moment, then sat down on the edge of the bed, looking up at Agatha. “How about you? Any teenage ambitions that you left behind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha paused, her fingers lightly grazing the framed photo of Rio with her soccer team. “I guess I always wanted to be a doctor. Ever since I was a kid, that was my thing.” She smiled wistfully. “I don’t remember a time I didn’t want to do it. But I wasn’t thinking about being anything else. Just… what she wanted me to do, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned her head toward Agatha, sensing the shift in tone, but not pressing for more. Instead, she reached for Agatha’s hand, pulling her to sit beside her on the bed. “I get that,” she said quietly. “You don’t always get to choose the path you walk, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha squeezed her hand, grateful for the moment of quiet understanding. She leaned into Rio, letting herself be grounded by the comfort of her presence. “No, not always,” she agreed softly. “But I love what I do now, so I guess it all worked out in the end, despite her interference.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, they sat there in the stillness, the only sound the faint hum of voices downstairs. Agatha turned her head slightly to meet Rio’s gaze. “You’ve done a lot with your life, Rio. Even if the soccer career didn’t happen, you’re doing something amazing now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled warmly, the way she always did when Agatha said something so tender. “Thanks. I think… I think this is the life I was supposed to have all along.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned forward, brushing her lips against Rio’s, letting the quiet affirmation of the moment linger between them. “You’re right. Maybe we don’t always know what’s ahead, but we find our way eventually.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they pulled away from the kiss, the moment felt sacred, private, and full of quiet understanding. Rio smiled softly at Agatha, her thumb tracing over the back of Agatha’s hand. For the first time, Agatha’s shoulders seemed to relax completely, as if she had let go of a weight that had been pressing on her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you’re here,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes softened. “I am, too. But I still feel like I’m trying to catch my breath with all the family chaos.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled. “That’s just the Vidal way,” she said teasingly. “If you’re not being pulled in a million directions, then you’re not doing it right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed quietly, but her eyes flickered with a hint of nerves. “It’s just… a lot. I want to fit in with them, but I don’t know how. And I don’t want to disappoint you, or Nicky, or your parents.” She paused. “I don’t want to mess this up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head, studying Agatha’s expression with care. “Agatha, you’re already doing more than enough. This isn’t about fitting into some mold of what you think they want. It’s about being you—the person I love. And if anyone in this family doesn’t see that, they’re blind.” She squeezed Agatha’s hand, her voice steady and warm. “Trust me, they’re gonna love you just as much as I do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a deep breath, the weight of Rio’s words settling in her chest like a gentle, steady anchor. She glanced out the window for a moment, watching the faint outlines of snowflakes starting to fall. The peacefulness of the moment made her feel a little more grounded, like maybe she wasn’t as out of place as she’d feared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I’m just scared,” Agatha admitted softly, her voice almost too quiet to hear. “I’ve been alone for so long, and the idea of this… being a part of something bigger, it’s just hard to wrap my head around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio reached over, cupping Agatha’s face in her hands. “You don’t have to be perfect, Agatha. You don’t even have to have all the answers. Just… be here with me. That’s all I need.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips parted as if to say something, but she stopped herself, her eyes searching Rio’s face for reassurance. And she found it—soft, unyielding, and full of patience. Rio wasn’t expecting anything from her but to be herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a long, breathless beat, Agatha finally nodded. “Okay,” she said, her voice steady. “I’ll try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned in, brushing her lips against Agatha’s forehead before pulling her into a tight hug. Agatha sank into it, letting herself be wrapped up in Rio’s embrace, feeling the safety of this moment, the certainty that they were in this together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got this,” Rio murmured against her ear. “And no matter what happens, I’ll be right by your side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled back slightly, lifting her head to meet Rio’s eyes. “Thank you,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled softly, brushing a strand of hair out of Agatha’s face. “You don’t have to thank me, love. I’m just happy you’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stayed like that for a moment, a simple, quiet peace between them, until the sounds of children calling for Rio downstairs echoed up to the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Guess we should go face the madness, huh?” Rio said with a mischievous grin, squeezing Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed softly, but it was a more genuine sound now, the nervous edge starting to fade. “I think I’m ready.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Rio said, standing up and offering Agatha a hand to help her up. “Let’s go show them what</span>
  <em>
    <span> this </span>
  </em>
  <span>madness looks like.”</span>
</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha watched as Rio moved through her family with an ease that was both effortless and deeply affectionate. It was something she had admired about her from the start—that warmth, that ability to make people feel seen, to make them feel like they belonged.</p><p>Right then, though, it was the teenage boy near the door who caught her attention. He was tall, lanky, shifting his weight from foot to foot, hands stuffed into his pockets. There was something familiar about the nerves in his posture, the way he kept glancing toward the redheaded girl beside him.</p><p>Before Agatha could wonder who he was, Rio stepped forward, immediately picking up on his discomfort.</p><p>“Hey, James, you look like you’re about to give a presentation,” she teased, a playful smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>James exhaled a quiet laugh, but his hand moved to rub the back of his neck. “Yeah, well… kinda feels like I am,” he muttered. Then, with a steadying breath, he gestured to the girl beside him. “This is my girlfriend Amelia.”</p><p>The redheaded girl at his side blushed almost instantly, offering a shy, polite smile. She was sweet-looking, a little timid, and Agatha recognized the way she stayed half a step behind James, as though unsure of how much space she was allowed to take up.</p><p>Rio, of course, wasted no time in making her feel at ease. “Hi, Amelia, nice to meet you,” she said warmly, stepping forward. “I’m James’ aunt, Rio, and this is my girlfriend Agatha and her son Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in greeting, watching as Amelia’s eyes flicked to her with a brief moment of curiosity before darting down to Nicky, who gave her a polite little wave.</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you,” Amelia said softly.</p><p>“You too,” Agatha replied, offering an encouraging smile. She could definitely relate to jittery nervousness the girl was probably feeling.</p><p>James, meanwhile, looked like he was both relieved and mortified at once. He glanced at Rio as if bracing himself, but instead of teasing, she just placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“You’re doing great, kid,” she said, her voice softer now. “Just breathe. It’s not a trial.”</p><p>James chuckled, his shoulders relaxing slightly. “Feels like it.”</p><p>“Welcome to the family,” Rio said to Amelia with a wink. “Don’t worry, we’re mostly harmless.”</p><p>Amelia let out a small laugh, her blush still lingering but her posture relaxing ever so slightly.</p><p>Before they could go any further, the door swung open again, and this time, the sound that followed was not quiet at all.</p><p>A loud, gleeful screech filled the house, followed by the frantic patter of little feet. Agatha turned just in time to see a small blur of energy launch itself toward Rio.</p><p>“Auntie Rio!”</p><p>Rio reacted instantly, dropping into a crouch and catching the child just in time, lifting him effortlessly into the air. The little boy giggled wildly as she tossed him up and then pulled him close, pressing a loud kiss against his cheek.</p><p>“Hey, little monster!” Rio laughed. “Where do you think you’re going, huh?”</p><p>The boy—Oliver, Agatha assumed—clung to her, still giggling, his tiny hands fisting in the fabric of her shirt. “I missed you!”</p><p>“I missed you too, buddy,” Rio murmured, rocking him slightly before finally setting him back down on his feet.</p><p>Agatha glanced up as another man—tall, with a striking resemblance to Rio—stepped into the house, shaking his head at the scene before him. “He’s been talking about seeing you all day,” he said, exasperated but amused.</p><p>“Of course he has,” Rio said smugly, reaching out to ruffle Oliver’s dark curls. “I’m his favorite.”</p><p>Pedro—Agatha was fairly sure this must be Pedro—snorted. “You bribe him with too many snacks.”</p><p>“It’s called bonding,” Rio corrected.</p><p>Pedro just rolled his eyes before looking toward Agatha, his expression shifting slightly as his gaze flickered between her and Rio. “And you must be Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha straightened slightly, offering a small nod. “That’s me.”</p><p>Pedro glanced at Rio, then back at her, a slow smirk tugging at his lips. “Well,” he said, his tone teasing, “it’s nice to finally meet the woman my sister can’t stop talking about.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, tilting her head slightly. “Oh? And what exactly has she been saying?”</p><p>Rio groaned immediately. “Pedro, I swear to God—”</p><p>Pedro just grinned wider. “Oh, you know. Just that you’re brilliant, terrifyingly smart, and that she’s completely—”</p><p>Rio slapped a hand over his mouth before he could finish. “Nope, we’re done here.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, watching the way Rio glared at Pedro, who was still smirking behind her hand.</p><p>She could get used to this, she thought.</p><p>The chaos, the warmth, the teasing.</p><p>The family.</p><p>~*~</p><p>A couple of hours passed, the house still buzzing with conversation and laughter, the energy never quite dipping. Agatha had settled into a comfortable rhythm—watching Rio move between her siblings with effortless ease, accepting teasing with eye rolls and sharp retorts, indulging in affectionate gestures that made it so clear how deeply she belonged here.</p><p>And then the last arrival stepped through the front door.</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to be told who he was. She knew instantly.</p><p>The moment Rio’s eyes landed on him, her entire expression changed. Something softer flickered across her face, something unguarded and unmistakably warm. And then she was moving, crossing the room in long strides before he even had a chance to take his coat off.</p><p>“Papi,” she said, her voice lighter, like a daughter greeting the safest place she knew.</p><p>The man—Juan Vidal—lit up at the sight of her. It wasn’t just a smile, not just recognition. His whole face softened, his eyes crinkling at the edges, his arms already opening as if he’d been waiting all night just for this moment.</p><p>“Mi niña,” he murmured, his voice rich with affection as he pulled her into a tight embrace.</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio all but melted into it. She couldn’t make out what he whispered to her in Spanish, but she saw the way Rio nodded and closed her eyes briefly, the way her shoulders relaxed, the way her fingers curled into the back of his jacket like she was grounding herself.</p><p>Then, when he finally pulled back, he cupped her face in both hands, his calloused thumbs brushing over her cheeks. He looked at her like she was still his little girl, like no amount of time would ever change that. Then, with a quiet fondness, he leaned forward and pressed a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>From across the room, Gabi huffed dramatically.</p><p>“Hey, Papi, we’re here too. You know, your other children?”</p><p>The room burst into laughter, but Juan didn’t let go of Rio just yet. He turned his head slightly, smirking at Gabi before shaking his head in mock exasperation.</p><p>“Sí, sí, I see you,” he said, finally loosening his hold on Rio, though he kept an arm over her shoulders as he turned toward the rest of the family.</p><p>That was when Rio stepped back, shaking her head fondly before glancing at Agatha.</p><p>And just like that, the warmth in Juan’s expression didn’t fade—it shifted, turning curious but just as kind as he followed Rio’s gaze.</p><p>“Papi,” Rio said, reaching for Agatha’s hand. “This is Agatha.”</p><p>For a moment, Juan’s gaze settled on her, steady and assessing—not scrutinizing, but as if he truly wanted to understand who she was before saying anything.</p><p>Then he stepped forward and extended a hand.</p><p>“Agatha,” he said, his voice warm, his grip strong but gentle when she took it. “It is very nice to meet you.”</p><p>“You too, Mr. Vidal,” Agatha replied politely.</p><p>Juan chuckled at that, shaking his head. “Juan,” he corrected. Then, with an easy smile, he added, “If my daughter brought you here, it means she loves you. And if she loves you, then this family does as well.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, momentarily caught off guard. It was such a simple statement, yet the weight of it—of unconditional acceptance, of belonging—settled deep in her chest in a way she didn’t quite know how to process.</p><p>She barely had time to respond before Rio moved again, reaching out just as a small blur rushed past them.</p><p>“Whoa, buddy—gotcha,” Rio said, effortlessly catching Nicky mid-run. He let out a surprised little giggle as she swung him around before settling him on her hip.</p><p>With a grin, she turned back toward Juan. “And this little tornado is Nicky. Agatha’s son.”</p><p>Juan’s expression shifted again, filling with even more warmth. “Ah,” he said, looking at Nicky with the same soft affection he had given Rio. “Hola, campeón.”</p><p>Nicky beamed. “Hi!”</p><p>Juan reached out, ruffling the boy’s curls. “Mucho gusto, Nicky.”</p><p>“Mucho gusto,” Nicky repeated, giggling.</p><p>Agatha found herself exhaling, some quiet part of her relaxing in a way she hadn’t even realized she needed to. This family—it was nothing like the one she had grown up with. Nothing like the coldness and emptiness of her childhood home. And yet, standing there, watching Juan interact so naturally with her son, she felt something she hadn’t felt in a long time.</p><p>She felt at home.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The house bustled with movement as everyone finally began settling in for dinner. The dining table was filled with plates of food, bowls passed back and forth, the scent of warm spices and roasted dishes filling the air. Agatha found herself seated between Rio and Nicky, who had climbed into the chair beside her with all the confidence of a child who already felt completely at ease in this house. Across from them sat Juan, Pedro, and Victor, while Gabi, Gloria and Holly, Pedro’s wife, took their spots down the table.</p><p>Conversation flowed easily, voices overlapping as everyone reached for food, filled their plates, and stole bites off each other’s dishes with the kind of familiarity that only came from years of shared meals.</p><p>“So, Rio,” Juan said as he leaned back slightly, fork in hand. “Are you still working those insane paramedic shifts while studying?”</p><p>Rio groaned, reaching for her drink. “Oh, here we go.”</p><p>Pedro smirked. “What? It’s a fair question. We gotta check in and make sure you’re not running yourself into the ground.”</p><p>“She is,” Agatha murmured before she could stop herself.</p><p>That earned her a look from Rio, half amused, half betrayed. “Hey.”</p><p>Juan laughed, clearly delighted. “See? Even Agatha knows you overwork yourself.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, everyone relax,” Rio said, waving a hand as she tried—and failed—to look innocent. “I’m managing it just fine.”</p><p>Gabi raised an eyebrow. “So you’re still getting two hours of sleep and calling it fine?”</p><p>“That’s an exaggeration,” Rio muttered, stabbing a piece of food with her fork.</p><p>“No, it’s not,” Agatha said, leveling her with a look. “You came into class once on barely that much sleep. I could see the imprint of the firehouse couch on your face.”</p><p>That got a full round of laughter from the table, Pedro and Victor both groaning in unison.</p><p>“Dios mío, she hasn’t changed at all,” Pedro said, shaking his head.</p><p>Victor snorted. “Still running on caffeine and bad decisions.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but didn’t argue, mostly because Agatha was giving her a pointed look that very much said they’re not wrong.</p><p>“Alright, fine,” Rio conceded. “Yes, I’m still working. But I like it. And before anyone starts yelling, I also love med school, and I know how to balance it.”</p><p>“Well, at least tell us you’re not slacking in class,” Juan said, giving her a teasingly stern look.</p><p>That was when Holly, who had been listening with a grin, glanced at Agatha and asked, “And how exactly did you two meet, anyway?”</p><p>Agatha took a sip of wine, momentarily glancing at Rio before answering. “Well, believe it or not, we met because she was working.”</p><p>“I was the paramedic on scene when Agatha and Nicky got into a car crash,” Rio added, her voice gentler now.</p><p>The teasing in the air dimmed slightly as everyone took that in, but Agatha saw only curiosity on their faces—concern, yes, but not the heavy, lingering kind.</p><p>“Damn,” Victor muttered. “That must’ve been intense.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “It was. But I—” She glanced at Rio, something small and unspoken passing between them as she reached out to squeeze her hand. “I was very lucky to have her there.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, shifting slightly in her chair as if the compliment made her a little uncomfortable under the weight of so many eyes. “Well. Just doing my job.”</p><p>“And then a week later, I walked into my neurology lecture and—surprise,” Agatha said, arching an eyebrow. “Guess who was sitting in my classroom?”</p><p>Pedro let out a low whistle. “Damn.”</p><p>Victor smirked. “Now that’s a plot twist.”</p><p>Rio groaned, already anticipating where this was going. “Don’t—”</p><p>Pedro ignored her completely. “So, professora,” he said, turning to Agatha with a grin. “Is our little sister a good student?”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio stiffen slightly beside her, but she only hummed, lifting her glass as if contemplating the question. “Oh, she’s an excellent student,” she said, deliberately slow. “Dedicated, hardworking…”</p><p>Rio relaxed.</p><p>“…and very dramatic.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward her. “What?”</p><p>Victor laughed. “Oh, please elaborate.”</p><p>“She has a flair for the dramatics,” Agatha continued, sipping her wine. “Always making some grand expression of suffering over an assignment that she, more often than not, already has completed.”</p><p>Pedro nearly choked on his drink. “That sounds exactly like her.”</p><p>“I knew it,” Victor added, nudging Gabi, who was already cackling.</p><p>Rio threw her hands in the air. “Oh, come on. I am not dramatic.”</p><p>Agatha simply arched a single, knowing eyebrow.</p><p>Rio groaned. “You’re supposed to be on my side.”</p><p>“I’m merely reporting what I’ve observed,” Agatha said, her voice far too innocent. ”What was it that you said the other day? That you and your laptop were in a very toxic relationship over that nephrology assignment?”</p><p>That only earned more laughter from the table, and Rio sighed, muttering something under her breath before shaking her head.</p><p>“Alright, since everyone is so interested in my academic life,” Rio said, pointedly ignoring her brothers’ continued smirks, “I’ll have you know that Agatha’s class is fantastic. Genuinely. She’s a wealth of knowledge when it comes to medicine and neurology, and honestly, if I wasn’t already into neuroscience, I would be after sitting through just one of her lectures.”</p><p>The teasing momentarily quieted at that, and Agatha found herself blinking at the sincerity in Rio’s tone.</p><p>It wasn’t said for the sake of deflecting her family’s jokes. It was just honest.</p><p>A warmth spread through Agatha’s chest, though she fought to keep her expression neutral. “Thank you, Rio,” she said softly.</p><p>Rio just shrugged, reaching for her drink. “Don’t get used to the compliments,” she teased, though her ears were slightly pink.</p><p>Victor leaned toward Pedro, stage-whispering, “She totally has a crush on her professor.”</p><p>Rio groaned again, reaching for her napkin and tossing it at him. “Oh, my god, shut up.”</p><p>Agatha, for her part, simply sat back and watched the chaos unfold, hiding a small smile behind the rim of her wine glass.</p><p>As the laughter and teasing settled into more casual conversation, Agatha took a moment to glance at Rio, who was sipping her drink, still recovering from the relentless hazing of her siblings. Something about the easy way Rio fit into this space, the warmth of her family, the effortless back-and-forth, made Agatha feel—</p><p>She wasn’t sure.</p><p>Comfortable, maybe. Included, even.</p><p>And she wasn’t used to that.</p><p>So instead of lingering too long on the feeling, she leaned back slightly and said, “Since we’re already talking about how brilliant your sister is, I should probably mention that she gave a presentation last week that left my colleagues speechless.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward her, eyes narrowing. “Oh, so now you want to talk about what they thought? But when I asked—”</p><p>Agatha, entirely unbothered, cut her off smoothly. “Oh, I’m not telling you about it. You’re not allowed.”</p><p>Rio gaped at her. “What?”</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her wine, entirely too composed. “But telling your family about it? That’s an entirely different matter. I’m not breaking any rules there.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “That’s not fair.”</p><p>Victor perked up immediately. “Wait, wait, wait—so what exactly did they say?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, glancing at the expectant faces around the table. “Oh, they were thoroughly impressed,” she said, and then, because it was the truth, she added, “I think some of them were even a little in awe.”</p><p>Rio made a strangled noise. “Agatha.”</p><p>“She was excellent,” Agatha continued, pretending not to hear her. “Her knowledge was thorough, her delivery was confident, and she handled questions better than most seasoned professionals.”</p><p>Pedro let out a low whistle. “Damn, Rio. Look at you, girl.”</p><p>Gabi, who had been watching Rio’s slow descent into barely concealed embarrassment at the Agatha’s praise, smirked. “Papi, do you hear this? Your baby girl is out there showing up entire panels of professors.”</p><p>Juan, who had been quietly observing the exchange with a look of fond amusement, nodded. “I would expect nothing less from her.”</p><p>Rio groaned again, slouching dramatically in her seat. “I hate all of you.”</p><p>“You love us,” Pedro corrected.</p><p>Agatha turned her attention back to Juan, still smiling. “It’s true, though. You should be very proud of her.”</p><p>Juan gave her a knowing look, something warm and understanding in his expression, before he turned to Rio and reached over to squeeze her hand. “I always am.”</p><p>Rio sighed but squeezed back. “Thanks, Papi.”</p><p>As the laughter continued, Victor leaned forward with a mischievous glint in his eye. “So, professora, was there a specific moment when you knew Rio was your favorite student?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, considering. “Oh, that’s difficult,” she mused. “Was it the time she walked into my lecture hall running on two hours of sleep, holding a coffee the size of her head?”</p><p>Pedro let out a bark of laughter. “Yep. That sounds right.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Or maybe it was when she started flirting with me even though she knew I was her professor and mentor.”</p><p>The reaction was immediate.</p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward her, eyes wide. “Agatha.”</p><p>Victor slammed a hand on the table. “No way.”</p><p>Pedro practically wheezed. “Oh, this is fantastic.”</p><p>Holly, who had been quietly enjoying her wine, let out a delighted laugh. “Rio, really?”</p><p>Rio groaned, dragging a hand down her face. “It wasn’t—okay, it wasn’t that bad—”</p><p>“That bad?” Victor repeated, grinning. “So you were flirting?”</p><p>“I was—” Rio started, then stopped, looking completely cornered. “It was lightly flirtatious!”</p><p>Pedro cackled. “So, confirmed.”</p><p>Gabi shook her head, grinning. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha, betrayal all over her face. “You just threw me to the wolves.”</p><p>Agatha, entirely unrepentant, sipped her wine and hid a laugh, completely entertained. Victor let out a whoop of laughter, while Rio groaned dramatically, slumping back in her chair.</p><p>Agatha just smiled to herself, warmth settling in her chest as she took in the easy, chaotic rhythm of the Vidal family.</p><p>She could get used to this.</p><p>As the laughter finally started to settle—though Rio was still grumbling under her breath about betrayal—Gabi leaned forward with a grin. “Alright, Agatha, since we’re already embarrassing Rio, let’s hear more about this flirting. Did she come up with some cheesy pickup line in the middle of class?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Oh no, she was more subtle than that. A lingering look here, a teasing comment there…” She tilted her head at Rio. “Though I do recall a certain moment when she told me she enjoyed my lectures a little too much.”</p><p>That was the moment Rio nearly choked on her wine. “Oh my God.”</p><p>Agatha just smiled, tilting her wine glass idly in her hand. “Let’s just say… there was an unmistakable tone.”</p><p>That sent the table into another uproar of laughter, with Victor pretending to wipe a tear from his eye. “I’m so proud of you, Rio. Truly.”</p><p>Rio threw her hands up. “Oh my God.”</p><p>Agatha watched, entertained, as the banter continued. She wasn’t in a hurry to explain everything about her and Rio—some things were better left for quieter moments—but this felt like a nice glimpse into Rio’s world. A bit loud, chaotic, and full of love. She could get used to this.</p><p>Pedro leaned forward, eyes gleaming. “Wait, wait. Define ‘a little too much.’”</p><p>Rio groaned and leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms over her chest. “Oh, you are all so embarrassing,” she muttered, clearly exasperated, but her amusement was still visible in the corners of her eyes.</p><p>“You’re lucky I’m not telling your siblings about all the other stuff,” Agatha teased, but when Rio shot her a look, Agatha couldn’t help but wink. “But she did make the first move.”</p><p>The table burst into laughter again, Rio slumping even further into her seat, her face reddening.</p><p>Pedro pointed at her, practically gasping for air. “So, not only did you flirt with her, but you also kissed her first?”</p><p>Rio shot her brother a glare. “I did not kiss her first,” she protested, but her words fell flat.</p><p>Agatha, barely suppressing a smile, looked at Rio with a tilt of her head. “Oh, you did.”</p><p>And just like that, the teasing picked up again, the room echoing with laughter. Rio was sinking into her seat, all but hiding behind her own hands as she tried to disappear.</p><p>Rio, trying to recover from the relentless teasing, finally muttered, “Okay, okay. I kissed her first. Happy now?”</p><p>Agatha smiled sweetly, but there was a glint of mischief in her eyes. “Just thought you’d want to get that out there.”</p><p>Just as Rio began to prepare her defense for another round of laughter, Nicky, who had been playing somewhere else, wandered back into the room. His little face was drowsy, eyes half-closed with exhaustion, and his legs were heavy from all the running around.</p><p>He barely made it a step before spotting Rio. Without hesitation, he rushed toward her and, before anyone could react, climbed right into her lap, snuggling up against her.</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise as the little boy settled into her embrace, his small hands clutching at her shirt. “Hey, buddy,” she whispered softly, her fingers smoothing through his hair. Her earlier embarrassment melted away as Nicky nestled in, the weight of his small body feeling like comfort in her arms.</p><p>Agatha watched quietly, feeling the warmth between the two of them. There was something effortless about the way Rio wrapped her arms around Nicky, just as if he had always been there. As if this, this chaotic family, was part of her, too.</p><p>As Nicky yawned, content to curl up in Rio’s lap, Agatha’s heart did a quiet flip. She glanced at Rio, who was already looking down at Nicky with a soft, loving gaze. Agatha couldn’t help but smile, her heart swelling with something that felt close to belonging.</p><p>The moment felt perfect in its simplicity. The teasing, the laughter, the noise of the family—it all felt like part of the same fabric that now connected them.</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eye, a soft, tender smile forming between them. No words were necessary; the way Rio gently stroked Nicky’s back was all the answer Agatha needed. She felt like she had found her place here, with Rio, with Nicky, in this messy, beautiful family.</p><p>~*~</p><p>After placing Nicky carefully in the children’s room, Agatha lingered for a moment, watching Rio. The way she moved so naturally, so lovingly, with the kids made Agatha’s chest tighten in the best way. She had already grown so fond of this family. Rio gently kissed Nicky on the forehead, adjusting his blanket with such care before ensuring the hallway light filtered into the room just enough.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the room behind her, her heart swelling with affection as she took in the sight. When Rio turned toward the door, Agatha reached for her hand, gently pulling her into a soft kiss. As their lips met, the moment was filled with warmth, with gratitude, with love unspoken. Agatha pulled away just enough to whisper, “You’re so good with him. So good to me. I’m so glad we found you.”</p><p>Rio smiled, the expression in her eyes almost unreadable for a moment, before she pulled Agatha in for another kiss. Agatha didn’t mind the interruption—she was content, grounded in this moment with Rio. But just as they deepened the kiss, a voice rang out from behind them.</p><p>“Ugh, Aunt Rio, please get a room,” Julia’s laughing voice cut through the quiet, and Agatha couldn’t help but laugh softly, startled at first but then chuckling at how typical it was.</p><p>Rio groaned playfully, pulling away from Agatha and turning toward her niece. “Alright, alright,” she said with a laugh, “We’ll start with the presents. I’ll keep it PG, I promise.”</p><p>Julia grinned, satisfied, and Agatha felt a soft warmth at the way Rio handled everything so effortlessly. Rio turned back toward her. “We exchange presents at midnight here, after prayer.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, feeling a pleasant tingle of excitement in her chest. She was looking forward to this new tradition. As they walked down the hallway to Rio’s room, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a little giddy. She followed Rio to where the gifts were stashed and watched as Rio picked hers up, ready to share in the celebration of this close-knit family. Agatha couldn’t help but feel like she was becoming part of something much bigger than just a holiday or a single family gathering.</p><p>When they returned downstairs, the energy was even livelier. The house was buzzing with the chatter and laughter of family, the sounds of children running around and adults reminiscing. </p><p>Agatha shyly gave Juan and Gloria their gifts, and was surprised when Rio’s parents handed her a gift in return. “For you,” Juan said warmly, his smile full of kindness. “And there’s one for Nicky too, for when he wakes up.”</p><p>The gesture made Agatha feel something she wasn’t expecting: a deep sense of belonging. Her heart tugged at the thought that these people, who she had only just begun to know, cared about her already. She glanced at Rio, who was watching the exchange with the same warmth in her eyes.</p><p>The night continued, loud and joyful, and Agatha settled into the chaos with a sense of calm. But just as she was getting comfortable, Gabi leaned forward with a teasing grin. “So, you two aren’t going to exchange gifts?” she asked, her tone filled with playful curiosity.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, raising an eyebrow at her. They shared a quick glance before Rio shrugged. “We’ll do it later,” she said, though Agatha couldn’t help but smile at the way the words hung in the air, full of something unspoken.</p><p>“We’ve got something in mind,” Agatha added with a grin, her tone light but suggestive.</p><p>Pedro, who had been listening in, leaned forward immediately. His eyes gleamed with mischief. “Oooh, is it kinky?” he teased, and the room erupted into laughter.</p><p>Agatha laughed, her face flushing lightly at the sudden turn of the conversation. She tried to hide her smile but couldn’t quite manage. Rio just rolled her eyes, but Agatha could see the playful glint in her eyes too. It was impossible not to feel the warmth that this family’s easygoing nature brought with it.</p><p>“Well, if the gift is half as good as the chemistry between you two,” Gabi said with a wink, “we’re all in for a treat.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, completely at ease now. She was part of something bigger than just this night—she was becoming part of Rio’s family, and it was clear to her now that she belonged here in a way she hadn’t expected. She caught Rio’s gaze across the room, her heart swelling again, and for the first time in a long time, everything felt like it was exactly where it was supposed to be.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As the evening wound down and the last of the laughter from the living room faded, the house grew quieter. The children had been tucked into bed, and the adults had all found their own places to settle in for the night. Agatha and Rio made their way upstairs, the gentle hum of the night settling around them.</p><p>Once in Rio’s room, the atmosphere shifted, a quiet anticipation hanging in the air. Agatha had taken a moment to think about what she wanted to give Rio. She felt the weight of the two gifts in her hands—one small and practical, the other more personal, but both meaningful in their own way.</p><p>Rio had already changed into comfortable clothes, a soft sweater and sweatpants, and Agatha couldn’t help but admire the easy way she moved, how she always seemed so grounded and sure of herself, even in the quietest moments. She had a way of making everything feel calm, even when the world around them was spinning with the noise of family.</p><p>“I have something for you,” Agatha said softly, holding out the small box wrapped in simple but elegant paper. She could feel her heart rate pick up, the anticipation suddenly weighing on her, though she wasn’t sure why. It was just a gift, after all. Just an offering of appreciation, a token of how much Rio meant to her already.</p><p>Rio looked at the box, then back at Agatha, a small but knowing smile curling on her lips. She took it gently from Agatha’s hands, and Agatha watched her face as she untied the ribbon and peeled away the paper.</p><p>Inside was a stethoscope, sleek and professional, with Rio’s name engraved on the metal part. It was a simple gift, but Agatha had spent a long time choosing it, wanting something that felt personal but also practical for Rio’s journey ahead in medicine.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, and she looked up at Agatha, her voice quiet as she spoke. “You know, I’ve been meaning to get a new one,” she said with a light chuckle, running her fingers over the name. “But this—this is… so thoughtful. I don’t even know what to say.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, her eyes lingering on Rio. “You don’t have to say anything,” she said gently. “Just that you like it is enough.”</p><p>But there was more she wanted to give, something more significant, a gesture that felt like the right way to show Rio how much she’d come to mean to her in such a short time.</p><p>She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small key. She held it in front of Rio, watching her eyes flicker with curiosity. “And this,” Agatha continued, her voice soft but steady, “is for you too. A key to my house.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her hand hesitating in mid-air as if unsure whether to take it. “A key?” she repeated, her voice barely a whisper, a mix of surprise and emotion in her tone. “Agatha, you—this is… a big gesture.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, meeting Rio’s gaze. “I want you to feel like you have a place in my life, just as you’ve made me feel like I have a place in yours. I’m welcoming you into my house, into my space, just like you did with me tonight. It feels right.”</p><p>Rio took the key from Agatha’s hand, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s for a brief moment, sending a spark through her. She stared at the key for a moment, clearly moved by the gesture, before she met Agatha’s eyes again. “I don’t even know what to say,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p>Agatha smiled, a little nervous now, but pleased that Rio seemed to appreciate the gesture. “You don’t have to say anything. Just… take it when you’re ready.”</p><p>For a moment, they just stood there, the air between them charged with something unspoken, something more than just the exchange of gifts. Rio stepped closer, gently pulling Agatha into a soft hug, the kind of hug that felt grounding and meaningful.</p><p>“I’m glad we found each other,” Rio whispered into Agatha’s ear, holding her close.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, breathing in the scent of Rio’s hair, feeling the warmth of her body against hers. She wanted to stay like this forever, caught in the simplicity of the moment, the quiet understanding between them.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Rio gave her a small, shy smile. “I have something for you too.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, curious but still feeling a little breathless from their embrace. “You do?” she asked softly.</p><p>Rio handed her a small, carefully wrapped package. It was much smaller than the stethoscope, but Agatha could see how meticulously Rio had wrapped it. Agatha took it, feeling the weight of it in her hand, before she began unwrapping it. Inside was a delicate bracelet, silver with tiny charms dangling from it. The charms were subtle but meaningful: a small heart, a stethoscope, and a tiny ambulance, a cup of coffee.</p><p>Agatha looked up at Rio, her breath catching in her throat. “This is beautiful,” she said softly, her fingers brushing over the charms. “You didn’t have to do this.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her cheeks flushing a little. “I wanted to. I thought it would be something that would remind you of me… even when I’m not around.” She gave a little laugh, but there was something vulnerable in it. “I know it’s not anywhere near as grand as what you gave me, but—”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha interrupted gently, reaching out to cup her face in her hands, her thumb brushing over Rio’s cheek. “This is perfect. It’s thoughtful and meaningful. You don’t have to measure up to anything. You already gave me something far more important.” She gave Rio a tender smile. “Your trust. Your love.”</p><p>Rio smiled back, her eyes shining with unshed tears. “You’re making me emotional.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, leaning in to place a gentle kiss on Rio’s lips. “I’ll try to keep it together too, but you’re not making it easy.”</p><p>For a moment, the world outside seemed to fade away, and it was just the two of them, sharing in the quiet intimacy of their exchange—of their shared feelings, their shared lives. Agatha had never been more certain that this, right here, was where she was meant to be.</p><p>The kiss deepened, slow and lingering at first, as if they were both savoring the taste of each other, allowing the moment to stretch out. Agatha’s heart raced, her breath quickening as Rio’s lips moved with purpose, a quiet intensity building between them. Rio’s hands found their way to Agatha’s back, pulling her closer, their bodies pressing together, the heat between them undeniable.</p><p>Agatha’s mind began to cloud, her senses overwhelmed by the feel of Rio against her, the subtle pressure of her lips, the warmth of her hands slipping underneath her sweater, tracing the curve of her skin. Agatha gasped softly as Rio’s fingers made contact with the smoothness of her stomach, her touch light but electric, sending a wave of desire coursing through Agatha’s body.</p><p>The air around them felt thick, charged, as Agatha’s body betrayed her—her hips subtly pressing forward, a burning need beginning to flare between her thighs. The tension was building quickly, and Agatha was aware of every little movement, every brush of skin, the way Rio’s fingers seemed to know exactly where to touch.</p><p>But then Agatha caught herself. She broke the kiss gently, her chest rising and falling rapidly with her breath, her hands resting on Rio’s shoulders to steady herself. Her eyes locked onto Rio’s, a mix of longing and hesitation in them.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha murmured, her voice a little shaky as she placed a hand on Rio’s wrist, halting the progress of her hand under Agatha’s sweater. “We can’t. Not like this.” She swallowed hard, trying to ground herself in the present moment. “Your parents are probably just down the hall.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed slightly, a flicker of confusion crossing her face. “Agatha—”</p><p>“I’m not saying I don’t want you,” Agatha quickly added, her voice low and earnest, “I do. So much. But I won’t—” She paused, struggling to keep her composure.</p><p>But Rio was relentless, and just moved to run her lips and tongue down the sensitive skin of Agatha’s neck, making an involuntary low moan escape her lips. Then to keep her from getting louder, Rio just captured her lips with hers, pulling her into a deep kiss, as their tongues danced together in a way that made Agatha lose all sense of time and space.</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, Agatha pulled back slightly, her chest still rising and falling with the intensity of their kiss. Her fingers lingered on Rio’s skin, but the reality of their situation was hard to ignore. She could feel the tension pulling at her, the overwhelming desire that came with being so close to Rio, but the logic of the moment still held her back.</p><p>But Rio, ever playful, broke the silence with a quiet suggestion, her lips curving into a teasing smile as her fingers gently traced Agatha’s lower back. “What if we’re really, really quiet?” she asked softly, her voice warm and low with mischief.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught at the suggestion. Her body wanted to give in, wanted to let go of the restraint that was holding her back. She couldn’t help the laugh that escaped her lips, a quiet, breathless sound that mixed with the heat between them.</p><p>“You are trouble,” Agatha whispered, her resolve beginning to weaken.</p><p>Rio leaned in, her lips brushing just barely against Agatha’s ear. “I know,” she murmured, her words sending a shiver down Agatha’s spine, as she guided her to her bed.</p><p>It was all it took. The barrier Agatha had built up in her mind crumbled in an instant. The teasing whisper, the playful hint in Rio’s voice—it was all too much, too tempting. Without a second thought, Agatha gave in, pulling Rio back into a kiss, deeper this time, letting go of her hesitation. The quietness of the room, the uncertainty of who might be just beyond the door, no longer mattered.</p><p>Rio’s hands moved back to Agatha’s sweater, slipping under it once more, and Agatha, unable to resist, let out a quiet sigh of approval. She pulled Rio closer, feeling the heat of their bodies melding together as she gave herself over to the moment. The world outside seemed to fade, leaving only the two of them in their shared space, hearts racing in the silence of the night.</p><p>Rio lay beside her, her body warm and inviting under the covers. Her hand traced lazy circles on Agatha’s arm, a touch that sent shivers down her spine. “You’re overthinking again,” Rio murmured, her voice low and teasing.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, her cheeks flushing. “I’m not overthinking. I’m just… aware that your parents are literally down the hall.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, her breath warm against Agatha’s ear. “So?”</p><p>“So?” Agatha repeated, turning to face her. “Rio, we’re in your parents’ house. In your old bed. They’re right there. What if they hear us?”</p><p>Rio’s grin was wicked, her dark eyes glinting with mischief. “They won’t hear a thing. They’re sound sleepers. Trust me.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, burying her face in the pillow. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And you’re gorgeous,” Rio countered, her fingers trailing down Agatha’s side, skimming the curve of her waist. “Come on, love. It’s Christmas. Don’t you want to… celebrate?”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped at the suggestion, a mix of nerves and desire coiling inside her. She peeked out from the pillow, meeting Rio’s gaze. “You’re not playing fair.”</p><p>“Never do,” Rio replied, her voice dropping to a whisper. She leaned in closer, her lips brushing against Agatha’s earlobe. “Besides, aren’t you curious? What it’d be like to have a little… fun… in my childhood bedroom?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Damn her. Rio always knew exactly what to say to unravel her. She could feel the tension between them, thick and electric, and it was becoming harder and harder to resist.</p><p>“It’s not fair,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling. “You’re making it impossible to say no.”</p><p>“Then don’t say no,” Rio murmured, her lips trailing down Agatha’s neck. Her hand slid beneath the hem of Agatha’s shirt, her fingers warm against her skin. “Just say yes.”</p><p>Agatha’s resolve crumbled. She turned to face Rio, her eyes locking onto hers. “You’re sure they won’t hear us?”</p><p>“Positive,” Rio promised, her lips curving into a smile. “Now stop worrying and kiss me.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a moment before closing the distance between them. Their lips met in a searing kiss, slow and deliberate at first, then deepening as the spark between them ignited into a flame. Rio’s hands were everywhere—in her hair, on her waist, sliding under her shirt—each touch sending a jolt of warmth through her body.</p><p>Breathless, Agatha pulled away, her heart pounding. “You’re going to be the death of me,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio chuckled, her fingers hooking into the waistband of Agatha’s pajama pants. “But what a way to go.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse quickened as Rio’s hands dipped lower, her movements unhurried and deliberate. She could feel the heat building between her legs, a slow, steady ache that left her craving more. This is insane, she thought, her mind racing. We’re insane.</p><p>But then Rio’s mouth was on her neck again, her teeth grazing the sensitive skin there, and all rational thought went out the window. Agatha’s fingers tangled in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, urging her on.</p><p>“Relax,” Rio whispered, her lips trailing lower, down Agatha’s collarbone. “Just let me take care of you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught as Rio’s hands slid her pants down, the cool air hitting her skin in stark contrast to the heat of Rio’s touch. She let out a soft gasp as Rio’s lips followed the path of her hands, her kisses searing against her stomach, her hips, her thighs.</p><p>“Rio,” she whispered, her voice shaky. “What if—”</p><p>“Shh,” Rio interrupted, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin. “Don’t think. Just feel.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut as Rio’s tongue flicked against clit, the sensation sending shockwaves through her body. Her hips bucked instinctively, her fingers tightening in Rio’s hair. It was overwhelming, almost too much, but she couldn’t bring herself to stop.</p><p>Rio’s hands gripped her hips, holding her steady as she took her time, each movement deliberate and calculated. Agatha could feel the tension building inside her, a coil tightening with every stroke of Rio’s tongue. Her breath came in short, ragged gasps, her body trembling with anticipation.</p><p>“Close,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I’m so close.”</p><p>Rio hummed against her, the vibrations sending her spiraling over the edge. Her back arched off the bed, a strangled cry escaping her lips as the waves of pleasure crashed over her.</p><p>For a moment, the world ceased to exist. There was only the heat of Rio’s mouth, the rhythm of her breathing, the sound of her own heartbeat pounding in her ears. And then, slowly, the sensation ebbed, leaving her boneless and breathless.</p><p>Rio pulled back, a smug grin on her face. “Told you they wouldn’t hear a thing.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, swatting at her arm. “You’re insufferable.”</p><p>“And you’re beautiful,” Rio replied, leaning in to kiss her. Agatha could taste herself on Rio’s lips, a reminder of what had just happened. It should’ve felt strange, but it didn’t. Instead, it only made her want more.</p><p>Her hands moved of their own accord, sliding under Rio’s shirt and pushing it up. Rio broke the kiss, her eyes dark with desire as Agatha’s fingers traced the curve of her breasts.</p><p>“My turn,” Agatha whispered, her voice low and sultry.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha’s hands moved lower, her touch igniting a fire that burned hotter with every passing second. The room was silent once more, but this time, it was filled with the soft sounds of their breathing, the rustle of the sheets, and the promise of what was to come.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Christmas morning came gently, wrapped in the kind of quiet only found in the early hours.</p><p>Agatha stirred first, the warmth of the room cocooning her as she slowly blinked awake. The first thing she registered was Rio—her steady breath, the solid weight of her body pressed close. They were tangled together beneath the blankets, skin warm against skin, Rio’s arm slung lazily over Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha exhaled softly, letting herself settle back into the moment.</p><p>She knew she should get up, check on Nicky. But when she reached for her phone on the nightstand and saw the time—6:12 a.m.—she allowed herself the indulgence of staying. Just for a little longer.</p><p>Her gaze drifted around the room, taking in the details she hadn’t noticed the night before. The old posters on the wall, some faded with time but still clinging stubbornly to their place. A corkboard filled with pinned notes, a few yellowed ticket stubs, and photos of a younger Rio, grinning with friends. Shelves stacked with books. It was a glimpse into a version of Rio she hadn’t known—teenage Rio, the girl who had dreamed, studied, lived in this space before the weight of the world settled on her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha’s heart ached in the best way.</p><p>She shifted slightly, just enough to tighten her hold on Rio, pressing a soft kiss into her hair. She didn’t say it, but she thought it—I love you.</p><p>Rio stirred at that, a sleepy hum escaping her lips as she nuzzled closer. “Mm, what time is it?” she murmured, voice thick with sleep.</p><p>“Too early,” Agatha whispered. “Go back to sleep.”</p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she tilted her face up, her lips brushing softly against Agatha’s collarbone. “Merry Christmas,” she mumbled, pressing another lazy kiss there.</p><p>Agatha smiled, threading her fingers through Rio’s hair. “Merry Christmas.”</p><p>Rio’s hand traced idle patterns along Agatha’s hip, her fingers warm and slow. “Pretty good way to wake up,” she mused, pressing another kiss, this time to the base of Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her fingers tightening slightly in Rio’s hair. “It’s not bad,” she teased, though her voice came out a little breathless.</p><p>Rio grinned against her skin. “Not bad, huh?”</p><p>Her lips trailed upward, pressing along Agatha’s jaw, slow and unhurried, savoring. Agatha tilted her head, letting her. Letting herself sink into the warmth of this—of Rio, of the slow, intimate way they fit together in the quiet morning light.</p><p>They had nowhere to be. Not yet.</p><p>So Agatha let herself stay, let herself hold on to this moment for as long as she could.</p><p>Rio’s lips found Agatha’s, soft at first, a lazy kiss that carried the weight of sleep and warmth and the quiet intimacy of the morning. It was unhurried, indulgent, the kind of kiss that had no destination—just a slow unraveling of affection.</p><p>Agatha sighed against her, her fingers slipping down Rio’s back, tracing the curve of her spine with featherlight touches. Rio shivered, her body instinctively pressing closer, her knee slipping between Agatha’s legs as she deepened the kiss.</p><p>It wasn’t rushed. There was no urgency, no desperation—just slow, deliberate touches, hands learning, exploring in the quiet glow of early morning. Rio’s fingers slipped beneath the fabric of Agatha’s shirt, her palm finding the warm skin of her waist, smoothing over it with a touch that was equal parts reverent and teasing.</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, her own hands finding purchase against Rio’s hips, holding her there as their bodies pressed together. The heat between them built gradually, a natural pull that neither of them resisted, kisses growing deeper, touches turning more certain.</p><p>Rio’s lips traveled along Agatha’s jaw, then lower, leaving a trail of soft, lingering kisses down her neck. Agatha let her head fall back against the pillow, eyes fluttering shut as she absorbed the sensation, the slow, deliberate way Rio was mapping her skin.</p><p>For a while, that was all there was—the quiet sounds of their breathing, the soft rustle of sheets, the warmth of their bodies entwined. It wasn’t hurried, wasn’t about anything more than being here, together, lost in the haze of morning and each other.</p><p>Agatha melted into the kiss, her fingers threading through Rio’s hair, holding her there as if she could keep time from moving forward. She didn’t want this to end—the slow burn of Rio’s touch, the way their bodies fit together like they’d done this a hundred times before.</p><p>Rio’s hands, warm and sure, skimmed over Agatha’s waist, her touch leaving behind a trail of heat. It was intoxicating, how easily Rio could pull her under, how every kiss, every brush of fingers against skin, made Agatha forget the world beyond this bed. She sighed against Rio’s lips, parting them just enough to deepen the kiss, to chase the warmth pooling low in her stomach.</p><p>Rio responded in kind, her body shifting, pressing closer, her knee slipping between Agatha’s thighs again with just enough pressure to make Agatha inhale sharply. The sound must have pleased Rio, because she hummed, her lips curving into a knowing smile against Agatha’s skin as she trailed soft kisses down her neck, nipping lightly before soothing the spot with her tongue.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into Rio’s back, her breath catching at the sensation. It was so easy to get lost in this, in her. The teasing edge to Rio’s touches, the slow, deliberate way she moved against her—it was enough to unravel her piece by piece.</p><p>She knew they couldn’t lose themselves completely, not here, not now. But the thought of stopping, of pulling away, felt impossible when Rio was pressing open-mouthed kisses to her collarbone, when her hands were tracing the curve of her hips with just enough pressure to make Agatha’s breath stutter.</p><p>“Rio,” she murmured, her voice catching somewhere between a plea and a warning.</p><p>Rio stilled for a moment, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin. Then she lifted her head, her dark eyes heavy-lidded but searching. “Too much?” she asked softly, her thumb tracing slow circles against Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her heart still racing, her body still humming with need. She shook her head. “No,” she admitted, voice quieter now, more raw. “Just… Nicky.”</p><p>Rio blinked, then let out a soft, breathless laugh, dropping her forehead against Agatha’s shoulder. “Right. Nicky.” She sighed, her fingers flexing against Agatha’s waist like she was warring with herself.</p><p>Agatha laughed too, softer this time, brushing her lips against Rio’s temple before cupping her cheek, coaxing her back up for another kiss. This one was slow, lingering, filled with something deeper than just want.</p><p>“We have time,” Agatha murmured against her lips.</p><p>Rio smiled, her fingers grazing the edge of Agatha’s jaw as she pulled back just enough to look at her. “Yeah,” she agreed, voice softer now, more certain. “We do.”</p><p>And even though neither of them moved just yet, neither of them rushed to pull away, Agatha knew it was true.</p><p>They stayed like that for a while, wrapped up in the warmth of each other, their breathing slowing as the intensity between them settled into something quieter, something deeper. Agatha traced idle patterns on Rio’s bare shoulder, letting her fingertips memorize the shape of her. Rio, in turn, pressed lazy kisses against Agatha’s jaw, her touch gentler now, more affectionate than teasing.</p><p>The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting everything in a soft glow, and for a fleeting moment, Agatha let herself bask in this—this rare kind of peace, this stolen moment where the rest of the world didn’t matter.</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, adjusting their position, but didn’t move away. Instead, she sighed, a sound of pure contentment, and nestled closer. “This is nice,” she murmured, her lips brushing against Agatha’s skin as she spoke.</p><p>Agatha smiled, smoothing a hand down Rio’s back. “It is.”</p><p>There was something about this—about waking up like this, tangled in soft sheets and even softer touches—that made everything feel so easy. So right.</p><p>Rio pressed another kiss to Agatha’s shoulder before tilting her head up, resting her chin against Agatha’s chest, studying her with that quiet intensity that always made Agatha’s pulse quicken. “Merry Christmas,” Rio murmured, her fingers tracing slow, absentminded circles against Agatha’s hip.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, brushing a stray curl from Rio’s forehead. “Merry Christmas, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, and without another word, she leaned up and kissed her again—slow and unhurried, like they had all the time in the world. It was a dangerous thing, this kind of ease between them, the way Agatha felt herself slipping further and further into whatever this was.</p><p>But for now, she let herself have it.</p><p>Because, for the first time in a long time, Christmas morning felt like something worth savoring.</p><p>The quiet was broken by the faint sound of movement in the hallway—a door opening, muffled footsteps against the hardwood floor. Agatha stiffened slightly, her mind already shifting back to reality.</p><p>Rio hummed, clearly unfazed, her lips still lazily tracing along Agatha’s collarbone. “Sounds like the house is waking up,” she murmured, her voice thick with sleep and something softer, something content.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet breath, carding her fingers through Rio’s hair one last time before she spoke. “Maybe it’s time we get up,” she suggested, though she made no immediate move to pull away.</p><p>Rio nuzzled against her, making a small, protesting noise. “Or,” she drawled, trailing her fingertips down Agatha’s spine in a way that sent a pleasant shiver through her, “we could stay here a little longer.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh, but she shook her head, pressing a quick kiss to Rio’s temple before finally shifting to sit up. “I should check on Nicky,” she said, glancing at the phone beside the bed. “I don’t want him to be alone for too long after he wakes up.”</p><p>Rio sighed, but there was no real frustration behind it. “You’re right,” she admitted, rubbing at her face before finally stretching, her muscles flexing under the soft morning light. “Guess we should make ourselves presentable for my family, too.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, arching a brow. “A shower would help with that.”</p><p>Rio’s grin turned playful. “Oh? Are you suggesting we conserve water?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the warmth in her chest didn’t fade. “I’m suggesting we don’t waste time,” she countered, already slipping out of bed.</p><p>Rio watched her with that familiar, amused glint in her eyes before finally following her lead. “Mmhmm,” she hummed, standing and stretching once more before padding after Agatha toward the bathroom. “Whatever you say, professor.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head fondly, but she didn’t argue. Instead, she let herself enjoy the rare simplicity of this—of waking up beside someone who made her laugh, of sharing this small, intimate moment before stepping back into the world.</p><p>And, just maybe, of the way Rio’s hand found hers as they disappeared behind the bathroom door.</p><p>~*~ </p><p> </p><p>Downstairs, the house was already buzzing with soft murmurs and the occasional clatter of dishes as someone moved around the kitchen. The scent of fresh coffee and something sweet, cinnamon maybe, lingered in the air, wrapping the space in warmth.</p><p>When Agatha and Rio finally made it to the living room, Nicky was already perched on the couch, legs swinging impatiently as he whispered something to Mateo, who sat beside him. Sofia, a little younger, was curled up on the floor with a plush toy in her lap, rubbing her sleepy eyes. The Christmas tree stood proudly in the corner, twinkling with multicolored lights, its base filled with neatly wrapped presents.</p><p>Nicky’s face lit up the moment he spotted Agatha. “Mom!” He practically launched off the couch, rushing to her. “Finally! I’ve been waiting forever.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a soft laugh as she knelt to hug him. “It’s barely past seven, Nicky.”</p><p>“Yeah, but presents,” he said as if that explained everything.</p><p>Rio chuckled behind them, ruffling Nicky’s hair as she passed. “You’ve got your priorities straight, kid.”</p><p>Gabi appeared from the kitchen with a steaming mug in hand, shaking her head in amusement. “They’ve  been up since six, staring at the tree like it was gonna vanish.”</p><p>“Respectfully,” Nicky said, “I had to make sure Santa did his job.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, pulling him toward the couch. “Well, let’s find out, shall we?”</p><p>The next few minutes were filled with the sound of torn wrapping paper and delighted squeals. Mateo and Sofia were equally caught up in the excitement, Mateo grinning as he unwrapped a new set of soccer gear, while Sofia clutched a doll close to her chest, already lost in playing with it.</p><p>When it was Nicky’s turn, Agatha handed him a neatly wrapped box. </p><p>The moment he saw the video game covers inside, his mouth fell open. “No way,” he breathed, flipping through them like they were sacred artifacts. “These are the newest ones! Mom, these just came out!”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, feigning nonchalance. “Must’ve been a Christmas miracle.”</p><p>Nicky let out an excited noise, launching himself at her for a hug. “This is amazing!”</p><p>Rio, lounging against the arm of the couch, grinned. “And here I thought I had the best gift,” she murmured in Agatha’s direction, nudging a large, oddly shaped box toward Nicky.</p><p>Nicky eyed it with a mix of suspicion and anticipation before tearing it open. The second he saw what was inside, a strangled gasp left his throat. “Oh my god.”</p><p>Inside was a full pirate costume—an intricate one, complete with a vest, sash, and a long, dramatically flowing coat. But the real highlight was the sword. It wasn’t just a flimsy plastic one; it was detailed, well-crafted, with an ornate hilt and just the right weight to feel real without being dangerous.</p><p>Nicky scrambled to pull the coat over his pajamas, barely able to contain himself. He brandished the sword, striking an exaggerated pose. “Captain Nicholas of the Seven Seas!” he declared, eyes shining.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Damn right you are.”</p><p>Mateo, clearly impressed, leaned closer. “That’s so cool. Can I try it?”</p><p>Nicky looked at him, narrowed his eyes in mock seriousness, then nodded. “Aye, but only if ye swear to follow the Pirate Code.”</p><p>Mateo grinned. “What’s the Pirate Code?”</p><p>“Rule number one—no telling Mom when we sword fight,” Nicky declared.</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “Oh god.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>The kitchen was filled with the scent of cinnamon, coffee, and something savory roasting in the oven. The house was still humming with the energy of Christmas morning—children’s laughter echoing from the living room, the occasional rustle of wrapping paper, the murmur of conversation from the hallway.</p><p>Agatha stood near the counter, fingers curled around a warm mug of coffee. Across from her, Gloria moved with effortless ease, checking on a pot simmering on the stove.</p><p>For a while, neither of them spoke. It was a comfortable quiet, the kind that didn’t demand to be filled.</p><p>“You know,” Gloria finally said, glancing at Agatha with a small smile, “when Rio told me you two would be here for Christmas, I was a little surprised.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Because I don’t seem like the kind of person to celebrate Christmas?”</p><p>Gloria huffed a soft laugh. “Because Rio doesn’t bring people home unless they mean something to her.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly around her mug. She looked down, as if the steam curling up from the coffee held the answer she was searching for.</p><p>“She didn’t tell me that,” Agatha admitted quietly.</p><p>Gloria tilted her head, watching her carefully. “That doesn’t surprise me. Rio can be open about a lot of things, but when something really matters to her? She holds it close.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “I don’t want to—” She stopped herself, shaking her head. “I don’t want to make things complicated for her.”</p><p>Gloria studied her for a moment before setting down the wooden spoon she had been stirring with. “Agatha,” she said gently, “Rio’s life is already complicated. That’s the nature of what she does, who she is. But the thing about my daughter is—she doesn’t shy away from what she wants.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet breath. “She thinks she wants this,” she murmured, more to herself than anything.</p><p>Gloria raised an eyebrow. “And you don’t?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. It wasn’t that she didn’t know—she did know. She just wasn’t sure what to do with it.</p><p>Gloria smiled knowingly. “You remind me a little of her father,” she said, turning back to the stove.</p><p>That startled Agatha. “I do?”</p><p>Gloria nodded. “Juan was careful. Thoughtful. He never rushed into things—he always had to be sure first. And sometimes, that meant he second-guessed himself, even when everyone else could see the truth clear as day.” She glanced at Agatha again, her expression warm but pointed. “Don’t let that happen to you.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly. There was a weight in Gloria’s words, not heavy in a burdensome way, but grounding.</p><p>“I don’t know how to be what she deserves,” Agatha admitted after a moment, voice quieter now.</p><p>Gloria smiled, soft and sure. “Then it’s a good thing that’s not for you to decide.”</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>Gloria reached out, gave Agatha’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “You’re here. That means something. Just don’t be so busy doubting yourself that you forget to enjoy it.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long moment before letting out a slow breath. A small, almost wry smile tugged at her lips. “You’re a very persuasive woman, Gloria.”</p><p>Gloria chuckled, picking up her spoon again. “I raised four kids, querida. Persuasion is a survival skill.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh before taking another sip of her coffee.</p><p>Gloria was quiet for a beat before she said, “Rio told me a little about your mother.”</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>It wasn’t a surprise, really. Rio had never pushed her to talk about Evanora, but she had seen enough to know. Still, hearing it out loud was different.</p><p>She forced a small, almost detached smile. “What did she say?”</p><p>Gloria studied her for a moment before answering, “That she was difficult when you were growing up. That she made you believe you had to earn her love.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her fingers tightening around her mug. She should have expected Rio to say something like that. But hearing it framed so plainly made it sting in a way she hadn’t prepared for.</p><p>She let out a soft, humorless breath. “That’s one way to put it.”</p><p>Gloria leaned against the counter, her expression unreadable. “She must have been proud of you, though. You’ve done so much. Built so much.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out something that was almost a laugh. “Pride would have required her to acknowledge me as more than a disappointment.”</p><p>Gloria frowned, her gaze soft but sharp. “That’s not right.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, as if it didn’t matter. “It is what it is.”</p><p>Gloria was silent for a long moment, then said, “You know, I used to think love had to be hard. That it had to be earned.” She shook her head. “But that’s not love, Agatha. That’s control.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched slightly. She wasn’t sure if it was the words themselves or the way Gloria said them—gentle, matter-of-fact, as if she were simply stating a truth Agatha had never let herself accept.</p><p>Gloria continued, her voice even, steady. “My father was like that. Love was something you had to prove yourself worthy of. And for a long time, I believed him.” She looked at Agatha, something soft but firm in her gaze. “Until I met Juan. Until I built my own family.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “And did that change things?”</p><p>Gloria smiled, small and knowing. “It changed everything.”</p><p>She reached for Agatha’s hand again, squeezing it gently. “Love doesn’t keep score, Agatha. It doesn’t demand perfection. You don’t have to earn your place here. You already have it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t realize she had been holding her breath until she exhaled, something in her chest loosening.</p><p>She didn’t know what to say, not really. But she found herself nodding, her fingers curling slightly around Gloria’s.</p><p>For a long time, love had felt like something fragile, something conditional. She didn’t know if she believed—fully believed—what Gloria was saying.</p><p>But standing here, in this kitchen, in this home that wasn’t hers but didn’t feel entirely <em>not</em> hers either… she wanted to try.</p><p> </p>

  <p>The highway stretched ahead of them, a long ribbon of asphalt cutting through the winter landscape. Snow still clung to the edges of the road, remnants of the cold front that had passed through while they were at her parents’ house. The car hummed steadily beneath them, a quiet, constant presence as they made their way back to Chicago.</p><p>Rio’s hands rested easily on the wheel, her fingers tapping idly against the leather as she stole a quick glance at the rearview mirror. Nicky was fast asleep in the backseat, his new pirate hat slipping down over his face, the toy sword from his costume held loosely in his arms like a prized possession.</p><p>Her gaze shifted to the passenger seat, where Agatha sat, looking out the window, her expression thoughtful but relaxed.</p><p>Rio exhaled, a slow, contented breath, letting the warmth of the past few days settle over her.</p><p>Christmas had been… a lot. A lot in the best possible way.</p><p>She had always loved the holidays, the messiness of it, the loudness, the way her family had a habit of talking over one another, laughter filling every room. And this year had been no different. If anything, it had been even better. Because Agatha had been there. Nicky had been there.</p><p>And they had been welcomed.</p><p>Her parents, her brothers, Gabi, even the kids—everyone had taken them in like they’d always been part of the family. Nicky had spent hours playing with Mateo and Sofia, darting through the house like he belonged there. And Agatha… well, Agatha had just fit. Completely. Even with her usual composed demeanor, Rio had caught the softening in her, the way she had let herself be taken into the warmth of Rio’s family, whether she realized it or not.</p><p>She thought about the way her mom had pulled Agatha aside in the kitchen, their quiet conversation stretching longer than Rio had expected. She hadn’t asked about it yet, but she had noticed the way Agatha had looked afterward—less guarded, maybe. A little more at ease.</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop the small smile tugging at the corner of her lips.</p><p>It was good. All of it. Better than she had let herself hope for.</p><p>She had been worried, in the back of her mind, about how Agatha would handle it—the sheer volume of her family, the chaos, the love that sometimes came in overwhelming bursts. But Agatha had taken it in stride, had watched Rio’s dad’s terrible magic tricks with a straight face before finally laughing, had indulged in Gabi’s teasing with a roll of her eyes but a small, fond smile. And when the time had come for presents, she had watched Nicky’s excitement with something in her expression that Rio didn’t quite have words for.</p><p>She had seen it, though.</p><p>The way Agatha wanted this.</p><p>Maybe she wasn’t fully there yet, maybe there were still things she had to work through—but Rio knew Agatha wanted this, wanted <em> them </em>.</p><p>
  <em> And fuck, that felt good. </em>
</p><p>She reached out, letting her hand find Agatha’s where it rested on her thigh, threading their fingers together without looking away from the road. Agatha glanced over, arching a brow, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she gave Rio’s hand a small squeeze, her thumb brushing lightly over her knuckles.</p><p>Rio smiled.</p><p>She didn’t need to say it. Not yet.</p><p>But this—this was home.</p><p>~*~</p><p>By the time they reached Agatha’s house, the familiar skyline of Chicago glittered against the night sky. The warmth of the car made the winter air outside feel sharper as they opened the doors.</p><p>Nicky, who had been half-dozing for the last stretch of the drive, perked up as soon as Rio unlocked the car doors. He yawned, stretching his arms above his head, then blinked up at them with a lopsided smile. “We home?”</p><p>Agatha turned in her seat, brushing a strand of hair from his face. “We are.”</p><p>“Finally,” Rio teased, undoing her seatbelt and stepping out. “I was starting to think you were gonna knock out completely back there.”</p><p>“I wasn’t sleeping,” Nicky insisted, though the slight rasp in his voice suggested otherwise.</p><p>Rio smirked as she pulled their bags from the trunk. “Sure, bud. Whatever you say.”</p><p>The house was just as they’d left it—warm, dimly lit, carrying the faintest trace of Agatha’s perfume in the air. Nicky kicked off his shoes without bothering to line them up properly, already shrugging off his coat as he turned to his mom.</p><p>“Can we play my new video games now?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled as she hung up her own coat. “You don’t even want a break first?”</p><p>Nicky shook his head, clearly determined.</p><p>Rio snorted, tossing her own coat over a chair. “You’ve been gone for two days, and the first thing you wanna do is whoop our asses in Mario Kart?”</p><p>Nicky grinned. “Uh-huh.”</p><p>Agatha sighed in mock defeat, ruffling his curls. “Fine. But I want at least five minutes to settle in.”</p><p>“Five minutes,” Nicky agreed, though the way he bounced on his feet made it clear he’d be counting every second.</p><p>Rio smirked, following Agatha into the kitchen while Nicky rushed to set up the game console. The moment they were out of earshot, she leaned against the counter, watching as Agatha poured herself a glass of water.</p><p>“You think if we let him win, he’ll tire himself out faster?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, sipping her water. “He’ll know. And he’ll never let us live it down.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Alright, then. No mercy.”</p><p>They played for hours, the house filled with the sounds of frantic button-mashing and Nicky’s triumphant cheers every time he managed to pull ahead. Despite her best efforts, Rio couldn’t quite keep up—Nicky had clearly spent too much time honing his skills, and Agatha, despite her protests, was more competitive than she let on.</p><p>Eventually, though, exhaustion won out. One minute, Nicky was upright, determined to play just one more round, and the next, he was slumped against Agatha’s side, his head resting against her arm as his breathing slowed.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Guess that’s game over.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, brushing a hand through his curls. “Looks like it.”</p><p>Rio stretched, rolling her shoulders. “Want me to take him?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I’ve got him.” She shifted carefully, gathering him in her arms, and Rio couldn’t help but watch as she carried him toward his room.</p><p>She followed, lingering in the doorway as Agatha tucked Nicky in. He stirred slightly when she adjusted his blankets, mumbling something under his breath before settling again. Agatha ran her fingers through his hair, a quiet, affectionate gesture that made Rio’s chest feel warm.</p><p>By the time they returned to the living room, the adrenaline from the game had faded into something quieter, more comfortable.</p><p>Rio flopped onto the couch, stretching her legs out. “So, what’s the plan for New Year’s?”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow as she sat beside her. “Are you asking if I have plans or if I want plans?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Both.”</p><p>Agatha considered this for a moment, then shook her head. “No plans yet.”</p><p>Rio hummed, pretending to think. “Maybe we could do something small. Just us. Some friends. Maybe some good food, good wine, and absolutely no Mario Kart.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Afraid of losing again?”</p><p>Rio gasped, placing a hand over her chest in mock offense. “I let you win.”</p><p>“<em> Right </em>,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>Rio grinned, nudging her knee. “Seriously, though. What do you think?”</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the couch, considering. “That sounds nice. So what, you’re suggesting… a party?”</p><p>Rio snorted. “God, no. I meant something small. Close friends. Alice and Jen, Wanda and Viz and the kids… maybe Lilia, if she doesn’t already have plans.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, considering. “That could work.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “You sure? I don’t want to drag you into something if you’re not feeling up for it.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look—one of those quiet, steady ones that always made Rio feel like she was being read a little too easily. “I’m sure.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Alright, then. Small gathering, good food, good wine, and maybe Mario Kart.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Maybe.”</p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, letting her fingers trail up Agatha’s arm. “You know, for someone who pretends to be above it all, you get really competitive.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, but there was a flicker of amusement in her eyes. “<em> I do not </em>.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shifting closer. “You absolutely do. I saw how you nearly threw your controller earlier.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she let out a quiet sigh, her body relaxing into the couch. “Fine. Maybe I slightly enjoy winning.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Uh-huh. And who was it that swore revenge when Nicky beat her last week?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a pointed look. “You’re very smug right now.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I’m always smug.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And yet, here you are, dating me.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, but Rio could see the small smile forming at the corner of her lips. “Unfortunately.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>A few days later, the firehouse was winding down from the overnight shift, and Rio was running on fumes. She sat on the worn-out couch in the common area, legs stretched out, her body aching from the past twelve hours. Across from her, Alice scrolled through her phone while Will stood by the counter, sipping coffee.</p><p>“So, Agatha’s house, eight o’clock?” Will confirmed, glancing over his mug.</p><p>Rio nodded, rubbing a hand over her face. “Yeah, she’s got most of the food covered, but we should probably grab extra drinks.”</p><p>“Already on it,” Will said. “Eddie’s picking up wine, and I’ll grab beer and whatever Alice decides she wants to regret tomorrow.”</p><p>Alice flipped him off without looking up. “I have refined taste, thank you.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Yeah, real refined. Just wait—Alice will show up an hour late like she always does and then pretend it was intentional.”</p><p>Will raised an eyebrow. “She does that?”</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Rio said, stretching. “She calls it ‘making an entrance.’”</p><p>Alice looked up with a smug grin. “And it works every time.”</p><p>Will chuckled. “Guess I’ll see it in action.”</p><p>“You’ll see a lot in action tonight,” Rio chuckled, standing up and grabbing her bag. “Anyway, I’m heading straight to Agatha’s. Gotta pretend to be useful before passing out for a few hours.”</p><p>Will smirked. “Tell her we’ll be on time.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “You mean I’ll be on time, and Alice will—”</p><p>“Make an entrance,” Alice cut in. “You’re welcome in advance.”</p><p>Shaking her head, Rio gave them a lazy wave and stepped outside. The cold bit through her clothes, but at least it kept her awake on the drive over. By the time she reached Agatha’s house, her limbs felt heavier, and the idea of crashing in Agatha’s bed for a few hours sounded a lot better than any party.</p><p>She parked and unlocked the door before pushing it open.</p><p>Inside, the house was already half-prepped for the night—decorations stacked on the dining table, a to-do list scribbled out beside them. The smell of fresh coffee and something sweet lingered in the air.</p><p>And then there was Agatha, standing in the kitchen in an oversized sweater, her hair slightly mussed from sleep. She glanced up from whatever she was writing, a knowing smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>“You look terrible.”</p><p>Rio groaned, dropping her bag by the door. “Flatter me some more, why don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, setting her pen down. “Come here.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She crossed the room, and the second Agatha wrapped her arms around her, she melted into the warmth. Exhaustion pressed heavier against her, but she didn’t care.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to her temple. “Coffee’s fresh. I made cinnamon rolls.”</p><p>Rio hummed against her shoulder. “You’re spoiling me.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Go eat, then sleep. I need you functional for tonight.”</p><p>Rio smirked, pulling back just enough to look at her. “Define functional.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but kissed her anyway. “Go.”</p><p>With a dramatic sigh, Rio pulled away, heading toward the kitchen. “You’re so bossy.”</p><p>“You love it,” Agatha called after her.</p><p>And, well—yeah. She really did.</p><p>~*~</p><p>A few hours of sleep made all the difference. When Rio finally surfaced, it was mid-afternoon, and Agatha’s house had shifted into full prep mode. The scent of something rich and savory filled the air, and as Rio wandered into the kitchen, she found Agatha at the stove, sleeves rolled up, moving with effortless precision.</p><p>“Morning—” Rio paused, then corrected herself with a smirk. “Afternoon.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over her shoulder, arching an amused brow. “Good nap?”</p><p>Rio stretched, feeling the lingering heaviness of sleep in her limbs. “Mm, needed it. You let me sleep.”</p><p>“You looked like you were about to drop,” Agatha said simply, returning her focus to the pan in front of her. “Besides, you won’t be much help if you’re half-conscious.”</p><p>Rio grinned, stepping closer and wrapping her arms loosely around Agatha’s waist from behind. “Bold of you to assume I’d be much help either way.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Fair point.”</p><p>Rio pressed a kiss to the back of her shoulder before peeking over it. “What’s cooking?”</p><p>“Short ribs,” Agatha replied, tilting her head slightly so Rio could see. “Figured we needed something substantial before the champagne starts flowing.”</p><p>Rio let out an appreciative whistle. “You really are trying to impress me, huh?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, finally turning to face her. “It’s been nearly two months, Rio. I think I’ve already won you over.”</p><p>Rio hummed, brushing a teasing kiss against her jaw. “Debatable.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look but didn’t pull away. “Mm-hmm. If you want to stay on my good side, you can help finish setting up.”</p><p>Rio saluted. “Yes, ma’am.” She glanced toward the living room, where a few bags of decorations were still untouched. “Where’s Nicky?”</p><p>“Upstairs,” Agatha said. “He wanted to pick out what to wear for tonight.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Kid’s got priorities.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head fondly. “He’s excited.”</p><p>Rio felt a warmth settle in her chest at that. She liked that Nicky was part of this—part of them.</p><p>She grabbed a bag of decorations and slung it over her shoulder. “Alright, where do you want these?”</p><p>Agatha nudged her toward the living room. “Anywhere that doesn’t involve you climbing on furniture. I’d like to keep my paramedic in one piece.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “No promises.”</p><p>Agatha just sighed, shaking her head as she turned back to the stove.</p><p>As Rio started untangling a string of lights, she couldn’t help but think—yeah, this was exactly where she wanted to be as the year came to a close.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>As Rio set to work on the decorations, she could hear Agatha moving around the kitchen, the occasional clatter of utensils and the rich aroma of the short ribs filling the house. The warmth of it all—the food, the soft hum of jazz playing from the speaker, the quiet comfort of knowing they were spending this night together—settled deep in her chest.</p><p>She unraveled a particularly tangled string of lights, muttering under her breath, when footsteps sounded on the stairs.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Nicky came bounding down, a bundle of energy as always, his dark curls slightly damp from a recent shower. He was wearing a button-down shirt, still untucked, with socks that were clearly a mismatched pair—one with tiny sharks, the other a bold, glittery silver.</p><p>Rio grinned, setting the lights aside just in time to catch him as he launched himself at her. “Whoa, kiddo, you trying to knock me out before the party even starts?”</p><p>Nicky giggled but didn’t let go. “Mom said you were sleeping.”</p><p>Rio ruffled his curls. “Yeah, I crashed for a bit. Long shift.”</p><p>He pulled back just enough to peer up at her. “Did you have any emergencies?”</p><p>She hesitated, debating how much detail to give, then settled on a lighthearted approach. “A couple. Nothing too wild. No aliens, no zombies, no superheroes in distress.”</p><p>Nicky huffed. “<em> Boring </em>.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Tell me about it.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice carried from the kitchen. “Nicky, did you pick out shoes?”</p><p>Nicky groaned, dramatically dragging his feet toward the stairs again. “They’re just gonna get stepped on anyway…”</p><p>As Nicky disappeared back upstairs, Rio returned to her decorating. The living room was already half set up—Agatha had gone for a mix of elegant and fun, with gold and silver accents, fairy lights strung along the fireplace, and a few festive touches on the bookshelves.</p><p>“So, who is coming tonight?” Rio asked, pulling a small step stool over to reach a high corner.</p><p>Agatha turned off the stove before answering. “Wanda and Viz and the kids, obviously. Alice and Jen. Will and his boyfriend—”</p><p>“First New Year’s with Will,” Rio noted with a grin. “I bet he’s excited. No third-wheeling tonight.”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft laugh, leaning against the counter. “And your family will be calling?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah, probably after midnight. You know how my mom gets—she’ll want to make sure I’m eating, staying warm, making good decisions.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Should I tell her you climbed onto the furniture against my orders?”</p><p>Rio gasped, pressing a hand to her chest. “You wouldn’t.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Wouldn’t I?”</p><p>They held each other’s gaze for a beat before Rio gave in, climbing off the stool with exaggerated care. “Fine. I’ll behave. For now.”</p><p>Agatha looked pleased with herself, but before she could say anything, Rio strode over and stole a quick kiss, just to keep her on her toes.</p><p>“Go finish your fancy cooking, Professor,” Rio teased.</p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head but unable to hide the small smile on her lips as she turned back to the stove.</p><p>Rio watched her for a moment before getting back to work, feeling something warm and steady settle deep in her bones.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The party was in full swing, the house filled with warmth, laughter, and the soft hum of music playing in the background. Rio had long since settled into the night, the exhaustion from her shift melting away as she enjoyed the company of her friends. She moved easily through the space, checking in on Alice and Jen, making sure Will and his boyfriend had drinks, and stealing glances at Agatha whenever she could.</p><p>At some point, she found herself next to Wanda near the fireplace, both of them watching the party unfold. Agatha was across the room, deep in conversation with Lilia, her expression animated as she gestured with her wine glass. It was a sight Rio had grown to love—Agatha in her element, comfortable and at ease.</p><p>Wanda nudged her lightly. “You’ve got it bad,” she teased, smirking.</p><p>Rio didn’t even bother denying it. “Yeah,” she admitted, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I do.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled, swirling the wine in her glass. “I’m happy for you both, Rio. Really. It’s just…” She hesitated, glancing around before lowering her voice. “You know how risky this is, right?”</p><p>Rio’s expression sobered slightly, and she met Wanda’s gaze head-on. “I know,” she said. “Believe me, we’ve talked about it.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And we’re being careful,” Rio assured her. “It’s not like we’re reckless. I know she’s my professor. I know she’s my mentor. But this—” she gestured between herself and Agatha, “—it’s real, Wanda. We’re in love. She gave me a key to her house for Christmas.”</p><p>Wanda’s brows lifted slightly, but there was no surprise in her eyes—just understanding. “I figured you were serious. But love doesn’t stop the fact that if the wrong person finds out, Agatha could lose everything. You both could.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. She knew that. It was something they had both been hyper-aware of since the beginning. “You don’t think I worry about that?” she asked, her voice quiet but firm. “Every time I walk into Northwestern, I have to remind myself to keep my distance. Every time we’re in her class, I have to make sure I don’t look at her the way I want to.”</p><p>Wanda studied her for a long moment before sighing. “I get it. And I trust you—I do. I just don’t want to see either of you get hurt.”</p><p>Rio softened, nudging Wanda’s shoulder. “We’re in too deep to walk away from this now. And honestly? I don’t want to.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a long look before finally offering a small, approving nod. “Alright. Just promise me you’ll keep your guard up.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Always.”</p><p>Before Wanda could respond, a warm hand slipped around Rio’s wrist, and she turned to see Agatha beside her, a knowing look in her eyes.</p><p>“Stealing my girlfriend, Wanda?” Agatha teased, her voice light but affectionate.</p><p>Wanda held up her hands in mock innocence. “Just making sure she doesn’t break your heart, professor.”</p><p>Agatha arched an amused brow, but before she could respond, Rio wrapped an arm around her waist and pressed a quick kiss to her temple. Then turned back to Wanda. “You worry too much.”</p><p>Wanda snorted. “Someone has to.”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head, but Rio felt the way her fingers brushed lightly against the small of her back—subtle, reassuring. And as the party continued around them, Rio knew, despite the risks, that they were exactly where they were meant to be.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As the night stretched toward midnight, the house buzzed with laughter, music, and the warmth of people who felt like home.</p><p>Rio stood in the kitchen with Agatha, their bodies close in the way they always seemed to be now. Agatha had one arm resting against the counter, the other hooked lightly around Rio’s waist, fingers idly playing with the hem of her shirt. It was effortless. Easy. The kind of closeness that no longer required permission.</p><p>From where they stood, Rio could see the rest of the party unfolding in the living room. Alice and Jen were curled up on the couch, Alice half in Jen’s lap as they watched Will and his boyfriend dance dramatically to whatever pop song was playing. Lilia and Wanda stood off to the side, drinks in hand, watching the scene with a mix of amusement and fondness.</p><p>Billy and Tommy were in the middle of an increasingly chaotic game that involved jumping over pillows and yelling about points, while Nicky—still full of energy despite the late hour—ran around them, egging them on. He’d barely stopped moving all night, bouncing between the twins, Rio, and Agatha like an excited pinball.</p><p>Agatha traced a slow circle against Rio’s back. “You’re holding up well for someone who just got off a shift.”</p><p>Rio exhaled a quiet chuckle, shifting closer. “You’re a good distraction.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, lips curving slightly. “I try.”</p><p>Before Rio could tease her, Alice’s voice rang through the house.</p><p>“Alright, everyone, grab your drinks! It’s almost midnight!”</p><p>There was a flurry of movement as people reached for their glasses. Rio grabbed a beer, while Agatha lifted her wine. The countdown started, voices rising together.</p><p><em>Ten</em>.</p><p>Billy and Tommy abandoned their game, scrambling over to Wanda and Viz.</p><p><em>Nine</em>.</p><p>Will draped an arm over his boyfriend’s shoulders, both of them grinning.</p><p><em>Eight</em>.</p><p>Nicky skidded to a stop, wide-eyed with excitement. “It’s time!”</p><p><em>Seven</em>.</p><p>Rio turned toward Agatha, heart already picking up its pace.</p><p><em>Six</em>.</p><p>Agatha mirrored her, their bodies now fully pressed together.</p><p><em>Five</em>.</p><p><em>Four</em>.</p><p>Rio’s hand found Agatha’s waist.</p><p><em>Three</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers brushed against her jaw, featherlight but sure.</p><p><em>Two</em>.</p><p>Agatha leaned in first.</p><p><em>One</em>.</p><p>Their lips met at midnight.</p><p>It wasn’t rushed or hurried—it was steady, certain, grounding in a way that settled something deep between them. Rio’s hand slid up, fingers tangling in the hair at Agatha’s nape, and Agatha let herself sink into it too.</p><p>And then—</p><p>A blur of energy crashed into them.</p><p>Nicky, full-speed, barreled into their legs, wrapping his arms around both of them in a tight, breathless hug. “Happy New Year!” he shouted, practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p>Rio and Agatha broke apart, startled into laughter. Agatha ruffled Nicky’s curls, her face full of affection. “Happy New Year, sweetheart.”</p><p>Around them, the house erupted into cheers. Billy and Tommy were yelling their own excited Happy New Years, Alice and Jen kissed, and Will dramatically dipped his boyfriend, making everyone laugh.</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha, her heart still racing from the kiss, from the way Agatha was looking at her—like she was everything.</p><p>Agatha leaned in again, softer this time, her lips brushing just below Rio’s ear. “I love you,” she murmured, quiet but sure.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, her fingers tightening against Agatha’s waist. But there was no hesitation, no doubt.</p><p>She turned, catching Agatha’s gaze, letting it sink in before she whispered back, “I love you too.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, and when Rio kissed her again—Nicky still latched onto them, still grinning wildly—she knew this was it.</p><p>This was home.</p><p>This was everything.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The morning light filtered softly through the curtains, casting a golden hue over the bedroom. Rio stirred, feeling the warmth of the bed and the faint scent of Agatha’s perfume lingering in the sheets. She blinked herself awake, momentarily disoriented before the realization settled in—Agatha’s house. Morning.</p><p>A slow, satisfied smile curled at her lips. She turned her head slightly, catching sight of Agatha still asleep beside her, hair tousled, face relaxed in a way Rio rarely got to see. For a moment, she considered staying in bed, lingering in the comfort of this stolen time, but then Agatha shifted, exhaling a sleepy sigh before blinking open her eyes.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha murmured, voice rough with sleep.</p><p>Rio grinned. “Can you blame me?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was no real exasperation there. “What time is it?”</p><p>Rio glanced at the clock. “A little past six.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, pressing her face back into the pillow. “Why did I agree to an early meeting today?”</p><p>“Because you’re a dedicated professor,” Rio teased. “And because if you’re late, Lilia will personally come find you.”</p><p>Agatha let out a muffled noise of protest but forced herself upright. She stretched, running a hand through her hair, before turning to Rio. “You have class at nine, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, but I can take my time. I don’t have to be there too early.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look, thoughtful. “I was going to take Nicky to school, but if you don’t mind, he’d probably love a ride from you.”</p><p>Rio perked up. “Oh, yeah? You’re trusting me with school drop-off duty again?”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “I trusted you with my life in an ambulance. I think you can handle a school run.”</p><p>“Fair enough.” Rio stretched before slipping out of bed. “Alright, I’ll take him. That means you can focus on your meeting, and I get to bribe your kid with snacks. Win-win.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a knowing look. “No bribing. And no letting him talk you into stopping for donuts.”</p><p>Rio feigned offense. “I would never.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a flat look, clearly unconvinced.</p><p>Rio just grinned and headed for the shower.</p><p>By the time they were both dressed and moving through the house, the morning had settled into an easy rhythm. Agatha sipped her coffee while packing the last of Nicky’s things, and Rio helped by stealing pieces of bacon from Nicky’s plate, much to his outrage.</p><p>“Hey!” Nicky frowned, clutching his plate protectively. “That’s mine.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “You snooze, you lose, kid.”</p><p>Nicky narrowed his eyes but quickly laughed and shifted gears when Agatha reminded him to grab his backpack. By the time they were ready, Agatha kissed Nicky’s forehead, gave Rio a quick peck on the cheek, and headed out first, leaving Rio and Nicky to take off in her car.</p><p>As they pulled out of the driveway, the radio hummed softly in the background. Nicky was quiet for a moment, but Rio could feel him looking at her.</p><p>She glanced at him briefly. “What?”</p><p>Nicky hesitated, then tilted his head. “So… what are your intentions?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “My what now?”</p><p>Nicky crossed his arms, his expression serious. “With my mom.”</p><p>Rio barely suppressed a laugh. “Damn, kid. That’s a loaded question for eight in the morning.”</p><p>“I’m serious,” Nicky insisted. “I just—I need to know if you really like her.”</p><p>Rio softened. She took a second before answering, her grip firm but relaxed on the steering wheel. “I really like her, Nicky.” Then, because it was the truth, she added, “I love her.”</p><p>Nicky studied her for a long moment. “Like… for real?”</p><p>“For real.”</p><p>He nodded, thoughtful. “So… does that mean you’re gonna be around for a long time?”</p><p>Rio considered that. “I hope so. That’s the plan.”</p><p>Nicky let out a little hmm, as if weighing her words. Then, after another beat of silence, he finally nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. “Okay?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Nicky said, a little more relaxed now. “I mean, I figured you were serious, but I had to ask, you know? I’m not just gonna let anyone date my mom.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Good to know you’re keeping an eye on things.”</p><p>“I am.” Nicky leaned back in his seat, finally seeming satisfied. Then, as if the serious moment had never happened, he perked up. “Sooo… can we stop for donuts?”</p><p>Rio burst out laughing. “Damn, you’re smooth.”</p><p>“I learned from the best,” Nicky said smugly.</p><p>Rio shook her head, already making the turn toward the donut shop. “Alright, kid. But if your mom asks, we ate fruit for breakfast.”</p><p>Nicky grinned. “Deal.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio leaned against the wall outside the lecture hall, her fingers lazily scrolling through her phone as she waited for Agatha to arrive. She’d gotten there a little too early and the lecture hall was still closed. It was their first Neurology II class today, and they were in a different room than they used to be in the previous semester.</p><p>The sound of heels clicking against the tile pulled her attention up, and sure enough, Agatha was making her way down the hall, keys dangling from her fingers, looking effortlessly put together as always. The sight of her still made something in Rio’s chest tighten, even now, two months in.</p><p>Agatha spotted her and slowed, a small smile pulling at the corner of her lips. “Lurking outside my classroom, hm?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Just making sure my favorite professor has a strong start to her day.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, stopping in front of her. “Flattery this early? What do you want?”</p><p>“Maybe just a kiss,” Rio murmured, keeping her voice low as a few students walked past them.</p><p>Agatha huffed, shaking her head. “You are impossible.”</p><p>“And yet you love me,” Rio countered in a whisper, flashing her a grin, as Agatha unlocked the door to the lecture hall.</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes, but her expression softened. “Get to class, Vidal.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>Rio gave her a playful salute before slipping into the lecture hall, taking a seat toward the back. A few minutes later, Agatha started class, and Rio let herself fall into the familiar rhythm of taking notes, watching the way Agatha moved through the material with ease.</p><p>The day passed in a blur after that— a quick lunch with Alice, then another lecture. It wasn’t until she was on her break that she realized Agatha hadn’t responded to her last text.</p><p>Or the one before that.</p><p>Or the one before that.</p><p>Rio frowned, unlocking her phone again and tapping out a quick ‘<em> You good? </em>’ before setting it aside.</p><p>No response.</p><p>An hour later, she tried again.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>A flicker of unease settled in her stomach. Agatha wasn’t the type to ignore her messages for hours, especially without a heads-up.</p><p>Finally, she texted Wanda.</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio </b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em> Hey, have you talked to Agatha today? She’s not answering her phone. </em>
</p><p><b>Wanda</b> </p><p>
  <em> Not since this morning. Why? </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio </b>
</p><p align="right">

  <em> No, I’ll go wait for her at her place. Let me know if you hear from her. </em>
</p><p>By the time Rio pulled up to Agatha’s house, the sun was already dipping below the horizon. She let herself in with the key Agatha had given her for Christmas, tossing her bag onto the couch before pacing the length of the living room.</p><p>She tried calling this time. It went to voicemail.</p><p>Another twenty minutes passed. Then thirty.</p><p>Just as she was starting to really worry, her phone buzzed.</p><p><b>Agatha</b> </p><p>
  <em> Sorry, got caught up in something. On my way home now. </em>
</p><p>Rio exhaled, some of the tension in her chest easing. But not all of it.</p><p align="right"><b>Rio</b> </p><p align="right">
  <em> Everything okay? </em>
</p><p align="left"><b>Agatha</b> </p><p>
  <em> Yeah. I’ll be home soon. </em>
</p><p>Rio stared at the screen for a second before shoving her phone in her pocket. Something didn’t sit right, but at least Agatha was finally responding.</p><p>Now she just had to wait.</p><p>
  <br />

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The morning light filtered through the curtains, soft and golden, coaxing Agatha awake. For a moment, she just lay there, savoring the quiet and warmth of the bed. It was still early, and Rio was beside her, her presence a steady, comforting weight. Agatha turned her head, watching as Rio shifted slightly, blinking herself awake. She caught her gaze, and the corners of Rio’s lips tugged into a sleepy smile.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile back. “You’re staring,” she muttered, her voice thick with sleep.</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “Can you blame me?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes but didn’t push the teasing. Instead, she stretched, her muscles protesting from the long hours of work. “What time is it?” she asked, more out of habit than necessity.</p><p>Rio glanced at the clock. “A little past six.”</p><p>“Six? Why did I agree to an early meeting today?” Agatha groaned, burying her face back in the pillow.</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. “Because you’re a dedicated professor. And because Lilia will personally track you down if you’re late.”</p><p>Agatha let out a muffled sound of agreement but finally pushed herself up, running a hand through her tousled hair. She sighed as she straightened up, the pull of sleep still lingering. She glanced at Rio. “You have class at nine, right?”</p><p>Rio nodded, stretching lazily. “Yeah, but I don’t have to rush. I can take my time.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a moment, thinking about the school run. “I was going to take Nicky to school… but if you don’t mind, he’d probably love a ride from you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up at the suggestion. “Oh, yeah? You‘re trusting me with school drop-off duty again?” she teased, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Agatha gave her a pointed look, the smallest smirk tugging at her lips. “I trusted you with my life in an ambulance. I think you can handle a school run.”</p><p>Rio feigned offense, dramatically placing a hand over her chest. “Fair enough. I’ll take him. Means you can focus on your meeting, and I get to bribe your kid with snacks. Win-win.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “No bribing. And definitely no donuts.” She shot Rio a playful glare, though she couldn’t keep the amusement out of her voice.</p><p>Rio chuckled, her grin never faltering. “I would never.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a skeptical look, but by the time she finished getting dressed, the house had settled into its usual morning rhythm. Rio poured herself a cup of coffee, and Nicky sat at the table, looking entirely too energetic for the hour. Agatha gathered Nicky’s things, slipping into the routine they’d established. Rio, of course, stole bites of Nicky’s bacon, earning a playful scowl from her son.</p><p>“Hey! That’s mine!” Nicky protested, clutching his plate.</p><p>Rio just smirked. “You snooze, you lose, kid.”</p><p>Nicky shot her a glare, but then, like most eight-year-olds, was distracted by Agatha reminding him to grab his backpack. Agatha kissed his forehead and gave Rio a quick, affectionate peck on the cheek before heading out the door. “You two have a good morning drive safe,” she called as she left.</p><p>The drive to her department meeting was a blur, and Agatha was grateful for the time alone. She needed a few moments to herself before the day kicked into full gear. By the time she arrived, the day’s grind was already well underway, filled with meetings, papers to review, and the small but necessary bustle of academia. She checked her watch again. Class was in just a couple of hours.</p><p>Her first Neuro II lecture was always a bit of a challenge—students were excited, nervous, and some were always insufferable know-it-alls, thinking they were seasoned neurologists just because they did a semester with her. </p><p>But today, with Rio sitting somewhere in the lecture hall, after their amazing holiday season and everything they’d shared, things felt… different. </p><p>Finding her waiting for her by the door had been enough to give her that warm feeling in her chest she’d learned to associate with Rio. The woman she loved so completely.</p><p>From Agatha’s viewpoint, the sight of Rio was both amusing and endearing. There, with her phone in hand and a mischievous glint in her eyes, Rio seemed to be biding her time, even though she’d arrived a bit early. Agatha couldn’t help but smile at the thought—of how, even after two months, Rio’s playful presence still managed to soften the sharp edges of her busy world.</p><p>Agatha unlocked the door and set her materials on the desk, her mind flicking back to the playful, easy conversation with Rio earlier. She’d asked her to take Nicky to school without thinking too much about it, and now, watching Rio walk into the room, a part of her still felt the rush of warmth that came from knowing how close they were. She caught Rio’s smirk as she entered, her gaze meeting Agatha’s before Rio casually slid into a seat at the back.</p><p>Agatha’s heart gave a little jolt, but she kept her professional face on as she turned to face the class, pushing away the flutter of nerves. “Good morning, everyone,” she began, voice steady. “Welcome to Neurology II. I hope you’re ready to dive even further into the complexities of the human brain.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>The door to Agatha’s office clicked open with a sharpness that made her look up from her papers. Jordan stood there, leaning casually against the doorframe, his expression knowing, like a cat who had just cornered its prey.</p><p>“Can I help you, Mr. Jordan?” Agatha asked, her voice smooth, though inside, her heart was already picking up speed. There was something off about this.</p><p>He stepped inside without waiting for an invitation, his shoes tapping against the floor as he made his way to the center of the room. “I think you already know why I’m here.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tightened, but she didn’t flinch. “I don’t think I do.”</p><p>Jordan smirked, his eyes glinting with malice. “Oh, you will. I know about you and Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse quickened at the mention of Rio’s name, but she masked her surprise quickly. “And what exactly do you know?” she asked, keeping her tone even, trying not to betray any reaction.</p><p>Jordan crossed his arms, a smug grin spreading across his face. “I know everything. I have photos. The texts. All of it. And I’ve got it all right here.” He reached into his jacket pocket, pulling out a phone with a flourish.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked to the device, her mind racing. She fought to keep her expression neutral, refusing to show any sign of panic. “Is that so? Let me see it then.”</p><p>Jordan raised an eyebrow, clearly not expecting that response. “What?”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, meeting his gaze head-on. “You say you have proof. Let me see it. If you think you can intimidate me with pictures and messages, you’re wasting your time.”</p><p>Jordan’s smug smile faltered, but only for a moment before he recovered. “You think I’m bluffing?”</p><p>“I think you’re trying to manipulate me,” Agatha said coolly, “and I’m not the kind of person who folds under threats. If you’re serious, show me what you’ve got.”</p><p>For a long moment, Jordan didn’t move. Agatha could see the wheels turning behind his eyes, trying to figure out if she was bluffing, too. But in the end, he smirked again, this time with a little more hesitation. “Fine. You want to play it that way?”</p><p>He held out the phone, tapping a few buttons before turning it toward her. Agatha’s eyes scanned the screen, seeing exactly what he’d described: pictures of her and Rio, moments from their time together that she hadn’t even realized had been captured. The messages, too—texts they had exchanged, things that could easily be misconstrued.</p><p>She didn’t flinch, though. Her gaze remained steady on him as she processed the images. “These aren’t going to change anything, Jordan. You’re still wasting my time.”</p><p>Jordan’s grin returned, but it was sharper now. “Not if I take this to Dr. Calderu, Harkness. I’m sure she’d love to hear about this little ‘sordid affair’ you’ve been having with one of your students. And if you think she won’t make things difficult for you… well, you’re sadly mistaken.”</p><p>Agatha’s blood ran cold at the mention of Lilia. She knew exactly what he meant, and the thought of it made her stomach twist. Lilia was a good friend, but also the head of the department—she’d have to consider the politics and the optics of the situation.</p><p>Still, Agatha wasn’t ready to back down. “You think you can just walk in here and demand whatever you want?” Her voice dropped, low and dangerous. “You’re playing a dangerous game, Jordan.”</p><p>Jordan took a step closer, and for a moment, Agatha almost felt a flicker of doubt. But she steadied herself. She had to be careful. She couldn’t let him see how rattled she was. She couldn’t afford to make the situation worse. </p><p>“What's your angle? What exactly do you want here?”</p><p>“Everything,” he said, his tone casual, but with an edge. “Mentorship. The OR spot for the neurosurgery. And if you don’t give them to me, I’ll make sure this ends up on Calderu’s desk. And trust me, she won’t be pleased to know what her star professor has been up to.”</p><p>Agatha stared him down, feeling the weight of the situation pressing down on her. She had two choices—comply, or fight back. The truth was, though, neither option felt good. She couldn’t risk this coming out. Not now. Not when things with Rio were so good.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t going to back down. Not this easily.</p><p>“I’m not giving you what you want,” she said, her voice steady now, full of conviction. “You want to go to Dr. Calderu? Fine. But know this—if you try to drag my personal life into this, I’ll make sure everyone knows exactly what you’ve been doing behind the scenes.”</p><p>Jordan’s smile faltered for the briefest moment, and for the first time, Agatha could see the doubt in his eyes. But he didn’t back off. He just nodded, eyes cold.</p><p>“I’ll be back. And you’d better remember who has the power here, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha stood as he turned to leave, her heart hammering in her chest. She couldn’t let him think he’d won. She’d figure out a way to handle this. But she wouldn’t tell Rio. Not yet. Rio had enough to deal with—Agatha would protect her from this. Somehow.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walked swiftly down the hallway toward Lilia’s office, her mind racing with the threat Jordan had made. She barely looked at Lilia’s assistant on her way in. Her hand hovered over the door handle before she opened it, walking in without the usual knock. </p><p>Lilia was seated at her desk, papers spread out in front of her. When she saw Agatha’s tense posture, she put down her pen and leaned back in her chair.</p><p>“Agatha,” Lilia said, her voice neutral but laced with concern. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t waste any time. She paced to the front of the desk and spoke quickly, the words tumbling out. “Thomas Jordan came to me today. He’s blackmailing me. He knows about Rio and me. He said he has photos of us—private moments, and screenshots of our texts.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes narrowed. She’d been expecting something like this, but hearing it aloud made her pulse quicken. “Do you know what else he has?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. “I don’t know. He didn’t say. But I… I saw the photos. He has proof. He’s been following us. There are photos of us together, kissing, hugging… God, Lilia, he has everything.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze softened for a moment, but it was quickly replaced by a hard edge. “And what does he want?”</p><p>“He wants the mentorship I denied him. And he wants a spot in the OR. He’s threatened to come to you… and report everything if I don’t give him what he wants.”</p><p>Lilia didn’t flinch, but Agatha could tell that her words hit their mark. “And have you confronted him about the photos? The texts?”</p><p>Agatha clenched her fists, frustration and fear mixing. “I don’t want to give him the satisfaction. I’m not going to let him see me sweat. But… I have to do something.”</p><p>Lilia leaned forward, steepling her fingers in front of her. “This is a serious situation, Agatha. If he has proof and he’s threatening to go public, this could ruin both of you. Not to mention it’s illegal, what he’s doing.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied, voice tight. “I thought about going to the police, but it’s not just the photos… He could use the texts. He’s got leverage. He’s going to spin this however he wants, and I can’t afford that. Not with Rio.”</p><p>Lilia exhaled, her expression hardening as she processed the gravity of the situation. “You’ve been with Rio long enough for me to know you care about her. This isn’t just about your job—it’s about protecting her, too. But the longer you keep this from her, the harder it will be for both of you when it comes to light.”</p><p>Agatha shifted uncomfortably but met Lilia’s gaze. “I’m trying to protect her. She doesn’t need to be dragged into this. I don’t want her to know. Not yet.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes softened, but only briefly. “I understand wanting to protect her, but you’re already walking a thin line. If this gets out, you won’t be able to shield her from the fallout. And I’m not sure how much longer I can look the other way, Agatha, especially if this escalates.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes briefly, biting back the wave of anxiety that threatened to overwhelm her. “I’m not asking for special treatment. I’m just… asking for time. I’ll handle this on my own, but I need to keep this quiet for as long as possible.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze didn’t waver. “You’ve been honest with me so far, and I appreciate that. But if anyone files a formal complaint… or if there’s any indication that you’ve been taking this lightly, I’ll have no choice but to act. I can’t protect you forever if you don’t take the necessary steps to protect yourself—and Rio.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, but she nodded. “I get it. I’ll talk to a lawyer. I’ll figure this out.”</p><p>Lilia exhaled, the weight of her role as Chair of Medicine settling into her tone. “Good. I’ll be here for you, Agatha. But don’t underestimate the gravity of this. You can’t avoid it forever.”</p><p>Agatha nodded again, her mind already reeling with the next steps. But before she left, she turned to Lilia one last time. “Thank you… for not making this harder.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze softened just a touch, her voice quiet but resolute. “I’m doing what I can. Just don’t forget—time is not on your side.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once more and walked out of the office, her heart heavy with the knowledge that things were about to get much more complicated.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Not even an hour later, Agatha was on her way to her lawyer’s office. Her phone buzzed as she drove and she saw a text notification from Rio.</p><p>
  <strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Hey beautiful! I was thinking maybe we could get some Thai food tonight? Does Nicky like it?</em>
</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, telling herself that she would just sort this out and get back to Rio. Everything would be fine. It had to be.</p><p>A few minutes later, Agatha sat across from the lawyer, the sterile, quiet office doing little to calm the churn in her stomach. She’d called in a favor from an old colleague—someone who specialized in both personal and professional matters—and now she was sitting in front of her, explaining the situation.</p><p>The lawyer, a sharp-eyed woman in her mid-forties, adjusted her glasses, listening carefully. “So, to summarize, this Jordan character has photos of you and your partner—personal, intimate photos—and has threatened to release them unless you give him what he wants: a mentorship and a spot in the operating room?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her jaw tight. “Yes. He also has screenshots of my texts with Rio. There’s nothing super incriminating there, but they are personal in nature. It definitely shows that our relationship is romantic.”</p><p>The lawyer raised an eyebrow, clearly disturbed. “That’s a serious violation of privacy, and it could be classified as harassment and even stalking, depending on how far he’s gone with this. I don’t know how much he’s actually done, but if he’s secretly taken photos and hacked into your phone, it’s already crossing into criminal territory.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her hands in her lap, the weight of it all sinking in. “I haven’t told anyone—especially not Rio. Actually, I only told Lilia Calderu, she’s the Chair of Medicine at Northwestern and a close friend. We talked and she’s known about my relationship with Rio for a while, but if Jordan does something, she won’t be able to help me. So I’m trying to handle this quietly. But I don’t know what my next step should be.”</p><p>“First off,” the lawyer said, “you need to document everything. Write down the exact words Jordan said to you, the threat he made, and how you know he has these photos and texts. If possible, gather whatever you can from your phone—screenshots of the texts, records of any conversations you’ve had with him about this mentorship and the OR thing. You say he’s been insisting that you reconsider for months, right?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, already going through the details in her mind. She’d seen the photos, and she knew the texts were likely a mixture of innocent exchanges and things they’d said that could be taken out of context. “I already have some evidence… the photos he showed me, but I do have the messages, but I’m afraid that’s not enough. He said he could make it look worse than it is.”</p><p>The lawyer leaned forward, her expression firm. “I understand the fear. But it’s important to know that no matter what he says, it’s not your fault. The fact that he’s using this against you is the crux of the matter here. What he’s doing is illegal, and if he follows through with these threats, he’s committing extortion.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, trying to calm the tightening in her chest. “I can’t let this get out. I don’t want Rio to get dragged into this. She doesn’t deserve this. She’s fought so hard to get to where she is now. I have to protect her.”</p><p>The lawyer paused, eyes sharp with understanding. “I get why you want to protect her. But if it were me, I’d tell her as soon as possible. Keeping her in the dark only makes it harder later. She might be upset, but it’s better than her finding out from someone else. And… if this goes public, you need to be prepared for the consequences.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the desk for a moment, her fingers tapping on the edge. She knew the lawyer was right, but it wasn’t something she could face yet. “I’ll think about it. But I need to know… what should I do right now?”</p><p>The lawyer slid a business card across the desk, along with a legal pad. “The best course of action is to make sure you’re fully protected. File a police report about the harassment and the blackmail. If he has these photos, he's stalking you, so he’s already be breaking the law. Not t mention hacking into your phone. I’ll help you gather the evidence you need. But also—don’t engage with him directly. You don’t want him to have any leverage over you.”</p><p>“I’ll do that,” Agatha said, feeling the first flicker of relief in her chest. “I’ll file a report. And I’ll gather the evidence. Thank you.”</p><p>“Of course,” the lawyer said, giving her a tight smile. “Remember, this is about protecting yourself. And if you want to keep your job and your relationship intact, you need to take action quickly.”</p><p>Agatha stood up, her resolve slowly hardening. “I will. I’ll handle it.”</p><p>As she left the office, her mind raced. There were a lot of moving parts to this, but for the first time today, she felt like she was taking control.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha stepped out of the police station, the weight of the report she had just filed settling heavily on her chest. The next steps weren’t clear yet, but at least she had done something. It didn’t erase the dread of what might come next, particularly where Rio was concerned.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her pocket. Rio’s texts and missed calls filled the screen.</p><p>
  <strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Where are you?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Agatha, I’m starting to get worried. Are you okay?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p><em>Call me. Please</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenched. She’d been so caught up in everything that she hadn’t realized how much time had passed. She quickly typed a response:</p><p align="right">
  <strong>Agatha</strong>
</p><p align="right"> <em>Sorry, got caught up in something. On my way home now.</em></p><p>First, she needed to grab Nicky. The evening had gotten away from her, and she hadn’t even been able to check in on him since leaving for the lawyer’s office.</p><p>After picking him up from his friend’s house, Agatha drove home, her mind swirling with everything she’d done that day. As she pulled into the driveway, a pang of concern struck her when she saw the lights on in her living room.</p><p>She parked the car, getting out with Nicky in tow. The house was silent, except for the quiet hum of the heater from inside. As they approached the door, it creaked open slightly, and Agatha found herself holding her breath. When she stepped into the foyer, she saw Rio standing there, waiting for them.</p><p>Rio’s expression softened when she saw them. Her concern was still evident, but there was a warmth to her eyes that made Agatha’s heart ache. She was clearly relieved to see them both.</p><p>“I was starting to worry,” Rio said softly, closing the door behind her. “I’ve been texting and calling. Where’ve you been?”</p><p>Agatha forced a smile, trying to keep the weight of the situation off her face. “Sorry, just had to take care of some things. I didn’t mean to make you worry.”</p><p>Nicky, looking up at Rio, seemed more concerned about the fact that his mom was acting a little off than anything else. “Are you okay, mama?” he asked, his small voice filled with innocence.</p><p>Agatha nodded quickly, kneeling down to ruffle his hair. “I’m fine, baby. Just got caught up with some work stuff, that’s all.” She gave Rio a quick glance, the unspoken tension between them not lost on her, but she hoped it wasn’t obvious to Nicky.</p><p>Rio eyed them both carefully, and for a moment, Agatha felt the weight of the unspoken words lingering in the air. But Rio just smiled and pulled Nicky into a gentle hug. “Good. I’m glad you’re both okay.”</p><p>She gave Agatha a lingering look, one that held a little too much curiosity, as if she could sense Agatha was keeping something from her. But Agatha could only offer a tight smile, hoping she wasn’t betraying herself too obviously.</p><p>“I’m gonna go start dinner,” Rio said, stepping away from Nicky and giving Agatha a soft smile. “What do you think, kiddo? You in the mood for something easy, like pasta?”</p><p>Nicky grinned, relieved by the return to normalcy. “Pasta sounds great!”</p><p>Agatha watched Rio walk to the kitchen, the weight of her silence heavier than ever. She had to keep the truth from her—for now. It was all too much to share. Agatha just wasn’t ready to let Rio carry that burden.</p><p>When Rio glanced back at her with that gentle, concerned expression, Agatha felt a wave of guilt wash over her, but she couldn’t bring herself to break.</p><p>She couldn’t risk it. Not yet.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>A few hours later, the house was quiet once again. The sounds of Nicky’s bedtime routine had faded, and now only the soft hum of the refrigerator and the faint rustle of wind outside filled the space.</p><p>Agatha stood at the kitchen counter, her hands wrapped around a mug of tea, trying to steady herself. Rio was in the living room, flipping through a book but clearly not as absorbed in it as she wanted to be. Agatha could feel her presence in the room—the soft energy that Rio always brought, the way she made the air lighter, warmer, without even trying.</p><p>But tonight felt different. The weight of everything that had happened today—the police report, the threat from Jordan, the lies she’d had to keep up—hung heavily on her. She could almost feel Rio’s eyes on her, the unspoken questions in the air. The silence was thick, and Agatha was finding it harder and harder to pretend that everything was fine.</p><p>Rio’s voice broke through the quiet. “Agatha.”</p><p>She looked up, finding Rio’s eyes on her, full of concern. “Are you sure you’re okay?” she asked softly. “You’re… different tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, her heart pounding as she struggled to find the words. She couldn’t tell Rio the truth—not yet, at least. She couldn’t risk it. Not when everything was still so uncertain.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said quickly, offering a smile she didn’t feel. “Just tired, that’s all. Been a very long day.”</p><p>Rio didn’t seem entirely convinced, but she didn’t push. She gave a small nod and returned to her seat on the couch, though her gaze remained fixed on Agatha.</p><p>It was a few moments before Rio spoke again, her tone hesitant. “I know something’s off,” she said quietly. “And I don’t want to push you, but… if you ever want to talk, I’m here. You know that, right? You can tell me anything, love.”</p><p>Agatha felt a lump form in her throat. Rio’s offer, her genuine concern, only made the situation harder to bear. How could she keep this from Rio? How long could she pretend everything was fine?</p><p>“I appreciate it,” Agatha said softly, looking at Rio for a moment before turning her gaze to her mug, unable to hold her eye contact. “But this is something I have to figure out on my own.”</p><p>Rio’s lips pressed together, and for a moment, Agatha thought she might argue, but instead, she nodded and fell silent. The tension lingered between them like a storm waiting to break, and Agatha could feel the distance growing.</p><p>As the minutes stretched on, Agatha found herself standing in the doorway, the weight of everything pressing in on her. She wanted to reach out to Rio, to let her in, but the fear of everything unravelling kept her frozen.</p><p>Finally, Rio spoke again, quieter this time. “I don’t want you to feel like you have to hide things from me, Agatha. I can’t promise I’ll always understand, but I want to be there for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart squeezed painfully in her chest, and she swallowed hard. She was so close to breaking, so close to telling Rio everything, but she couldn’t. Not yet.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha whispered. “I just need a little more time. I promise I’ll tell you when I can.”</p><p>Rio didn’t push further, but the quiet weight of the room pressed down on Agatha. She could feel Rio’s gaze, steady and unwavering, but it wasn’t judgmental. It was just… there. A soft reminder that Rio would be there when Agatha was ready.</p><p>For now, though, Agatha had to keep the walls up.</p><p>With a shaky breath, she finally looked up at Rio. “I’m going to head to bed. I’m exhausted.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her expression softening. “Of course. I’ll be up soon. We can talk tomorrow if you feel like it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t trust herself to speak, so she simply gave a small nod and walked toward the stairs, the silence once again settling in around them.</p><p>But even as she made her way up the stairs, Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that the truth was pulling her toward Rio, and it was only a matter of time before she couldn’t hide from it any longer.</p><p> </p>

  <p>
  <span>The sunrise filtered softly through the window, casting a pale glow across Agatha's room. Rio had been awake for a while, lying beside Agatha and watching her sleep. She couldn’t help but notice the way Agatha seemed so distant the night before, the subtle tension that hadn’t been there when they had last spoken yesterday morning. Even in her sleep, Agatha was different—her brow furrowed slightly, like there was something weighing on her that she couldn’t shake off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio had learned to read Agatha’s moods in the time they’d been together. She knew when something was off, and yesterday was one of those days. The tightness in Agatha’s shoulders when she spoke, the way she kept her gaze a little too low, the forced smiles—Rio could feel it all. She hadn’t asked about it yet, not wanting to push, but it was clear that Agatha was hiding something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Part of her ached at the thought. She wanted to help, to be there for her in the way that Agatha always was for her, but Agatha had been pulling away in little ways. Rio knew she had to be patient, but it was hard. There was a quiet fear creeping into her chest, the kind that whispered that maybe Agatha didn’t want her in the same way anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sighing quietly, Rio shifted carefully out of bed, trying not to disturb Agatha. She had an early shift at the firehouse today, and though she hated leaving with the tension still hanging in the air, she knew she had to go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stood beside the bed for a moment, watching Agatha’s peaceful expression, the way her hair fell across the pillow in soft waves. Rio smiled softly, a flicker of warmth spreading through her at the sight. Despite everything that was unsaid, there was something deeply comforting about being here, in this space with Agatha. She felt at home in a way she hadn’t known was possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bending down, Rio placed a gentle kiss on the top of Agatha’s head, letting her lips linger for just a second longer than usual, before whispering softly, “I’m going to work, babe. I’ll see you later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stirred, mumbling something unintelligible at first before blinking her eyes open. Her gaze was blurry with sleep, but it softened when she met Rio’s eyes. “Mm, okay,” Agatha mumbled, her voice still thick with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart gave a small flutter at the softness in Agatha’s tone. It wasn’t much, but it was enough. She wanted to stay, to pull Agatha closer, to forget about the space between them, but her shift was calling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you,” Agatha murmured in her sleep, her voice small but sincere, almost like it slipped out without her realizing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio froze, her chest tightening as the words hit her. She could feel the warmth spreading in her chest, the comfort of hearing those words even when Agatha wasn’t fully awake. It was a reassurance, a thread of connection, a lifeline that told Rio that Agatha still felt what she felt, even if the distance between them was starting to grow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you too,” Rio whispered back, her voice low and soft, a promise to herself as much as it was to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stayed a moment longer, watching Agatha’s chest rise and fall steadily, before she reluctantly turned and made her way toward the door, trying to shake off the uneasy feeling that lingered. She couldn’t ignore it anymore—there was something happening, and while Agatha was keeping her distance, Rio wasn’t going to give up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A couple of days later, it was a typical Friday afternoon, and Rio was eager to get out of her pediatrics class. The new semester was in full swing, and while she was excited for the classes ahead, nothing compared to the thought of getting to Agatha’s place later, curling up with her, and putting the stresses of school and work behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had had Cardio II earlier that morning, and though the material had been tough, she was looking forward to Agatha’s company. She couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something off with Agatha for the past couple of days, but she’d decided to let it go for now. After all, maybe Agatha was just stressed with work. She had her own busy schedule, so Rio understood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Walking down the hallway toward the exit of the medical building, her phone buzzing in her pocket, Rio was already mentally planning the rest of her day. She barely noticed the figure approaching her until she bumped into him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey there,” Thomas Jordan’s voice sounded behind her, and she turned, frowning when she saw him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan. Of course.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t expect to see you here, Vidal,” he said with a smirk. “Still chasing that little neurology professor of yours around, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio narrowed her eyes. There was something about his tone that felt off. “What are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan chuckled, his expression darkening with a bit of amusement. “Your little girlfriend—has she come to any conclusions yet? You know, about the whole… situation?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s stomach dropped, confusion swirling inside her. “What situation?” she asked, her voice laced with suspicion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His laugh was low and knowing, as if he’d been waiting for this moment. “Oh, come on. You can’t be that naive. I know you two have been… close.” He leaned in slightly, lowering his voice, “Maybe you should’ve talked to her more about things before getting all tangled up. Maybe this was just a fling after all, huh? If you two don’t even trust each other enough to share stuff like this, it doesn’t seem like it’s going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio froze, her heart thudding against her chest. She didn’t know what he meant, but she could tell from the way he was looking at her, from that smug expression on his face, that it wasn’t something innocent. The words were loaded, heavy with something she didn’t want to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re really out of line, Jordan,” Rio said, her voice low but firm, her anger rising. “I don’t know what you think you know, but I’m not going to stand here and listen to you talk about my personal life like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shrugged, that same arrogant smirk still in place. “Oh, come on. You’re really going to pretend like you don’t know what I’m talking about?” His eyes glinted with something sinister. “I’ve got proof. You should ask her about it sometime. Maybe you’ll both feel better getting it out in the open.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt a cold shiver run down her spine, her blood turning to ice. Proof? What the hell was he talking about?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she could respond, Jordan was already turning away, tossing a casual glance over his shoulder. “Maybe you should rethink things. No one’s a fool for long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stood there for a moment, her mind racing. What had just happened? What did he mean by ‘proof’? Was there something between Agatha and Jordan she didn’t know about? She didn’t believe it for a second, but the unease gnawing at her stomach wouldn’t go away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could feel her pulse quickening as she gripped her phone, wanting to call Agatha, but she held off, unsure of what to say, unsure of what to even ask. The doubt that Jordan planted, that strange feeling of betrayal, lingered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart was pounding as she walked away from Jordan, her mind a storm of confusion and suspicion. His words echoed in her ears, gnawing at her insides. She barely even remembered leaving the building, her feet carrying her on autopilot toward Agatha’s office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She needed to see Agatha. To hear from her what this was about. Whatever it was, Jordan’s insinuations couldn’t be true. He had to be lying. He had to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the more she thought about it, the more she realized she didn’t know what to think. She’d felt the distance between them lately, the way Agatha had been pulling back. But this—this was something else entirely. Jordan had said ‘proof,’ and the cold, knowing way he’d said it made something in her stomach twist uncomfortably.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Rio reached the medical building, she was already fuming. Her fingers trembled slightly as she pushed open the door to Agatha’s office. She found herself standing there, momentarily frozen, before she took a deep breath and knocked sharply on the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” Her voice was tight, but she couldn’t stop it. The fear—dread—swirled in her chest. “We need to talk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She waited for a response, her heart hammering in her chest as she tried to steady her breathing. She needed answers, but part of her dreaded hearing them. Part of her feared what Agatha might say—or worse, what she might not say at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stood there, her chest tight as she took in Agatha’s startled expression. Her heart was pounding, her mind racing with the aftermath of the encounter with Jordan. The words he had said echoed in her mind, sharp and accusatory: ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Your little girlfriend’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s gaze flickered, almost like she was preparing for this, but Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that she was being kept at arm’s length. Again. She stepped into the room, her body tense, her fingers curled into fists by her sides as she forced herself to stay steady.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan’s words kept playing on a loop in her head, and she couldn’t understand how Agatha could keep things from her. This wasn’t just about a fling. This was them, and it was clear now that something was wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s going on, Agatha?” Rio demanded, her voice low but sharp. “Jordan just talked to me. He said he has proof of us… of everything. Is that true?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression froze for just a second, and Rio caught it—caught the way her shoulders stiffened, how her eyes narrowed slightly, as though she was weighing her response. For a moment, Rio felt a sinking feeling in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” she pressed again, her voice trembling now with the force of her frustration. She felt betrayed—like she’d been living in the dark while Agatha kept her secrets tucked away like something to be ashamed of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a long, slow breath and finally nodded. Her gaze didn’t quite meet Rio’s as she spoke. “It’s true. Jordan… he has photos and screenshots of our conversations. He’s been… spying on me, Rio. On us. He hacked into my phone, took pictures when he thought I wasn’t looking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart skipped a beat at the words. “What? He… he’s been stalking you?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Her mind reeled. “Why didn’t you tell me this? Why didn’t you say anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes finally met hers, and Rio saw the weight of the truth in them—heavy, uncomfortable, but undeniable. “I didn’t want to get you involved. I thought I could handle it. I thought if I kept it from you, you’d be safe. He’s threatening to go to Lilia if I don’t give him the mentorship and the OR opportunity. I’m… trying to fix this, but I didn’t want you to worry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s breath caught, the shock hitting her like a punch to the gut. The realization of what Agatha had been trying to protect her from made her stomach twist in a way she couldn’t explain. But the hurt was there, deep and raw, because it wasn’t just about protecting her anymore. It was about the distance—about the fact that Agatha had kept all of this from her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Rio said, her voice trembling with a mix of anger and disbelief. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m already involved.</span>
  </em>
  <span> You didn’t trust me enough to tell me this? You kept me in the dark while he’s been </span>
  <em>
    <span>stalking</span>
  </em>
  <span> you? And you thought I wouldn’t care? Or that I wouldn’t want to help? That I didn’t deserve to know what’s going on with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a step forward, but Rio backed away, shaking her head. “I get that you’re trying to protect me, but you can’t keep doing this. I can’t be in a relationship where I don’t know what’s going on. Where you’re hiding things from me because you think it’s easier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression softened, and Rio could see the hurt there too, but it wasn’t enough. “I’m sorry, Rio. I didn’t want to put you in danger. I wanted to keep you safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I’m already </span>
  <em>
    <span>here</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Agatha! I’m already involved!” Rio’s voice cracked, and she couldn’t stop herself from taking a step closer. “I’m already in this with you. I don’t want to be kept in the dark anymore. I need you to trust me. I need you to tell me everything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked at her, eyes filled with regret. “I will. I promise. But right now, I need to handle this. Please… I’ll explain everything when it’s safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest tightened with the weight of the situation. “I don’t know if I can keep doing this if I don’t know what’s going on,” she whispered, her voice raw. “I can’t keep being kept out of the loop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression faltered, and she reached for Rio’s hand, but Rio pulled back before she could make contact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to think,” Rio said softly, her throat tight as she turned toward the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t say anything. She just stood there, watching Rio leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Rio walked away, her heart felt heavier with every step. She didn’t know if she could keep doing this. Didn’t know if the distance between them, the lack of trust, could be fixed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The weekend stretched on, each moment feeling like an eternity for Rio. She couldn’t shake the conversation with Agatha from her mind. The hurt was still raw, an aching reminder of how much she felt like she had been left in the dark. She couldn’t understand why Agatha hadn’t trusted her enough to share what was going on. It was a sharp, bitter feeling that refused to fade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice had been relentless in trying to get Rio to talk, but every time she tried, Rio just shrugged it off, her responses curt and distant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine, Alice,” Rio had muttered for what felt like the hundredth time. “Just need some space.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice, ever the observant friend, seemed to sense Rio’s mood. “You know you can talk to me, right? You’re not alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Rio wasn’t ready to talk. Not yet. Not about the thing that was gnawing at her from the inside, not about how betrayed she felt, and certainly not about Agatha. She didn’t know how to voice the anger, the confusion, or the disappointment. So she stayed quiet, hiding behind her silence and her stubbornness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s calls, texts, and even a few voicemails came pouring in, but Rio ignored them all. The phone buzzed in her pocket like a constant reminder of what was happening, but she couldn’t bring herself to answer. She needed space. Time to process. Time to figure out what this relationship meant, especially now that Agatha had kept something so important from her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha showed up on her doorstep, knocking insistently, Rio just stared at the door for a moment before taking a deep breath and unlocking it. She opened it just enough to see Agatha standing there, looking both apologetic and desperate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just want to talk, Rio,” Agatha said softly, her voice tinged with concern and something else, something that made Rio’s chest tighten.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t deal with it. Not now. She shook her head, stepping back and leaning against the doorframe. “I need some time, Agatha. I can’t… I can’t do this right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s face fell, but she didn’t push, understanding the finality in Rio’s tone. “I’m sorry, I—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Rio interrupted quietly. “You’re sorry. But I need some space. I need time to think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a heavy, silent sigh, Agatha stepped back, her hand lingering in the air as if wanting to reach out but knowing it wasn’t the right moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” she said, her voice barely audible. “I’ll give you time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door closed softly between them, and Rio felt the weight of it press against her chest. She knew she wasn’t ready to forgive Agatha yet, but somewhere deep down, she also knew she wanted to. She just didn’t know how.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By Sunday night, Rio was still wrapped up in the same bitter funk she’d been in all weekend. She barely noticed the world around her as she suited up for her shift, the usual chatter of the firehouse sounding muffled, like she was underwater. The weight of everything from the past few days felt heavy on her shoulders, making each movement feel sluggish, her thoughts disjointed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabbed a few supplies to restock the ambulance and walked out to the rig with her mind a million miles away. She didn’t even realize Will was standing next to her until he spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, you good?” Will’s voice was casual, but Rio could hear the concern in it. He was the only one brave enough to ask, everyone else content to let her be—until it was obvious she wasn’t going to snap out of it on her own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced at him, not even attempting a smile. “I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will raised an eyebrow, crossing his arms as he leaned against the truck. “Yeah? You sure? You’ve been quiet all weekend. And you’ve been carrying some serious weight around with you tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her jaw tightened. She wanted to brush him off, but something in his tone made her pause. He wasn’t asking out of judgment—he genuinely cared. And for whatever reason, the walls she’d been putting up all weekend cracked just a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m… I don’t even know,” she muttered, glancing at the ground. She knew she should’ve kept it to herself, but Will had always been someone she trusted, someone who had seen her through tough times without pushing too hard. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to say it out loud, even if she wasn’t ready to figure it all out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Talk to me,” Will urged, his voice softening. He was still leaning against the rig, watching her with an open, understanding gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled sharply, running a hand through her hair. She couldn’t keep it in anymore. She needed to get it out, even if she didn’t fully understand it herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, here’s the thing,” she started, looking up at him. “It’s Agatha. I—” She hesitated, not sure how to explain it all. She’d been holding onto so much. “There’s stuff she’s been hiding from me. She got caught up in something with… someone. And now it’s this whole mess. I found out—” Rio paused, her hands clenching in frustration. “I found out someone’s been threatening her, and she didn’t even tell me. She kept it from me like I couldn’t handle it. Like she couldn’t trust me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will listened carefully, his expression serious but soft. “That sounds like a lot to carry,” he said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, swallowing against the tightness in her throat. “It is. I mean, I get why she didn’t want to drag me into it. But she kept me in the dark, Will. And I—I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to feel anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will leaned in slightly, keeping his tone steady. “You’re upset because you feel betrayed. And maybe she wasn’t honest with you. But what she did, holding it all in? Sounds like she was trying to protect you from it. Doesn’t mean it was right, but it doesn’t mean it was about you, either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio crossed her arms, shaking her head. “I don’t know. It feels like she doesn’t trust me. And I can’t be with someone who doesn’t trust me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gave her a sympathetic smile, his voice low. “I get that. But Rio, you’re not the only one in this. I’m not saying you shouldn’t be hurt, because you have every right to feel that way. But have you thought about why she might’ve kept things from you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked at him, her brow furrowing as she thought for a moment. “She says it was to protect me. But I don’t know if that’s enough to make it right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not gonna tell you how to feel,” Will said, his voice kind but firm. “But you’ve been carrying this for days now, and I think it’s time to stop pushing it down. Talk to her. Get the full picture before you make any decisions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip, her mind a whirlwind. Will was right, though. She couldn’t keep ignoring this. She had to hear Agatha out, even if she was afraid of what that might mean for them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess I have to talk to her, don’t I?” Rio muttered, her voice low.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will gave a small nod. “Yeah, I think you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few hours later, Rio stood there for a moment, phone in hand, hovering over Agatha’s contact. She wasn’t sure how to even begin the conversation, but Will’s words echoed in her mind. You have to talk to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a deep breath and quickly typed out the message:</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We need to talk. Please call me when you can.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she could hit send, the shrill sound of the station bell pierced the air. The tone of urgency cut through her thoughts instantly. Her heart skipped, and her body went into autopilot as the crew scrambled into action. The dispatcher’s voice crackled over the speaker.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Large structure fire. 14th and Broadway. Multiple units needed.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand shot out, quickly clicking send before shoving the phone back into her pocket, not even realizing it was nearly midnight. She sprinted to the rig, her mind already racing with the urgency of the call. They had no time to think, no time for anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The call came in fast—a five-alarm blaze in a commercial building downtown. Rio’s adrenaline kicked in as she slid into the driver’s seat of the ambulance, the sirens already blaring. Alice’s fire truck was already on the move, lights flashing as it roared down the street.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay safe, Wu!” Rio called out to Alice through the open window, but the firetruck had already sped off, the sound of its engine drowned out by the chaos.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they arrived on scene, the building was fully engulfed in flames, smoke pouring from every window. Rio joined her team, getting ready to help evacuees and assess injuries. She kept an eye on Alice, watching the firefighters gear up as they entered the building, while Rio and her crew began working with evacuees outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fire raged faster than expected, and Rio’s gut tightened. Her radio crackled to life—firefighters were still inside, trying to contain the blaze, but they needed backup.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice!” Rio called into the smoke-filled air, spotting her friend among the firefighters. But the noise and chaos of the scene drowned out her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, a deafening crack sounded. The sound of wood splintering, followed by a thundering collapse of beams and debris falling from the ceiling. Rio’s heart lurched as she saw the direction the debris had fallen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice!” Rio yelled, her voice frantic now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sprinted toward the building just as the other firefighters managed to pull Alice from the wreckage. They laid her on the ground, her suit torn and bloodied. Rio was there in an instant, kneeling beside her, heart racing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice!” Rio breathed, trying to assess the situation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice groaned, her eyes barely open. “Not… the plan…” she mumbled, her breath shallow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hang on, I’ve got you,” Rio said, hands shaking as she worked to stabilize Alice’s airway. She quickly checked for any signs of severe injuries—broken ribs, possible internal bleeding. Her mind raced with protocol and triage, but the fear of seeing her best friend hurt clouded her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other firefighters stepped back to allow Rio to do her work. One of the medics from the ambulance team approached, but Rio shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not leaving her. I need to get her stabilized before she’s moved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, we’ve got it covered. Let us take over,” the medic urged gently, but Rio ignored him, focusing entirely on Alice. She couldn’t let anyone else take the lead with her best friend in this condition.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few tense minutes, she’d done everything she could to stop the bleeding and stabilize Alice’s vitals. The medic nodded in approval, signaling to the team to carefully lift Alice onto the stretcher. Rio’s hands hovered over her, reluctant to let go, even though the job wasn’t finished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got you, Wu,” Rio whispered as the team moved Alice toward the ambulance. Her heart ached with the weight of it all, but she didn’t let herself break down—not yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once Alice was secured in the ambulance, Rio climbed in beside her, never leaving her side. The only sounds in the back of the ambulance were Alice’s uneven breathing and the rush of the sirens outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s gonna be okay,” Rio murmured to Alice, though she didn’t fully believe it. Not yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ambulance was rocking with every sharp turn, the flashing lights outside casting eerie shadows through the windows. Alice’s breathing was erratic, and Rio’s hands were trembling as she worked to stabilize her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice, come on, stay with me,” Rio muttered, checking for a pulse when the monitor beeped and then flatlined. There was nothing. Rio’s heart raced as panic threatened to take hold, but she pushed it down, refocusing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice, please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She started chest compressions, counting in her head, moving fast, methodical. Every push was a plea, but no matter how hard she tried, Alice didn’t respond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Wu, don’t do this to me!” Rio gritted out, switching to rescue breaths, desperation seeping into every motion. The pressure in her chest was suffocating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Alice’s chest gave a weak rise. Rio didn’t stop. She continued CPR until she felt the faintest pulse, but it was still so weak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Alice. Just hold on, okay? I need you to hold on for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time they reached the hospital, Rio’s arms were burning from the force of her efforts. She jumped out of the ambulance, pulling Alice’s stretcher toward the emergency room. Her voice was steady, but there was a tremor beneath her words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice Wu, 39 years old, blunt force trauma to the chest, possible internal bleeding. Lost pulse briefly en route. Respiration and heartbeat restored, pulse weak. Ongoing CPR. BP 80 over 40.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rattled off the details without missing a beat, but her voice was shaking—small cracks starting to show through the control she’d forced herself to maintain. The doctors and nurses took over, wheeling Alice inside as quickly as they could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hours in the hospital passed with excruciating slowness. Rio barely moved from her spot in the waiting area, her mind racing with a thousand thoughts, each one more frantic than the last. Alice’s surgery, the uncertainty, the aftermath of the fire—everything felt like a blur. The wait seemed endless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mick, John, Will, and Ben stayed by her side, their usual banter subdued, everyone too tense to speak. The only sound was the quiet hum of the hospital, but it felt like Rio’s whole world was holding its breath, waiting for the next update.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, a doctor emerged from the ICU, his expression professional but tinged with a sense of calm. He scanned the group and then focused on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice Wu’s family?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She immediately jumped to her feet. “How is she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doctor nodded. “She made it through surgery. She’s stable now, resting in the ICU. We’ll need to monitor her closely, but everything looks promising. She’s not awake yet, but we’ll keep you posted if anything changes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled a shaky breath, relief flooding her system, and she saw the same sense of relief ripple through her colleagues. Will clapped her on the back, a soft, “Good job, Rio,” slipping out, but she barely heard him, her mind already turning to the next thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sagged against the wall, her body finally giving in to exhaustion. She let out a shaky breath, hands still trembling as she wiped at her face, feeling the full impact of the day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She reached for her phone, her thumb swiping across the screen absently. It was a flurry of missed calls and texts. Her heart skipped when she saw Agatha’s name at the top of the list. Several calls. A handful of worried messages. The last one reading, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Are you okay? I’ve been trying to reach you for hours. I’m worried.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio checked the time for the first time. It was 1:15pm. Rio’s stomach twisted, guilt and something else gnawing at her. She hadn’t been able to answer. Not with everything going on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now, everything that had been building—everything she had tried to suppress—rushed to the surface.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without thinking, she booked an Uber, her body on autopilot as she rode to Northwestern. She couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think of anything except Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the Uber pulled up to Northwestern, Rio was already halfway out the door. She didn’t even pause to fix her uniform, still smeared with Alice’s blood. She didn’t care. All she could focus on was getting to Agatha, getting answers, making things right, and for the first time, realizing how much she’d been hurting, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She practically ran into the building, ignoring the tightness in her chest, heading straight for Agatha’s office. She knocked on the door with shaking hands. When Agatha opened it, Rio didn’t have the strength to hold herself upright anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She collapsed into Agatha’s arms, all the weight of the last few days crashing over her in one overwhelming wave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio, pulling her inside and shutting the door behind them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio? What happened?” she asked, her voice filled with concern and confusion, but Rio couldn’t speak yet. Her body was still shaking with the adrenaline, and her throat was tight, fighting the wave of emotion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha held her, rubbing soothing circles on her back as Rio clung to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I… I thought I was going to lose her,” Rio finally managed to choke out. “I thought I was going to lose Alice last night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha said nothing for a long moment, just holding Rio, letting her lean into her warmth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m here,” Agatha whispered, voice gentle, but Rio could hear the edge of worry that had crept in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for the first time all weekend, Rio let herself lean into Agatha’s presence, letting the feeling of being held in her arms drown out the noise of everything else that had been happening.</span>
</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha held Rio in her arms, her heart pounding as she felt the weight of everything. Rio had pulled away from her earlier, keeping her distance, but now she was here, in her arms again. Agatha could feel the tension in Rio’s body, the way her breathing was shallow, the weight of whatever she’d been carrying pressing down on her. The familiar rhythm of Rio’s heartbeat thudded against her chest, grounding Agatha in a way she hadn’t realized she needed.</p><p>Her mind raced, overwhelmed with the need to comfort her, to be there for her—especially after everything that had happened. There was something more in the air now, an unspoken shift between them. But Agatha kept her grip tight, not wanting to let go. She needed to hold on, to keep her close for just a little while longer.</p><p>“Rio,” she murmured, her voice soft but firm, “just breathe. Just… stay with me for a while.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her head resting against Agatha’s shoulder, and for a moment, everything felt like it was right where it should be. But Agatha knew better than to think it was that simple. The unease in Rio’s posture was still there, lingering beneath her quiet breaths. There was a storm inside of her, one that Agatha could feel but didn’t yet understand.</p><p>As Agatha gently pulled back, wanting to look into Rio’s eyes, she finally spoke. “What happened, Rio? You said something happened to Alice?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her fingers tightening on the fabric of Agatha’s shirt, her knuckles white as she drew a breath. Agatha could see the unease in her eyes, the conflict in the way Rio’s gaze kept darting away.</p><p>Rio exhaled, trying to steady herself before she spoke, but the words came out in a rush, barely coherent. “She was… caught in the fire. She was trapped. We pulled her out, and then—then her heart stopped. Her heart <em> stopped</em>, Agatha. She crashed on the way to the hospital.”</p><p>The way Rio’s voice cracked made Agatha’s chest tighten, and instinctively, she pulled Rio back in. She needed to feel her in her arms again, to offer whatever comfort she could, even though she could see that nothing would be enough to take the pain away.</p><p>Rio continued, her voice softer now but still trembling. “I—I had to do it, Agatha. I had to give her CPR. I thought I was going to lose her right there. She wasn’t responding. I was… I don’t know what I was thinking. I just kept doing it until we got to the hospital and she—” Her voice caught, and Agatha could hear the rawness of it, the weight of the fear and the adrenaline that had kept Rio going all this time.</p><p>Agatha held her tighter, feeling the way Rio’s body trembled, the pain in her voice sinking deep into her heart. She knew Rio was strong, knew how much she cared for the people in her life. But this… this was different. This wasn’t just the adrenaline of a rescue. It was the gut-wrenching fear of almost losing someone she loved, and Agatha felt the depth of that fear like it was her own.</p><p>“Shh,” Agatha whispered, pressing her cheek to the top of Rio’s head. “You did everything you could. Alice is going to be okay, right?”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as she nodded, and Agatha could feel the sudden shake in her shoulders as the tears started to fall. She felt the warmth of them against her neck, and her heart broke for the woman in her arms.</p><p>Rio pulled back just slightly, enough to look Agatha in the eyes, her face streaked with tears and her expression a mix of exhaustion and vulnerability. “I—I was so scared, Agatha,” she whispered, her voice trembling with the weight of everything. “I didn’t think I could do it. I thought I was going to lose her. I thought I wouldn’t be able to save her.”</p><p>Agatha cupped Rio’s face gently, wiping away a tear with the pad of her thumb, the moment raw and tender. “You did save her, Rio. You’re a hero, you know that?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her eyes filled with disbelief. “I don’t feel like a hero. I just feel… lost. Like everything’s spinning out of control.”</p><p>Agatha could see it then—the way the fear, the weight of the responsibility Rio carried, had been building for days. It wasn’t just Alice or the fire. It was everything. It was the fear of losing someone close, the pressure of keeping it together, and, maybe, the strain of everything she and Agatha hadn’t been able to say to each other.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice steady but full of warmth. “I’m here. You don’t have to go through this alone.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t seem to hear her. She was too lost in her own thoughts, her head dropping to Agatha’s shoulder again. Agatha held her, the silence between them comfortable for once, both of them knowing that words weren’t needed at the moment.</p><p>As Rio’s body shuddered with the weight of her emotions, Agatha wrapped her arms around her once more, not letting go this time. She could feel Rio’s breath hitching in her chest, could feel the tremors of fear and exhaustion that still lingered, and she knew this was the moment to let her feel safe, to give her the comfort she needed.</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha whispered, gently guiding Rio by the shoulders. “Let’s sit down. You need to rest for a moment.”</p><p>She led Rio toward the small couch in her office, the one Agatha had used countless times for meetings with students, but it felt different now—more personal, more intimate, as she guided Rio to sit down. The couch was soft, and as Rio sank into it, Agatha settled beside her, sitting close but allowing Rio the space to breathe.</p><p>Rio exhaled deeply, her head dropping to rest on Agatha’s shoulder as she sat down. Agatha reached for a nearby blanket, draping it gently over Rio’s shoulders. It was simple, but in the moment, it felt like exactly what Rio needed—a safe space to process everything, to let go for just a little while.</p><p>Agatha’s hand found its way to Rio’s, intertwining their fingers as she rested her head against Rio’s, her heart beating steadily, reassuringly.</p><p>“I’m here, Rio,” Agatha murmured again, her voice soft but full of meaning. “I’m right here with you.”</p><p>And for the first time in days, Rio let herself sink into the comfort of Agatha’s embrace. As they sat there in silence, Agatha knew that no matter what came next, they would find a way to face it together.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha held Rio close as the tears continued to pour, allowing her to cry without interruption, without judgment. She just let her lean into her, softly whispering reassurances, knowing Rio needed this—needed the space to let it all out. It wasn’t just the fear or the trauma of what had happened to Alice; it was everything—her confusion, her guilt, her exhaustion.</p><p>As the minutes passed, Rio’s sobs started to quiet, her body slowing its shaking. Agatha kissed her temple gently, the warmth of the gesture grounding both of them.</p><p>“Are you feeling a little better?” Agatha asked softly, her voice tender.</p><p>Rio nodded against her shoulder, her breath still uneven but more stable now. She hadn’t said a word for a while, but Agatha could feel the slight relief that was starting to seep through her tense frame.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha murmured. She brushed a strand of hair from Rio’s face, her thumb lightly grazing her cheek. “Listen, I know you probably want to get out of those clothes. They’re soaked in—” she paused, swallowing a knot in her throat, “blood. I’ve got some sweatpants and a hoodie in my car. You can change into those if you want.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her eyes glistening with exhaustion, but her grip on Agatha’s hand tightened in response. “Yeah… I’d really appreciate that.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, brushing another kiss to Rio’s temple before standing up. “Okay, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>As she left the office to grab the clothes from her car, Agatha’s heart was still heavy with worry, but she knew that Rio needed some comfort, some way to shed the weight of the night. And Agatha would be right there with her, helping to carry it as much as she could.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha returned a few minutes later with the clothes, the soft fabric of the hoodie and sweatpants a welcome contrast to the tension that had lingered in the air. She stepped into her office, where Rio was sitting on the small couch, her eyes closed, her expression a mixture of exhaustion and emotional overload.</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said gently, offering the clothes. “I’ll wait outside. You can change in here, take your time.”</p><p>Rio looked up, her eyes still red, but a faint, tired smile tugged at the corner of her lips. “Thanks, Agatha. You’ve done enough already.” Her voice was rough from all the crying, but there was warmth in it, even if it was tinged with uncertainty.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her chest tightening as she watched Rio struggle to get her bearings. “I’m not going anywhere, sweetheart. Just let me know if you need anything.”</p><p>She stepped out into the hallway, giving Rio the space to change. The minutes stretched on, each second seeming to hang heavier in the air. Agatha couldn’t shake the worry gnawing at her insides. She could only imagine what Rio had gone through, how her heart must have been pounding in her chest when Alice crashed in the ambulance. The weight of it all was unbearable, and Agatha knew she had to be there for Rio—she had to be strong, especially when Rio felt like she might break.</p><p>When Rio finally opened the door to the office, dressed in the clothes Agatha had given her, she looked softer somehow, though still fragile. Her eyes met Agatha’s, and there was a flicker of something unspoken between them—gratitude, vulnerability, something deeper that neither of them could yet name.</p><p>“Feel a little better?” Agatha asked, her voice low but caring.</p><p>Rio nodded, though she seemed too tired to form a response. She sat back down on the couch, her shoulders slumping with relief, but there was still a haunted look in her eyes. Agatha could tell that, even though the worst was over for Alice, the emotional toll on Rio hadn’t even begun to fade.</p><p>Agatha sat beside her, her presence a quiet comfort. She didn’t try to force a conversation, letting the silence stretch between them, but it wasn’t an uncomfortable silence. It was one of understanding, a space where they didn’t need to fill the gaps with words. Agatha’s hand gently brushed against Rio’s, a subtle offering of support.</p><p>“I’m here,” Agatha whispered, her voice almost a promise.</p><p>Rio didn’t respond immediately. She just leaned into Agatha’s side, her head resting on her shoulder. Agatha could feel the tension in Rio’s body slowly ease, bit by bit, as they sat there together, two souls navigating the aftermath of a nightmare that had somehow pulled them closer.</p><p>“Thank you for staying with me,” Rio said quietly after a long pause, her voice soft but full of sincerity. “For everything.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her forehead lightly, her heart swelling with a tenderness that only Rio could inspire in her. “I’ll always stay with you.”</p><p>Rio’s breath evened out, her head still resting on Agatha’s shoulder, the soft rise and fall of her chest giving away how exhausted she truly was. Agatha stayed as still as she could, not wanting to disturb the fragile peace that had settled over Rio. She could feel the weight of Rio’s body, the exhaustion that had claimed her, and she knew that the last thing Rio needed was to be rushed.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha allowed herself to simply be present—just holding Rio, keeping her close, as time seemed to stretch and bend around them. It wasn’t until Rio’s breathing deepened, her face relaxing into sleep, that Agatha knew she had drifted off.</p><p>After a few minutes, Agatha carefully shifted, adjusting so she could look down at Rio without disturbing her too much. The exhaustion on Rio’s face was undeniable, but so was the trust Rio had placed in her today. Agatha’s heart ached, but there was something else there too—a warmth that she couldn’t quite explain, a sense of belonging that settled in her chest.</p><p>She gently brushed a few strands of hair from Rio’s face, feeling the softness of her skin beneath her fingers. It felt almost intimate, this quiet moment between them, and Agatha held on to it as long as she could before she knew she had to do something.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered softly, brushing a kiss to the top of her head, “You should get some real rest. Come on, baby, I’ll drive you home.”</p><p>Rio stirred slightly, mumbling incoherently for a moment before blinking her eyes open. She looked up at Agatha, still a little dazed.</p><p>“You’re falling asleep on me, Rio,” Agatha said with a soft smile, her hand gently brushing Rio’s cheek. “I think you could use a few more hours of sleep at home. I can take you there.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted as if to protest, but the words never came. She seemed to think about it for a beat, then nodded slowly, too tired to argue.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio murmured, her voice still rough. “Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha offered her a reassuring smile, helping Rio stand up from the couch. “Let me get you home.. We can talk tomorrow, when you’re ready.”</p><p>Rio gave a small, weary smile in return as Agatha helped her gather her things and they walked together out of the office. Agatha’s heart remained heavy with the events of the day, but there was comfort in knowing she was there for Rio in this moment—right when she needed it most.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As Agatha and Rio entered the apartment, the tension between them was palpable. The silence in the air seemed heavy, like it was waiting for something to break it. Rio moved toward her bedroom without saying much, and Agatha followed quietly, understanding that this wasn’t the time for pressing conversations. It was just the two of them, and Agatha wanted to respect that.</p><p>Rio stopped at the edge of the bed, standing still for a moment, as though uncertain of what to do next. She glanced at Agatha, her expression unreadable. Agatha didn’t push her. Instead, she stood nearby, allowing Rio the space to decide what she needed.</p><p>“Do you want me to stay?” Agatha asked gently, breaking the silence but keeping her voice calm and low. She wasn’t about to make any moves without Rio’s direction.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer immediately. She simply moved to the side of the bed, slowly sitting down. After a beat, she patted the spot next to her, an unspoken invitation. Agatha hesitated for a moment but then sat down beside her.</p><p>They sat like that, a small distance between them, neither of them quite sure how to bridge it. The weight of the night still lingered in the air, both of them worn out from the chaos of the fire, the fear, and the events that had followed. But Agatha could see it—the way Rio’s shoulders were slumped, the way her hands fidgeted with the hem of her sleeve. She could tell that Rio wasn’t okay, that there was something more underneath the surface, something that Rio was holding back.</p><p>The quiet stretched on, but then Rio shifted. She turned slightly, looking at Agatha, her eyes vulnerable. “I don’t want to be alone right now,” Rio admitted quietly, her voice rough.</p><p>Agatha felt a pang in her chest, a sharp ache of empathy. She reached for Rio’s hand gently, offering comfort without words, and to her surprise, Rio took it. The contact seemed to break the invisible wall between them, and Rio leaned a little closer, her face still tight with the exhaustion of the day.</p><p>Agatha’s heart softened, and she could feel Rio slowly letting herself rely on her.</p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath. “I feel like everything’s falling apart, Agatha. I don’t even know where to start… or how to deal with all of it.”</p><p>“You don’t have to figure it out right now,” Agatha said softly, moving a little closer herself. “It’s okay to just… be. We can figure it out when you’re ready.”</p><p>There was a long moment of stillness, before Rio finally sought comfort, just like she had earlier on the couch. She inched closer, leaning her head gently on Agatha’s shoulder. The action was simple, yet it felt monumental—like a shift, a sign of trust, of allowing herself to need someone.</p><p>Agatha’s arm naturally wrapped around her, pulling her a little closer. For a while, they just sat like that, Rio’s breath steadying as she rested against Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha didn’t try to rush her, didn’t push for more. She just held her, offering what little comfort she could.</p><p>When Rio spoke again, her voice was quiet but sincere. “Thank you… for being here. For not letting go.”</p><p>“I’ll never let go, Rio,” Agatha whispered. “I’m here, no matter what.”</p><p>The silence that followed wasn’t uncomfortable. It was filled with understanding, with the quiet connection they were building, step by step.</p><p>Rio’s body eventually relaxed into her arms, and Agatha slowly made the woman she loved lie down, as her breathing started to even out. Before long, Rio’s head tilted against Agatha’s, her eyelids fluttering closed as she dozed off in the safety of Agatha’s embrace.</p><p>Agatha let her sleep, watching over her, knowing that there would be time to talk, time to sort through the mess of everything that had happened. But for now, all that mattered was this—being here, together, letting Rio rest.</p><p>As Rio drifted off to sleep, Agatha kissed her hair softly, whispering to herself more than to Rio, “I’ll protect you, baby. Always.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>A few hours passed in a quiet, peaceful stillness. Agatha hadn’t moved from the couch, her eyes flicking between the quiet apartment and Rio’s room, her thoughts occupied by everything that had happened and everything that was yet to be addressed. She knew Rio needed space to breathe, to let the weight of the day sink in before anything else could be discussed. Agatha made the decision to text Wanda and ask her to pick up Nicky and keep him for a bit, giving Rio the time to sleep uninterrupted.</p><p>When Rio finally emerged from her room, it felt like the calm after a storm. Her hair was mussed, and she rubbed her eyes sleepily as she stepped into the living room, looking every bit the vulnerable, tired woman Agatha knew she was at that moment.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said gently, her voice a soft whisper in the quiet apartment. She looked up from her phone, where she’d been texting Wanda updates on Nicky.</p><p>Rio gave her a small, tired smile, but there was still a hesitancy in her movements. She shuffled over to the couch and sat down next to Agatha, her eyes still heavy from sleep.</p><p>“How do you feel?” Agatha asked softly, her gaze studying Rio’s expression, looking for any hint of what she might be feeling.</p><p>Rio let out a small, shaky breath before answering. “Better, I think. Just… tired.” She glanced at Agatha, her eyes lingering a bit longer than usual, but she didn’t say anything else.</p><p>Agatha nodded, offering her a small smile. “You needed the rest. Don’t worry about anything right now.”</p><p>Rio leaned back into the couch, her body sinking into the cushions, and for a moment, neither of them spoke. The silence was comfortable, a brief respite from the chaos of the past few days.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio murmured after a while, her voice quiet but sincere. “For everything. For being here, even when I was… well, distant.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a soft smile, reaching out to gently touch Rio’s arm. “You don’t have to thank me. I’m here, Rio. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, her exhaustion mixing with a quiet sense of relief. She let her head fall back against the couch, closing her eyes for a moment, just enjoying the calm presence of Agatha beside her.</p><p>“I just needed a little time,” Rio murmured, her voice still thick with sleep.</p><p>Agatha nodded, understanding. “Of course. Take all the time you need. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything else for a while, and Agatha gave her the space to think. She could tell Rio wasn’t ready to dive back into the heavy emotions of the night, but Agatha was here, ready to offer her support whenever Rio was ready.</p><p>A few moments later, Rio shifted slightly, looking at Agatha with a small but appreciative smile. “I know I’ve been hard to deal with these past few days,” she said, her voice quiet but sincere. “But I’m glad you’re here. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart swelled at the words. She wanted to tell Rio that she didn’t have to do anything alone, but she just nodded, offering her a soft smile in return.</p><p>“No place I’d rather be,” Agatha promised quietly.</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, and for the first time that day, a small, genuine smile tugged at the corner of her lips. “I’m lucky to have you.”</p><p>Agatha returned the smile, squeezing Rio’s hand gently. “We’re in this together.”</p><p>Rio nodded at Agatha’s words, letting them settle into the quiet of the apartment. She squeezed Agatha’s hand back, just for a moment, before leaning forward and rubbing her face with both hands.</p><p>“I should eat something,” she murmured, though she didn’t move just yet.</p><p>Agatha watched her carefully. “I can make you something,” she offered.</p><p>Rio glanced at her with a small smile. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha brushed a strand of Rio’s hair behind her ear. “Of course.”</p><p>Rio’s smile was faint, but it was real, and Agatha counted that as a win. “Alright, professor. Show me what you’ve got.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but stood, extending a hand to Rio, who took it and let herself be pulled up. She was still moving slower than usual, exhaustion clinging to her bones, but she was up. That was enough for now.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As Agatha moved around the kitchen, Rio sat at the counter, watching her with an unreadable expression. The quiet between them wasn’t heavy, but it wasn’t exactly light either. It was the kind of silence that came after a long, exhausting night—the kind that didn’t need to be filled.</p><p>Agatha worked efficiently, scrambling eggs and toasting some bread, something quick and warm that wouldn’t take too much effort to eat. She was aware of Rio’s eyes on her the entire time, though the younger woman hadn’t said much since they got up.</p><p>When she finally set the plate in front of her, Rio muttered a quiet “Thanks” before picking up her fork.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching as Rio took her first bite.</p><p>Rio chewed slowly, then swallowed, letting out a soft sigh. “I think this is the first thing I’ve eaten in… I don’t even know.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Since before your shift?”</p><p>Rio just nodded, not meeting her eyes.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, rubbing her forehead. “You need to take care of yourself.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio muttered, picking at her toast. She hesitated, then sighed, shaking her head. “It’s just—” She paused, gripping the fork a little tighter. “I can still feel it, you know? The way her ribs felt under my hands when I was doing compressions. The way she just—” She stopped, pressing her lips together like she was trying to push back the memory. “It’s like it’s stuck to me.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened. She stepped closer, resting a hand on the counter beside Rio. “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, but that weight won’t always be this heavy.”</p><p>Rio let out a breath that sounded almost like a laugh, though there was no humor in it. “You say that like it’s something I can just put down.”</p><p>“Not put down,” Agatha corrected gently. “But carry differently.”</p><p>Rio finally looked at her, eyes tired but open. “You ever carried something like this?”</p><p>Agatha held her gaze, thinking of all the patients she’d lost, the ones she hadn’t been able to save. Of the times she had to step into a waiting room and tell a family there was nothing more they could do. Of how—no matter how much time passed—some names never faded.</p><p>“Yes,” she said simply.</p><p>Rio searched her face for a long moment, then nodded. She turned back to her plate, picking at the food but eating a little more. It wasn’t much, but it was something.</p><p>And for now, something was enough.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The silence between them stretched, thick with things left unsaid. Agatha watched as Rio absently pushed her toast around the plate, eyes unfocused, her mind clearly elsewhere. She wanted to reach for her, to pull her back, but she knew now wasn’t the time.</p><p>Not when Rio was still raw from everything that had happened.</p><p>Not when she was still carrying Alice’s near-death like it was etched into her skin.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, shifting her weight. She thought about the past weekend, about the way her stomach had twisted when she spotted Jordan sitting in his car outside her house, watching. She’d felt her heart hammer in her chest, a cold dread creeping up her spine. He hadn’t done anything—hadn’t approached, hadn’t spoken—but he hadn’t needed to. His presence alone had been a reminder. A warning.</p><p>She should tell Rio.</p><p>She wanted to.</p><p>But as she looked at her now, still shaken, still struggling to push down the weight of what had happened to Alice, Agatha knew she couldn’t. Not yet.</p><p>She wouldn’t make the same mistake as before, though. She wouldn’t shut Rio out completely.</p><p>Taking a slow breath, Agatha reached out, resting a hand lightly on Rio’s arm. “Hey.”</p><p>Rio blinked, finally looking up.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze, steady and open. “We can talk. If or when you’re ready.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a long moment, something flickering behind her tired eyes. Then, finally, she gave a small nod. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, fingers curling slightly on the edge of the table. The distance between them—so unfamiliar, so heavy—made her chest ache. They were walking on eggshells, careful and uncertain in a way that neither of them had ever been before. And it just about killed her.</p><p>She cleared her throat, voice quieter than she intended. “Do you want me to go?”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up, startled. Her brows pulled together as if the question hadn’t even crossed her mind.</p><p>Agatha held her breath, bracing herself for whatever came next.</p><p>Rio blinked, her expression shifting—hesitation, something close to disbelief, then something softer. She exhaled, rubbing a hand over her face before shaking her head. “No,” she said, voice rough with exhaustion. “I don’t.”</p><p>Agatha felt something in her chest unclench. She nodded, slow and careful. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers drummed idly against the table, a restless energy still lingering in her. “I know I’ve been—” She sighed, shaking her head like she didn’t know how to put it into words. “I just—”</p><p>“You don’t have to explain,” Agatha said gently. </p><p>Rio’s jaw tensed. She looked away for a moment, then back at Agatha. “No, no. I just… don’t want you to think I don’t want you here.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. She reached across the table, hesitating for only a second before covering Rio’s hand with her own. “I don’t,” she murmured. “I just don’t know how to help.”</p><p>Rio looked down at their hands, then flipped hers over so their fingers curled together. “Just stay.”</p><p>It was barely more than a whisper, but it was enough.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand. “Okay.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>The quiet stretched between them, the soft flicker of the screen casting shadows across the room. Rio’s gaze wandered, but her mind seemed far away, her thoughts weighing heavier than the light atmosphere the comedy was trying to provide.</p><p>She shifted slightly, a quiet sigh escaping her lips. After a moment, she spoke, her voice soft but tinged with something deeper. “I miss Nicky,” she admitted, her eyes briefly meeting Agatha’s before drifting away again. “I’ve been so caught up in everything… and I miss him. I miss how things used to be.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, her heart warming as she listened to Rio’s words. There was something about hearing Rio talk about Nicky with such longing that made Agatha feel closer to her, like she was opening up in a way that only came when someone truly cared. She reached out instinctively, her hand resting lightly on Rio’s, a quiet gesture of reassurance.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha murmured, her voice soft. “I see how much you care for him, Rio. He’s lucky to have you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her throat tight. “I just want to make sure he’s okay. I’ve been away for a few days now, and I… I don’t know. I guess I’m not sure if I’m doing this whole ‘family’ thing right. If I even should.”</p><p>Agatha’s entire demeanor softened and she squeezed her hand gently. “You’re doing just fine, sweetheart. He loves you, and he’s growing up with a role model like you. He’s lucky to have you in his life, just like you’re lucky to have him.”</p><p>A silence fell again, but this time it felt lighter, like a weight had been lifted just a little. Rio shifted again, her eyes lowering to her lap as her fingers played with the edge of the blanket. After a moment, she let out a quiet breath, as if letting something out that she had been holding in for far too long. “And… I miss you, Agatha,” she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper, but it hit Agatha like a wave. “I don’t know what I’m doing anymore, but I know I miss you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, warmth flooding her chest as she looked at Rio, the vulnerability in her eyes more than enough to silence any other thoughts. She leaned closer, brushing a lock of hair from Rio’s face.</p><p>“I miss you too,” Agatha said, her voice soft, almost tender. She gave a small, wry smile, a hint of self-consciousness creeping in as she added, “I’m just following your lead here.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened as she looked at Agatha, and for a moment, everything else seemed to fade away—the worries, the confusion, the pain. It was just the two of them, finding solace in the quiet, in the shared understanding that things weren’t perfect, but they were still trying.</p><p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” Rio murmured, “but I want to figure it out… with you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her thumb brushing against Rio’s hand in a gentle, reassuring motion. “We’ll figure it out. Together.”</p><p>

  <p>
  <span>Rio blinked slowly as the morning light filtered through the curtains, the warmth of Agatha’s presence next to her pulling her from the depths of sleep. Her gaze shifted to Agatha, who was still sleeping soundly beside her, her features soft and peaceful in the early light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hadn’t expected this — hadn’t expected to wake up with Agatha beside her, to find herself tangled in the quiet comfort of her presence after everything that had happened. She never thought the first time Agatha would sleep in her bed would be under such fragile circumstances. It wasn’t the start she’d imagined for them, but somehow, it was the beginning they had found.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her heart ached, the remnants of the conversation they’d had the night before still lingering in the air, as raw and tender as the moments between them. They were still walking on eggshells, still trying to find their footing in the aftermath of everything, and it hurt more than Rio had expected. But despite the fragility, there was a quiet understanding between them now. They didn’t need to rush into fixing everything; they just needed to be together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stared at Agatha for a moment longer, her heart swelling with emotions she wasn’t sure how to put into words. The hurt and betrayal she’d felt when Agatha hadn’t told her about Jordan’s threat was still there, still heavy, but it was tempered by something deeper, something more potent: the undeniable ache of being without her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had only been three days. Four, now. But every second without Agatha had felt like an eternity. She couldn’t imagine living without her again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand moved slowly to where Agatha’s rested beside her, her fingers brushing against the older woman’s. The simple contact sent a spark of warmth through her, a reminder of the tenderness between them that she still held onto. Despite everything, the connection was still there, fragile but real.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She loved Agatha. So much that it hurt sometimes. But this was worth fighting for. They were worth fighting for.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want this,” Rio whispered to herself, her voice barely a breath, but it felt like a declaration. She didn’t know exactly how they were going to navigate the mess they were in, didn’t know how long it would take to get through everything, but she knew she wanted to try.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wanted to fight for them, for their love, for their future, whatever that might look like. Because with Agatha beside her, the world felt a little less heavy, and she felt like she could take on whatever came next.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, she just stayed there, watching Agatha’s peaceful expression. Her heart ached a little at how still and tender Agatha looked, how vulnerable in that quiet, unspoken way. Rio couldn’t believe how much she had missed this—her, Agatha, just being close to her like this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After everything that had happened, everything they’d been through, it was hard to believe they were still here, still connected. But Rio wasn’t ready to let go, not yet, not after everything that had passed between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She reached out, her hand trembling slightly, but she didn’t pull back. Her fingers traced the curve of Agatha’s face, brushing against her cheek as she caressed her, almost like it was instinct. She could feel Agatha’s warmth beneath her touch, the gentle rise and fall of her breath. Rio closed her eyes for a second, savoring the moment, feeling the soft weight of Agatha’s presence like a lifeline.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha stirred, blinking her eyes open, Rio met her gaze immediately. There was so much unspoken in that look, so much that neither of them knew how to say just yet. But Rio felt the warmth in Agatha’s gaze, the understanding, and it made her heart skip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t stop herself from smiling faintly, her thumb continuing to glide over Agatha’s cheek. She hadn’t meant to say it, but the words just slipped out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I missed you,” she whispered, her voice low, almost hesitant. It felt strange to admit, to say it aloud, but it was true. She missed her so damn much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression softened, her eyes flickering with emotion. Rio felt something shift in her chest at the sight—something that felt like hope, like maybe everything wasn’t as broken as it had seemed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re here,” Agatha whispered, the words heavy with something Rio couldn’t quite place but felt deep in her bones. “You’re here with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded slowly, her heart pounding in her chest. “Always,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. The words felt natural, as though that was exactly what she had always known she wanted to say, even before she had the courage to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She moved then, closing the gap between them, her lips hovering just a breath away from Agatha’s. For a moment, everything was suspended—her heartbeat, her breath, her thoughts—until Agatha’s hand reached up to gently cup her face, urging her closer. And Rio couldn’t help herself. She leaned in, pressing a soft, lingering kiss to Agatha’s lips, a kiss full of all the things she hadn’t known how to say. It wasn’t perfect. It was messy, just like them, but it was real.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally pulled away, Rio let her forehead rest against Agatha’s, her breath shaky. She closed her eyes and sighed, feeling the weight of everything they had been through, everything they hadn’t yet said, but also feeling a fragile, growing peace settle in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Rio whispered, her voice small but filled with gratitude. “For being here. For not giving up on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s arms moved to hold her, pulling her closer, and Rio let herself melt into her embrace. “I’m not going anywhere,” Agatha murmured softly. “We’re not giving up on us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for the first time in what felt like forever, Rio allowed herself to believe that—really believe it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart was racing, her thoughts a whirlwind. The closeness between her and Agatha was everything she wanted, but it was also the thing that scared her most now. There were still so many things left unsaid, and the weight of them felt too heavy to ignore any longer. They couldn’t keep going like this, not when there was so much between them, unresolved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a deep breath, pulling back slightly to look Agatha in the eye. The vulnerability was thick in the air, but there was something else, too—determination. If they were going to move forward, they needed to talk, really talk. They had to lay everything out on the table. It was the only way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Rio started softly, but her voice was steady. “I need to know everything. About Jordan’s threat. All of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha froze, her body tensing slightly, like she was about to pull away. Rio could see the flicker of hesitation in her eyes, and for a moment, it felt like all the air was sucked out of the room. But she kept her gaze on Agatha, waiting, giving her the space to speak, knowing this wasn’t going to be easy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should’ve told you sooner,” Agatha said quietly, her voice filled with regret. “I thought… I thought I could handle it myself, and I didn’t want you to worry, especially after everything else we’ve been through. But that was wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio reached out, her fingers brushing over Agatha’s hand. She wasn’t angry. She understood the impulse to protect, but they were in this together now. That was the point. They couldn’t build anything if they didn’t have complete honesty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can handle it,” Rio replied, her voice firm, though it softened at the end. “But I can’t handle not knowing. If we’re going to fight for this, for us, then I need to know. Everything, Agatha. I don’t care how ugly it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, looking away for a moment before finally meeting Rio’s gaze again. There was a heaviness in her eyes, and Rio’s chest tightened in response. She could see the weight Agatha had been carrying, the burden of this secret. But it wasn’t just her burden anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Agatha said, taking a breath. “Okay, here’s the truth. Jordan… he’s been blackmailing me. He found out about us. He threatened to report me to Lilia, saying he had proof of our relationship, and he demanded my mentorship and access to the OR, or he’d go to Lilia immediately. He has screenshots of our texts, pictures, everything. He’s been following us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s breath hitched as the realization hit her. Jordan had been stalking Agatha. Watching them. Taking pictures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He… he had pictures of us? He showed them to you? Like, you actually saw them?” Rio asked, her mind spinning. She could feel the anger rising, the sickening weight of what had been done to them, to Agatha. Her heart squeezed for Agatha—how she must have felt, how alone she must have been trying to deal with this by herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Agatha admitted, her voice barely audible. “He’s been watching. I’m so sorry, Rio. I should’ve told you. I was just trying to keep you safe from all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio squeezed her eyes shut for a moment, trying to take it all in. She wanted to rage, to lash out at Jordan, but it wasn’t going to help anyone. She had to stay grounded, stay calm—for Agatha, and for them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with this alone,” Rio said quietly, her voice cracking as the words left her mouth. “But we’re in this together now, okay? We’re going to fix this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, the relief in her eyes so clear it almost broke Rio’s heart. It was like Agatha had been holding her breath, waiting for Rio to understand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Agatha whispered, her voice soft. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned in again, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s. “You’re not going to have to find out,” she said with certainty. “We’re going to handle this. Together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The weight of the moment settled between them, the air thick with everything they had just laid bare. But Rio felt something shift inside her—something solid, something unshakable. They weren’t hiding anymore. No more secrets. No more fear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were going to fight for this. For their love. For their future.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And no one—especially not Jordan—was going to take that from them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a deep breath, clearly struggling with the weight of what she was about to share, but Rio’s unwavering gaze gave her the strength to keep going.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s something else,” Agatha said quietly, her eyes dropping to their joined hands. “Something that really rattled me. This weekend… Jordan was outside my house. I saw him. Sitting in his car.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt a shiver run down her spine at the thought. “What?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. “He was… just sitting there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her jaw tightening. “Yeah. He wasn’t doing anything but watching my house. I was so scared. I had to act, so I took pictures. I hid behind the curtain, tried to stay out of sight. I wanted to show the police, to have evidence in case I needed it. But the whole thing was just… terrifying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her stomach churn, the image of Jordan lurking outside Agatha’s house, stalking her, sending a wave of protectiveness over her. “You were alone,” she murmured, her heart aching for Agatha. “You didn’t tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha met her eyes, a vulnerability she rarely showed surfacing in her expression. “I couldn’t. You were already dealing with so much. You asked for space. I couldn’t just throw this at you. And when you showed up in my office yesterday… I’d just spoken to the lawyer about everything. I was still trying to figure out what the next step was, and then… you were there, and I just wanted to focus on you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio took a moment to process this. Agatha had been dealing with so much—Jordan’s threats, the pressure of legal action, and then Rio had just shown up, demanding to know everything. She should’ve been more patient, more understanding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you shouldn’t have been alone with all of this,” Rio said softly, squeezing Agatha’s hand. “I should’ve been there. I should’ve known.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled faintly, her fingers brushing over Rio’s. “I didn’t want to drag you into it. I thought I could handle it on my own. But I know now that I don’t have to. You’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked down for a moment, letting the weight of what Agatha had gone through settle in. The image of Jordan sitting outside Agatha’s house, the threat hanging over her head, was enough to make her blood boil. He had been trying to control her, intimidate her. And yet, here was Agatha, still standing strong, fighting back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did the right thing,” Rio said, her voice firm. “Going to the lawyer, filing the report. We’re gonna handle this together, Agatha. No more secrets, no more pretending everything’s fine. We’re in this together. All of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s gaze softened, a flicker of something deep and unspoken passing between them. She nodded, her voice low. “I’m glad you’re with me, Rio. I really am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio squeezed her hand, her heart swelling with affection and determination. “Always.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t help herself. As she watched Agatha move around the kitchen, flipping pancakes with such effortless grace, an overwhelming sense of affection surged through her. Without thinking, she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist from behind, pulling her close. Agatha tensed at first, clearly startled, but she quickly relaxed into Rio’s embrace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rested her cheek against the back of Agatha’s shoulder, her voice barely above a whisper. “I love you so much,” she murmured, feeling the weight of those words settle in her chest. She closed her eyes, trying to focus on the moment, on the warmth of Agatha’s body against hers. “Please, let’s not fight ever again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stilled for a heartbeat, and Rio could feel the way her breath caught. When Agatha turned in her arms, their eyes met, and Rio felt the pull of her gaze deep in her chest. She had never been so vulnerable, and yet, in this moment, she felt an undeniable closeness that made everything else seem distant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands gently cupped her face, and Rio’s heart skipped a beat as she saw the hesitation in her eyes. Then Agatha pulled her in, their lips meeting in a soft, almost tentative kiss. Rio melted into it, feeling the weight of all the tension, the uncertainty, the fear, and the love that had been building between them. This kiss was everything. It was an apology, an understanding, a promise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally broke apart, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s, her heart still racing. Agatha’s voice was gentle as she spoke, and Rio could hear the sincerity in every word. “I’m sorry. I— I never wanted to hurt you. You’re everything to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tightened her grip around Agatha, the words sinking deep into her. She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the emotional rawness of it all. She didn’t want to dwell on what happened, not now. She just wanted to hold on to this moment, to the connection they shared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you didn’t mean to,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with emotion. She pulled Agatha in for another kiss, this one slower, deeper, like she was trying to tell Agatha everything she couldn’t put into words. “But I’m glad we’re here, now. I don’t want to go through anything like that again either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a long moment, the world outside disappeared. It was just the two of them, their hearts beating in sync. All the misunderstandings and hurt seemed to melt away, and in that quiet, peaceful space, they both found comfort in each other’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pancakes could wait.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio reluctantly pulled herself away from Agatha’s embrace, the warmth of their closeness still lingering. As much as she wanted to stay in her arms, to show Agatha how much she loved her, to lose themselves in each other’s touch and forget the world outside, there was still reality waiting for her. Her heart sank just a little at the thought of leaving Agatha’s side, but she knew she couldn’t put off what she had to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gently cupped Agatha’s face, leaning in for a soft kiss before pulling back. “I need to get to class,” Rio said, her voice quieter than usual, a mixture of regret and necessity. “And I want to check in on Alice, see how she’s doing. I can’t keep avoiding that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her hand lingering on the small of Rio’s back as she met her gaze. “I understand,” she replied, her voice soft but steady. “I have a consult with a patient later today, but I’ll check in with the lawyer again about Jordan. I’ll keep you posted on what the next steps are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave a slight nod, appreciating Agatha’s dedication to everything that was happening. “I’ll be waiting for your updates,” she said, her eyes lingering on Agatha, reluctant to leave her presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled, a slight sadness in her expression. “I’ll keep you in the loop,” she promised. “And hey—” She paused, her eyes softening as she looked at Rio. “Let me know if you need anything. Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, her heart lightening a little. “I will. And, uh…” she hesitated, but the words came naturally after a second. “You can wear some of my clothes if you want. I know you didn’t bring anything extra.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow playfully. “Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed softly, brushing a hand through her hair. “Yeah, I’m sure. I’d rather you be comfortable. And look better on you, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “You’re something else,” she said fondly. She leaned in for one last kiss, her lips brushing lightly against Rio’s before she pulled back. “Alright, I’ll take you up on that offer. Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched as Agatha headed to the bathroom, a feeling of tenderness spreading through her chest. Even with everything going on, this felt right. They would handle everything—together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched Agatha move to the bathroom, but before she could fully step through the door, Rio called out softly, “Hey, you can take a shower if you want. Towels are in the cabinet, and you can help yourself to anything in my closet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned back to her with a soft smile. “Thanks,” she said, her voice warm. “I’ll be quick.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Rio wasn’t ready to let her go just yet. There was still a bit of uncertainty in the air, but beneath it, Rio felt the pull between them, that undeniable connection. Agatha was already under so much pressure, dealing with the aftermath of Jordan’s actions, and Rio couldn’t help but feel like they needed this—something just for them, to reaffirm that, despite everything, they were still together. Not just physically, but emotionally. They had been through so much already, and Rio needed to prove to herself that nothing had changed between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stood up from the bed, slipping over to the bathroom door. For a moment, she hesitated, but then, gathering her courage, she pushed it open, stepping inside just as Agatha was adjusting the water temperature in the shower.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha blinked in surprise but didn’t pull away. “Rio?” she said, her voice a little uncertain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I… I just want to be with you,” Rio said, her voice low and earnest. “It’s not about… anything else. I just need to feel close to you. We’ve been through so much, and I don’t want any of this to get in the way of what we have. We’re still us, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression softened, the vulnerability in Rio’s eyes catching her off guard. She let out a breath, a soft smile tugging at her lips. “Of course we are. We’re still us. And I need that too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped closer, and this time, Agatha didn’t pull away. They stood there for a moment, just looking at each other, each one searching the other’s eyes for reassurance, for the same unspoken truth—that despite the chaos, despite the fear and the uncertainty, they were still here. Together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without a word, Rio gently placed her hand on Agatha’s shoulder, her thumb grazing the soft fabric of her shirt before it trailed up to her neck. Agatha closed her eyes briefly, and Rio’s heart swelled at the quiet moment of trust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped closer, her hand gently resting on Rio’s hip, pulling her just a little nearer. Their faces were only inches apart, and Rio could feel the warmth of Agatha’s breath on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you,” Rio whispered, her voice steady but filled with longing. “I just… need you to know that. I don’t want anything to come between us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips curved into a small, reassuring smile. She leaned in, brushing a soft kiss across Rio’s forehead before pulling her into an embrace. “I love you too,” she murmured, her voice full of tenderness. “And nothing is going to change that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her eyes, allowing herself to lean into Agatha’s embrace, savoring the quiet intimacy between them. No words were necessary; the connection between them spoke louder than anything else ever could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stood in the parking garage, the cool concrete beneath her feet matching the weight in her chest. She watched Agatha as she approached her car, both of them knowing that saying goodbye was inevitable, but neither of them wanting to let go. The last few days had been nothing short of a whirlwind, and even now, standing here, Rio still felt like she was trying to make sense of everything that had happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should probably avoid riding together for a bit,” Rio said, her voice thick with everything left unsaid between them. She didn’t want to be here in the parking garage, didn’t want to be apart, but they both knew it was for the best.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her eyes full of understanding. “Yeah. It’s safer this way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hated the distance between them, the cold separation that had become necessary for their own protection. But there was nothing else to be done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Agatha started to open her car door, Rio reached out, touching her arm gently. She could feel the tension between them, the reluctance to part. Her voice came out softer than she intended. “I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to be apart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha paused, turning to look at her with a quiet intensity. “I know. I don’t either.” She moved closer, her fingers brushing Rio’s cheek in a way that made Rio’s heart beat faster. “But we’ll make it through this, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her throat tight. She wanted to tell Agatha so many things — how much she loved her, how much she hated the thought of being apart, how she feared what might happen if they couldn’t find a way to make this work. But all that came out was a soft, almost desperate whisper. “Just… stay safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped closer, her hand finding Rio’s and holding it like she might never let go. “I will. You too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned in, her lips finding Agatha’s in a kiss that was tender, almost hesitant. It wasn’t a kiss of urgency or passion. It was the kind of kiss that told them both they weren’t ready to say goodbye, not yet. It lingered, slow and soft, as if time had stopped for a moment, just for them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally pulled away, their foreheads touched, both of them breathing a little heavier, eyes closed for just a moment. Rio didn’t want to open her eyes, didn’t want to step away. But they had to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Call me,” Rio said, her voice still thick with emotion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With one last look, Rio turned toward the elevator, her heart aching with every step away from Agatha. But she knew this wasn’t the end. It couldn’t be. They were in this together. They just needed time. And for the first time in a while, Rio felt like maybe that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Rio entered the classroom, the tension in the air was immediate. She felt the weight of Jordan’s gaze before she even saw him. It was like a physical pressure, his eyes boring into her as she walked down the aisle between the rows of desks. Her heart pounded, anger coiling in her chest, but she kept her head high, not letting him see how much he rattled her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wanted to scream at him, to call him out right there in front of everyone. To ask him what the hell his problem was, why he thought he could threaten her and her life with impunity. Her fingers itched to grab him by the collar and shake him, to demand answers. But she wouldn’t give him the satisfaction. She wouldn’t let him see how deeply he had gotten under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, Rio held her composure, walking straight to her seat as if nothing were wrong, as if the knot in her stomach wasn’t threatening to undo her. She could feel his eyes following her, like a shadow, even as she sat down. He was watching her, trying to make her uncomfortable, trying to push her buttons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She clenched her jaw, doing everything she could to focus on the lecture as the professor began speaking. But she couldn’t shake the feeling of Jordan’s presence lingering behind her. He was like a dark cloud in her peripheral vision, and she had no idea how much longer she could stand it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t just the threat to Agatha, the looming danger hanging over them both. It was the sheer audacity of Jordan. The smug satisfaction he seemed to take in making her feel small, in trying to control her. He was trying to intimidate her, to make her doubt herself, and she refused to let him win. Not today.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as she sat there, trying to breathe and focus on the lecture, the anger still simmered beneath her skin. One thing was for sure: she wasn’t going to let him get away with this. She wouldn’t let him tear her and Agatha apart. Not if she could help it. And maybe, just maybe, she was going to make sure he regretted ever trying to play this game with her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s phone buzzed in her pocket, snapping her out of her angry haze as she tried to focus on the lecture. She glanced down at the screen, her heart skipping a beat when she saw Jen’s name. The text was simple: Alice is awake and alert.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A rush of relief flooded through her, so overwhelming that she nearly collapsed in her seat. She quickly shoved her phone back in her pocket, trying not to let her emotions spill over, but she felt lighter, as if the weight that had been crushing her chest had finally eased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the class passed in a blur. She barely heard what the professor was saying, her mind only focused on getting to the hospital, on seeing Alice alive and awake. When the professor finally dismissed the class, Rio was already halfway out the door before anyone could stop her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t even care about getting there just in time for visiting hours—she had to see Alice </span>
  <em>
    <span>now</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The drive to the hospital felt like an eternity, and when she finally arrived, she rushed through the corridors, barely pausing to acknowledge the nurses at the front desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand shook as she pushed the door to Alice’s hospital room open, the weight of the moment almost too much to bear. She had been running on adrenaline all day, but now that she was finally here, with Alice awake and alive, it was hard to stop the tears from welling up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Alice’s eyes met hers, Rio’s breath caught in her throat. The woman in front of her was battered and bruised, but she was alive. That was all that mattered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Alice</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with emotion. She could hardly bring herself to speak, afraid if she did, the floodgates would open. “Oh my god, Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice blinked a few times, as if trying to process what was happening. Her lips curled into a small, tired smile, but her eyes were soft, a little confused but mostly reassuring. “Hey, girl,” she rasped, her voice hoarse. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was when it hit Rio, like a freight train, the real emotion of it all. She had almost lost Alice. She had been this close to having her best friend slip away, and the weight of that nearly crushed her. She felt tears sting her eyes, but she didn’t fight them, didn’t try to hold them back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without thinking, she moved closer to Alice’s bed, sinking down into the chair beside her. She just needed to be near her. Needed to touch her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t scare me like that ever again, do you hear me?” Rio finally managed, her voice breaking. She gripped Alice’s hand tightly, as if she could anchor herself in this moment and make sure nothing would change. “I thought I lost you. I—I had to perform CPR on you, Alice. You stopped breathing, and I…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her words trailed off, choked by the rush of emotions that threatened to overwhelm her. She didn’t know how to explain it, how to put into words how terrifying it had been to work on her best friend, to feel that weight in her chest as she desperately tried to bring her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice’s hand squeezed hers back, the only real sign that she was truly there. “I’m sorry,” Alice whispered, her voice shaky now, more from the strain of her own emotions than anything physical. “I didn’t mean to worry you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, more tears slipping down her face. “You didn’t mean to, but you did,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I—I don’t even know how I kept it together. I just… I couldn’t think, Alice. I was so scared. But you’re here. You’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice’s face softened, her exhaustion finally taking over as she closed her eyes for a moment. “I’m here,” she confirmed, her voice quieter now. “I’m sorry for putting you through that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward, resting her forehead against Alice’s hand, feeling the cool touch of her skin, grounding herself. “I’m just glad you’re okay. I don’t know what I would’ve done without you.” She paused, realizing how close she was to breaking down again. “I couldn’t have lost you. Not like that. Not on my watch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice opened her eyes again, her expression full of affection and understanding. “You wouldn’t have,” she promised softly. “Hey, I’m tougher than I look.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a shaky laugh, but it didn’t last long. She wiped her eyes quickly, trying to regain some composure. “I’ll be right here. I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice’s smile was faint, but it was there. “You’ve got your own stuff going on, Rio. You don’t need to sit here with me all day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head vehemently. “Oh yeah? Watch me, I’m staying with you whether you like it or not. At least for a little while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so, they sat there for a while, the silence between them comfortable in its own way, both of them processing what had just happened. Rio needed to stay in the moment, needed to hold onto the fact that Alice was breathing, that she was alive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she left Alice’s room, a sudden burst of relief came over her, and it wasn’t just for Alice—it was for herself, for her own heart that had been holding its breath all weekend. She texted Agatha, her fingers a little unsteady, and then hurried to her car.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Alice is awake. She’s gonna be okay. I need to see you.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Her phone buzzed almost immediately. </span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m so relieved to hear that. Want to come by for a late lunch? Swing by my practice? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t even have to think about it. She was already on her way to Agatha. She texted back that she would love to, a genuine smile starting to tug at the corners of her lips for the first time in what felt like days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, things were starting to feel like they might be okay again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands gripped the steering wheel as she navigated the streets toward Agatha’s private practice. The text from Agatha was still fresh in her phone, the address clearly laid out, but Rio couldn’t quite focus on the directions. Her mind felt like a whirlwind, a storm of tangled thoughts and emotions she couldn’t quite untangle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The relief she felt when she saw her friend awake, alive, was still making her heart beat a little faster. She had almost lost her, and the terror of that moment still clung to her. But Alice was going to be okay. It had to be enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then there was Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As much as Rio tried to keep things clear in her head, it was hard to ignore how she felt about Agatha. After everything that had happened between them—the kiss, the tension, the misunderstandings, and the emotional baggage they both carried—it all felt like it had been leading to this moment. Being with Agatha again, holding her, talking to her, even just sitting together and letting the silence do the work—it felt right. But still, there was so much to navigate. Rio knew that, deep down. They were starting from a place of raw honesty, but there was a lot left unsaid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then there was Jordan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The looming threat that made Rio feel uneasy every time her mind wandered to him. She hated that someone like him could manipulate, control, and intimidate Agatha like that. She hated that he was still in their lives, that his dark shadow lingered over everything they tried to build. But Agatha was strong, and Rio knew that. They would deal with him. Together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as she turned onto the street where Agatha’s practice was, Rio’s chest tightened again, and it wasn’t from any of the threats, or fears, or doubts—it was the way her love for Agatha had intensified since they’d gotten back together. It was like a dam had broken, flooding her chest with a love so fierce, so strong, she didn’t even know how to keep up with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last few days, when Agatha wasn’t around, had been unbearable. She hadn’t realized just how much she needed her. But now that they were back in each other’s lives, it felt like everything was falling into place—like everything they had been through only made this moment, right here, more precious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was no longer just a teacher, no longer a mentor. She was someone Rio couldn’t imagine her life without. And that realization, powerful and overwhelming, left Rio breathless every time she thought about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She parked in front of the building, her heart racing with anticipation. She needed to see Agatha again, needed to feel that warmth, that grounding presence. She needed to feel like things were real, like this—them—was real.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She texted Agatha that she’d arrived and then took a deep breath, bracing herself for whatever came next. There were so many things she wanted to say to her, but she didn’t know where to start. There was still so much to figure out. Yet, somehow, just knowing that Agatha was here, that they were both willing to try again, felt like the most important thing in the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Stepping out of the car, she straightened her shoulders, pushing aside the confusion and the weight of all that had happened. She had her love for Agatha. And that was enough for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Rio walked into the building, the sleek, modern decor made her feel like she was stepping into another world. It was a sharp contrast to the cozy, intimate spaces they’d shared in her apartment, but it was still Agatha’s—professional, polished, yet undeniably hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she stepped up to the front desk, she was greeted by an older woman with kind eyes and a professional demeanor. “Hello, you must be Rio,” the woman said with a smile, her tone warm but efficient. “I’m Sharon Davis. Dr. Harkness is expecting you, dear. You can go right in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio offered a quick, appreciative smile, still feeling a little out of place in the pristine office. She thanked Sharon before heading down the corridor to Agatha’s door. When she reached it, her pulse quickened. She could feel the weight of the day lifting as she was finally, finally about to be with Agatha again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knocked softly before opening the door, her heart already racing in anticipation. The moment it clicked shut behind her, she didn’t think—she just moved. Her feet carried her across the room, and before Agatha could even react, Rio was on her, cupping her face and pulling her into a kiss so deep, so fierce, that it felt like a floodgate had opened inside her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kiss was unrestrained, raw with all the emotion that had built up in the hours and days they’d been apart. Rio needed Agatha, needed to feel her close, to pour every ounce of love, longing, and frustration she’d been holding back into this one moment. The world outside, the worries, the tension—it all faded as she lost herself in Agatha’s embrace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha responded with equal intensity, her hands finding Rio’s waist, pulling her even closer. Rio could feel her breath coming in sharp bursts as they kissed, a mixture of urgency and tenderness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally pulled away, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s, her fingers still tracing the curve of her jaw. Her voice was shaky, almost hoarse, as she spoke. “I love you so much, Agatha. I couldn’t stand being apart from you anymore. It’s like—it’s like everything inside me’s been waiting for this moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes softened, her hand lifting to gently touch Rio’s cheek. “I feel the same way,” she murmured, her voice laced with emotion. “I’ve been… so afraid, but this—us—this is what matters.” She took a deep breath, her thumb brushing across Rio’s skin, her gaze steady and warm. “I’ll never let you go again. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, her heart swelling with emotion. The weight of everything that had been left unsaid seemed to melt away in that moment. No more doubts, no more hesitation. They were here, together, and that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned in and kissed her again, slower this time, more deliberate, as if to savor the moment. Rio melted into the kiss, letting the love and relief wash over her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they finally pulled away from the kiss, Agatha nodded toward the containers of Thai food neatly set out on the table. “I figured you’d like a warm meal,” she said softly, her voice a comforting mix of practicality and tenderness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t help but smile, her heart swelling with affection. Agatha had thought of everything—just like she always did. She reached up and kissed Agatha’s cheek in gratitude. “Thank you,” she murmured, before walking over to the plush, modern couch across from a massive floor-to-ceiling window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The view from the 30th floor was nothing short of breathtaking. Rio paused for a moment to take it all in, her breath catching slightly as she gazed out at the shimmering expanse of the lake, stretching out in the distance. The buildings around her were a mix of modern steel and glass, their sharp angles and intricate lines reflecting the sky. It was beautiful, but there was something about the view that felt almost surreal—a reminder of how far they had come and how much more was still ahead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha joined her shortly, taking a seat beside her on the couch, still wearing the remnants of her professional demeanor, but Rio could see the softness in her eyes. There was comfort here. A sense of home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they unwrapped the containers, Rio couldn’t help but smile at the spread—sushi, pad Thai, a selection of spring rolls—and the thoughtfulness behind it all. She took a bite, savoring the familiar flavors as Agatha did the same, but her eyes kept flicking back to Agatha, that steady pulse of affection rising in her chest once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a quiet moment, Agatha’s voice broke the comfortable silence. “You’re really okay, aren’t you?” She asked it so gently, as if the question had been lingering on her mind for a while. “After everything that’s happened with Alice, and… with Jordan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced out the window again, trying to gather her thoughts. Her life had felt like it was spinning out of control for so long—between Alice’s accident, the threat from Jordan, and everything in between. But sitting here with Agatha, in this moment of peace, she felt a sense of clarity she hadn’t known in days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am,” Rio said softly, her voice full of quiet resolve. “It’s been a lot to process, but… I’m okay. And I’m grateful that you’re here. That we’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her hand resting gently on Rio’s. “I’m here,” she echoed, squeezing her hand reassuringly. “For as long as you’ll have me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a deep breath, her fingers wrapping around her cup of tea before she began speaking again. “So, I talked to the lawyer yesterday,” she said, her voice calm but serious. “She recommended that we file for a restraining order against Jordan. With the way he’s been behaving, and the fact that he was sitting outside my house and threatening me, it’s the safest thing to do. He also advised that we go ahead and officially disclose our relationship to Lilia and the university. It’s the only way to get ahead of this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brow furrowed, processing what Agatha was saying. “What do you mean, disclose it to the university? Like, make it official?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her gaze steady on Rio. “Yes, exactly. It means going to Lilia together and officially telling her about us. I know it’s a big step, and I know it’s not something we planned for, but if we do this now, if we tell the university officially, then if and when Jordan files a complaint, it’ll be dismissed because they’re already aware of our relationship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her chest tighten at the idea. The prospect of making their relationship public like this felt like a leap she wasn’t sure she was ready to take. “And what if Lilia doesn’t approve? What if she—” Rio stopped herself, uncertain how to voice the concern, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha interrupted gently, her voice warm but firm. “Lilia already knows. She’s been more than aware of us for a while. This is just the formal step to make it official, so it’s on record. It’s about protecting us both and making sure there’s no ambiguity if Jordan tries to use this against me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a slow exhale, still digesting everything. The idea of putting themselves on the university’s radar like that was intimidating, but Agatha was right. If they didn’t act now, the situation could only get worse. “So, we do this together. Tell Lilia, get the restraining order, and deal with whatever happens next.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave a small nod, her eyes softening as she gazed at Rio. “Yes. It’s the only way to stay ahead of him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio met Agatha’s gaze, her heart steadying at the strength and certainty she saw in her eyes. “Okay. Let’s do it. We’ll face this together, no matter what.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>Agatha watched as Rio sat beside her, her face tense with focus as they went through the online forms for the restraining order. Agatha took the lead, carefully filling in every detail about Jordan’s threats, the blackmail, and how he had been stalking her outside her home. She uploaded the photos she had taken from her window, her fingers tightening on the mouse as the memory of that night crept back in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio remained silent but seething. Agatha felt it in the way her jaw tensed, the way her knee bounced slightly against the leg of Agatha’s desk. When they finally submitted the request, a heavy silence settled between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s done,” Agatha murmured, leaning back in her chair. She let out a slow breath, but the tension in her shoulders didn’t ease.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled sharply through her nose, then ran a hand over her face. “Now we wait?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. “Yes. If the judge grants the emergency hearing, we’ll have something in place soon. If not…” she trailed off, not wanting to voice the alternative just yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clenched her jaw. “Then we fight for a regular hearing as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached out, her fingers finding Rio’s. She squeezed gently. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, they just sat there, holding onto each other. Then, Agatha glanced at the time. “We should head to Northwestern. We still need to talk to Lilia.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a deep breath, nodding. “Yeah. Let’s get this over with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They gathered their things and left Agatha’s practice, both knowing that the next few hours could change everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled into the faculty parking lot at Northwestern, her fingers tight around the steering wheel. The drive from her private practice had been mostly quiet, both of them lost in thought. Filing for the restraining order had been one thing—an official step forward, a tangible action. But now came the next hurdle: disclosing their relationship to the university before Jordan could weaponize it against them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced over at Rio as she shut off the car. She looked exhausted, tension still pulling at the corners of her mouth, but she was here. She was standing beside Agatha, ready to face this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They made their way through the halls, heading toward Lilia’s office. It wasn’t their first time here, but today felt different. The weight of what they were about to do hung between them like a storm cloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wait outside Lilia’s office stretched on, the weight of what they were about to do settling heavily in Agatha’s chest. She could feel Rio’s tension beside her—the way her knee bounced restlessly, the way she kept exhaling sharply, like she was trying to release some of the nerves coiling inside her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha understood. This wasn’t just about them anymore. It was about safeguarding their careers, about controlling the narrative before someone else twisted it. About making sure that, whatever happened next, they stood on solid ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Miriam, Lilia’s assistant, barely spared them a glance as she typed away at her computer. “She’s finishing up a meeting. Shouldn’t be long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded and sat down. Rio followed, shifting in her seat, fingers tapping an absent rhythm against the fabric of her jeans.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then a familiar chime broke the silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled out her phone, expecting something mundane—an update from Wanda, maybe, or a message from Nicky’s school. But when she glanced at her screen, her breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>1 New Email – Subject: Neuro OR Selections – Finalized</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was from Dr. Patel, the only one of her colleagues who hadn’t yet sent in his final picks. She hadn’t expected his selections so soon—he’d said he would take his time deciding—but now, here it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A small coil of anticipation formed in her stomach as she opened the email. Her eyes scanned the message, heart hammering against her ribs.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Selected Students for the OR Observation based on presentation delivered on December 18th and student history:</span>
  </em>
</p><ul>
<li><em><span> Rio Vidal</span></em></li>
<li><em><span> Daniel Cho</span></em></li>
</ul><p>
  <span>For a split second, she couldn’t breathe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then relief hit her like a wave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned to Rio, unable to keep the small smile off her lips. “You got it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The OR spot for the surgery.” Agatha tilted her phone toward her. “You got it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s breath stilled. She stared at the screen as if the words weren’t quite registering. Then she exhaled, shaky and disbelieving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Holy shit</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s smile softened. “Congratulations.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a half-laugh, half-sigh, running a hand through her hair. “I—I can’t believe it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chest tightened in the best way. She had seen firsthand how much Rio had wanted this, how hard she had worked. This moment—seeing the stunned joy on her face—made everything worth it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she could say anything else, Miriam’s voice cut through the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dr. Harkness, Lilia will see you now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt Rio’s hand brush against hers as they stood. It was subtle, almost instinctive, like she had reached for her before remembering where they were.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t take her hand, but as they walked into Lilia’s office, she wished she could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia leaned back in her chair after Agatha and Rio finished explaining, her fingers steepled together as she let out a sharp breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is absolutely unacceptable,” she said, her voice clipped. “Thomas Jordan is a menace, and if he wasn’t already skating on thin ice with his performance in the program, I’d—” She cut herself off, shaking her head. “But we have to be careful about how we handle this. You’re right to want to get ahead of him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted in her chair, already tense. “We need to disclose our relationship officially.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia nodded. “Yes, that’s the cleanest way forward. And that means changes.” She turned to Rio. “You’ll need to switch mentors.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio had braced herself for this, but the words still landed like a punch to the gut. “I—” She exhaled slowly. “Right. That makes sense.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat straighter. “Lilia—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Agatha,” Lilia interrupted, firm but not unkind. “You know this is the best option. If you two are serious about this—and I have no doubt that you are—then we have to eliminate any conflicts of interest. Jordan won’t have a leg to stand on if Rio is no longer your mentee.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio ran a hand down her face, grounding herself. She had worked so damn hard on her research with Agatha. The thought of starting over with someone else made her stomach churn. But this wasn’t just about her project anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll do it,” she said, voice steadier than she felt. “But I still get to keep my OR spot, right? The list just came out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely,” Lilia assured her. “Your selection was merit-based and chosen by a committee.. That stands. As for Neuro II, I’ll assign you to another class.” She paused, thoughtful. “Dr. Meyer. She’s excellent, and I know she’ll take you on. The semester is only starting, so it won’t make that big of a difference.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, jaw tight, but she didn’t protest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia’s gaze softened slightly. “I know this isn’t ideal, but it protects both of you. The university can’t be blindsided by Jordan filing a complaint. By disclosing first, we take that power away from him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, tension lining her shoulders. “And what about him? We’ve filed for a restraining order.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me know as soon as you hear back about the hearing,” Lilia said. “In the meantime, I’ll speak with Dr. Olsen. If Jordan so much as breathes in either of your directions, we’ll be prepared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exchanged a glance with Agatha, and despite the ache of giving up their mentorship, she knew this was the right choice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached for her hand under the desk, squeezing lightly. Rio squeezed back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll make it clear that this disclosure is coming from you, not from a complaint. That puts us in control of the narrative. And given that Jordan is already trying to blackmail you, we need to eliminate any leverage he thinks he has,” Lilia continued and Agatha nodded, feeling Rio’s thumb gently caressing her hand in an attempt to calm them both down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, that sounds good,” Rio said, her voice quiet and resigned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the best way to protect both of you. It doesn’t mean you stop working on your project, just that Agatha won’t be your official advisor anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha glanced at Rio, whose jaw was tight, but she gave a small nod.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia clasped her hands together. “I’ll call Dr. Olsen now. You two sit tight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olivia Olsen’s office exuded the same composed authority as the woman herself—dark wood, shelves lined with medical journals and framed accolades, and a floor-to-ceiling window that overlooked the city skyline. She sat behind her desk, impeccably dressed in a deep blue blazer, her expression unreadable as she regarded them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had met her several times over the years, as she was the Dean of Medicine, but never like this. Never with stakes this high.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beside Dr. Olsen, Lilia sat with her hands folded neatly in her lap, her usual sharp eyes softened just a fraction. But there was no mistaking the tension in the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Dr. Olsen said, her voice smooth but firm, “you’re both here to formally disclose your relationship.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave a small nod. Rio, sitting stiffly beside her, barely moved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate the honesty,” Dr. Olsen continued. “It makes handling this situation significantly easier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled sharply through her nose and muttered, “Easier for who?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olsen’s dark eyes settled on her, unwavering. “For all of us. The cleanest way forward is for you to be reassigned to a different mentor and a different professor for Neurology II.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s jaw tightened. “So I lose everything I’ve worked for.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia sighed. “No one is taking your research away from you, Rio. We’ll ensure that your new mentor is someone who supports your goals. As for Neuro II, I’ll personally oversee your transition to another professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t change the fact that this isn’t fair,” Rio shot back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olsen sat forward slightly, hands clasped on the desk. “I understand why this feels like a punishment. But let me be clear—this is about protecting you. If we do this now, on our terms, Thomas Jordan has no case against Dr. Harkness or you. We remove his leverage completely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s throat bobbed as she swallowed. “And if I refuse?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olsen didn’t hesitate. “Then if Jordan files a complaint, the university will be forced to investigate, and you both risk far greater consequences. This way, we control the narrative.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha finally found her voice, quiet but certain. “She’s right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned to her, eyes stormy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wished she could tell her otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stared at Agatha, the betrayal flickering across her face like a slow burn. Agatha felt it in her chest, sharp and deep, but she held her gaze steady. She wasn’t choosing the university over Rio. She was choosing to protect them both.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olsen leaned back in her chair, giving them space. “This isn’t easy,” she said, her voice measured. “And I won’t pretend that it is. But Dr. Harkness is right. If you fight this, you’re giving Thomas Jordan exactly what he wants—an opening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled harshly, rubbing a hand over her jaw. She looked to Lilia, then back at Dr. Olsen. “Who would my new mentor be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia exchanged a glance with the dean before answering. “Dr. Simon Patel. He’s in neuro-oncology, but his background in neurodegenerative diseases makes him a strong fit for your research.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s shoulders tensed. Agatha knew why. Patel was a brilliant researcher, but he wasn’t Agatha. He wasn’t the mentor Rio had chosen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Neuro II?” Rio asked, voice tight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll assign you to Dr. Lena Meyer,” Lilia said. “She’s tough, but fair. You’ll still be set for your rotations and clinicals as scheduled.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a slow, heavy breath. “And the OR spot?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silence stretched between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olsen’s eyes softened just a fraction. “You were selected by a panel, not just Dr. Harkness. And I hear it was a unanimous choice. So that stands.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her eyes, letting a heavy breath in relief. When she opened them again, she looked at Dr. Olsen. “And if Jordan still reports Agatha after all this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then he loses all credibility,” the dean said simply. “The university will see it for what it is—retaliation. And he will face the consequences for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t respond right away. She drummed her fingers against her knee, exhaling through her nose before finally nodding. “Fine. Let’s do it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt a pang in her chest at those words, but she swallowed it down. This wasn’t about her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Dr. Olsen said, brisk and efficient now. “Lilia will start the paperwork immediately. Dr. Patel will be notified today. You’ll meet with him soon. And as of next week, you’ll be in Dr. Meyer’s class for Neuro II.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t move. Didn’t even blink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there anything else?” Dr. Olsen asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, frustration coming off of her in waves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olsen smiled sympathetically. “We’ll give you two a minute alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia glanced at Dr. Olsen, who gave a curt nod before rising from her chair. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood as well, but Rio didn’t move, her fingers laced tightly together in her lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll be right outside,” Lilia said before stepping out with Dr. Olsen, the door clicking shut behind them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment they were alone, Agatha sat back down, her heart heavy. “Rio—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know what this feels like?” Rio’s voice was quiet, but there was a sharp edge to it, one that Agatha knew was barely holding back something deeper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed. “Tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a humorless breath, shaking her head as she ran a hand over her face. “It feels like I’m losing everything I worked for.” She looked up then, her dark eyes raw with emotion. “I fought so hard for this, Agatha. For you as my mentor. For your guidance. And now I have to give that up because some asshole decided he wanted to ruin us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, reaching out instinctively, but Rio flinched. Not away from her, but just enough that Agatha froze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know this isn’t fair,” Agatha said, keeping her voice steady. “I know this is cruel. And if I could take this from you, if I could carry the weight of it instead, I would.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clenched her jaw, looking away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But this is the best way to protect us both,” Agatha continued. “To make sure Jordan doesn’t have any leverage over us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a slow breath. “And if he still comes after you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chest ached. “Then the university will handle it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silence stretched between them, heavy and unresolved. Then, finally, Rio’s shoulders slumped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you just—” Her voice wavered, and she shut her eyes for a second before looking back at Agatha. “Can you just hold me for a second?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t hesitate. She moved closer, wrapping her arms around Rio, pulling her in as Rio buried her face against her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so tired,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pressed a kiss to her hair. “I know, baby.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stayed like that, wrapped in each other, as the weight of it all settled between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stayed in the embrace for several moments, the quiet of the office wrapping around them like a cocoon. Agatha could feel Rio’s breath slow, the tension in her body softening under the comfort of her touch. Agatha wanted to say more, to make Rio feel better, but words seemed inadequate in the face of all that was unfolding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled back slightly, just enough to look at Agatha, her eyes glistening with unspoken emotions. “I hate that it has to be this way,” she murmured, her voice thick with frustration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hate it too,” Agatha admitted, her heart heavy. “But we’re doing this together. And whatever happens, we’ll face it together, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded slowly, her fingers finding Agatha’s once more. “I’m just scared. I’m scared of losing you, of losing this… of everything I’ve worked for.” She looked at Agatha with a vulnerability that tugged at her chest. “But I can’t lose you. I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gently cupped Rio’s cheek, her thumb brushing across her skin. “You won’t. I promise you, I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door to Lilia’s office creaked open, and they both looked up as Dr. Olsen and Lilia reentered. Dr. Olsen’s expression was unreadable, but Lilia’s gaze softened when she saw them together, her concern palpable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll make sure you stay on track,” Dr. Olsen added. “You’re still a top student in our program, Rio. Nothing about your ability or your passion for the work changes or is being questioned here. This… this situation doesn’t define you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes softened, but there was still a flicker of doubt. “I just don’t know if I can keep doing this—pretending like nothing’s wrong. It feels like I’m giving up part of myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia leaned forward, her voice firm but understanding. “I won’t sugarcoat it, Rio. This isn’t easy. But the more proactive you are in handling it, the stronger you’ll be. I’ve seen the way you fight for what you care about. I have no doubt you’ll get through this.” She paused, letting her words sink in. “But if you want to make it out of this with your career intact, you need to be strategic. And that means we need to be honest with the university, right now, before Jordan has a chance to escalate anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s stomach churned at the thought, but she nodded. “I agree. We’ll do it together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia looked at them both, her expression softening just a bit. “Good. We’ll take it one step at a time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olsen stepped back, her voice quiet but reassuring. “And we’ll support you every step of the way. We’ll make sure that everything is handled with care and professionalism.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With that, the conversation shifted into more logistical details, but the weight of their discussion hung in the air. It wasn’t over. It wasn’t going to be easy. But for the first time in a while, Rio felt like maybe—just maybe—there was a way forward. A way to hold on to what mattered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the meeting came to a close, Agatha and Rio stood, and Agatha gently touched Rio’s arm. “Let’s go home,” she said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio met her eyes, a small but genuine smile forming. “Yeah. Let’s go home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Agatha and Rio walked through the door of Agatha’s house, the familiar scent of lavender and clean linen filled the air, but it couldn’t wash away the tension that still lingered. Rio kicked off her shoes and settled on the couch, leaning back with a sigh, her eyes tired but still full of so much emotion—frustration, love, and fear. Agatha stood in the kitchen for a moment, her hands on the counter as she took a deep breath, trying to steady herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, her phone buzzed on the kitchen counter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her stomach dropped when she saw the notification, the text from her lawyer’s office confirming the bad news: “Emergency hearing denied. Formal hearing scheduled for January 25th at 10am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stared at the message for a moment, her chest tightening. Rio had already taken a seat on the couch, but the room felt heavier now, the quiet between them more oppressive. Agatha’s hands trembled as she set the phone down, running her fingers through her hair. The feeling of helplessness gnawed at her. Two weeks. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Two weeks. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She couldn’t believe it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio must have seen her reaction, because she got up and crossed the room, her eyes searching Agatha’s face. “What’s wrong?” she asked, her voice full of concern.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t even have to say it. She didn’t need to explain. Rio read her expression, her face falling as she put the pieces together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Denied,” Agatha whispered, her voice heavy. “The emergency hearing was denied. We have to wait two weeks for the formal one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled, sinking onto the couch, her face darkening with frustration. “That’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>bullshit</span>
  </em>
  <span>. How can they just… leave you hanging like that? With that asshole out there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, feeling her own frustration rising. “I don’t know. It’s just the way the system works. And now we have to wait, while he’s out there, doing God knows what.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio reached for her hand, squeezing it tightly. “I’m sorry, Agatha. I know this is tough. But we’ll get through it. We have to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked down at their joined hands, then back up at Rio’s face. “I want to believe that. I do.” She ran her other hand over her face, wiping away a tear that had silently fallen. She hadn’t even realized it was there. “But waiting… it’s just hard. It’s like everything’s out of my control.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled Agatha close, wrapping her arms around her. “I know. But this? It’s not forever. We’ll make it through these next two weeks, and when that hearing happens, we’ll be ready. I promise you, I’m here for you. All the way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha buried her face in Rio’s shoulder, finding comfort in the warmth of her embrace. In this moment, the outside world seemed to fade, and all that mattered was the strength of the woman holding her. The weight of everything they’d been through, of everything that still loomed over them, was still there, but for now, in the quiet of Rio’s arms, Agatha allowed herself to feel a flicker of peace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll be okay,” Rio said, almost like a vow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her arms tightening around Rio. “Yeah. We will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they pulled away from the embrace, Rio’s concern didn’t fade. She looked at Agatha, her brow furrowing. “Do you need me to go pick up Nicky fro you? He’s still at Wanda’s, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha paused, taking a deep breath before shaking her head. “Wanda said she can keep him for now, while we figure this out. But I’ll definitely get him tomorrow. He’s probably confused, too, with everything that’s been happening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded in understanding. She’d seen how much Nicky meant to Agatha—how deeply she loved him. She couldn’t imagine the stress Agatha was feeling, balancing all of this with the worry about her son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes softened as she spoke about Wanda keeping Nicky for dinner, but before she could say anything else, Rio murmured, “Then let me take care of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words lingered in the air between them, charged with a quiet intensity that made Agatha’s chest tighten. Her gaze met Rio’s, a mix of gratitude and longing flickering across her face. She hadn’t realized how much she needed this—this simple gesture, this reminder that despite everything, they were still each other’s anchor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped a little closer, brushing her thumb gently over Agatha’s knuckles. “Let me take care of everything tonight,” Rio said softly, her voice a quiet promise. “You’ve been carrying so much, love. Let me help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart ached with the weight of the day’s events, but the tenderness in Rio’s voice was enough to ease some of the tension. She nodded, her breath shaky, and for the first time in what felt like forever, she let herself lean into the warmth of Rio’s presence, trusting her to guide them through this difficult moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Agatha whispered. “Just… be here with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s answer was a simple kiss, a slow, comforting press of lips against Agatha’s, as if to say that they were in this together. When they pulled apart, Agatha’s eyes searched Rio’s, seeing both strength and vulnerability in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m here,” Rio whispered. “Always.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood there, the air between them thick with emotion, but the tension of the day still pulsing through her veins. She watched Rio carefully, the tenderness in her eyes never faltering. After a beat, she leaned in, her lips brushing against Rio’s in a soft but deliberate kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio responded immediately, pulling Agatha closer, her hands sliding around her waist. Agatha let herself melt into the kiss, allowing Rio to take control, to deepen the connection. She moaned softly as Rio’s lips moved down her jawline, trailing hot, lingering kisses that made her pulse race.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to take care of you,” Rio murmured between kisses, her voice low and heated. She cupped Agatha’s face gently, her thumbs caressing her cheekbones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart was thudding, her body alive with the heat of Rio’s touch. It was like a spark had been lit between them, and now there was no turning back. She pressed her body closer, feeling Rio’s warmth against her, her heartbeat syncing with hers. The room seemed to shrink as everything else faded away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without thinking, Agatha found herself tugging at Rio’s shirt, fingers desperate to feel her skin. Rio followed her lead, her hands sweeping over Agatha’s body, pulling her into a deeper kiss that left them both breathless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me,” Rio whispered, and before Agatha could respond, she was gently guiding her back toward the couch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They tumbled onto the soft cushions, Rio straddling Agatha’s lap. The sensation of Rio’s body against hers was electric, every movement setting Agatha’s nerves on fire. She groaned as Rio ground against her, her hands slipping under Agatha’s shirt, warm and firm on her skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached up, tangling her fingers in Rio’s hair as their kisses grew more urgent, more desperate. Her breath caught as Rio’s hands roamed, touching, exploring, as if they were rediscovering each other all over again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need you,” Agatha gasped, her voice rough, her body aching for more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio paused, her forehead resting against Agatha’s, their breaths mingling as they caught their bearings. “Are you sure?” she asked, her voice soft but filled with intensity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart was racing, her body burning with the need to be close to her. “Yes,” she whispered, her hands pulling Rio back down, kissing her with everything she had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for the first time in a long time, everything else in the world faded into the background as they lost themselves in each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They moved together, slowly at first, each touch a reassurance, each kiss a confirmation that they were here, together, despite everything. Agatha’s hands roamed over Rio’s back, pulling her closer, wanting to feel her more, to hold onto this moment as tightly as possible. Rio’s touch was gentle but insistent, her hands trailing over Agatha’s body with an urgency that mirrored the storm of emotions inside her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The weight of the past few days—the threats, the uncertainty, the fear—seemed to vanish as they connected in this way, grounding each other in something tangible, something real. Rio moved with a careful tenderness, as if she could feel Agatha’s fragility, her vulnerability, and wanted to protect it. Her lips brushed against Agatha’s neck, a soft trail of kisses as Agatha’s fingers dug into the back of Rio’s shirt, tugging it off with shaky hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve missed this,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “Missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart fluttered at the words, her hands roaming to Rio’s face, holding her there, kissing her deeply, fiercely. “I’ve missed you, too,” she breathed out between kisses. “More than you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands slid down Agatha’s torso, her touch firm and sure, and Agatha’s body arched in response. She closed her eyes for a moment, letting the sensations wash over her, focusing on Rio, on the way they fit together so perfectly, like they were meant to be in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With every kiss, every touch, they were reaffirming something they had both been afraid to confront—something they were both desperate to hold on to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio paused for a moment, her eyes soft but burning with desire. “You’re safe with me,” she whispered. “I’ll protect you. I’ll never let anyone hurt you again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chest tightened, emotion swirling within her. She cupped Rio’s face, her thumb brushing over the smoothness of her cheek. “I know,” she whispered back, her voice thick with gratitude and longing. “And I’ll do the same for you. I’m here. Always.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words hung in the air between them, a promise, a bond, sealing the connection that had always been there but was now stronger than ever. It wasn’t just about physical desire—it was about something deeper, something that transcended the fear and the chaos that had threatened to tear them apart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In that moment, they were simply two people who loved each other, who wanted nothing more than to be together, to hold on to each other through whatever came next.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha woke up slowly, the morning light streaming through the blinds, casting soft shadows across the room. Her body felt warm, relaxed, for the first time in days, with Rio nestled in her arms. It was the first time since their fight that they’d shared this kind of closeness, and it felt… right. Her fingers gently brushed a strand of Rio’s hair away from her face as she watched her sleep, her breath steady and even.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hadn’t been an easy few days. They’d both been through so much—Jordan’s threat hanging over them, the tension between them, and the weight of everything unresolved. But now, here they were. Together, in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As much as Agatha had wanted to keep things practical, to maintain distance to avoid making any more mistakes, she couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of peace. Her arms instinctively tightened around Rio, holding her just a little bit closer, as though she feared if she let go, it would all slip away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stirred slightly in her sleep, her face softening, lips parting in a quiet sigh. Agatha smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. There was so much she wanted to say, to apologize for—so much that needed to be said. But for now, she was content with just being here. The future would come soon enough, with all its challenges, but today… today they had each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She closed her eyes, allowing herself to just breathe in the moment, savoring the peace, knowing that they had overcome a lot to get here, and that they still had a long way to go. But as she held Rio in her arms, she finally felt that they were going to be okay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stirred against her, a quiet hum slipping past her lips as she nuzzled closer, her body instinctively seeking out Agatha’s warmth. Agatha couldn’t help but smile, tracing slow, lazy circles along the bare skin of Rio’s back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning,” Rio murmured, voice husky with sleep as she blinked up at Agatha. Her dark eyes were still heavy-lidded, soft in the early light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha brushed her fingers through Rio’s hair, smoothing it back gently. “Morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, they just looked at each other, the weight of the last few days still lingering between them, but it wasn’t as sharp anymore. The wounds were still there, but they weren’t bleeding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled, pressing her forehead against Agatha’s shoulder. “I missed this,” she admitted quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart clenched. She tilted Rio’s chin up so their eyes met. “Me too,” she said, no hesitation in her voice. “So much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio searched her face for a long moment, like she was memorizing every line, every quiet promise between them. Then she sighed, nuzzling into Agatha’s neck before pressing a soft, lingering kiss there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As much as I’d love to stay in bed all day,” Rio murmured, lips brushing against Agatha’s skin, “I need to check on Alice before class.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed in understanding, though she didn’t loosen her arms around her just yet. “And I need to pick up Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled at that, warm and a little wistful. “Give him a hug from me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will,” Agatha promised, pressing a kiss to Rio’s forehead. “And you’ll see him soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, then sighed. “Guess that means we should actually get up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unfortunately.” But neither of them moved right away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, though, Rio stretched, her fingers skimming along Agatha’s waist before she pulled back with a grin. “Come on, professor. Let’s face the day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes at the teasing, but she smiled, watching as Rio slid out of bed. No matter what the day ahead held, at least now, they were facing it together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Agatha drove Nicky to school, she could feel his eyes on her, his usual chatter subdued. He kicked his feet lightly where they dangled from his booster seat, fingers drumming against his backpack.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, he broke the silence. “Mom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” She glanced at him in the rearview mirror, catching his hesitant expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s going on?” His voice was quieter than usual, uncertain in a way that made her chest tighten. “You’ve been weird. And Rio’s been gone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tightened her grip on the steering wheel, exhaling slowly. She’d known this conversation was coming—she just hadn’t figured out how to put everything into words that wouldn’t worry him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s been… some complicated things happening at work,” she said carefully. “And I needed to figure some things out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky frowned. “Is that why Rio hasn’t been around?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is she coming back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s throat tightened at the way he asked it—hopeful, but guarded. Like he wasn’t sure if he’d like the answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, baby,” she said firmly. “She’s coming back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That earned her a little smile in the mirror, but his brows were still furrowed. “And the complicated things?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m handling it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky was quiet for a moment, then said, “I don’t like it when you’re sad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha inhaled sharply. “Oh, sweetheart.” She reached back at the next red light, squeezing his knee. “I know the last few days have been different, but I promise, everything is okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky studied her, like he was trying to decide if he believed her. Then he sighed. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could tell he wasn’t completely convinced, but when they pulled up to his school, he leaned forward and kissed her cheek before hopping out of the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you, Mom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you too,” she murmured, watching as he ran toward the school doors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Agatha drove away, she exhaled slowly, her chest still tight. Nicky was too perceptive for his own good. And as much as she wanted to protect him from everything going on, she knew he felt the shift in their world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She just hoped, in the end, she could prove to him that everything really would be okay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had barely stepped into her office at Northwestern when she heard the sharp, purposeful click of shoes behind her. She had just enough time to set her bag down before a voice, venomous and seething, lashed out at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>You bitch</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her spine went rigid. She turned slowly, her face carefully blank, even as her pulse picked up. Thomas Jordan stood in the doorway, his face flushed with fury, his chest rising and falling with the force of his breathing. His hands were clenched at his sides, fingers twitching like he was barely restraining himself from lunging forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A fucking restraining order?” he spat, stepping inside, closing the door behind him. “Are you out of your fucking mind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha inhaled steadily through her nose. She had expected him to retaliate – after all, she knew he would be notified about the hearing – but she hadn’t expected him to be this unhinged so quickly. She squared her shoulders, keeping her voice level. “Leave my office, Mr. Jordan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His lip curled. “You think you can just—just </span>
  <em>
    <span>destroy</span>
  </em>
  <span> me like this? Do you have any idea what you’ve done?” His voice rose, barely restrained rage vibrating through it. “You think you’re untouchable, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched a brow. “I think you should leave before you make this any worse for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan let out a sharp, bitter laugh, running a hand through his disheveled hair. “You’re unbelievable.” He took a step closer, and she held her ground. “You really think you’re in control here? That you can just file some bullshit paperwork and I’ll disappear?” His eyes gleamed with something dark, something dangerous. “I’m just getting started, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers curled against the desk. “Is that a threat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a promise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her stomach tightened, but she refused to let him see even a flicker of fear. He leaned in slightly, voice dropping to a hiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to play dirty? Fine. You have skeletons, Harkness. We all do. And I swear to God, I will find every single one of yours. You will regret this. You think your career is safe? That little student of yours? Your little toy? I’ll make sure she goes down with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A cold fury ignited in Agatha’s chest, simmering beneath her composed exterior.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan tilted his head, eyes raking over her with open disdain. He smirked. “This isn’t over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, with one last sneer, he turned and stalked out, slamming the door behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled slowly, forcing the tension from her muscles, but her mind was already racing ahead. This was escalating faster than she had anticipated. He wasn’t just cornered—he was desperate. And desperate men did dangerous things.</span>
  <em>
    <span>.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span> Agatha’s hands were steady as she unlocked her phone, but beneath the surface, her heart was hammering. She refused to let Jordan see how much he’d rattled her, but the way he’d spat his threats—like a cornered animal, furious and unpredictable—made her stomach twist.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Jordan just confronted me in my office. He’s furious about the restraining order and made serious threats. We need to talk.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She hovered over the send button for only a second before pressing it. Lilia needed to know immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it wasn’t enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her thumb hesitated over her screen before she opened her messages with Rio. She didn’t want to worry her—not when Rio had already been through so much—but keeping this from her wasn’t an option. Jordan had made it clear that he intended to drag them both down, and Rio needed to know exactly what they were up against.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Jordan came to my office. He’s furious. Made threats. I’m fine, but I wanted you to know.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She stared at the message for a beat before hitting send. Then she took a slow, deep breath, grounding herself, before she straightened her shoulders and walked to her desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <br />

  <p>
  <span>Rio was in the middle of reorganizing the ambulance’s supply bags when her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out with one hand, expecting a message from Alice or maybe a group text from one of her classmates.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, she saw Agatha’s name.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Jordan came to my office. He’s furious. Made threats. I’m fine, but I wanted you to know.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s blood ran cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her grip on the IV bag tightened as her pulse skyrocketed. She read the message again, then again, as if the words would somehow change. But they didn’t. Jordan had confronted Agatha—he’d threatened her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, you good?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will’s voice barely registered as Rio tossed the IV bag aside and ripped off her gloves. “I need a minute.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stepped out of the rig, her breathing shallow, hands shaking as she called Agatha. It rang twice before going to voicemail.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried again. Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew Agatha had probably silenced her phone—maybe she was in a meeting, maybe she just couldn’t talk—but that didn’t stop Rio’s mind from spinning out. What if Jordan was still there? What if he was waiting for her after class? What if he was actually dangerous?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She texted back, fingers moving fast.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Are you safe? Where is he now?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The three dots appeared. Disappeared. Came back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her heart pounded.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m fine. He left. I’m in my office</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fine. Agatha said she was fine. But Rio wasn’t buying it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shoved her phone back into her pocket and clenched her jaw, trying to steady herself. Jordan wasn’t going to stop. He’d made that clear. And Rio was done waiting for him to make the next move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will had been restocking the trauma bags when he glanced up and caught sight of Rio’s face. His easygoing expression shifted immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rough text?” he asked, closing the compartment and leaning against the rig.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s jaw was tight, her shoulders tense like she was barely keeping herself in check. She exhaled sharply through her nose before running a hand over her face. “Jordan showed up at Agatha’s office. Threatened her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will straightened. “Are you serious?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She just texted me. Said she’s fine, but—” Rio’s fingers curled into fists. “I don’t know, man. This guy doesn’t know when to fucking quit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will let out a low whistle. “Damn. What do you want to do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled harshly, pacing a step away from the rig. “I don’t know.” She wanted to drive straight to Northwestern, to see Agatha with her own eyes, to make sure she was actually okay. But she also knew she couldn’t just abandon her shift.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled out her phone again.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>I need to see you. Are you staying in your office?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s reply came quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I have class in a couple of hours, but I’ll be here until then</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That wasn’t good enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted her gaze to Will. “I need to get out of here for a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will studied her for a second, then nodded. “Go. I’ll cover for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up at Will, her jaw still clenched. “Come with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will raised an eyebrow. “We taking the rig?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded sharply. “Yeah. In case we get a call.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will didn’t hesitate, already grabbing his radio as he followed her to the ambulance. “Let’s roll.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The drive to Northwestern was tense, the siren silent but the weight in Rio’s chest deafening. Her fingers flexed on the steering wheel, her grip tight as she maneuvered through traffic. Will didn’t say much, but his presence was grounding, a steady force beside her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they pulled up outside the medical school, Rio barely put the rig in park before unbuckling her seatbelt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will shot her a look. “You wanna take a breath first?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled sharply through her nose. “I just need to see her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will nodded, then unbuckled his own belt. “Then let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stepped inside, the familiar scent of antiseptic and polished floors greeting them. Rio’s gaze darted around as they made their way toward Agatha’s office. Her heart pounded, every step fueled by the lingering fury from Agatha’s text.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan had threatened her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Rio was done letting that bastard get away with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they reached Agatha’s office, Rio turned to Will. “Wait out here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will gave a curt nod, positioning himself just outside the door. “Got it. I’ll keep an eye out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t bother knocking. She pushed the door open and stepped inside, her eyes immediately landing on Agatha. She was standing near her desk, arms wrapped around herself, tension written all over her face. The second their gazes met, something inside Rio cracked wide open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without hesitation, she crossed the room and pulled Agatha into a crushing hug. She held her tight, her arms locking around her as if she could shield her from everything—Jordan, the university, the entire damn world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stiffened for half a second before melting into her, her fingers clutching the back of Rio’s uniform. She exhaled shakily against Rio’s shoulder, and that sound alone nearly brought Rio to her knees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got you,” Rio murmured, pressing her lips to the side of Agatha’s head. “I’ve got you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t say anything at first, just held onto Rio like she was the only thing tethering her to the ground. Rio ran a soothing hand down her back, feeling the tension coiled in her muscles, the way Agatha’s breathing hitched unevenly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was here,” Agatha finally whispered, her voice raw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Rio murmured. “I got your text.” She pulled back just enough to cup Agatha’s face, searching her expression. There was anger there, frustration, but beneath it all, Rio saw exhaustion. “Did he touch you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, but her jaw was tight. “No. But he wanted me to be scared. And it worked.” Her fingers curled into Rio’s uniform, gripping tight. “I hate that it worked.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest ached with the need to fix this, to make it right. But she wasn’t a cop, wasn’t a lawyer. All she could do was be here, stand between Agatha and whatever storm was coming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t get to win,” Rio said fiercely. “We’re filing that restraining order. He’s going to have to answer for this. And you’re not alone in this, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed hard, her hands sliding down to Rio’s arms. “I don’t want you caught in the middle of this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, but there was no humor in it. “Agatha, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>am</span>
  </em>
  <span> in the middle of this. He’s coming after you because of us. Because he’s a pathetic excuse of a man who can’t handle rejection.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A muscle in Agatha’s jaw twitched, and Rio saw her fighting to hold herself together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey.” Rio’s voice softened, her hands steady on Agatha’s waist. “You don’t have to be strong right now. Just let me be here for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, her forehead dropping to Rio’s shoulder for a moment. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, lucky for you, you’re never going to have to find out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sharp knock at the door made them both tense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will’s voice came through. “You good in there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave Agatha one last reassuring squeeze before stepping back. “Yeah,” she called out. “Just a minute.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned back to Agatha, her voice firm. “Come on. Let’s get out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, straightening her shoulders, the steel returning to her spine. She was still shaken, still raw—but she wasn’t alone. And Rio would make damn sure she never felt like she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced at Will as they stepped outside, the cool breeze doing little to settle the fire simmering in her chest. He gave her a knowing look and jerked his head toward the ambulance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll wait in the rig,” he said. “Give you two some space.” Then, with a pointed smirk, he added, “But you owe me coffee. And something sweet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed, shaking her head. “Yeah, yeah. I got you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will grinned, but his eyes flickered toward Agatha, assessing her the same way Rio had been doing since she’d walked into that office. Whatever he saw must have been enough, because he didn’t push. Just gave Rio a nod before heading off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed beside her. “You didn’t have to come all the way here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shot her a look as they started toward the campus café. “Are you serious? You think I was just gonna sit back and wait for an update after you told me that asshole cornered you in your own office?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled slowly, her arms crossing over her chest. “I’m fine, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed. “Yeah, you keep saying that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t argue, which told Rio everything she needed to know. She wasn’t fine. But she wasn’t ready to break, either.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The café was tucked in one of the quieter parts of campus, and the line was mercifully short. Rio ordered their drinks, along with a pastry she knew Will would appreciate, before nudging Agatha toward a table by the window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they sat, Rio reached for Agatha’s hand, running her thumb over her knuckles. “Talk to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha studied their hands for a long moment before finally speaking. “I hate that he got to me,” she admitted, voice low. “That I let him rattle me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “That’s not on you. He’s the one in the wrong. You did the right thing filing that restraining order.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips pressed together. “And it didn’t do a damn thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yet,” Rio corrected. “But it will. He’s desperate, Agatha. He knows his days of getting away with this shit are numbered.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha met her eyes then, something unreadable in her gaze. “And what if that just makes him more dangerous?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio squeezed her hand, her voice steady. “Then we deal with it. Together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha searched her face, then let out a breath, some of the tension in her shoulders easing. “You always make it sound so simple.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “That’s ‘cause I don’t do complicated before coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A small, reluctant chuckle escaped Agatha, and Rio counted that as a win.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their drinks arrived, and for the first time in what felt like hours, Agatha took a real breath. Safe, for now. But Rio wasn’t letting her guard down. Not when she knew Jordan wasn’t finished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a slow sip of her coffee, her fingers curling around the cup like it was something solid to hold onto. But after a moment, her eyes flicked back to Rio’s, sharp and knowing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re still worried.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t even try to deny it. She just exhaled through her nose and took a sip of her own coffee. “Of course, I’m worried.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed, watching her. Then, as if sensing she needed a shift in focus, she asked, “How’s Alice doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s shoulders eased just slightly at the change in subject. “Better. She’s awake and alert. Still in the ICU for observation, but the doctors are optimistic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, the tension in her face softening a bit. “That’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Rio said, tapping her fingers against her cup. “She’s already complaining about the hospital food, so that’s a promising sign.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a small chuckle, and Rio felt the corners of her own lips twitch. “She’d hate it if she knew I was saying this, but Alice is the toughest person I know,” Rio added. “If anyone’s gonna come out of this okay, it’s her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s gaze was steady, warm in a way that made Rio’s chest ache. “You really care about her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “She’s my best friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers brushed against hers on the table, a quiet reassurance. “I’m glad she’s doing better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned her hand over, lacing their fingers together, grounding herself in the simple, steady presence of Agatha beside her. “Me too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, rolling her coffee cup between her hands. “Dr. Patel reached out to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha lifted a brow. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Rio nodded. “Said he wants to meet sometime this week to discuss my research.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tilted her head, studying her. “How do you feel about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled slowly. “I don’t know. I mean, I knew this was coming, and Dr. Patel is brilliant, but—” She hesitated, her fingers tightening slightly around her cup. “It’s not the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression softened. “I know.” She reached across the table, brushing the back of Rio’s hand with her fingertips. “But you’re going to do great. And whatever happens, you can always bounce ideas off me. Anytime.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked at her, a warmth settling in her chest at the quiet reassurance. Before she could say anything, her phone buzzed against the table. She glanced down and saw a text:</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Will Kaplan</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Call came in. Let’s go.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio cursed under her breath and looked back at Agatha apologetically. “I have to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded in understanding, but instead of staying behind, she stood and walked with Rio toward the parking lot. Their steps were quick, purposeful, but there was an ease between them now—something that hadn’t been there before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they reached the rig, Rio slowed her steps, reluctant to pull away just yet. Will was already in the driver’s seat, watching them with an amused expression through the windshield, but Rio barely paid him any mind. Instead, she turned to Agatha, eyes scanning over her face, taking in the soft lines of concern and something deeper—something warm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without thinking twice, she reached out, cupping Agatha’s face with both hands, and pulled her into a firm, lingering kiss. Agatha exhaled against her, her fingers curling lightly around Rio’s wrist, grounding them both in the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally broke apart, Agatha blinked up at her, a little breathless. “What was that for?” she asked, voice quiet but steady.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s lips curled into a small, teasing smirk, but there was nothing but sincerity in her gaze. “Because we don’t have to hide anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression softened, her thumb brushing absently against Rio’s wrist. There was something unspoken in her eyes, something that made Rio’s heart feel too big for her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sharp honk from the rig made her step back, and Will leaned out the window with an exaggerated sigh. “I hate to break up whatever’s happening here, but we’ve got a job to do, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, rolling her eyes, but before she climbed into the rig, she turned back to Agatha one last time. “I’ll call you later,” she promised.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, a quiet smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “Be safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Always,” Rio murmured before shutting the door behind her. The rig pulled out, sirens blaring into the crisp afternoon air, but even as they sped off, she could still feel the warmth of Agatha’s lips on hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Rio finally wrapped up her shift, exhaustion clung to her limbs, but the first thing she did was pull out her phone and text Agatha.</span>
</p><p align="right">

  <span>It didn’t take long for Agatha to respond.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Agatha</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m at Wanda’s for dinner. Want to stop by?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled to herself, already heading to her car.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Rio</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>On my way.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The drive to Wanda’s was short, but Rio still had enough time to think about how different things felt now. She and Agatha weren’t just something anymore. They were together. Official. The thought sent a warmth through her that even the exhaustion of her shift couldn’t dull.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time she parked outside Wanda’s house, she could hear laughter coming from inside. That alone eased some of the lingering tension in her chest. After everything that had happened, knowing that Agatha was somewhere safe, somewhere filled with warmth and familiarity, made her feel a little better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio knocked twice and waited, shifting on her feet. She could hear laughter from inside, the kind that came from easy company, from familiarity. It settled something deep in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door opened to Wanda’s raised brow and smirk. “Took you long enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed a tired laugh. “Some of us actually work for a living.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda snorted but stepped aside to let her in. The smell of home-cooked food filled the space, warm and inviting. Agatha sat at the dining table, a glass of wine in her hand, watching her with something unreadable in her expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio crossed the room and leaned down, pressing a kiss to her lips. It was brief but full of meaning. When she pulled back, Agatha’s fingers curled around her wrist, holding her there for just a second longer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was that for?” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, something quiet and certain in her chest. “I love that we don’t have to hide anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda made a dramatic gagging noise from the kitchen. “God, finally.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t bother hiding the small smile tugging at the corners of her lips. She gave Rio’s wrist a gentle squeeze before finally letting go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sit,” Wanda said, already grabbing another plate. “You look like you could use a decent meal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t argue. She pulled out the chair next to Agatha and sank into it with a content sigh. Now that she was here, surrounded by warmth and comfort, exhaustion started creeping in. It had been a long day—hell, it had been a long few weeks—but for the first time in a while, she felt like she could breathe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda set a full plate in front of her. “Eat before you pass out at my table.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked, picking up her fork. “You do realize this just means I’ll be back more often, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah,” Wanda said, waving a hand as she poured herself another glass of wine. “Just don’t expect me to start setting a place for you every night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled and dug into her food, nudging Agatha’s knee under the table as she did. Agatha glanced at her, something soft in her gaze, before returning to her wine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a little while, things felt normal again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio barely had time to set her fork down before she heard the quick shuffle of little feet on the tile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s voice was high with excitement as he ran straight into her side, throwing his arms around her waist. She barely managed to catch the glass Wanda had been handing her before she spilled it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whoa, bud!” Rio laughed, quickly setting the wine down so she could hug him properly. “Didn’t see you there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I missed you so much!” Nicky mumbled into her sweater, clinging tightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest ached at the sheer sincerity in his voice. She ran a hand through his curls, squeezing him close. “Missed you too, kid. What’s been going on? You holding down the fort for me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded against her. “Yeah, but it’s been boring.” He tilted his head up to look at her. “You weren’t here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a quiet sigh, but Rio didn’t look away from Nicky’s expectant face. She cupped his cheek lightly. “Well, I’m here now. And I wanna hear all about what you’ve been up to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s face brightened instantly. “I got a new book at the library! It’s about space.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, cool,” Rio said, grinning. “Think you could tell me all the facts before I leave?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can try!” Nicky said eagerly. “Wait here!” He pulled away and dashed out of the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched Nicky dart out of the kitchen, the soft patter of his footsteps fading as he disappeared down the hall. She shook her head fondly, but when she turned back, she found Agatha watching her with an expression she couldn’t quite decipher.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda, on the other hand, just smirked knowingly over the rim of her wine glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Rio asked, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She blinked, as if realizing she’d been staring, and shook her head slightly. “Nothing,” she said, but her voice was quieter than before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head, unconvinced. “You sure about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, glancing down at her own glass before meeting Rio’s eyes again. This time, there was something unmistakably tender in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He really missed you,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt something deep in her chest pull tight. She swallowed, glancing toward the hallway where Nicky had vanished before turning back to Agatha. “Yeah,” she said softly. “I missed him too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something flickered in Agatha’s expression—something vulnerable, something open. For a second, it looked like she wanted to say more, but then Wanda let out a quiet chuckle, breaking the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Wanda said, leaning back in her chair. “You’re in it now, kid. No backing out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed a laugh, but she didn’t look away from Agatha. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, her fingers tightening around her glass. Then, just as she started to speak, the sound of Nicky’s hurried footsteps filled the kitchen again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I found it!” he announced, holding up a thick book nearly as big as his torso. “Okay, Rio, I have so many things to tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, stretching her arms out. “Lay it on me, little man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Nicky climbed into the chair beside her, eagerly flipping through pages, Rio caught Agatha’s gaze once more. And this time, Agatha wasn’t looking away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky dove straight into an enthusiastic explanation about the book he was holding—something about space, black holes, and whether or not wormholes could actually exist. Rio listened with a grin, nodding along as he spoke, occasionally glancing at Agatha, who was still watching them with that same unreadable expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t say much, just sipped her wine, but there was something about the way she was looking at Rio and Nicky that made Rio’s chest feel strangely warm. Like she was witnessing something she hadn’t expected to see but also couldn’t look away from.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re really into space, huh?” Rio said, nudging Nicky’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duh,” he said, as if the answer was obvious. “I told Mom we should go to the planetarium again. But she’s been busy.” His little nose scrunched. “And also weird.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes flickered to Agatha, whose expression shifted in an instant. “Weird how?” she asked lightly, though Rio could hear the underlying tension in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky shrugged, flipping another page. “I dunno. Just… distracted. And kind of quiet.” He frowned, looking up at Agatha with a rare seriousness for his age. “Is everything okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breath hitched just slightly, but she recovered quickly. She reached over, smoothing a hand over Nicky’s hair. “Of course, darling,” she said, her voice softer than before. “Things have just been… a little complicated lately.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched as Nicky seemed to think about that for a second before nodding, accepting the answer for now. But then his gaze flicked back to Rio, and he grinned. “But at least Rio’s here now!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, her fingers tightening around her wine glass again. Wanda, still leaning back in her chair, shot her a knowing look over the rim of her own glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked, deciding to ease the tension. “Yeah, well, someone’s gotta make sure you’re still the smartest kid in the room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky beamed, satisfied, and went back to flipping through his book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha, however, didn’t look away from Rio this time. There was something different in her gaze now—not just surprise, but something deeper. Something Rio felt settle in her bones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for the first time since everything with Jordan had started, since the threats and the stress and the uncertainty of what came next, Rio saw a piece of Agatha finally relax.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The transition to the living room was an easy one. Nicky, Billy, and Tommy disappeared into the other room, their excited voices echoing as they set up their game. Rio stretched out on the couch next to Agatha, her legs loosely crossed, while Wanda poured them all more wine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Viz arrived not long after, dropping onto an armchair with a sigh. “Those kids are gonna wear themselves out before bedtime,” he said, taking a sip from Wanda’s glass before Wanda huffed and went to grab his own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced at Agatha, who had been quiet since they sat down. She could see the tension creeping back into her shoulders, the way she was rolling the stem of her glass between her fingers. Wanda must have noticed too, because she didn’t waste time getting to the point.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Wanda said, stretching her legs out onto the coffee table, “what’s the latest with our favorite scumbag?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a slow breath. “Jordan knows about the restraining order,” she said, voice steady but tight. “He confronted me this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda and Viz both sat up straighter at that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Viz’s expression darkened instantly. “Where?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My office. He—” Agatha exhaled sharply, fingers tightening around her glass. “He called me a bitch for filing it. Threatened me again. Said I was ruining his career.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s jaw clenched at the memory, her hands curling into fists on her lap. “I swear to God, if I ever get five minutes alone with that bastard—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need you getting yourself in trouble, love,” Agatha murmured, her hand brushing lightly against Rio’s knee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed, leaning into the touch but not relaxing entirely. “So what now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked at Wanda. “Lilia’s getting the dean involved. We disclosed our relationship officially, so Jordan’s complaint, if he makes one, won’t have as much weight. We wanted to get ahead of him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda nodded approvingly. “Smart move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Viz, however, tilted her head. “But there’ll still be consequences, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, rubbing at her temple. “Rio has to change mentors. Take Neuro II with someone else. Dr. Patel reached out to her about a potential mentorship, but nothing’s set in stone yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Viz looked at Rio. “Damn, that’s rough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, trying for nonchalance. “Yeah, well. Could be worse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda studied her for a long moment, then softened. “I know how much you wanted to work with Agatha,” she said gently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed, forcing a smirk. “At least I still got the OR spot. And Agatha said I can still bounce research ideas off her. You know, in our personal time.” She shot Agatha a playful glance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That earned her a small smirk in return, but Agatha’s eyes still held something heavier. A weight Rio recognized.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda exhaled. “Well, I hate that this is happening, but at least you two are facing it together. And if that asshole tries anything else, you know I have no problem breaking a kneecap.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Viz raised her glass. “To legally dubious solutions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clinked her glass against Viz’s, smirking. “I’ll drink to that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh at that, but her fingers were still toying with the stem of her glass, her thoughts clearly elsewhere. Rio noticed—of course she did—but she let it be for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, Wanda leaned back with a satisfied sigh. “Alright, enough of the serious talk. We’ll handle it as it comes. Right now, I’d rather enjoy my wine and hear about something not infuriating.” She looked at Rio with a sly grin. “So, you and Agatha, officially official now, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. “Guess so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Viz raised an eyebrow. “So what’s that like? Dating a distinguished professor and highly regarded neurosurgeon?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio made a show of looking thoughtful, then turned to Agatha. “Babe, how is it dating a second-year med student?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed, finally rolling her eyes. “Infuriating.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda burst out laughing, and Rio clutched her chest in mock offense. “I am a delight, thank you very much,” she said, nudging Agatha’s thigh with her knee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re a menace,” Agatha corrected, but there was warmth in her voice now, a lightness that hadn’t been there before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “And yet, here you are, in love with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched a brow but didn’t argue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Viz snorted. “God, you two are disgusting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Disgustingly in love,” Wanda said, grinning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio just shot Agatha a knowing look, her smirk softening as Agatha reached over, squeezing her knee lightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the first time in what felt like days, the weight pressing on her chest loosened just a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Rio could fire back with another cocky remark, the sound of feet padding across the floor interrupted them. A second later, Nicky came running into the living room, his face lighting up the moment he spotted Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come play Mario Kart with us!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled. “Oh, buddy, I don’t know if you’re ready for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha warned, though her lips twitched.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Rio said, feigning innocence. “I just think it’s important to teach him humility.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re just mad because I beat you last time,” Nicky shot back, eyes gleaming with challenge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda let out a bark of laughter. “Oh, I love this kid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio narrowed her eyes playfully, then cracked her knuckles. “Alright, let’s go, squirt. Time for a rematch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Nicky whooped and ran back toward the other room, Rio turned back to Agatha, leaning down just enough to murmur, “You okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers curled lightly around her wrist. “Yeah,” she said softly. “More than okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio squeezed her hand once before standing. “Alright, time to go break a kid’s spirit,” she announced, cracking her neck like she was preparing for battle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Viz groaned. “I’m putting my money on Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Rio headed off, she caught the way Agatha watched her, something warm and unguarded in her gaze. And for the first time in a while, Rio let herself sink into it, let herself believe that despite everything, this—they—were going to be okay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The problem was, things were not okay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, it was easy to dismiss. Jordan was in her ortho class, and their schedules overlapped enough that running into him was inevitable. She felt his eyes on her when she walked in, the weight of his gaze pressing against her back as she took her seat. But she never looked at him. Never acknowledged him. That was the only power she had over him right now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, it started happening outside of class. The first time was at the café near the firehouse. It was a popular spot, and plenty of med students hung around there, so she didn’t think much of it. But then it happened again. And again. Every time she stopped by for coffee, he was there. Never sitting too close, never doing anything outright threatening—but watching. Always watching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first real spike of unease hit when she spotted him near her apartment building. She had just come off a brutal shift and was half-asleep when she stepped out of her car, only to catch sight of a figure leaning against a parked sedan across the street. At first, she thought she was imagining it—her mind playing tricks on her from exhaustion—but then he shifted, stepping forward just enough for the streetlamp to catch his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her stomach turned to lead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She forced herself to keep moving, refusing to acknowledge him. He wasn’t breaking any laws. He wasn’t doing anything. But he was making damn sure she saw him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then, the worst of it—he showed up when she was with Agatha and Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had taken Nicky out for ice cream after school, a rare moment of peace in the chaos of their lives. She had been laughing at something Agatha said, the sound warm in her chest, when a familiar shape in the distance made her blood run cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan. Standing across the street, pretending to be on his phone. But his eyes weren’t on his screen. They were on them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tensed. Agatha, picking up on it immediately, followed her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio?” she asked, voice quiet but alert.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She swallowed hard, shifting so she was partially in front of Nicky. “It’s fine,” she murmured. “Let’s just go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t argue, but the look she gave Rio said this is not fine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she was right. It wasn’t fine at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled as she crossed the hospital parking lot, phone pressed to her ear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn, Al, finally,” she said, relieved. “I was starting to think you were milking this whole near-death experience just for the VIP treatment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice snorted. “You’re just mad I got a week off while you’re still running on fumes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, if I had your chart, I’d be out in two days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice laughed, and Rio was about to fire back when movement near the entrance caught her eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was leaning against a parked car, arms crossed, like he had been waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her stomach twisted. Not here. Not now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice was still talking. “So what’s the plan? You sweeping me off my feet and carrying me out of here, or—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hold on a sec,” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She switched her phone to speaker and, with a few quick swipes, started recording her screen. Then she angled the camera down just enough that Jordan would be visible without making it obvious what she was doing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice’s voice crackled through the line. “Uh, what’s up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan pushed off the car and stepped toward her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You gonna keep pretending you don’t see me?” he asked, voice cold and low.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clenched her jaw, not letting him intimidate her. “I </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> see you,” she shot back. “You’re nothing to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice went silent on the other end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan hummed, looking her over like he was unimpressed. “Funny. I figured we’d at least be cordial, considering you’re the reason my life just went up in flames.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed. “Your own damn actions did that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t think filing for that bullshit restraining order had anything to do with it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her pulse ticked faster, but she refused to flinch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are </span>
  <em>
    <span>stalking</span>
  </em>
  <span> Agatha,” she said coolly. “And now me, too, apparently.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan let out a short, humorless laugh. “Oh, get over yourself.” Then he stepped closer, dropping his voice. “Tell me, Vidal, do you like being her little pet? Is that what gets you off? Jumping whenever she calls?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice swore under her breath, but Rio barely heard her over the rush of blood in her ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or maybe,” Jordan went on, lips curling, “you like pretending she actually cares about you. That you’re not just a fun little game for her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio saw red.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she didn’t react—not in the way he wanted. Instead, she let the corner of her mouth lift, slow and sharp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really wanna test me right now?” she asked, voice calm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan’s smirk faltered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head, just slightly. “You’re already circling the drain. Keep pushing, and I’ll make sure you drown.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan’s eyes narrowed, and his voice dropped, now full of venom. “I’m just getting started. You think you’re safe, but you’re not. I’ll make sure both of you regret this. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness and her little project.</span>
  </em>
  <span> I’ll destroy her, and you’ll be right there with her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her heart rate spiked. He was threatening them both, openly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really think I’m scared of you?” Rio spat, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her. “Keep talking, Jordan. Keep threatening me. I’ll make sure the next time you try anything, you won’t walk away so easily.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jordan’s smirk faltered for a split second, but his eyes darkened with rage. “You think you can do something about it? Keep your nose clean, Vidal. You won’t know what hit you if you get in my way again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Try me,” Rio said, her voice ice-cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, they just stared at each other—intense, charged, like a slow-motion collision waiting to happen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Jordan sneered, “You’ll be sorry. You’ll both be sorry.” He turned on his heel and stormed off, leaving Rio standing there, her chest tight with the threat still hanging in the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice’s voice came through the speaker, frantic. “What the fuck was that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled sharply, her pulse still racing. “Nothing I can’t handle. I’ll deal with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Deal with it?” Alice scoffed. “You better tell me what the hell that was, because that wasn’t just some angry ex. That was a threat.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, Al,” Rio muttered, her hand clenched into a fist. “I know. And he’s only just getting started.” Her mind raced, but she didn’t let it show. “Let’s just focus on getting you out of here, okay? I’m on my way up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not letting this go, Rio,” Alice said, her voice tight with concern.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you’re not,” Rio said with a forced laugh, pushing back the fear trying to creep in. “And neither am I. Let’s get you out of here, then I’ll figure out how to deal with this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced back in the direction Jordan had disappeared to, her jaw tightening. He wants to play? Fine. She’d make sure he knew just how badly he’d miscalculated.</span>
</p><p>

  <p>
  <span>Agatha sat at her desk, reviewing her latest research, but her mind wasn’t on the papers in front of her. She kept glancing at her phone, waiting for Rio’s update. She felt on edge today, as if she was just waiting for the other shoe to drop. She and Rio had instituted a rule to let each other know where they were at every given time, at least until the restraining order came through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew that Rio was supposed to pick up Alice from the hospital today, and she was definitely overdue in checking in with her. Every moment felt drawn out, and the seconds seemed to stretch into hours.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, her phone buzzed with a text notification.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Just home with Alice, but I had to text you right away. We have proof. Jordan threatened me. Has been stalking me actually. Been showing up at places I usually go to. Today he approached me in the parking lot and said some really fucked up shit. I recorded it. It’s all on my phone.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breath caught in her chest, and her eyes flicked to the door. Her first instinct was to run straight to Rio. But she couldn’t—not yet. She needed to process this, to make sure she wasn’t overreacting. But every nerve in her body was already on fire.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Are you okay??? Did he touch you???</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a pause before Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m fine, babe. He didn’t get close enough. But the threats… damn, Agatha. He’s more dangerous than I thought</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a shaky breath, pushing herself to stand. Her hands were shaking, and she instinctively checked her watch. Rio had been avoiding telling her about Jordan showing up at her usual spots. The realization hit her hard.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>You’ve been seeing him? Where?? At the firehouse?? You should’ve told me!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The reply came back quickly, an apology in Rio’s tone even through the screen.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I know. I should’ve told you sooner. But I didn’t want to freak you out. And I didn’t want to get you more involved.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>More involved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was exactly what Agatha had been afraid of. The deeper Rio got tangled with Jordan, the more dangerous it would become. She had hoped that Rio would’ve told her sooner, that she wouldn’t have had to find out like this. But she wasn’t going to let herself spiral. Not now. Not when Rio was dealing with this.</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>It’s not about that, Rio. It’s about safety. We should’ve been handling this together from the start. You’re not alone in this.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She paused, rubbing the bridge of her nose, trying to keep calm. She needed to be the rock for both of them right now.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You’re right. I’m sorry. I’ll stop by your place later tonight. Let’s talk when I get there?</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>I can swing by your place. I have something for Alice.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Sounds good, love. The door is unlocked. Just let yourself in.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>With that, Agatha grabbed her things, walked out of her office, and drove toward Rio’s apartment, her mind racing with thoughts of Jordan, of how to protect Rio, and how this would affect everything—both professionally and personally. Agatha wasn’t sure what this would all mean in the long run, but she wasn’t about to let anything happen to Rio. Not while she had breath in her lungs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Twenty minutes later, Agatha stepped into Rio’s apartment with a soft smile, the bag with Alice’s welcome home gift hanging from her hand. She felt an overwhelming need to take care of both of them after the chaos that had unfolded. As the door clicked shut behind her, she was immediately hit with the scent of something delicious cooking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was in the kitchen, moving around with practiced ease, clearly in the middle of making them something to eat. Alice was curled up on the couch, a blanket wrapped around her, her face soft with the relief of being home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Agatha said quietly, her gaze flicking between Alice and Rio. Rio glanced over at her and smiled, but there was a tension in her shoulders that Agatha knew well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I wasn’t expecting you so soon,” Rio said, though her voice held a note of relief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to see you,” Agatha replied, walking over to the kitchen counter where Rio was chopping vegetables. She placed the gift bag down. “I brought Alice a little something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked over at the bag, then back at Agatha, her brow furrowed with concern. “You didn’t have to… but I know Alice will love it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned against the counter, eyes never leaving Rio. “How’s she doing?” she asked softly, genuinely wanting to know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s doing a lot better. She’s just glad to be out of the hospital, you know? But… I think we both know there’s more to this than just her recovery.” Rio’s tone shifted, and Agatha could hear the worry in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” Agatha asked, her voice growing serious. “With Jordan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t had the chance to talk to you about it yet. I’m sorry,” Rio admitted, her eyes flicking to Alice briefly before she exhaled sharply. “It’s… it’s been a lot. I don’t know why I didn’t tell you sooner, but I’ve been seeing him around more. It’s like he’s everywhere. And then today… I recorded everything when he confronted me.” Rio’s gaze darkened as she reached for her phone, showing Agatha the video of Jordan’s encounter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart sank as she watched it. The anger inside her swelled, but she quickly forced it down, the protective instinct flaring to life once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry you’ve had to go through this,” Agatha murmured, reaching out to touch Rio’s arm. “I should’ve been there for you. I should’ve known.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “No, it’s not your fault. But… I get it now, Agatha. I know why you didn’t tell me about Jordan before. About what he did to you… I know how it feels now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart clenched, and she swallowed hard, guilt gnawing at her. “I should’ve trusted you,” she whispered, “but I didn’t want to drag you into it. I didn’t want to put you at risk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I get it,” Rio said softly. “And I’m sorry, too. But we’re in this together, right? ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, fighting back the lump in her throat. She gently cupped Rio’s face, brushing her thumb over her cheek. “Yeah. We are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the evening settled in, the scent of simmering pasta filled the apartment, and Rio carefully set the table, placing a bottle of wine in the center. The kitchen was warm with the gentle hum of the stove, the clink of plates, and the low murmur of conversation as Alice slowly got comfortable back in the apartment. It was a rare moment of normalcy, the quiet hum of life after Alice’s discharge, but both Rio and Agatha knew it wouldn’t last long—there was still too much to address.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once they were seated at the table, Alice dug into her meal first, as if she hadn’t eaten in days. Agatha could see the tension in Rio’s shoulders, the weight of everything that had happened still hanging between them, but the warmth in the air from the comfort of dinner made it easier to start unpacking everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice looked from one to the other as she chewed, her gaze shifting between them. “Okay, spill. What the hell is going on? You two are being so quiet about it, but I can tell something’s off.” Her words weren’t sharp, but there was an underlying edge to them. She wasn’t a fool, and she knew when something was being left unsaid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced at Agatha before answering, her voice quieter than usual. “It’s that lunatic I told you about a few weeks ago, remember? Thomas Jordan,” she began. “He’s been stalking me. Following me to places I hang out, showing up around my neighborhood. Today, he—” She paused, visibly bracing herself for what she was about to say. “He threatened me. You saw the whole thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand across the table, her heart aching at the words. She could still see the hurt in Rio’s eyes, the lingering fear, and the uncertainty that clung to her. Agatha had always hated the thought of someone hurting Rio. It was a weight she hadn’t been able to lift for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice stopped chewing, her fork still suspended mid-air, and her eyes narrowed. Her voice had a sharpness now, a protective edge to it. “How long has this been going on? Why the hell didn’t you tell me earlier?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, rubbing her temples before meeting Alice’s gaze. “I didn’t want to worry you, Al. You were in the hospital! I thought I could handle it, but today—today, I just couldn’t pretend it wasn’t happening anymore. He’s threatened both me and Agatha. He said he was going to ruin everything. I thought he was just full of shit, that he was too much of a chicken shit to actually do anything to us. But today he actually scared me. You heard what he said. I didn’t realize until now how much of a risk this actually is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed hard at the mention of herself. The thought of Jordan trying to involve her in this mess made her blood boil, but it was the reality they were facing. The severity of the situation wasn’t something Agatha could ignore anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Listen,” Rio said, noticing the change in her demeanor. “We’ve got proof now. I recorded him today. And I—I didn’t want you to know sooner because I didn’t want you to worry, but Agatha is filing for a restraining order. It’s just… everything’s happening so fast, and I don’t know how to keep him away from us. He keeps showing up everywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice set down her fork with a heavy sigh, her frustration clear now. “I’m going to make sure we get him. This isn’t happening. We’ll deal with this the right way—he’s not going to get away with this. I know people in the police. We both do, Rio! If I have to go down there and find him myself—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha held up a hand, stopping Alice before things escalated any further. “No, Alice. We’re not taking matters into our own hands. We’re going through the legal process. We’re gathering everything we need to ensure he’s kept away from both Rio and me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice glared at her but nodded slowly. “Fine. But don’t think for a second that if I find him out there, I won’t kick his sorry ass. No one messes with my family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled softly at Alice’s protectiveness. “I know, Al. And I’m not going to let him mess with me anymore either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned forward, her eyes meeting Rio’s. “We’ll get through this. Together. We’ll make sure he’s stopped.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The warmth of the words didn’t fully take away the weight of the situation, but Rio found some comfort in Agatha’s reassurance. Her presence was a grounding force, and Rio knew she wasn’t alone anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice sighed deeply, shaking her head. “I swear, if that fucker comes anywhere near you again—” She cut herself off, shaking her head. “I just can’t believe this is happening. I thought we left high school drama behind. But nope. Here we are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The conversation slowed as they finished their meal, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but the weight of their conversation still hung in the air. They had a plan, they had proof, and they had each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the plates were cleared away, Agatha rose from the table and walked over to the counter, pulling out a bottle of wine. She uncorked it, poured a glass for each of them, and turned back to face Rio and Alice. “To the truth,” Agatha said, her voice steady.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To the truth,” Rio echoed, raising her glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice clinked her glass with theirs and gave them both a wry grin. “And to kicking Jordan’s ass out of your lives for good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all laughed, the sound genuine despite the tension that still lingered. But it was a moment of relief. A small victory against the darkness that had been trying to consume their lives.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat back down at the table, looking at both of them, her heart full. “We’ve got this,” she said quietly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha woke up to the feeling of warmth pressed against her. Rio’s arm was draped over her waist, her face buried in Agatha’s neck, breathing deep and steady. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had made it back to her place late the night before, making a quick detour to pick up Nicky at Wanda’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shifted slightly, just enough to turn onto her side and take in the sight of Rio still sleeping. There was a peacefulness to her features that Agatha wished she could preserve, untouched by the stress of classes, work, and now the looming threat of Jordan. She reached up, brushing a few stray curls from Rio’s face. At the touch, Rio stirred, humming softly before cracking one eye open. A slow, lazy smile spread across her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmm… morning, beautiful,” Rio murmured, voice thick with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stretched, her arm tightening around Agatha before she leaned in to press a soft kiss against her lips. It was unhurried, gentle, like the world hadn’t started moving yet. But eventually, Rio sighed and flopped onto her back. “What time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned her head toward the clock on the nightstand. “Almost seven.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned. “I hate early mornings.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re a paramedic. That’s half your job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t mean I like it,” Rio said, but she sat up, rubbing a hand over her face. “I should get moving. My schedule’s different now with the new Neuro II professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tensed slightly at that. Another reminder of what Rio had lost because of Jordan’s threats. She reached out, resting a hand on Rio’s back. “Are you ready for it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head back, looking at Agatha over her shoulder. “Ready as I’ll ever be. Can’t say I’m thrilled, but I’ll survive. Hopefully, Dr. Meyer won’t make me regret everything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha offered a small smile. “She’s competent. You’ll get a fair shot with her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, then turned to fully face Agatha again, her expression softening. “What about you? What’s on your schedule today?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hesitated for a moment before sitting up. “I have a conference in New York next week. I’m giving a talk on my latest research.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brow quirked. “That’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>big</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Why didn’t you mention it before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been a little preoccupied,” Agatha admitted wryly. “It just feels like another thing on top of everything else. But it’s important, so I need to focus and prepare for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio studied her for a long moment, then reached out to tuck a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “Hey. You’ll kill it. You always do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha exhaled, leaning into Rio’s touch just slightly. “I appreciate the confidence.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Always.” Rio leaned in, stealing another kiss before reluctantly pulling away. “Alright, I really do need to get ready. New professor, new routine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, watching as Rio moved toward the bathroom. She stayed in bed a moment longer, considering everything ahead—Jordan, the conference, the weight of all of it. But then she took a breath and pushed the thoughts aside. For now, she had the morning, and she had Rio. That was enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The morning at Agatha’s started in a slow, sleepy haze, but quickly gave way to the familiar rhythm of getting ready for the day. The scent of coffee filled the kitchen as Agatha stood by the counter, sipping from her mug, watching Rio and Nicky work on breakfast together. It had become an unspoken routine—Rio handling the eggs while Nicky took charge of buttering toast, his little hands moving with exaggerated precision.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mom, did you know that Venus spins the opposite way from all the other planets?” Nicky asked, eyes bright as he looked up at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked over the rim of her cup. “I did, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky huffed, turning to Rio. “Did you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio ruffled his curls. “Nope. But that’s why I’ve got my favorite expert here to teach me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky beamed, completely won over. “We’re doing the solar system for my class project, and Rio said she’s gonna help me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s gaze softened as she watched the two of them. Something in her chest tightened—something warm and so dangerously full. She loved them. She loved this. More than she’d ever let herself admit before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to do that,” she told Rio, even though part of her was thrilled at the idea of Rio being even more entrenched in their little world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio just shrugged, scooping scrambled eggs onto their plates. “I want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat down to eat, the conversation flowing easily between them. Nicky, as always, had an endless supply of facts to share, and Rio egged him on, gasping at every new piece of information. Agatha, content, let herself bask in the simple joy of the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, the morning rush resumed. Agatha helped Nicky pack his school bag while Rio finished the dishes. They fell into sync so naturally that it was hard to believe Rio hadn’t always been a part of this routine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they headed out, Agatha drove, with Nicky chattering excitedly in the backseat about his day ahead. When they pulled up to the school, Rio twisted in her seat to high-five him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Knock ‘em dead, champ,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will! Love you, Mom!” Nicky said, already climbing out of the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled. “Love you too, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He waved before disappearing into the school, and Agatha lingered a moment, watching until he was out of sight. When she turned back, Rio was studying her with something soft in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Agatha asked, feigning ignorance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio just shook her head with a small smile. “Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment lingered between them as Agatha pulled back onto the road, heading toward Northwestern. But as they neared campus, that quiet warmth slowly gave way to tension.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because Jordan was there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Standing near the entrance to the parking lot, just far enough not to seem overly suspicious, but close enough that it was obvious he was waiting for someone. Or watching someone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s grip on the wheel tightened. Rio went rigid beside her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was always around. Always watching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And they were done pretending not to notice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was absorbed in her notes when she heard the soft knock at the door, followed by the familiar creak of it opening. Her heart gave a little flutter when she looked up to find Rio standing there, her usual bright smile gracing her face. It was a Monday, and they hadn’t seen each other in a couple of days because Rio was working a double shift, and Agatha missed her like crazy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Rio said, voice tinged with warmth after the long shift, her eyes meeting Agatha’s with a certain ease that made Agatha’s chest tighten in a way she was still learning to navigate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey yourself,” Agatha replied, standing up from her desk. A brief silence passed between them, the kind that felt comfortable in its own way, before Rio crossed the room, her hand reaching up as she closed the distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They greeted each other with a soft kiss—quick, but full of quiet affection, a silent acknowledgment of how much they had missed each other. Agatha’s lips lingered for a moment before she pulled back, meeting Rio’s gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping you’d come by,” Agatha said, her voice softer than she intended, but it felt right. “How was your shift?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged lightly, her exhaustion still visible in the slight slump of her shoulders but masked by the warmth in her expression. “Long, but nothing I couldn’t handle. Glad to be off.” She stepped back a little, leaning against the doorframe casually, but her gaze remained on Agatha, almost too focused. “You doing okay? You’ve got that meeting with Dr. Olsen today, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “Yeah, I’m meeting with her to update her on everything with Jordan. We’re still working out how best to handle your transition to Dr. Patel for the mentorship.” She tilted her head, watching Rio. “I’ve been thinking about you… making this change, and I just want to make sure you’re feeling okay with everything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes softened, and she pushed off the desk she’d leaned against, taking a step closer. “It’s not easy, but I’ve already been in touch with Dr. Patel. He seems great. I think we’ll figure it out. Plus, I’ll still be around.” She paused, her voice lowering as she added, “And I’ll still stop by to say hi whenever I can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled, a light blush coloring her cheeks. “I think I’d be disappointed if you didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, her hand gently brushing the side of Agatha’s arm as she stood close enough that Agatha could feel the warmth of her presence. There was something effortless about the way they stood there, no longer trying to hide the connection between them. “You don’t have to worry about that,” Rio replied with a teasing glint in her eyes. “I don’t let go of people that easily.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Agatha said, her voice softer now, full of a deeper kind of sincerity. “I don’t want you to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood just a little closer to Rio, still feeling the warmth of their earlier kiss. The silence stretched between them, comfortable but filled with unspoken thoughts. Agatha finally let out a quiet breath and met Rio’s gaze, feeling a flutter in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know,” Agatha began, her voice slightly hesitant but warm, “I’ve been meaning to ask you something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head, a knowing look crossing her face. “Yeah? What’s up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a moment, gathering her thoughts. She’d been thinking about this for a while, but the timing had never felt quite right—until now. “I’m heading to New York tomorrow for that Neurology conference I told you about,” she said, her words coming a little faster now. “I was wondering if you’d want to come with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes widened slightly in surprise, but the warmth never left her expression. “You want me to come to New York with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave a soft nod, feeling the weight of the question hanging in the air. “Yeah. I mean, I could use the company. I’ll be tied up with the panels and lectures most of the time, but I’ll have some free time in the afternoons, and… it would be nice to have someone with me. You’re interested in the research, and I thought, well… maybe you’d want to come along.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stood there for a moment, looking thoughtful, her gaze flicking to Agatha’s face as if weighing the invitation. Then, a grin broke across her face, playful and genuine. “You’ve been working up the courage to ask me, haven’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled softly, a bit embarrassed but relieved to have finally said it. “Maybe a little,” she admitted, her voice light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped closer, her hand brushing Agatha’s arm as she looked up at her with that teasing glint in her eyes. “Well, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t interested. New York with you sounds… pretty damn good right about now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, the warmth in Rio’s eyes making everything else fade away for a second. “So, you’re saying yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, her voice softening. “I’m saying yes… but,” she added, her tone shifting to something more practical, “I need to check with my captain at the firehouse first to make sure I can get the time off. We’ve got a lot going on right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, understanding. “Of course, I get it. I just wanted to ask, and if you can swing it, we’ll make it work. I’ll book your flight as soon as you’re sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave her a reassuring smile. “I’ll check in with him and get back to you. But I really want to make this happen, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me know as soon as you can,” Agatha said, trying to keep her tone light, though she couldn’t help the little spark of anticipation that ran through her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped closer once again, her hand brushing Agatha’s arm as she looked at her with that familiar warmth. “I’ll see what I can do,” she promised, then leaned in to place another soft kiss on Agatha’s cheek, lingering for a moment before pulling back to meet her gaze. “Looking forward to it. I’ll keep you posted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt a quiet warmth spread through her at the gesture, and for a second, the room felt a little smaller, a little more intimate. “I’m looking forward to it too,” Agatha replied, her voice softer than before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave her one last smile, her eyes lighting up as she turned to head toward the door. “I’ll text you as soon as I get the okay from my captain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take care of that, and I’ll be ready when you are,” Agatha said with a smile, watching her leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the door closed behind Rio, Agatha stood there for a moment, a quiet thrill rushing through her. It was happening. Slowly, but it was happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That afternoon, after finishing up a few last-minute tasks, Agatha sat in her office, trying to focus on the paperwork scattered before her. Her phone buzzed again, breaking her concentration. It was Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Got the time off. I’m all in for New York!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart lifted at the message. She quickly responded: </span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Perfect! I’ll book your flight right now. Looking forward to it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She grinned to herself, her mind racing with thoughts of the trip. It would be a nice break from the stress, a chance to reconnect with Rio away from the mess at the university. Checking the time on her phone, Agatha realized she was borderline late for her meeting with Dr. Olsen. So she picked up her purse and quickly made the trek to the fifth floor where the Dean’s office was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she got there, Dr. Olsen’s assistant told her to right in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agath entered, finding the Dean behind the desk, her expression all business. “Agatha,” she said with a nod, and Agatha closed the door behind her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha straightened in her chair, instinctively bracing herself. She knew this meeting was coming, but it didn’t make it any easier.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr. Olsen waited for her to take a seat across from her, her gaze sharp but understanding. “I wanted to check in on everything, especially with Jordan’s situation. How are you holding up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m managing,” Agatha said, but the weight of the situation lingered in her tone. “I’ve got the lawyer involved, and we’re waiting for the hearing for the restraining order. That’s this Friday, finally. But I’m trying to stay focused on work until then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olsen nodded, her eyes narrowing slightly. “Good. You’ve done what you can there. But let’s talk about Rio. I know she’s in transition now, moving over to Dr. Patel for her mentorship, right? Have you spoken with her about how that’s going?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have,” Agatha replied, her voice steady. “She’s been great about it. She understands the situation, even if I know it’s disappointing for her.” She hesitated, the familiar pang of guilt washing over her. “She was a great fit for my mentorship. This is just… a difficult situation all around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olsen leaned back in her chair, studying Agatha for a moment. “I’m sure this is hard, but you’re doing the right thing. Having her switch to another mentor is the smart call. You’ve got to protect yourself, Agatha, and you’ve got to protect her too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Agatha said quietly, swallowing the lump in her throat. “I just… wish things were different. It just feels like everything’s falling apart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olsen’s expression softened, her tone more supportive. “It’s not falling apart, but I understand why it feels that way. You’re trying to juggle too much, and it’s a lot. You’re only human.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a deep breath, nodding. She appreciated Olsen’s reassurance, though it didn’t quite ease the weight she was carrying. “I just want to make sure Rio’s okay. This is tough for her, and I… don’t want to make it harder.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olsen gave a short nod. “You’re doing the best you can. That’s all you can do. And if you feel like you need more time away from all this, there’s no shame in that. I know you’ve got that conference in New York this week, right? Take a breather. It might help you clear your head.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha straightened slightly, the thought of the conference making her feel a bit lighter. “Actually, I was just about to book the flights. Rio’s coming with me. I think a few days away could be good for both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olsen raised an eyebrow. “So, you’re not going solo?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled faintly, a small but genuine smile. “No, I’m not. I invited her. I could use the company, and she’s been working hard on her research. She’s earned the break.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That sounds like a good plan. A change of scenery might do you both some good,” Olsen said, her tone approving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Agatha said, nodding. “I’ll have a lot to go over, but I think it’ll be a nice escape from the pressure here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olsen gave her a small smile. “I’m glad to hear it. You deserve that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Agatha replied, the relief of having this conversation behind her settling in. “I’ll be sure to take it easy. It’ll be good for us to get out of here for a bit, too. Jordan is starting to bother Rio, so if we’re both out of town, he won’t be able to do anything against us.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olsen nodded, standing up. “Let me know if this thing with Mr. Jordan escalates further. You’re doing well, Agatha. Keep your head above water. And if Jordan keeps bothering you even after the restraining order, we will see what we can do about disciplinary actions here. He might lose his spot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha followed her lead, standing up as well. “Thanks, Dr. Olsen. I appreciate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Olsen left, Agatha sat back down in her chair, her thoughts briefly drifting to Rio. She’d booked the flights, and everything was set. The idea of getting away for a few days, with Rio by her side, felt like a lifeline.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a deep breath, feeling a little lighter, and sent a quick message to Rio: </span>
</p><p align="right">
  <b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>
    <span>Flights are booked. I’ll pick you up tomorrow around 10-ish after I drop Nicky off at school.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A few moments later, Rio’s reply came: </span>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Can’t wait, love. I’ll be ready.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled to herself, a quiet excitement settling in her chest. Tomorrow couldn’t come soon enough.</span>
</p><p>

  <p>Rio zipped up her duffel bag, moving quickly between the pile of clothes on the bed and the bathroom counter where her toiletries were scattered. It felt like she was running on autopilot. A long shift at the firehouse, barely any sleep, and now packing for a trip to New York with Agatha. Not that she was complaining. In fact, the idea of spending a few days with Agatha, away from the chaos, was exactly what she needed. The whole Jordan situation had been weighing on them both, and a break was long overdue.</p><p>Alice, sitting on the couch with her foot propped up on a pillow, gave Rio an amused glance. “So, let me get this straight,” she said, the corner of her mouth curving into a grin. “Your first romantic trip together is to… a neurology conference?”</p><p>Rio froze for a second, looking over at her with a raised eyebrow. “What’s wrong with that?”</p><p>Alice let out a dramatic sigh, shaking her head. “You two are literal neuro nerds. I thought your first getaway together would be some romantic weekend at the beach or a cute little cabin in the mountains, not… a conference about brain science.”</p><p>Rio laughed, her heart lightening at Alice’s teasing. “It’s not like we planned it that way. Agatha’s speaking at the conference, and I’m going along to support her—and, okay, yeah, to check out the research. I mean, it’s New York, and we do both kind of geek out about neurology.”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” Alice replied, her grin widening. “But I bet the only thing on your minds will be neurons and synapses, huh? Don’t you dare come back and tell me you spent the whole time talking about Alzheimer’s research and neurodegenerative diseases. That’ll be a mood killer for sure.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t help the smile tugging at her lips. “Okay, we’re not only going to talk about neuro stuff. We’ll have some fun too. It’ll be nice to get away for a bit. No work, no school, no psycho Jordan. Just us.”</p><p>Alice arched an eyebrow, her playful tone turning a bit more teasing. “Yeah, sure. Just make sure you take some time for, I don’t know, romance too, yeah? You two deserve it.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed, and she glanced away, busying herself with stuffing a pair of socks into the bag. “Yeah, I guess we do.”</p><p>“You’re both in love, and it’s pretty obvious to anyone who’s seen you two together. But hey, take your time. Just make sure you don’t spend the whole trip locked in your hotel room talking about the hippocampus or whatever.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t suppress a laugh. “Okay, okay. I get it. But I really am excited for this. We both need a little break from everything, and the last couple of months have been… a lot. I’ll bring you back a souvenir or something.”</p><p>“Better make it a big one,” Alice said, grinning. “Have fun in New York, you two lovebirds. I’ll be here, holding down the fort and still recovering from this stupid injury.”</p><p>Rio gave Alice a thumbs-up as she finished packing the last of her things. “Thanks. I’ll check in with you after we get settled.”</p><p>She was zipping up her suitcase when her phone buzzed on the counter. She glanced at the screen and saw Agatha’s name.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio answered, hurrying to toss the last pair of shoes into the bag. “Everything okay?”</p><p>“I’m on my way to pick you up,” Agatha’s voice came through the phone, warm and steady. “The Uber will be there in ten minutes, so get your things together and meet me outside.”</p><p>Rio quickly glanced around her apartment, making sure she hadn’t missed anything. Her bag was packed, and she had everything she needed. “Okay, I’m almost done. I’ll be out in a few minutes.”</p><p>“Great. See you soon.”</p><p>After hanging up, Rio rushed around the apartment, stuffing a few last items into her bag before slinging it over her shoulder. She darted over to Alice, who was still lounging on the couch, looking way too comfortable.</p><p>“I’m heading out,” Rio said, hurriedly gathering her things. “You behave while I’m gone. Don’t do anything to make your injury worse, okay?”</p><p>Alice just grinned at her, “No promises, but I’ll try. Have fun, and don’t forget to tell me all the actual details when you get back.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, her heart light with excitement. “I will. I swear. But don’t make me regret leaving you alone with your Netflix marathon.”</p><p>“You’re the one leaving me with the remote,” Alice teased back, laughing.</p><p>Rio shook her head as she rushed out the door, the thrill of the trip ahead of her making everything else fade into the background. She’d finally have a few days to focus on herself—and Agatha—without the weight of everything else. She was ready.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Rio barely had time to catch her breath before she reached the curb and saw Agatha’s Uber pull up. She smiled, feeling a flutter of excitement, and moved quickly to the trunk to stow her suitcase. As she slammed it shut, Agatha stepped out of the car, looking effortlessly chic in a simple but elegant coat and scarf, her dark hair flowing loosely around her shoulders.</p><p>Without thinking, Rio moved toward her and pulled her into a warm kiss, their lips meeting in a soft, quick embrace. Agatha’s familiar, comforting scent washed over her, and for a moment, everything else disappeared.</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly, her eyes sparkling. “Hi there. You ready for this?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her heart racing. “Definitely. Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>They slid into the backseat of the Uber, and Rio settled into the plush seat next to Agatha, feeling the warmth of her presence settle around her. As the car started moving, she glanced at Agatha, watching the way the light played on her face.</p><p>“How’s Nicky doing?” Rio asked, her voice soft. “Has he been looking forward to the trip?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said with a small smile. “He’s really excited to spend a couple of days with Wanda and the twins. I think he’s already planned a list of movies to watch with them and the things they’re going to do.” She laughed lightly, shaking her head. </p><p>“That’s great,” Rio said, shaking her head. “He won’t even have time to miss us.”</p><p>“We’ll be back before you know it,” Agatha reassured her, her fingers brushing against Rio’s as she settled into the seat. “It’ll be nice to just focus on each other for a bit. We’ve both needed this, I think.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her stomach fluttering. “I agree. No work, no school, no… psycho. Just us.”</p><p>“Exactly.” Agatha’s smile widened, and she shifted slightly, turning to Rio. “So, what do you want to do once we get there? I know you’re all about checking out the research, but we’ll have time to explore a bit, right?”</p><p>Rio leaned back in the seat, eyes closing briefly. “I’m honestly just excited to be away from everything for a while. But yeah, we can check out the city a little. Maybe go to a museum or something. I’m pretty sure you’ll love all the art in New York.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a hint of mischief in her eyes. “I’m in, as long as there’s some time to relax. No neuro talk 24/7, promise?”</p><p>“Deal,” Rio said with a chuckle. “We’ll save that for the conference only.”</p><p>They chatted more as the Uber made its way to the airport, Rio’s mind buzzing with the idea of the trip ahead. There was something peaceful about the way Agatha made everything feel easy. It was just the two of them, a little getaway, and—hopefully—a much-needed break from all the tension.</p><p>As they arrived at the airport and went through the usual motions of checking in and getting their tickets, Rio found herself becoming a bit more fidgety. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to go—she was looking forward to the time away—but there was always this gnawing feeling in the pit of her stomach whenever she had to fly.</p><p>She kept it to herself, as she usually did, focusing on the task at hand. But as they made their way through security, Rio found her nerves starting to build. She felt the familiar tension in her chest, her palms sweating slightly. It was hard to ignore, but she wasn’t about to let it show.</p><p>Agatha, always perceptive, noticed the subtle changes in Rio’s posture. “Everything okay?” she asked quietly as they moved through the terminal.</p><p>Rio nodded quickly, trying to brush it off. “Yeah, just… a little tired. Nothing to worry about.”</p><p>But Agatha, not fooled, raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure?”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment, her gaze flickering to Agatha’s. She really didn’t want to admit it—not now, not with all the excitement of the trip ahead. But Agatha was already watching her with that knowing look.</p><p>“I… I’m just not great with flying,” Rio admitted softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened with understanding, and she reached out to gently take Rio’s hand. “Hey,” she said, squeezing it lightly. “It’s okay. We’ll be fine. I’ll be here with you the whole time.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, her anxiety still there but lessening with Agatha’s calming presence. “I’m fine. I just… I don’t like the feeling of being up there. It’s like I have no control, you know?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her fingers still wrapped around Rio’s. “I get it. But you’re not alone in this. We’ll make it through together. And if you need anything, just let me know.”</p><p>Rio felt a wave of relief wash over her at Agatha’s words. She wasn’t alone in this, and that made all the difference. She gave Agatha a small smile, grateful for her support.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio whispered, leaning into her for a brief moment before straightening up again. “I’ll be okay.”</p><p>They made their way to the gate, Rio’s nerves slowly settling as they passed through the final steps of getting on the plane. The discomfort still lingered in the back of her mind, but with Agatha beside her, she felt like maybe—just maybe—she could handle it.</p><p>As they boarded the plane and settled into their seats, Agatha took her hand once more, a soft smile on her face. Rio couldn’t help but feel a little lighter, knowing that with Agatha by her side, she wasn’t facing this fear alone.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>The Uber pulled up in front of the Four Seasons Hotel, and Rio’s breath caught in her throat as she looked up at the towering building. She could already tell from the sleek, modern exterior that this was going to be something special.</p><p>As they got out of the car, Rio hesitated for a moment, looking at the opulent entrance. The doorman greeted them with a warm smile, but Rio couldn’t help feeling a little out of place. She had grown up in a very different world—one where luxury like this wasn’t even on the horizon. A place like this felt… way beyond her reach. She glanced over at Agatha, trying to ignore the feeling creeping in.</p><p>Agatha noticed the shift in Rio’s demeanor but didn’t say anything. She simply smiled, reaching out to take Rio’s hand as they walked toward the entrance. “You okay?” she asked, her voice gentle.</p><p>Rio gave a small, unsure smile. “Yeah, just—” She paused, then took a breath. “This place is amazing. But it feels like I’m out of my depth, you know?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile didn’t waver as she squeezed Rio’s hand. “I get it,” she said, her voice calm and reassuring. “But this is just a little something I wanted to do for us. A way to celebrate what we’ve built together. Our relationship. Our love.” She leaned in close, dropping her voice to a soft whisper. “It’s a gift for both of us, Rio. Don’t think for a second it’s out of your range. You deserve this and more.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened as she met Agatha’s gaze. There was a warmth and sincerity in Agatha’s expression that made the knot in Rio’s stomach loosen, just a little. Still, the reality of the difference in their financial worlds lingered in the back of her mind, but Agatha’s words made her feel a little better about it.</p><p>“You really mean that?” Rio asked quietly, her voice tinged with uncertainty.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her hand never leaving Rio’s. “Of course I do,” she replied, her thumb brushing gently against Rio’s skin. “You mean the world to me. And I want you to feel comfortable. This is just about us. Nothing more.”</p><p>Rio smiled, though she still felt a little uneasy. She allowed herself to relax into Agatha’s touch, her heart warming at the thought of Agatha’s thoughtfulness.</p><p>When they entered the lobby, the grandeur of the space took Rio’s breath away once again. The marble floors, crystal chandeliers, and modern artwork scattered throughout—it all felt surreal.</p><p>They made their way to the elevator, and Rio couldn’t help but glance around, feeling as if she was in a dream. She still wasn’t completely sure how she felt about it, but Agatha’s assurance helped ease the tension in her chest.</p><p>Once inside the suite, Rio’s breath hitched. The view of Central Park through the floor-to-ceiling windows was absolutely breathtaking, and the room itself—luxury at its finest. Her mind raced with thoughts of how this was way beyond what she could ever afford, but Agatha had given her that reassurance, and for now, she allowed herself to feel the joy of it all.</p><p>“Wow, this place is… incredible,” Rio murmured, stepping closer to the window, her fingers lightly brushing against the glass.</p><p>Agatha moved up beside her, her hand slipping into Rio’s as they both took in the view. “It’s ours for the next few days,” Agatha said softly. “Just us. No stress, no worries. Just time together.”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, her heart swelling with affection. “Thank you,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “I know I don’t always feel like I belong in places like this, but… I’ll try to let myself enjoy it.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened around hers, a gentle, grounding gesture. “You belong with me. That’s all that matters.”</p><p>The suite was nothing short of breathtaking, and Rio couldn’t help but let out a soft, awed laugh as she turned around, taking in every luxurious detail. The crisp white sheets on the king-sized bed, the modern furnishings, and the soft glow of ambient lighting—it was the kind of place she had only ever seen in movies. The grand view of Central Park was like a painting, framed perfectly by the floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><p>“Seriously, Agatha… this is insane,” Rio murmured, running her fingers over the smooth surface of the polished wood furniture. “I feel like I’m in a dream.”</p><p>Agatha smiled warmly, watching Rio’s reaction. “I’m glad you like it. I wanted it to be special,” she said, her voice full of affection. She moved closer, her hand brushing against Rio’s arm, sending a spark of warmth through her.</p><p>“I don’t even know where to start,” Rio said, still taking it all in. She looked at Agatha, eyes soft. “You really didn’t have to do all this. But I’m glad you did. It feels like… we’re really doing this. Together.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart swelled as she stepped forward, closing the gap between them. “I wanted us to have something to remember. Something perfect.”</p><p>Their eyes locked for a moment, and Rio felt a pull—one she couldn’t resist. She leaned in slowly, her lips brushing against Agatha’s in a soft kiss, the warmth of it lingering as they deepened the connection. Agatha’s arms wrapped around Rio, pulling her closer, and Rio melted into her embrace, the tension from earlier fading into the background.</p><p>The kiss grew more intense, their lips moving against each other with an urgency that hadn’t been there before. Agatha’s hands slid into Rio’s hair, tugging her closer as Rio’s arms wound around Agatha’s waist, pulling her body flush against hers. There was no hesitation now—just the heat of the moment, the growing desire that had been simmering between them since their arrival.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio deepened the kiss, her hands roaming to the small of Rio’s back, pressing their bodies even closer. Rio responded in kind, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s neck, a shiver running through her at the touch. Every kiss felt like an electric spark, igniting something inside her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips trailed down to Rio’s neck, kissing her skin softly before pulling back just enough to meet her eyes. “We could just stay here,” she murmured, her voice hushed but filled with heat. “Forget about everything else.”</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell rapidly as she tried to catch her breath, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips. “I’m not going to lie, the idea of just staying here… with you… sounds amazing,” she admitted, her voice thick with desire.</p><p>But despite the pull between them, Rio couldn’t ignore the fact that they were in New York, in this incredible place, and there was so much more to explore. As much as the idea of staying in bed with Agatha sounded tempting, she didn’t want to miss out on the adventure ahead.</p><p>Agatha, sensing the change in Rio, leaned back slightly, searching her face. “But you want to see the city,” she said with a playful grin. “You’re right. As tempting as it is, we’re here, and we should enjoy it. The city’s waiting for us.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, brushing her lips against Agatha’s once more before pulling away, albeit reluctantly. “You’re right,” she said, her voice low and teasing. “We’ll save the staying-in thing for later.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, taking Rio’s hand in hers as they made their way toward the door. “Later sounds perfect.”</p><p>After a few moments of gathering coats and scarves, they left the suite and made their way downstairs to the front entrance. The cold air hit them as soon as they stepped outside, a crisp January wind biting at their cheeks, but Rio couldn’t help but smile. There was something magical about New York in winter—the city felt alive, bustling with energy even in the quieter, colder months.</p><p>The streets were still lined with holiday lights, twinkling against the stark sky. The sidewalks were crowded with people rushing from place to place, but it didn’t feel chaotic. It felt like something out of a dream—everything was crisp and clear. The skyline was stunning, the towering buildings framing the clear blue sky, and the streets were buzzing with energy, the air alive with the hum of the city.</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s hand as they walked down the sidewalk, the cold wind biting their faces, but the warmth between them was enough to keep them close. “I love New York in January,” Agatha said, glancing at Rio with a smile. “It’s the best time to see the city without the huge crowds.”</p><p>Rio smiled, feeling the excitement of being there, of being with Agatha in such an incredible place. “I’ve only ever seen New York in the summer, so this is completely different. It’s like… there’s a quiet magic to it in the winter.”</p><p>They strolled down the street, talking about everything and nothing, letting the city unfold around them. They passed by cafes with windows fogged up from the warmth inside, the smell of fresh coffee drifting into the chilly air. It was like every corner of the city had something to offer—there were people out walking dogs, tourists bundled up in coats, and street vendors selling hot pretzels.</p><p>After a while, they found themselves near the edge of Central Park, the snow-covered trees standing tall against the crisp winter sky. Rio’s eyes widened as they stood at the edge of the park, the sprawling landscape dotted with snow and the distant skyline rising in the background.</p><p>“Let’s take a walk,” Rio suggested, her voice soft. “I want to see it up close.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her hand never leaving Rio’s. “I’m all for it.”</p><p>As they walked deeper into the park, the sound of the city faded, replaced by the quiet of the snow-covered trees and the occasional laughter of children in the distance. They walked for a while, taking in the peaceful scenery, the cold air settling on their skin as they talked and laughed.</p><p>Rio looked over at Agatha, her heart full. “I never thought I’d be here. With you. In New York. It feels… like we’re in a movie or something.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her hand finding Rio’s again, squeezing it gently. “I’m glad you’re here. With me. And I’m glad we’re doing this. It’s perfect.”</p><p>They stopped for a moment, standing together in the quiet of the park, the world around them peaceful. Rio leaned into Agatha, resting her head on her shoulder, feeling completely content in that moment.</p><p>“Perfect,” Rio whispered, her smile soft against Agatha’s skin. “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>By the time they were heading back to the hotel, both Rio and Agatha were slightly tipsy, the wine and cocktails from dinner still dancing on their tongues. They had spent the evening wandering through the city, getting lost in the lights of Manhattan, before finding themselves at a cozy little bar where the conversation had flowed as easily as the drinks.</p><p>And now, as they stepped into the elevator, the energy between them was electric—charged with anticipation, the kind of energy that had been building since they arrived. The doors slid shut with a soft chime, and before either of them could say anything, Rio reached for Agatha, her hands pulling her closer.</p><p>Agatha responded immediately, her lips meeting Rio’s in a kiss that was full of heat and urgency. Rio’s hands slid around Agatha’s neck, her fingers tangled in the soft strands of her hair as she deepened the kiss, pushing herself closer. Agatha’s hands were on Rio’s waist, gripping her firmly as they kissed with a desperation that hadn’t been there earlier. The alcohol was still warm in their veins, loosening their inhibitions, making everything feel a little more intense.</p><p>The elevator hummed quietly as it rose, but the only sound that mattered was the rush of breath between them, the soft sounds of their lips moving against each other. Rio’s back pressed into the cool metal wall of the elevator, her chest rising and falling rapidly as Agatha’s lips trailed down to her neck, kissing her skin softly, then harder, with a fierceness that made Rio’s heart race.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed, her voice trembling with the heat of the moment. “God, I can’t… I need you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath was hot against her skin as she pulled back just enough to look at Rio, her eyes dark with desire. “I need you too,” she whispered, her lips brushing against Rio’s in a slow, lingering kiss. She leaned in again, the kiss deepening, as if they couldn’t get close enough, couldn’t touch each other enough.</p><p>When the elevator reached their floor with a soft ping, they barely noticed, too consumed by each other to care about anything else. The doors slid open, but neither of them made any move to pull away. Just as the doors were about to close, Agatha pushed them open wider with her shoulder, her hands already working to pull Rio closer.</p><p>They stumbled out of the elevator, laughing softly, but the laughter quickly turned into more kisses, more touches. As they neared the suite, Agatha was the one to pull back slightly, her hands finding the keycard in her pocket. Her hands were shaking slightly, the need for Rio undeniable, but she didn’t want to fumble and waste any time.</p><p>The door clicked shut behind them, the sound echoing softly in the quiet of the hotel room. Rio’s breath was still shallow, her lips tingling from the heated kisses she and Agatha had shared in the elevator. The warmth of the room enveloped them, a stark contrast to the biting winter chill outside. She watched as Agatha kicked off her heels, the soft thud of them hitting the carpet making Rio’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>Agatha turned to her, cheeks flushed, a playful glint in her eyes. “You’re staring,” she teased, her voice low and velvety, the kind that made Rio’s stomach twist in the best way.</p><p>Rio bit her lip, the faint taste of Agatha’s cherry gloss still lingering there. “Can you blame me?” she murmured, her eyes trailing over Agatha’s form. The silky blouse she wore clung to her curves, the top button undone, revealing just enough to make Rio’s thoughts spiral.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, her fingers brushing against Rio’s wrist. “You’re incorrigible,” she whispered, her breath warm against Rio’s ear. The scent of her perfume, something floral and intoxicating, filled the space between them.</p><p>Rio’s pulse quickened as she reached out, her fingers tangling in the fabric of Agatha’s blouse. “Come here,” she said, pulling her closer until their bodies pressed together. The heat between them was electric, a spark that had been building all evening.</p><p>Their lips met again, softer this time, but no less urgent. Rio could feel the way Agartha melted into her, her hands sliding up Rio’s back, pulling her even closer. The room felt smaller somehow, the air thicker, charged with something undeniable.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, Agatha’s eyes were dark, her lips slightly swollen. “I want you,” she said, the words barely audible but ringing in Rio’s ears like a bell.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. “I’m yours,” she replied, her voice trembling with need.</p><p>Agatha took her hand, leading her toward the floor-to-ceiling mirror that dominated one wall of the room. The dim light from the bedside lamps reflected off the glass, casting soft shadows across their faces. Rio’s heart pounded as Agatha turned to face her, their reflections staring back at them.</p><p>“Look at us,” Agatha murmured, her fingers trailing up Rio’s arm. “Just us.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked to the mirror, taking in the way their bodies fit together, the way Agatha’s hand rested possessively on her hip. It was surreal, seeing themselves like this, raw and unfiltered.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her lips brushing against Rio’s neck. “Let me show you how much I love you,” she whispered, her voice sending shivers down Rio’s spine.</p><p>Rio nodded, her throat too tight to speak. Agatha’s hands moved to the hem of Rio’s sweater, tugging it off in one smooth motion. The cool air hit her skin, but it was nothing compared to the heat of Agatha’s gaze as she took her in.</p><p>“You’re beautiful,” Agatha said, her voice full of wonder. She reached out, her fingers skimming over Rio’s collarbone, down to the cups of her bra. She unhooked it with practiced ease, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught as Agatha’s hands cupped her breasts, her thumbs brushing over her nipples. The sensation was overwhelming, her body arching into the touch.</p><p>“Lean on the mirror,” Agatha instructed, her voice firm but gentle.</p><p>Rio obeyed, her palms pressing against the cool glass. Her heart raced as Agatha knelt behind her, her hands sliding down Rio’s sides to her waistband. She hooked her fingers into Rio’s jeans, tugging them down along with her underwear.</p><p>The air was cool against her bare skin, but it was nothing compared to the heat of Agatha’s breath as she kissed the inside of Rio’s thigh. Rio’s legs trembled, her fingers gripping the edge of the mirror for support.</p><p>“Relax,” Agatha murmured, her lips brushing against Rio’s core. The first touch of her tongue was electric, sending a jolt of pleasure through Rio’s body. She gasped, her head falling back as Agartha took her time, her movements slow and deliberate.</p><p>Each stroke of her tongue was maddening, the pressure building in Rio’s gut until she was trembling, her breath coming in shallow gasps. She could see their reflections in the mirror, Agatha kneeling behind her, her hands gripping Rio’s hips, the sight only adding to the intensity.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whimpered, her voice breaking. “I’m close…”</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop, her tongue circling Rio’s clit, her fingers slipping inside her. The dual sensation was too much, the pleasure cresting until Rio was shaking, her body convulsing with the force of her orgasm.</p><p>When it finally subsided, Rio slumped against the mirror, her legs barely holding her up. Agatha stood, her lips glistening, a satisfied smile on her face.</p><p>“Your turn,” Rio said, her voice still shaky but determined. She turned to face Agatha, her hands reaching for the buttons of her blouse. One by one, she undid them, revealing the lace bra underneath. She unhooked it, letting it fall to the floor, and then her jeans followed.</p><p>Agatha stood before her, completely bare, her skin glowing in the soft light. Rio’s throat went dry as she took her in, every curve, every freckle, every inch of her perfection.</p><p>She stepped closer, her hands trailing up Agatha’s sides, feeling the way her breath hitched at the touch. “You’re stunning,” Rio whispered, her lips brushing against Agatha’s neck.</p><p>She pressed her body against Agatha’s, their skin meeting in a delicious friction. Her hands slid down to Agatha’s ass, lifting her slightly and guiding her toward the foot of the bed. Rio gently laid her down, her hands trailing up Agatha’s legs, spreading them apart.</p><p>She bent down, her lips brushing against Agatha’s inner thigh. “Let me taste you,” she murmured, her breath hot against her skin.</p><p>Agatha’s hips arched slightly, a soft moan escaping her lips. Rio didn’t wait any longer, her tongue finding Agatha’s clit, circling it in slow, deliberate motions. She could feel the way Agatha’s body responded, her legs trembling, her fingers tangling in Rio’s hair.</p><p>“Oh, Rio…” Agatha moaned, her voice thick with desire.</p><p>Rio increased the pressure, her tongue moving faster, her fingers slipping inside Agatha. The combination was enough to make Agatha cry out, her body arching off the bed as she came, her release spilling over Rio’s tongue.</p><p>When the waves of pleasure finally subsided, Agatha laid back, her chest rising and falling rapidly. Rio kissed her way up Agatha’s body, her lips lingering on her stomach, her breasts, her neck.</p><p>“You’re incredible,” Agatha whispered, her eyes meeting Rio’s.</p><p>Rio smiled, her heart swelling with love. “So are you.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>The next morning, the soft light of the early New York sun filtered through the curtains of the suite. The room was quiet except for the steady rhythm of their breathing. Agatha was still wrapped in Rio’s arms, her head resting on Rio’s chest. The intimacy of the night before lingered in the air, and neither of them wanted to let go of the closeness they’d found, not yet.</p><p>Agatha shifted slightly, her fingers tracing the lines of Rio’s skin as she looked up at her, her lips curving into a small, contented smile.</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha whispered softly, her voice still heavy with the remnants of sleep.</p><p>Rio’s fingers gently tangled in Agatha’s hair as she leaned down to kiss her, a slow, tender kiss that said everything words couldn’t. “Morning,” she replied, her voice hushed, still feeling the weight of the night in her chest. “I can’t believe how incredible last night was. I—” She paused, a soft laugh escaping her lips. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget it.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her thumb brushing over Rio’s wrist. “Neither will I. I’ve never felt more alive,” she said, her eyes gleaming with a mix of affection and something deeper. “It was perfect. You were perfect.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart skip a beat at Agatha’s words. “So were you,” she whispered, feeling the warmth of Agatha’s touch against her skin.</p><p>They lay there for a moment, wrapped up in each other, before Agatha reluctantly sat up, stretching her arms above her head. “We should probably get ready for today,” she said, glancing at the clock. “I have my presentation this afternoon.”</p><p>Rio followed her lead, sitting up as well and running a hand through her messy hair. “Right,” she said, her voice still thick with sleep, but a smile tugging at the corners of her lips. “I want to look good by your side today”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a teasing smile. “You’re already more than stunning, but I think you can manage.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, pushing herself out of bed and stretching. “I’ll do my best. I want to look sharp for you.”</p><p>Agatha stood and walked over to the windows, drawing the curtains open. The view of Central Park spread out before them, the city waking up in all its grandeur. It was surreal being here, in this moment, in this place. Everything felt new and electric, as if their time in New York was marking the beginning of something even more significant.</p><p>“Do you think Nicky’s going to be okay with Wanda?” Rio asked, a little concern still in her voice.</p><p>Agatha turned, meeting Rio’s gaze. “He’ll be fine,” she said with a small smile. “Wanda’s great with him. He’s probably already planning to have her spoil him.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her heart lightening at the thought of Nicky having a good time with Wanda. “You’re right,” she said, moving toward Agatha, who was standing near the closet, and wrapping her arms around her from behind. “But I still miss him. It’s strange being away, even just for a few days.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands covered Rio’s, pulling them closer. “I miss him too. I haven’t been away from him for more than a couple of days in a long time. But this is good for us. For you and me. And we deserve this. We deserve a little time to just be.”</p><p>Rio leaned her head against Agatha’s back, savoring the warmth of her embrace. “You’re right. Let’s make the most of it.”</p><p>They spent the next hour getting ready, the buzz of the city outside their windows adding to the anticipation of the day ahead. Agatha wore a tailored dark suit, the sharp lines accentuating her elegance, and a soft blouse that caught the light just right. Her hair was perfectly styled, and she looked every bit the professor, the neurologist, the powerful woman she was.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, opted for a more casual but sophisticated look—dark pants and a fitted jacket that complimented her shape. She kept her hair simple, but there was something undeniably attractive in the way she moved. It was her natural confidence that made her glow just as brightly as Agatha.</p><p>As Agatha finished adjusting her blazer, she turned to Rio, her eyes gleaming with affection. “You look stunning, as always.”</p><p>Rio smiled and met Agatha’s gaze. “So do you. Ready for your big presentation?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, nerves evident in her eyes. “I guess as ready as I’ll ever be.” She took a deep breath. “It’s just a talk, right? But you’re here. That makes everything better.”</p><p>Rio reached out, gently cupping Agatha’s face in her hands. “You’ve got this. You’re incredible at what you do. I’m proud of you, no matter what.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile softened, her heart swelling with Rio’s words. “Thank you,” she whispered, leaning in for a kiss that was gentle but full of love. </p><p>~*~</p><p>The conference venue buzzed with energy as attendees filtered in, the hum of conversations filling the air. Agatha led Rio through the crowd, her confidence commanding the space, yet there was a softness in her gaze whenever she glanced at Rio. The sleek glass walls of the hall allowed views of the New York skyline, a city that had always felt larger than life, but now, standing here beside Agatha, it felt like anything was possible.</p><p>They found their seats in the middle of the hall, and Agatha immediately began scanning the program, nodding slightly as she skimmed through the session details. “First couple of talks are usually a bit dry,” she said with a wry smile, lowering her voice so only Rio could hear. “But hang in there. It’ll pick up.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I’m just here to support you,” she teased, leaning in slightly. “And, you know, for a little bit of neurology too.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her smile lingering. “I’m glad you’re here.”</p><p>As the first talk began, Agatha leaned back in her seat and turned to introduce Rio to a couple of colleagues who were nearby, catching up with them after some time apart. Agatha’s presence was magnetic as always, commanding respect with her stature while her smile added a layer of warmth to the interactions.</p><p>“This is Dr. Harper,” Agatha said, gesturing toward an older man with silver hair, who shook Rio’s hand firmly. “He’s one of the top researchers in Alzheimer’s, always pushing the boundaries of what we know.”</p><p>Dr. Harper smiled at Rio. “It’s good to meet you, Rio. Agatha has told me about your work. You’re doing some promising research into early-onset Alzheimer’s, right?”</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised to hear her work mentioned so casually. Agatha always spoke about her research with such pride, but to hear someone else acknowledge it made Rio feel a surge of pride. “Yes, that’s right,” she said, smiling. “I’ve been focusing on identifying biomarkers early in the progression of the disease. It’s been a passion of mine for a while, especially because of my grandmother.”</p><p>Dr. Harper nodded approvingly. “I’ve heard good things. Keep at it. It’s the type of research that could really make an impact.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at Rio with that quiet, reassuring confidence. “Her approach is cutting edge. I think she’s going to do something incredible in the field.”</p><p>As they continued to chat with Dr. Harper, Agatha casually mentioned, “Rio’s also my girlfriend.” The way she said it was so natural, as if it had always been that way, and Rio felt her heart swell. It wasn’t the first time Agatha had mentioned it, but it still made Rio feel a special kind of warmth.</p><p>Dr. Harper’s eyes flickered between them, and he smiled knowingly. “Well, it’s good to see a couple of brilliant minds together.”</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped a beat at the acknowledgment, and Agatha’s pride in her, even in this public setting, made her feel grounded in a way that was both humbling and thrilling. They continued talking for a little while longer, Agatha introducing Rio to a few more colleagues, each one impressed by her research.</p><p>As the talks continued, Agatha occasionally glanced over at Rio, offering her small smiles and quiet words of encouragement. With every passing moment, Rio felt more and more sure of herself, inspired by the work around her and the way Agatha had so seamlessly integrated her into this world—her world.</p><p>And as the session moved into a deeper discussion about new treatments and experimental techniques, Rio couldn’t help but feel the energy shift within her. Surrounded by like-minded people, listening to the latest breakthroughs, she was more certain than ever that she was exactly where she was meant to be.</p><p>The whole experience felt surreal—being here with Agatha, hearing people talk about the work she was doing, and knowing she had her girlfriend’s support every step of the way.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The room had filled with a quiet hum as the conference moved into its afternoon sessions. Rio, settled comfortably in the audience, watched Agatha at the front of the room with a sense of pride swelling in her chest. Agatha stood with a poised elegance, her voice steady and confident as she began her presentation on Frontotemporal Dementia. Rio couldn’t help but admire how effortlessly Agatha commanded the room, her expert knowledge shining through with every word she spoke.</p><p>There was something magnetic about Agatha’s presence, something that made Rio feel like the luckiest person in the world. The way Agatha spoke—passionately, yet with such humility—made Rio’s heart swell. It wasn’t just her intelligence or expertise in the field of neurology that captivated Rio; it was the way Agatha carried herself, the way she seemed to take on the world without needing to announce it.</p><p>As Agatha dove into the complexities of FTD, explaining its impact on behavior, personality, and language, Rio couldn’t help but think back to all the moments they’d shared together, all the quiet conversations late at night about their hopes, fears, and everything in between. This wasn’t just a brilliant scientist she was in love with—it was the woman who cared deeply for her, the one who had shown her a love she never thought she deserved.</p><p>Rio’s gaze never wavered from Agatha as she spoke about how FTD could often be mistaken for other psychiatric conditions, how the symptoms of social withdrawal and impulsivity could often go unnoticed. The words felt personal, not because Rio had experienced those symptoms firsthand, but because she could hear Agatha’s voice carrying her passion for the research that had shaped her career, the research that had driven her to dedicate herself to the study of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Listening to Agatha speak, Rio felt a profound sense of awe. Agatha had this way of making even the most complex topics feel accessible, yet there was no mistaking the depth of her expertise. It made Rio want to know more, to dive deeper into Agatha’s world and learn as much as she could, not just about her field, but about the woman herself. She felt an overwhelming pride in being with someone who had devoted her life to making the world better, one discovery at a time.</p><p>When Agatha’s presentation wrapped up, the room erupted in applause. Rio’s hands instinctively clapped harder, her smile wide, her chest full. She was in awe—not just of the work Agatha had done, but of the woman who had given her heart to her. A woman who was both a force of nature and, in Rio’s eyes, someone entirely tender and loving.</p><p>Agatha made her way back to the audience, her eyes finding Rio’s in the sea of faces. There was a brief moment, just a fleeting second, where the rest of the room seemed to fade away, and Rio saw Agatha’s eyes soften, just for her. Her smile was both proud and full of love, and Rio’s heart stuttered at the sight of it. She couldn’t believe how lucky she was to be standing beside this brilliant woman, to be able to call her not just a mentor, not just a colleague, but her partner.</p><p>“You were amazing!” Rio mouthed as Agatha neared her, and Agatha’s smile widened. Rio could feel the heat of her gaze, that same familiar warmth that always made her feel safe and cherished.</p><p>Agatha leaned down, speaking low enough so only Rio could hear. “I couldn’t have done it without you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart raced. The quiet, intimate words felt like a promise, like a deep understanding that they were in this together, no matter where their paths took them.</p><p>As Agatha sat beside her, Rio reached for her hand, her fingers intertwining with Agatha’s. “I’m so proud of you,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. Agatha’s thumb brushed gently across the back of her hand, a silent affirmation of the bond they shared.</p><p>The applause had died down, but for Rio, the room had never felt more full, more alive, than in that moment—right next to the woman she loved, who had just shared her brilliance with the world.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As the last of the conference attendees began to move toward the exits, Agatha, Rio, and their colleagues lingered, talking over the day’s talks. Rio could feel the energy still buzzing in the room, but something about the way Agatha had stiffened caught her attention. She instinctively followed Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>Evanora Harkness.</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped, and she tried to school her expression, but her pulse quickened. This wasn’t just any casual meeting. Rio had already encountered Evanora before, at the mall. The last time they’d met, Evanora’s icy cold attitude had stung. This time, she was even more striking in her confidence, dressed in a sleek, tailored suit that screamed authority. And the look she gave Rio—assessing, judging, dismissing—made Rio bristle.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, seemed frozen. Her back straightened, the weight of their history pressing down on her. There was no time to warn her; it was happening now.</p><p>“Agatha,” Evanora’s voice sliced through the air with that all-too-familiar coolness. She gave her daughter a tight smile, one that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “How quaint to see you here.”</p><p>“Mother,” Agatha said, voice tight. Her composure was remarkable, but Rio could sense the undercurrent of tension beneath her words.</p><p>Evanora didn’t even glance at Rio as she continued, her eyes fixed on Agatha with that same sharpness. “I knew you were presenting today, of course. I wouldn’t miss it. Not when I’ve heard such interesting things about you, Agatha. About your little ‘affairs.’” The word hung in the air like an accusation, a sneer creeping into her voice.</p><p>Rio felt her blood run cold. She had heard enough, but she remained quiet, her gaze steady on Evanora.</p><p>“You’ve certainly made a spectacle of yourself, haven’t you?” Evanora continued, her eyes flicking briefly to Rio. “Involving yourself with a student. A paramedic, no less. It’s disgraceful, Agatha. You’ve caused the university more trouble than you’re worth. I can’t say I’m surprised. You’ve always been so… predictable.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch at her mother’s words, but Rio saw her jaw tighten as she fought to remain composed.</p><p>“And to think,” Evanora added, her voice dripping with condescension, “that you’d stand in front of all these people, pretending to be this perfect, accomplished academic. But we both know the truth. The only reason I’m here is to see if you’re still worthy of the name Harkness. So far, I haven’t seen any evidence that you are.”</p><p>Rio felt the weight of Evanora’s gaze, and it felt like a slap, not just to Agatha, but to them both. The older woman’s words were designed to hurt, to cut deep. It was clear that Agatha had spent her entire life trying to live up to a mother who never saw her as good enough, always waiting for that approval that would never come.</p><p>“I’m not here for your approval, Mother,” Agatha said, her voice now colder than it had been all afternoon. “I’ve never needed it.”</p><p>Evanora’s lips curled into a smile that didn’t touch her eyes. “Maybe not. But I wonder how long it’ll take for you to realize how much damage you’ve done. This relationship with her—” She motioned to Rio, her tone dismissive, as though Rio was nothing but a shadow to Agatha’s mistakes. “This will only lead to more disappointment, Agatha. Mark my words.”</p><p>Agatha’s posture stiffened, her breath coming a little quicker as she clenched her hands into fists, her knuckles turning white. Rio could see the familiar hurt in Agatha’s eyes—the years of silent battles with a mother who would never acknowledge her achievements unless they met some impossible standard.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t about to let Evanora have the last word. Stepping forward, she placed a hand on Agatha’s arm, grounding her in the present moment.</p><p>“Agatha is not a disappointment to me,” Rio said firmly, her voice carrying the weight of conviction. “She’s the most brilliant woman I know, and I’m proud of her. Proud of everything she’s accomplished, both in her career and in her life. You don’t get to define her. You don’t get to tear her down.”</p><p>Evanora’s gaze shifted to Rio, and for a moment, there was a flicker of surprise in her eyes. It wasn’t often that people stood up to her, but Rio wasn’t backing down.</p><p>“You have no idea what you’re talking about,” Rio added, her voice low and controlled. “I’ve seen Agatha work harder than anyone I know. I’ve watched her fight to be the person she is, and she deserves more than your callous, homophobic judgment. So maybe you should leave her to live her life without throwing your disapproval at every turn.”</p><p>Evanora’s smile wavered for a moment, and she seemed to gather herself, her posture growing more rigid. “You’re too blinded by whatever fantasy you’ve created with her,” she said with a sharp tilt of her head. “But that’s not my concern. You’ll see the truth eventually. All of you will.”</p><p>With that, she turned on her heel, striding away with the same calculated grace that had always made Rio feel small in her presence.</p><p>Agatha remained silent for a long moment, her expression unreadable as she stared at the space where her mother had just been. Rio stayed close, offering her silent support. She wanted to say something, to offer comfort, but she knew this moment wasn’t for words. It was for presence.</p><p>Finally, Agatha spoke, her voice quiet but steady. “Thank you,” she said, her gaze softening as she looked at Rio. “I couldn’t… I couldn’t do that without you.”</p><p>Rio reached out, gently cupping Agatha’s face in her hands. “You don’t have to. I’m right here, love.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shimmered with something between gratitude and exhaustion, but Rio could see the weight lifting, just a little, from her shoulders.</p><p>Together, they stood in the wake of Evanora’s cruelty, knowing that the bond they shared was stronger than anything that could be thrown their way.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
