      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“You look like you just sprinted a mile,” Alice said, smirking. “Dr. Harkness give you a hard time today?”</p><p>Rio dropped into the seat across from her, pulling her scarf loose and letting out a sigh. “No, not really.

The way she talks, the way she challenges you. It’s like she’s… magnetic.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Alice’s smirk deepened. “Magnetic. Sure. That’s the word we’re going with?”</p><p>“Oh, stop it,” Rio groaned, her cheeks heating.</p><p>-------</p><p>Or: Rio Vidal, a PhD student, finds herself enthralled with Dr. Agatha Harkness, her Modernist poetry seminar teacher, and her adorable son, Nicky.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>College AU where Rio is a Phd student and Agatha is a professor, so it is totally age appropriate!</p><p>The title and every poem at the beginning are from the four sections of T. S Eliot's "Four Quartets."</p><p> </p><p>Also: I made a Pinterest Board for this story, feel free to check it out! https://pin.it/80WPW8Ddg</p></blockquote>

</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">         (T. S. Eliot, “Burnt Norton”, <em>Four Quartet)</em></p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><hr /><p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The seminar room at Hillman Hall was a relic of the 1950s: thick oak tables that refused to give up their polish, windows streaked with rain from the morning drizzle, and chairs that creaked with the weight of academic ambitions. Rio Vidal arrived early, as always, her bag slung over one shoulder and a steaming cup of tea balanced precariously in her hand. She liked the quiet of an empty classroom, the way the stillness echoed her thoughts before the arrival of her peers and, of course, Dr. Agatha Harkness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio placed her tea on the table nearest the window and pulled out her copy of <em>The Waste Land</em>. The cover was battered, pages marked with an ocean of multicolored tabs. She stared at the familiar text, but her thoughts drifted, as they often did, to the professor who taught the seminar.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dr. Harkness wasn’t like any academic Rio had encountered. She was sharp but never abrasive, her critiques incisive and unyieldling, as if she could strip the truth bare with a single glance. Her lectures carried the weight of someone who didn’t just teach literature but lived it, her voice weaving between the cadences of Eliot and the rebellion of Stein like she had known them personally. Her writing, too—critical essays interspersed with poetry—commanded reverence in the literary circles Rio desperately wanted to join.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The seminar door creaked open, and in walked Dr. Harkness herself, precisely on time. She carried nothing but a thin folder, her dark coat trailing behind her like a cape. She was tall, her posture upright, and her long brown hair was pinned up in a way that looked effortless but must have taken precision and years of practice. Her gaze swept the room, and Rio felt a jolt when their eyes met—a fleeting connection, heavy and charged – at least on Rio’s side - before the professor’s attention moved on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good afternoon,” Dr. Harkness began, her voice rich and steady. She set her folder on the table and leaned against it, arms crossed. “Today, we’ll discuss framgentation—not just in Modernist poetry, but in how it reflects the fractured human condition. Eliot believed the poet’s role was to make order out of chaos. Do we agree?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question hung in the air, and Rio forced herself to focus. She’d prepared for this discussion. Her hand rose slightly, but not before a classmate chimed in with a carefully rehearsed answer about literary traditions. Dr. Harkness listened, nodding, before cutting in with a pointed, “And yet, does that answer the question I asked?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips twitched into a smile. That was another thing about Dr. Harkess—her ability to unsettle without ever raising her voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio finally spoke, it was after a moment of courage. “I think Eliot wasn’t trying to impose order so much as document the chaos. He couldn’t fix it; he could only reflect it back to us, fragmented, like a broken mirror.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dr. Harkness turned her gaze on Rio, and for a moment, the seminar room faded away. “A fair interpretation,” she said, her tone neutral, but her eyes lingered. “Though perhaps Eliot wasn’t as passive as you suggest. Can chaos itself be an artistic choice?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her heart pounding, and tried to answer as thoughtfully as she could. But the words came out in a jumble, her nerves betraying her. Dr. Harkness listened without interruption, raised a brow then pivoted to another student, giving Rio the space to exhale.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the seminar ended, Rio felt both drained and exhilarated. As the students filed out, she lingered, pretending to pack her things slowly. Dr. Harkness was tucking her folder under one arm, her eyes already scanning the corridor beyond.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good insight today, Miss Vidal,” she said suddenly, her voice lower now that the room was nearly empty.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze, her cheeks warming. “Thank you, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The professor’s lips curved slightly, almost imperceptibly. Then, with a curt nod, she swept out of the room, leaving Rio alone in theempty room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Fascination</em>, Rio thought as she watched her go. It was a dangerous thing to feel, but she couldn’t seem to help herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio slung her bag over her shoulder and practically ran out of Hillman Hall, ignoring the curious glances of a few classmates. Her destination was clear: the small café tucked just off campus where Alice, her best friend and fellow PhD student but in musicology, was waiting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice spotted her through the window and waved, her dark curls bouncing as she leaned back in her chair. By the time Rio burst through the door, slightly out of breath, Alice already had two steaming cups of coffee on the table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You look like you just sprinted a mile,” Alice said, smirking. “Dr. Harkness give you a hard time today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio dropped into the seat across from her, pulling her scarf loose and letting out a sigh. “No, not really. She actually said I had a ‘fair interpretation.’”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s eyebrows shot up. “High praise from the Ice Queen. Did she smile this time, or was it more of a grimace?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled hereyes but couldn’t hide the small, self-conscious grin tugging at her lips. “She… sort of smiled. I think.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand. “And that made your entire week, didn’t it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tried to brush it off, stirring sugar into her coffee. “She’s just—she has this presence, you know? The way she talks, the way she challenges you. It’s like she’s… magnetic.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Uh-huh.” Alice’s smirk deepened. “Magnetic. Sure. That’s the word we’re going with?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, stop it,” Rio groaned, her cheeks heating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m just saying,” Alice continued, clearly enjoying herself. “You’ve got a bit of a thing, and it’s adorable. No judgment. I mean, who wouldn’t be at least a little fascinated by the famously untouchable Agatha Harkness?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s not like that,” Rio protested, but her voice lacked conviction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice sipped her coffee, watching Rio over the rim of her cup with a knowing gleam in her eye. “Look, I get it. She’s brilliant, intimidating, and probably smells like expensive books and disappointment. But just… be careful, okay? Fascinations have a way of becoming obsessions.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened her mouth to respond, but the words didn’t come. Instead, she stared into her coffee, Alice’s teasing echoing in her mind. Fascination, obsession—what was the difference, really? And why did the thought of Dr. Harkness, with her imperious presence and unreadable expressions, make her feel both thrilled and utterly unmoored?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned back in her chair, her teasing smirk fading into a grin. “Speaking of obsessions, don’t forget you’re drumming for us this Friday. It’s a big gig, and we need your rhythm to keep Jen  from going rogue again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, but a smile tugged at her lips. “Don’t remind me. I still have bruises from carrying that drum kit up for three flights of stairs last time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Small price to pay for fame and glory,” Alice quipped, raising her coffee like a toast. “Besides, the crowd loves you. You might even get some groupies this time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress a laugh. Playing with Alice’s band wasn’t something she had planned when she’d started her PhD, but it had become one of her favorite escapes. There was something freeing about letting loose on the drums, the rhythms drowning out the stress of thesis deadlines and seminar discussions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be there,” Rio said, pointing a mock-threatening finger at Alice. “But if Jen tries to change the setlist mid-performance again, I’m walking offstage.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Fair,” Alice replied, holding up her hands in surrender. “I already gave her the ‘don’t mess with Rio’ speech. Besides, you’re the bakcbone of the band. And between you and me, I think you secretly like it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Maybe a little. But only because you’re in it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice beamed at her, leaning forward. “Good answer. Now, let’s plan this setlist. You’ve got two days to nail the tempo changes for our new song.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they dived into band logistics, Rio felt the weight of her morning seminar lift. The prospect of performing gave her something tangible to look forward to—a beat she could control in her world full of chaos. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Alice began sketching out the setlist on a napkin, Rio’s phone buzzed in her pocket. She glanced at the screen and saw Lilia’s name flashing. Excusing herself with a quick gesture, she stepped outside the café, the brisk air biting at her cheeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi, Lilia,” Rio answered, her voice softening instinctively.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, sweetheart,” Lilia’s warm, familiar voice came through. “I was wondering if you’re coming to dinner tonight. I made that stew you like—the one with the chickpeas and all those spices. It’s been a while since we caught up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, the tension from her morning slipping away. “You didn’t have to go all out for me, Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course I did,” Lilia replied with mock indignation. “You’re working yourself to the bone. Someone’s got to make sure you eat something that’s not from a campus vending machine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed. “Guilty as charged. Yeah, I can come by tonight. You’re too good to me, you know that?” She glanced at her watch. “I can come over after my dance class. I’m teaching the little ones today, so I might be a bit late, but I’ll be there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dance class? You’re still cramming your schedule full, aren’t you?” Lilia said, a mixture of affection and mild exasperation in her tone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s not that bad,” Rio protested lightly. “Besides, I love it. They’re a good group, they’re so cute you should see them, even if I do have to keep prying them off the barre every five minutes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed. “Well, as long as it’s not wearing you out. Come by when you’re done. Dinner will be waiting, and I expect to hear all about your day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Deal,” Rio said with a smile. “See you tonight, Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she hung up and walked back into the café, the thought of her dance class filled her with a comforting sense of rhythm. It was another part of her life that kept her grounded—a space where she could share her love of movement with wide-eyed kids still discovering the magic of pliés and jetés. The promise of Lilia’s presence and her warm kitchen afterward made the long day ahead feel a little lighter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After years of bouncing between foster homes, Lila had been the one constant in her life, taking her in at sixteen—a steady presence with a knack for tough love and perfectly spiced meals. She wasn’t family in the traditional sense, but she was home, in a way that mattered more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio returned to the table, Alice raised an eyebrow. “Lilia?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio said, sitting down and picking up her coffee. “She wants me to come to dinner tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice grinned. “Lucky you. Homemade food and a chance to escape the madness for a bit. Tell her I said hi.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will,” Rio said, and for a moment, she let herself enjoy the warmth of the café, the hum of Alice’s band plans, and the promise of a home-cooked meal waiting for her later.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After finishing their coffees and finalizing the setlist for Friday’s gig, Rio and Alice gathered their things and headed toward the university library. The sprawling, ivy-covered building was a sanctuary for students juggling deadlines and academic ambitions, and Rio felt the usual mix of anticipation and dread as they pushed through the heavy wooden doors.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The library smelled of old paper and faint coffee, the kind of comforting scent that always reminded Rio of late nights buried in books. She followed Alice to their usual spot—a tucked-away corner on the second floor near the poetry section. It was quiet but close enough to a window to let in slivers of light on gloomy days like this one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice plopped her bag onto the table and pulled out a thick stack of sheet music. “Alright, time to figure out how to make Bartók sound exciting to my supervisor,” she muttered, pulling a face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled as she set up her laptop and opened her notebook, its pages covered in handwritten notes for her thesis. “I’m sure you’ll manage,” she said. “You’re good at making even the most niche topics sound fascinating.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right back at you, Miss ‘Modernism and the Language of Timelessness,’” Alice quipped. “Speaking of which, how’s that coming along? Or have you been too busy staring at Dr. Harkness to get anything done?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a look but couldn’t help laughing. “I’ve been working on it. I’m still stuck on the section about the intersections between Eliot’s grasp of time and his poetic fragmentation. It feels like no matter how much I write, it’s never enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned back in her chair, spinning a pen between her fingers. “Sounds like classic imposter syndrome. You’re brilliant, Rio. Don’t let the ghosts of dead poets tell you otherwise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Rio said softly, her smile fading into thoughtfulness as she turned to her laptop. She spent the next few hours alternating between writing and flipping through her dog-eared copy of <em>The Waste Land</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice worked beside her, occasionally humming snatches of music under her breath, the sound a comforting counterpoint to the quiet buzz of the library. It was moments like these—focused, productive, and grounded in the presence of her best friend—that reminded Rio why she loved academia, even when it felt overwhelming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the light outside began to fade, Rio glanced at her watch. Her dance class was only a couple of hours away, and then, dinner with Lilia. It was going to be a long day, but for now, she felt ready to take it on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The soft glow of a desk lamp illuminated Agatha Harkness’s office, the only souce of light in her otherwise dark office, illuminating the stacks of books and papers scattered across her desk. Outside, the campus had quieted, the bustle of the day replaced by the faint hum of distant conversations and footsteps.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Aatha sipped her tea—black, unsweetened, and long since gone cold—as she turned to the stack of essays awaiting her attention. Her fountain pen hovered in her hand, poised to strike out an errant phrase or scribble a curt remark in the margins. She took grading seriously, perhaps too seriously, treating it less like an academic chore and more like a craft.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Midway through the pile, she paused. An essay titled <em>Fragmentation and the Search for Wholeness in Eliot’s Later Works</em> caught her eye. It was written in the sharp, clear hand of Miss Vidal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agtha adjusted her glasses and began reading. By the second paragraph, her brow lifted in interest. By the third, she was leaning back in her chair, the faintest hint of a smile playing on her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Miss Vidal’s analysis was incisive, her arguments carefully constructed and grounded in textual evidence. There was a subtlety to her insights—a willingness to engage with the uncertainty and contradictions in Eliot’s work rather than smoothing them over. Agatha found herself nodding as she read, her pen marking the margins not with corrections but with the occasional “good” or “yes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached the conclusion, which wove the essay’s threads into a cohesive and compelling argument. Agatha set the paper down and stared at it for a moment, her fingers drumming lightly against her desk. There was something about Miss Vidal’s work that lingered—an undercurrent of passion that felt both familiar and unepxected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Pulling a sheet of grading sheets closer, she began to write her comments with deliberate care.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Miss Vidal, this is an exceptional piece of work. Your analysis is thoughtful and well-articulated, and your willingness to engage with the complexities of Eliot’s later poetry demonstrates both intellectual rigor and creative insight. Keep pushing yourself to explore these ideas further—I suspect they have more to reveal to you.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha signed her name at the bottom, hesitating for the briefest moment before adding: <em>“Well done.”</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Setting the paper aside, she allowed herself another small smile before returning to the next essay in the pile. But even as she worked, Miss Vidal’s words stayed with her, a reminder that every so often, a student’s brilliance could cut through the routine like light through a crack in the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sun had dipped below the horizon, casting Agatha’s office in a deep blue twilight. She rubbed her temples, feeling the fatigue of the day creeping in. Glancing at her watch, she realized it was time to wrap up. Her lips quirked into a rare smile as she gathered her things</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Grading could wait, but her son could not.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Pushing back her chair, Agatha stood and draped her coat over her arm. Her son’s dance class was only a short drive from campus, and she cherished these moments of transition: the shift from her role as a demanding professor tosomething softer and more instinctual—a mother.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She locked her office and made her way through the quiet corridors of the English department, her heels echoing faintly against the stone floors. As she stepped outside, the crisp evening air greeted her, and she quickened her pace, eager to see her baby. No matter how draining her day had been, the sight of her son running toward her, his face flushed with the joy of movement, always made it worthwhile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dance center hummed with energy as Agatha stepped inside, the familiar scent of wood polish and faint traces of lavender in the air. She adjusted her coat and made her way toward the classroom where her son’s lesson was wrapping up, her heels muffled by the soft flooring.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Peeking through the large observation window, she scanned the room, her sharp gaze softening as she spotted her son – Nicky - among the group of children. He was laughing, his small frame moving with the carefree enthusiasm that only a six-year-old could muster.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But what caught Agatha’s attention wasn’t just her son—it was the figure crouched beside him, gently fixing the elastic of his little black ballet slipper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio Vidal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Agatha stood frozen, a flicker of surprise darting through her. She’d known Miss Vidal was a multifaceted student, but she hadn’t anticipated seeing her here, guiding a group of children with the same focus and precision she displayed in her writing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s voice carried across the room, calm yet encouraging. “Good job today, everyone! Remember, point your toes during your jetés—otherwise, I’ll have to start calling them bunny hops.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The children giggled, her son included. Rio smiled warmly at them, her easy rapport with the kids evident in the way they crowded around her at the end of the class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the other children began to trickle out, Rio knelt again to meet Nicky at eye level. “You’ve been working so hard,” she said with a gentle smile, helping him gather his small dance bag. “Your balance is getting better every week. High five?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He grinned, slapping her hand enthusiastically before running toward the door. As he exited the classroom, he spotted Agatha and lit up. “Mama!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crouched to embrace him, pressing a kiss to his head. “Did you have fun, darling?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah! Miss Rio said I did really good today!” he replied, his voice brimming with pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood, her gaze drifting to Rio, who was tidying up the studio. Rio glanced up, and their eyes met. For a second, there was a flicker of recognition—surprise and a slight blush appearing across Rio’s face, quickly replaced by something more composed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” Agatha said smoothly, stepping into the room with her son in toe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness.” Rio’s voice was polite, her expression unreadable but tinged with a hint of curiosity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wasn’t aware you were a teacher here,” Agatha said, her tone neutral but edged with intrigue.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">io shrugged lightly, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear. “It’s something I do on the side. Keeps me sane between thesis chapters.” Her smile was faint, but genuine. “We take turns with the other teachers.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s son tugged at her hand, looking up at Rio with wide eyes. “Mama, Miss Rio’s the best! Can I show you my plié?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly. “Perhaps another time, darling.” She glanced at Rio again, a spark of approuval in her sharp blue gaze. “It seems your talents extend beyond academia, Miss Vidal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head slightly, her blush returning. “Oh, it’s just something I enjoy. And the kids are amazing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, and said her goodbye, echoed by an enthusiastic but tired Nicky, hanging off her arm, almreay pulling her forward.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha escorted her son out of the studio, her mind lingered on the unexpected encounter. There was more to Rio Vidal than met the eye—and, somehow, that only made her all the more intriguing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p>*</p><p>*<br /><br /></p>

</p><p align="justify">       (Eliot, “Burnt Norton”, <em>Four Quartets)</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dance center emptied out slowly, the sounds of laughter and scuffling feet fading into the crisp evening air as Rio locked up the studio. She slung her bag over her shoulder, her muscles pleasantly sore from the day’s lessons. The encounter with Dr. Harkness lingered in the back of her mind, unexpected and strangely significant, though she brushed the thought aside as she made her way toward Lilia’s house.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The walk wasn’t far—Lilia’s small, cozy home was nestled just off campus, tucked into a quiet neighborhood lined with tall trees. The warm glow of the porch light greeted Rio as she climbed the steps and rang the doorbell.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Moments later, the door swung open to reveal Lilia, her warm smile framed by soft curls that had gone gray over the years. “There’s my girl,” she said, pulling Rio into a hug that smelled of spices and fresh bread. “Come in, you must be starving.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Always,” Rio said, stepping inside and shedding her coat. The house was as inviting as ever, filled with the scent of Lilia’s cooking and the faint crackle of a fire in the living room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sit, sit,” Lilia urged, gesturing to the small kitchen table already set with mismatched plates and bowls. “How was your day?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sank into a chair, letting out a long breath. “Busy. Classes, grading, dance…oh, and Dr. Harkness showed up to pick up her kid from my class.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyebrows shot up as she ladled stew into a bowl for Rio. “Dr. Harkness? Your professor? Small world.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Tell me about it,” Rio said, shaking her head. “It felt…weird, seeing her there. Like she stepped out of the seminar room and into my other life. But her kid’s adorable. He’s in my six-year-old group.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled, setting the bowl in front of Rio. “Sounds like fate’s having a bit of fun with you. And how are you holding up with everything else? Thesis work? Band rehearsals?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio picked up her spoon, letting the rich aroma of the stew soothe her. “It’s a lot, but I’m managing. The band’s got a gig this Friday, and my supervisor actually liked my latest draft, so…progress.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good.” Lilia sat across from her, a knowing look in her eyes. “Just don’t forget to take care of yourself in the process. You’ve got a lot on your plate, but you’re not in this alone, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio met her gaze and smiled, a wave of gratitude washing over her. “I know, Lilia. Thanks for always reminding me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They ate in comfortable silence for a while, the soft clink of spoons against bowls filling the space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dinner, as the evening settled into a quiet hum, Rio stood up and helped Lilia clear the table. The familiar routine felt comforting, like a small ritual that tethered her to this place—this home—that had been her refuge for years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Lilia moved into the living room to clean up, Rio wandered slowly around the house, her eyes drawn to the framed photographs hanging on the walls. She had seen them countless times before, but tonight, they felt different. The images seemed to capture more than just moments frozen in time—they held memories, stories of her life before she came to Lilia, of the woman who had become her anchor in the stomr.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">One photo caught her attention—Lilia, ten years younger, standing on a beach with a wide smile, her arms wrapped around a younger version of Rio. SHe felt a pang of nostalgia. She could almost hear the laughter in the photo, the carefree energy that had once felt so foreign to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio traced the edges of the frame with her fingers, the weight of the years suddenly more apparent. She remembered the first time Lilia had took her in, a scared, angry teenager who had known nothing but the instability of the foster care system. At the time, she hadn’t trusted anyone—least of all a stranger offering a roof over her head. But Lilia had been patient, always steady, always there, guiding her through those rough years with unwavering tryst and strength.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Moving on, Rio’s gaze landed on another photo—this one taken at a ballet recital. A teenage Rio clad in a blue leotard and her hair up in a bun stood with a bright, shy smile, Lilia’s arm draped around Rio’s shoulders who was holding a bunch of flowers, their faces both flushed with pride. It had been her very first glower bouqet. Rio could see in the picture how far she had come, how much Lilia had helped her rebuild herself, piece by piece.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She paused at a larger framed portrait on the wall near the hallway, one that always caught her eye. It was of the two of them, smiling together at a small family gathering, arms wrapped around each other like they belonged. Lilia’s face radiated warmth, and Rio looked so much younger, maybe seventeen or eighteen, her features softer, her expression more guarded than it was now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned closer to the photo, studying her younger self—the girl who had been so lost, so broken. She barely recognized her. It was hard to imagine that person was the same one who stood here now, a PhD student, a dance teacher, someone who had found a place in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia appeared in the doorway, watching her quietly for a moment before speaking. “You always spend a little extra time with those pictures,” she said softly, her voice gentle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled faintly, turning to meet Lilia’s eyes. “I guess I get lost in them sometimes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, crossing the room to stand beside her. “I keep them around to remind myself of how far we’ve come. Of how much you’ve grown.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, her emotions welling up unexpectedly. “I still can’t believe you took me in,” she said, her voice thick with emotion. “I never would have made it without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia placed a hand on her shoulder, her touch firm and reassuring. “You made it, Rio. You always had it in you. I just helped you find your way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung in the air, and for a long moment, Rio allowed herself to feel the weight of them—the depth of their meaning. She wasn’t sure where she would be without Lilia, but in this moment, she knew exactly where she was: home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She looked at the photos one last time, taking a deep breath, before finally pulling away. “Thank you, Mom,” she whispered. It was a word she didn’t use all the time, but it held weight when she did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia simply nodded, her eyes soft. “Always, sweet girl. Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify">In the large Harkness home, the quiet of the evening settled in Agatha’s big yet cozy living room. She moved with ease, setting aside her long blue coat and placing her bag on the couch before glancing at the clock. It was a little later than usual, but Nicky had still been full of energy when she’d picked him up from his dance class but Nicky, as always, had found a second wind after his brief nap in the car. He was never too tired to talk about dance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, my little dancer,” Agatha said gently as she entered Nicky’s room, her voice warm yet firm with the authority of a mother who had long since perfected the art of bedtime routines. “Time to get into bed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, with his ever-present enthusiasm, jumped onto his bed and wriggled under the covers, his eyes wide with excitement. “Mama, Miss Rio said I did really good today! I did my jump just like she showed me. And she laughed when I did it, Mama! She said I had really good balance!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips quirked at the mention of Miss Rio. Nicky’s admiration for his dance teacher was clear—he could hardly stop talking about her, his face glowing with pride. “That’s wonderful, sweetheart,” Agatha said, sitting down beside him on the edge of the bed. “It sounds like Miss Rio is a really good teacher.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah! She said I’m getting better, Mama.” Nicky grinned, his small hand reaching up to grasp Agatha’s. “I’m going to be a ballerino like her, Mama, but I’ll be better!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, brushing a lock of hair from his forehead. “You’re already a little ballerino, Nicky. You’ll be great.” She paused, her fingers tracing the edge of the blanket. “You really like Miss Rio, don’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded, his face lighting up. “She’s nice,” he said, his voice turning softer, sleep creeping in at the edges. “She’s always laughing, and she helps me when I don’t get things right.” He paused, his brows furrowing in thought before he added, “And she smells nice too! Like… flowers.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an amused brow. “Flowers?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah! Like the park. Or maybe like the sun.” Nicky yawned, his grip on her hand loosening. “I like Miss Rio, Mama.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened as she stroked his hair, her thoughts turning inward. She had only briefly interacted with Rio Vidal at the dance center, but hearing Nicky talk so freely about her, his admiration so genuine, made Agatha even more curious. There was something about her student, something more than the impressive academic talent she showed in class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The way she taught children—patient, encouraging, seemingly able to make them feel seen and valued—had been evident even in their brief exchange at the dance center. But Agatha could tell there was more beneath the surface, something she hadn’t quite placed yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sounds like Miss Rio is a very special teacher,” Agatha said, her voice quiet as she watched Nicky’s eyes flutter with sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She is!” Nicky murmured, his voice already growing drowsy. “She says I’m getting better, Mama…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I have no doubt,” she murmured, pressing a lingering kiss to his forehead and bringing his blue stuffed dragon closer to his chest. “Get some rest now, sweetheart. I love you more than the moon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“More than the stars?” he mumbled sleepily.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, smoothing his curls one last time. “More than the stars.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">AsNicky drifted off to sleep, his soft breathing filling the room, Agtaha sat for a moment longer, her mind still on her student. There was something undeniably intriguing about Rio Vidal. And as the quiet stretched on, her curiosity deepened, pulling her thoughts back to the girl who had been so effortlessly kind and skiled with Nicky, and who, in Agatha’s eyes, carried a certain mystery that was hard to ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A few days later, Agatha stood at the front of the seminar room. Her seminar on Modernist poets was always well attended, and she was used to the quiet buzz of eager minds settling into their seats. The chairs clinked softly, papers shuffled, and the scent of freshly brewed coffee lingered in the air—an essential part of every class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a deep breath, her gaze sweeping over the room, noting the familiar faces of her students, including the ever-focused Rio Vidal. Rio sat near the front in the second row, as always, her posture straight, her attention ready. She hadn’t missed a single seminar since the semester began, and Agatha found herself watching Rio’s concentration, her curiosity about the student only growing since their unexpected encounter at the dance center.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, everyone,” Agatha said, her voice carrying effortlessly across the room. “Today, we’ll be exploring T.S. Eliot’s <em>The Waste Land</em>, with a focus on its fragmented structure and its exploration of disillusionment in the post-war world. I know it’s a lot to digest, but I expect you all to bring your insights, as always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a murmur of assent from the students as Agatha moved to the whiteboard, scribbling down the key points for the day’s discussion. Her sharp eyes flicked over to Rio, who was already flipping through her notes, her pen poised to take careful, methodical annotations.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the class progressed, Agatha guided the students through Eliot’s dense imagery and fragmented verses. She had a way of drawing out connections that seemed buried beneath the surface, a skill that kept even the most hesitant of students engaged. Rio, as expected, had already dived deep into the text, her insights cutting through the surface of the material with ease. Agatha found herself drawn to Rio’s answers, the thoughtfulness in her responses, the way she challenged the traditional readings of Eliot’s work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal, would you care to expand on your point about Eliot’s use of fragmentation as a reflection of post-war anxiety?” Agatha asked, her voice smooth but carrying an underlying curiosity that was hard to hide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced up, her eyes focused but calm, her hand trambling the only sign of her nervousness. “Of course, Dr. Harkness. I think Eliot’s fragmented style mimics the fractured nature of human consciousness during that time. The chaos of the modern world is reflected not just in the themes but in the structure of the poem itself. It’s as though the poet is trying to piece together something lost or irretrievable, but the pieces never quite fit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned against the desk, her gaze fixed on Rio, noting the passion in her delivery, the confidence in her voice despite the quiet intensity she always carried. There was something about Rio’s approach to literature—something reflective, yet raw—that made Agatha feel both impressed and intrigued.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s an excellent observation,” Agatha responded, her tone warmer than usual. “Eliot’s use of fragmentation might indeed suggest an inherent disintegration in how we perceive the world—this constant attempt to make sense of the chaos around us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The class continued, but Agatha found herself paying closer attention to Rio. Her mind wandered slightly, thinking back to their encounter at the dance center, her son’s glowing praise of Rio’s teaching, and the effortless warmth she’d exuded. There was more to Rio than met the eye, and Agatha couldn’t help but wonder about the layers beneath her composed exterior. The thoughtful, articulate student in front of her seemed like a far cry from the carefree, slihhtly chaotic dance instructor who had interacted with her son only days ago.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the seminar came to a close, Agatha dismissed the class, and the students gathered their things. Rio paused, gathering her notes slowly, her fingers brushing against the edges of the pages as she stood. She glanced at Agatha, and for a moment, their eyes met—a silent exchange passing between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you for the discussion, Dr. Harkness,” Rio said, her voice soft but sincere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Always a pleasure, Miss Vidal,” Agatha replied, her curiosity piqued once more. “I look forward to hearing more of your insights as the semester progresses.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave her a small smile and a nod before heading out, leaving Agatha standing there for a moment longer, her thoughts swirling around the enigmatic student who continued to captivate her attention in ways she hadn’t expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Friday night arrived with the familiar hum of excitement in the air of the campus’s bar. Rio stood backstage, her drumsticks in hand, the cool evening air filtering through the back door of the venue. The bar was dimly lit, filled with anticipation as people chatted and sipped their drinks. The sound of a band tuning their instruments and the occasional burst of laughter made the space feel alive, buzzing with energy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, standing beside her, adjusted her bass while Jen tuned in her guitar, and flashed Rio a wide grin. “Ready for this?” she asked, her voice full of playful excitement. Her outfit—girly, pink, with a bit of sparkle—was as bold as her personality, contrasting Rio’s more understated look in a simple black tee and jeans, her hair loose around her face, sotfening her features.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Always,” Rio replied, giving a quick nod. Her heart raced with the familiar mix of nerves and exhilaration. It had been a while since she had played a live gig with Alice’s band (madz of three people really), and she was itching for the adrenaline rush of the crowd, the beat of the drums pulsing through her veins.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound of the opening chords broke through their conversation as the lights dimmed and the crowd grew louder. The stage manager gave them a nod, signaling it was their turn to take the stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s rock this,” Alice said, clapping Rio’s shoulder before they made their way to the stage, joining the rest of the band.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The crowd’s energy hit them immediately as they took their positions. The bass rumbled in Rio’s chest, and the rhythm section took hold of the room like an electric charge. As the first notes rang out, Rio could feel the beat taking over, her body moving instinctively with the rhythm. Her hands flew across the drum kit with practiced precision, hitting the toms and cymbals with the ease of someone who had spent countless hours perfecting the craft. THe music was like an extension of her body, flowing from her limbs, and the audience could feel it too—the way she became one with the beat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The band played through their set, and Rio was lost in the music. The lights, the cheers, the pulse of the crowd—it all melted away, leaving only the sound of their instruments filling the air. She could see Alice grinning on stage, her bass thloud, her energy contagious. For a moment, Rio felt like she could do this forever—feel the rush of the music, feel alive in the moment. It was a stark contrast to the quieter life she led outside the spotlight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Halfway through the set, the music reached a crescendo, the crowd swaying with the rhythm as they fed off the band’s energy. Alice leaned toward Rio, shouting over the music, “This is our best crowd yet! They love us!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned in return, drumming harder, faster, and feeling the rhythm of the room like an electric current. Every beat was a statement, every crash of the cymbals an echo of her heartbeat, and for the first time in days, her mind felt free—no worries, no responsibilities, just the music.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the final song of their set approached, Alice turned to her, giving a knowing look. Rio nodded in response, a slight grin tugging at her lips. It was time for their signature closing number. Alice’s fingers moved to the first note, and Rio took a deep breath, her hands hovering over the drumsticks, ready to unleash.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The final notes echoed through the club as the band finished their set, the crowd erupting into applause. Rio’s heart pounded in her chest, her body buzzing with the echoes of the performance. She could feel the sweat on her brow, the adrenaline still coursing through her veins.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the lights brightened and the applause continued, Rio exchanged a quick look with Alice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You were amazing out there,” Alice said as they made their way offstage, still buzzing with the energy of the performance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Rio replied, her smile wide. “You were awesome too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The band gathered backstage, catching their breath and high-fiving each other. It was a moment of camaraderie, and Rio reveled in it, even as her mind drifted slightly—perhaps just for a moment—to the things waiting for her offstage, like her thesis, her classes, and her curious professor, Dr. Harkness. But for now, the night was theirs, and Rio had no intention of letting go of the thrill of the gig just yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, the band’s guitarist, stood nearby, her fingers still lightly vibrating from the final strums of the set. As a PhD student in chemistry, she was the type to approach both her academic work and her music with a meticulous yet passionate attitude, sometimes haughty but always loyal. While her field was worlds away from the music scene, Jen had always been able to balance both worlds with ease. Her eyes sparkled with the same intensity whether she was discussing chemical reactions or laying down a killer riff on her guitar.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nice work out there, Rio,” Jen said, leaning against the wall as she wiped the sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. Her voice was warm, and she flashed Rio a grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Jen,” Rio replied, returning the smile. “You were on fire tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen chuckled, adjusting the strap of her guitar as she looked around at the others. “You know, it’s always a rush.

  <em>To be conscious is not to be in time</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,</em>

</p><p>
  <em>Be remembered; involved with past and future.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Only through time time is conquered.</em>
</p><p>            (T. S Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets.)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>It wasn’t long after the band’s gig that the news came. She was sitting in the small library nook on campus, sipping her coffee, when she received the email. Her PhD supervisor, who had guided her through the early stages of her thesis, had been offered a higher position at another college across the country and had decided to take it to advance his career. The decision had come suddenly, and as a result, Rio would need to be reassigned to a new supervisor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her screen, rereading the email as if the words might change the second time around.</p><p> </p><p>Her supervisor was <em>leaving</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Just like that, the already precarious balance she had been maintaining—the endless cycle of research, writing, adjusting, and rewriting—felt like it had shifted beneath her.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t particularly <em>fond</em> of him, but he had been a constant. She had learned how to work with his expectations, how to anticipate his feedback, how to navigate his sometimes overly critical comments without taking them to heart. And now, after months of careful academic maneuvering, she was being thrown into the unknown.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a slow breath, her fingers tightening around her coffee cup. A reassignment. That meant a new supervisor, a new dynamic, a new set of expectations. And at this stage in her PhD, that could be either a blessing r a disaster.</p><p> </p><p>A chair scraped across the floor nearby, snapping her out of her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you’re making <em>that</em> face,” Alice said, dropping into the seat across from her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. “What face?”</p><p> </p><p>“The ‘I just got an email that ruined my week’ face.” Alice leaned forward, propping her chin on her hand. “So, spill.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her laptop around so Alice could see the email. As Alice scanned it, her eyebrows lifted. “Damn. He really just up and left, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Apparently.” Rio leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temple. “And now I get reassigned to… someone.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice pursed her lips. “Someone better? Because, no offense, but he was <em>not</em> my favorite person.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a dry laugh. “No argument there. But at least I knew what to expect. Now I have to figure out how to impress someone else, make sure they don’t tear aparteverything I’ve already written, <em>and</em> hope they don’t have some entirely different vision for my thesis.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice tapped a finger against her mug. “You know… this could actually be a good thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shot her a look. “Do you <em>know</em> how risky this is?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice shrugged. “Sure, but also—your last guy wasn’t exactly <em>inspiring</em>. Maybe this new person will actually <em>get</em> your work. Maybe they’ll push you in the right ways.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, drumming her fingers on the table. “Or maybe they’ll make my life a living hell.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice smirked. “Ah, yes. The thrilling gamble of academia.”</p><p> </p><p>Roi groaned, slumping forward dramatically. “Why did I do this to myself?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice patted her hand sympathetically. “Because you’re brilliant, dedicated, and <em>a little</em> masochistic.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorted. “That last part is definitely true.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice took a sip of her coffee. “So… when do you find out who your new supervisor is?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced back at her screen. “It says they’ll inform me by the end of the week.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice grinned. “Perfect. That gives us a few days to stress-drink about it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed a laugh, but the tension in her shoulders didn’t quite ease. No matter how Alice spun it, the uncertainty still loomed over her.</p><p> </p><p>She just had to hope that whoever was assigned to her wasn’t about to turn her entire PhD into a nightmare.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>And indeed, on Friday, at noon sharp, the answer came.</p><p> </p><p>She had been sitting in the library again, her laptop open, but her focus shot. Her fingers tapped a restless rhythm against the table as she refreshed her inbox for what had to be the twentieth time in the last five minutes. Around her, students chatting, the librarian shushing them, and pages flipping barely registered.</p><p> </p><p>Then—</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>New Email: PhD Supervision Reassignment.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She jumped on it as if it held the universe’s secrets, eager to discover who had her fate between their hands.</p><p> </p><p>She scanned the formal pleasantries, barely registering them. But as she scrolled down the email, her breath caught in her throat, and she felt like the world had stopped turning.</p><p> </p><p>Because there, in the middle of the email was the name of her new supervisor: <em>Dr. Agtaha Harkness.</em></p><p> </p><p>The words blurred for a second.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grip tightened on the edge of her laptop as her brain fought to process what she was seeing.</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Harkness had agreed to take Rio on as a new student.</p><p> </p><p>her mind swirled. This was unexpected, to say the least. It had always been a subtle pull—a fascination she couldn’t quite shake—toward Dr. Hakness. Agtaha had a way of seeing things that made Rio question her own perspectives. And now, she was about to work under her direct supervision.</p><p> </p><p>The transition wouldn’t be easy, but Rio couldn’t deny the underlying excitement. This was a challenge, and something about it felt both intimidating and exhilarating. Agtaha, with her fierce intellect and commanding aura, was not the type of professor to let anything slide. She had a reputation for pushing her students to their limits, a trait Rio had seen firsthand in her seminars. But maybe that was exactly what Rio needed—someone who would help her refine her ideas, push her boundaries, and perhaps even help her discover parts of herself she hadn’t yet explored.</p><p> </p><p>The thought lingered in her mind as she closed her laptop and gathered her things. She couldn’t help but wonder: What would it be like, working directly with Dr. Harkness? And what did this shift mean for her own academic journey?</p><p> </p><p>A few hours later, after a long morning of classes and research, Rio met Alice for lunch at their usual spot on campus—an outdoor café near the library. They grabbed their usual order, and as they sat down at a small table under the shade of a tree, Rio couldn’t help but feel a little anxious. She had barely processed the news of her supervisor transfer, but now she was faced with telling Alice and bear her endless teasing.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I’ve got something to tell you,” she said, leaning forward a little. “You’re not going to believe it.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. “Oh? This sounds good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment before she dropped the bomb. “You remember my old supervisor left, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice huffed, offended. “Of course, I remember. Girl, I’m not that dumb.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio ignored her. “Well, I’ve been assigned a new one.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice’s eyes widened, and she leaned in, clearly eager for more. “Who?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed, the name suddenly feeling strange in her mouth. “Dr. Agatha Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>No freaking way.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a laugh—short, disbelieving. “Oh, it’s real.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice blinked. Then grinned. “Holy shit. Your academic crush is now <em>your supervisor</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t call it that,” Rio hissed, glancing around like someone might overhear.</p><p> </p><p>Alice ignored her, leaning in like she had just been handed the juiciest gossip of the year. “How did this <em>happen</em>? I mean, I know you’re one of the top students in the department, but <em>Agatha freaking Harkness</em> doesn’t just <em>take people in</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, raking a hand through her hair. “I don’t know. I mean, I guess my research aligns with her interests, but… I never thought she’d actually—” She shook her head, still processing. “She must have <em>chosen</em> me.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice smirked. “Well, obviously. And look, you’ve been obsessed with her work for <em>years</em>. This could be amazing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Or <em>terrifying</em>.” Rio sank back into her chair. “She’s—she’s <em>Dr. Harkness</em>, Alice. Have you seen the way she eviscerates people in class when they don’t meet her standards? What if she hates my thesis? What if she tears apart everything I’ve done so far?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice shrugged. “Then she makes you better. That’s kind of what you signed up for with a PhD, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned. “Not <em>this</em> level of intensity.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice sipped her coffee, watching her with amused eyes. “So… what’s the plan?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio inhaled deeply, willing herself to think. “I guess I set up a meeting. Try to figure out where she stands. And—” She ran a hand down her face. “Try not to completely panic before then.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice grinned, raising her coffee cup like a toast. “Good luck with that.” She leaned back in her seat before bursting into a knowing grin. “Oh. My. God. Rio Vidal, you are <em>so</em> screwed.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face flushed instantly, her hands awkwardly wrapping around her coffee cup. “What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice wiggled her eyebrows, leaning back in her chair with a teasing smirk. “Oh, come on. The <em>Agatha Harkness</em>? The one you’ve been staring at in class for months? The one who practically exudes ‘I’m too cool for you’ energy? You’re about to spend a <em>lot</em> of time with her, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, resting her forehead on her hand. “It’s not like that, Alice. I mean, yes, she’s… intimidating. But she’s also brilliant. And she’s going to be my supervisor. It’s, uh, professional.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sure,” Alice teased, sipping her drink. “Professional. If by ‘professional’ you mean you’re going to be spending hours in her office, just the two of you, discussing <em>modernist poets</em> and somehow—<em>somehow</em>—I don’t see how that will not reinforce your intense, intellectual crush. You sure it’s your thesis you’re writing about? Because it sounds like you’re writing about <em>her</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a long, exasperated sigh. “You’re ridiculous. It’s not like that. It’s just that… she’s really smart, okay? And she’s justmy new supervisor. It’ll be fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow. “Fine, sure. I’m just saying… if you ever need a distraction from all that, you know where to find me. Just remember—<em>professional</em>.” She emphasized the word with a teasing wink, making Rio roll her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re impossible,” she muttered, trying to hide the flush creeping up her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but you love me anyway.” Alice grinned. “But seriously, I’m excited for you. Agatha Harkness? That’s a huge deal. Just… don’t forget about us little people when you’re deep in your thesis and making profound discoveries about obscure poets and stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh, her nerves easing a bit under Alice’s lighthearted teasing. “I promise I won’t forget you, babe. You’ll still have me around to play drums at your gigs, even if I’m drowning in academic work.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the spirit!” Alice clinked her cup against Rio’s. “Now, go and conquer that thesis of yours. And don’t let Dr. Harness bite you with her intellectual powers. Even if I’m sure you wouldn’t even mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alice!” Rio cried out, blushing to the tip of her ears and coving her face with her hands, shaking her head. “I’ll try my best.”</p><p> </p><p>As they continued chatting, Rio couldn’t shake the feeling of butterflies in her stomach. There was no denying it—this new chapter with Agatha Harkness as her supervisor was going to be a challenge. But a part of her couldn’t help but feel that it might also be an opportunity for something more, even if she wasn’t sure yet what that was.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>The day of Rio’ first formal meeting with her new supervisor arrived sooner than she had expected. No amount of preparation had eased the low hum of nerves that had settled in her stomach the moment she’d woken up that morning.</p><p> </p><p>She had spent hours going over her thesis notes the night before, marking key points in the margins, reviewing every potential weak spot Agatha might pick apart. It hadn’t done much to steady her. Because <em>this</em>—having Agatha Harkness as her supervisor—was entirely different from sitting in her seminar, absorbing her lectures, and attempting to impress from a comfortable distance.</p><p> </p><p>Now, there was no distance.</p><p> </p><p>Rio arrived at the faculty building early, walking down the quiet corridor with slow, measured steps. The hallway smelled faintly of old paper and coffee, the usual scent of academia. The overhead lights buzzed softly, the only sound accompanying her footsteps. She clenched her thesis notebook a little tighter in her hand as she approached Agtah’s office.</p><p> </p><p>Through the small window on the door, she could see her new supervisor at her desk, adjusting a neat stack of papers, flipping through them with effortless precision. The sight sent a fresh wave of nerves through Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She inhaled deeply, forcing herself to calm the slight tremor in her fingers before raising a hand and knocking. The sound felt loud against the hush of the hallway, echoing more than she’d anticipated.</p><p> </p><p>A pause. Then—</p><p> </p><p>“Come in.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice, rich and smooth, carried easily through the door.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed it open and stepped inside.</p><p> </p><p>The office was exactly as she had imagined it—warm, but not in a comforting way. More in the way of controlled intellect, carefully curated over time. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined the walls, crammed with volumes on literature, philosophy, history, even a few psychology texts. A reading lamp cast a soft golden glow over the desk, where Agtaha sat with her usual air of quiet command.</p><p> </p><p>She was dressed in a crisp white button-down, sleeves cuffed at her elbows, her dark hair falling neatly well past her shoulders. There was something effortless about her presence, something completely self-assured. As Rio stepped further inside, Agatha looked up, her sharp eyes locking onto her student with unsettling focus.</p><p> </p><p>For a brief moment, Rio was hyperaware of herself—her brown corduroy overalls, the long-sleeved green shirt she’d thrown on that morning, the slight scuff on the toe of her well-worn Converse. She felt young. <em>Unpolished.</em></p><p> </p><p>And Agatha—well, she had never once seemed anything less than composed.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Vidal,” Agatha greeted, her voice even, unreadable. She gestured toward the chair opposite her desk. “Please, take a seat.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio obeyed without hesitation, lowering herself into the chair as she gripped her notebook tightly in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed against the nervous energy bubbling in her chest as she sat down, shifting slightly in the chair. The room smelled faintly of old books and black tea, the kind of scent that felt timeless, as if it had always existed in this space. Agatha regarded her with that same unreadable expression she always carried in class—cool, assessing, giving away nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Before we discuss the specifics of your thesis,” Agatha began, folding her hands atop her desk, “let’s establish expectations.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio straightened slightly, nodding.</p><p> </p><p>Agtaha’s gaze remained steady. “I assume you’re aware that I have high standards for mystudents.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Obviously.</em> rio had spent the past two years watching her eviscerate half-hearted arguments in seminar discussions with surgical precision. It was part of what made her so fascinating. Rio cleared her throat. “Yes, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Agatha replied, as if she had never expected any other answer. “I agreed to take you on because I see potential in your work. But I also expect discipline, precision, and intellectual curiosity.” She leaned back slightly, studying Rio with the same analytical sharpness that she used on poetry. “Do you believe you can meet those expectations?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her pulse in her throat but forced herself to hold Agatha’s gaze. “Yes.” Her voice came out steadier than she expected. “I do.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inclined her head slightly, something like approval flickering across her otherwise unreadable features. “Good. Now, I’d like to hear more about your work. I’ve read the latest draft your previous supervisor forwarded me, but I need to hear it from you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio straightened slightly, feeling the weight of Agatha scrutiny settle over her like a heavy cloak. Her palms were damp against the surface of her notebook, but she didn’t let herself falter. This was it—her first real chance to prove herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” she began, clearing her throat. “I’ve been thinking a lot about the way Death is represented in poetry—not just as a theme, but as a presence that lingers behind the words, shaping the tone and structure of the poems even when it isn’t explicitly named. For many Modernist poets, Death isn’t just a subject to be written about—it’s something that seeps into the very fabric of their work, influencing the rhythm, the language, even the way time is perceived within the poem. It’s almost as if Death is a figure waiting in the wings, silent but omnipresent.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her expression unreadable but clearly intrigued. “Go on,” she murmured, steepling her fingers in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a breath, her confidence growing as she found her rhythm. “I’m particularly interested in how poets like T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams engage with death in their work—not always in overt ways, but in a way that lingers in the background. Eliot’s <em>Prufrock</em>, for instance, is soaked in existential dread—not just the fear of literal death, but the death of meaning, of purpose, of selfhood. There’s a profound anxiety about time slipping away, about being forgotten before one even truly exists.</p><p> </p><p>“And then there’s Pound’s <em>In a Station of the Metro</em>—a two-line poem, deceptively simple, but haunted by the idea of transience, of lives flickering and vanishing before they can be grasped. It reads almost like an epitaph, a fleeting moment preserved just before it’s lost forever. And Williams—<em>Spring and All</em> is fascinating in how it plays with destruction and rebirth. The prose and verse sections seem to kill and resurrect each other, a cycle that mirrors life and death itself. His treatment of death is so deeply tied to perception, to the way we see and experience the world.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha listened intently, her eyes never once leaving Rio’s face. There was no nodding, no interruptions, just an unwavering gaze that made Rio feel as though every word she spoke was being weighed, measured, tested.</p><p> </p><p>“And what do you think this ‘presence of Death’ ultimately <em>means</em> for these poets?” Agatha asked at last. “Why is it so central to their work? What are they trying to <em>do</em> with it?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated, turning the question over in her mind. <em>This</em> was the heart of her thesis—the part she had been struggling to articulate with absolute clarity. Dr. Harkness was <em>dead on</em>. She swallowed and pushed forward.</p><p> </p><p>“I think it’s tied to their sense of disillusionment,” she said. “These poets were grappling with the aftermath of World War I. Death wasn’t an abstract concept for them—it was real, immediate. It lingered in cities reduced to rubble, in the loss of an entire generation. But it wasn’t just about physical death. It was about the death of ideals, of certainty, of the belief that the world was ordered and meaningful.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio met Agatha’s eyes for a second before refocusing and jumping right back in.</p><p> </p><p>“Modernist poetry reflects that sense of fragmentation—how do you write about a world that no longer makes sense? How do you find meaning in it? Death isn’t just an ending in these poems—it’s a rupture, a loss of coherence. It shapes the way time moves in their work, the way memories surface and dissolve, the way identity itself becomes unstable, becomes noise and then turns into silence. I think,” she added, voice quieter but firm, “this silence is particularly loud.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was silent for a moment, considering. Then, finally, she nodded, her expression still unreadable. “Interesting,” she murmured, tapping her pen against the desk. “You’re framing Death as both a literal and structural force. I think there’s potential in that argument. But what’s your <em>angle</em>, Miss Vidal? What’s your precise argument?”</p><p> </p><p>A flicker of excitement sparked in Rio’s chest at the challenge. She was used to being asked <em>what</em> she thought, but Agatha was pushing her to go deeper. She was asking <em>how</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“I want to argue that Modernist poets use Death not just as a theme, but as a lens through which they examine the breakdown of meaning in the modern world,” Rio said, her words coming faster now. “It’s not just something they write about—it <em>structures</em> their work, like a second writer shaping the text from within. Death dictates the way their poems unfold, the way thoughts fragment, the way time becomes unstable. It’s the underlying force that gives shape to their existential questions, their anxieties about identity, their relationship with memory and loss.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the desk as she absorbed Rio’s words. “You have a solid concept here, Miss Vidal. I’m intrigued by your interpretation of Death as an invisible structural force rather than just a subject.” A brief pause, then—“But I need to see <em>more.</em> More textual analysis. More rigor in your close readings. You can’t just present an idea—you have to <em>prove</em> it. I want to see you push beyond the obvious connections. Consider how Death functions in relation to alienation, to identity, to modernity itself. Don’t settle for a surface reading.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded quickly, already scribbling notes in the margins of her notebook. “Of course. I’ve already started looking at a few passages, but I’ll go deeper—especially in how death interacts with their treatment of time and perception.”</p><p> </p><p>Agtha gave a small, approving nod. “Good. And be prepared to challenge your own readings. I expect rigor in your analysis. I will be watching closely.” She met Rio’s gaze, sharp and steady. “This will not be easy work, Miss Vidal. But if you’re truly committed to it, it will beworth it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed, feeling the weight of Agatha’s expectations settle over her. But strangely, she didn’t feel overwhelmed. If anything, she felt energized. Agatha wasn’t just testing her—she was pushing her toward something greater, something sharper, something <em>real.</em></p><p> </p><p>“I won’t disappoint you, Dr. Harkness,” Rio said, voice steady. “I <em>am</em> committed to this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, then allowed a slow, knowing smile to appear on her lips. It was the kind of smile that carried both approval and a challenge.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll see, Miss Vidal,” she murmured. “We’ll see.”</p><p> </p><p>She tapped a stack of papers on her desk. “I have some notes. Quite a few, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, bracing herself. “I expected as much.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked, as if mildly amused. “Then let’s begin.”</p><p> </p><p>And for the next hour, they did. Agatha was relentless—precise, exacting, cutting through weak arguments with a single question. But she was never means or belittling. She pushed, but she never dismissed. She challenged, but she also listened.</p><p> </p><p>And to Rio’s own surprise and a little to Agatha’s too, Rio <em>kept up. </em></p><p> </p><p>She countered, she adjusted, she thought on her feet. The nerves never fully faded, but something inside her <em>settled.</em></p><p> </p><p>This was going to be hard.</p><p> </p><p>But she had never wanted anything more.</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After the meeting with Dr. Harkness, Rio stepped out of the office feeling like she had just run a marathon. The conversation had been intense, challenging, <em>relentless</em> in a way she hadn’t quite expected, and yet… she had held her own. The weight of Agatha’s expectations pressed against her, lingering like a phantom presence, but so did the fire it had sparked in her. This was it. This was the kind of intellectual rigor she had <em>craved</em>. And now, she had to live up to it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mind was a tangle of thoughts, spinning too fast for her to sit with them. She knew herself well enough to recognize that if she didn’t <em>move</em>, she would spiral—turning every word, every glance, every pause from that meeting over in her mind until she’d picked it apart to nothing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So she headed straight to the dance studio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Ballet had always been her escape. The one place where thinking stopped and instinct took over. It was a different kind of challenge, a different kind of discipline—one that existed outside of words, where her body spoke in ways language never could. Here, there was no thesis to defend, no pages to analyze. Just movement. Just music. Just <em>breath</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The scent of polished wood and faint traces of rosin welcomed her as she stepped inside, the quiet hum of the studio overhead lights lights filling the space. The room was nearly empty at this hour—just her and the floor-to-ceiling mirrors reflecting her own tension back at her. She stood still for a moment, exhaling slowly, letting the silence settle over her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shrugging off her jacket, she peeled away the day’s stress along with it, leaving behind the weight of academia as she stepped toward the barre. She stripped down to just a light sweater draped over her well-loved green leotard—a gift from Lilia when she had first been accepted into the PhD program—and a pair of black shorts. Her hair, still slightly mussed from the day, was quickly twisted into a bun to keep it from falling in front of her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She met her own gaze in the mirror. <em>Steady. Breathe.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Riio sighed, rolling her shoulders back, and moved toward the barre at the far end of the studio. The wood felt cool beneath her fingers as she settled into position, her body instinctively falling into the familiar routine. <em>Plié, tendu, dégagé.</em> Each movement stretched through her muscles, warming them, grounding her. The tightness in her chest didn’t vanish entirely, but with every extension of her leg, with every controlled breath, she could feel the anxiety beginning to loosen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She knew she wouldn’t be able to outrun her thoughts completely—she never did. They always lingered, circling at the edges of her mind, waiting for a quiet moment to creep back in. But dance gave her <em>space</em>. Space to breathe, to focus, to quiet the relentless pressure that had been sitting so heavy on her shoulders. With every pirouette, she let a little more of the uncertainty melt away. With every leap, she reached for something beyond the expectations pressing down on her—beyond the weight of Dr. Harkness’ challenge, beyond the constant push to prove herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a while, she sank down onto the floor, stretching her legs out in front of her. Her fingers worked instinctively as she tightened the ribbons of her pointe shoes, looping them around her ankles with precision. The sound of soft piano music filtered through the studio speakers. She flexed her feet, rolling through her ankles, feeling the familiar resistance of the shoes molding to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then she rose, stepping into the center of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a deep breath, letting everything else fall away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment her foot pressed into the floor for the first movement, the rest of the world disappeared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She let herself sink into the music, her body flowing effortlessly from one motionto the next. Hhe rise and fall of her chest matched the tempo, her limbs carving shapes through the air with a grace that felt instinctive, inevitable. She knew these steps as well as she knew herself. The way her arms extended through a développé, the precise angle of her turnout, the stretch of her body as she pulled into an arabesque—it was all second nature.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, the music swelled, and Rio let go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She moved into a grand jeté, her body soaring through the air, every muscle engaged in the perfect balance of strength and surrender. The rush of momentum filled her veins, lifting her, freeing her. In that single, weightless moment, she was nothing but motion and energy. No thesis deadlines, no imposter syndrome, no lingering gaze of a brilliant, enigmatic professor dissecting her every word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just movement. Just <em>freedom</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She landed with quiet control, her muscles absorbing the impact as she transitioned smoothly into another turn, another leap, another moment of flight. The sweat on her back cooled against her skin, her pulse quick but steady, her breathing deep and even. She pushed herself harder, spinning, extending, losing herself entirely in the dance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time she finally slowed, chest rising and falling with exertion, her thoughts had settled. The pressure of her PhD, the stress of proving herself—it was all still there, waiting for her outside this room. But here, in this moment, she was just Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not a student. Not a musician. Not someone living under the watchful eye of Dr. Harkness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just a dancer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just <em>herself</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The stillness of the studio wrapped around Rio as she stood there, catching her breath. The music had stopped, leaving only the rhythmic pounding of her heartbeat in her ears. Sweat dampened the back of her neck, and she rolled her shoulders, exhaling slowly. The familiar ache in her muscles was a welcome sensation—a reminder that she was <em>here</em>, in her body, present in the moment, instead of spiraling into endless academic anxieties.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned toward the mirror, pressing her hands to her hips as she studied her reflection. Her chest still rising and fell with exertion, her green leotard clinging to her like a second skin. Stray pieces of hair had escaped her loose bun, framing her face in messy wisps. She looked… lighter. Less weighed down than she had felt when she first walked in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But the moment of peace was interrupted by the sharp chirp of her phone vibrating against the bench where she had tossed her things. Rio sighed, crossing the room and picking it up, half-expecting a new flood of emails about her thesis or a reminder from Alice about band rehearsal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead, it was a text from Lilia.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <strong>Lilia : </strong>
  <em>I made too much food again. You coming over?</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small smile tugged at Rio lips. <em>Of course she did.</em> Lilia had a habit of cooking as though she were feeding an entire dinner party rather than just herself. And Rio knew—without having to ask—that this was her way of making sure she ate something other than coffee and stress.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <strong>Rio : </strong>
  <em>Be there in twenty.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio set her phone down and grabbed her sweater, tugging it over her leotard before gathering the rest of her things. The tension in her shoulders hadn’t completely disappeared, but it was more manageable now, no longer clawing at the back of her mind like it had been earlier.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But right now, none of that mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Right now, there was a warm meal waiting for her and the quiet, steady presence of someone who had been there for her through everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And for tonight, that was enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The walk to Lilia’s house was brisk, the evening air cool against Rio's flushed skin as she made her way across campus. She clutched the strap of her dance bag a little tighter, losing herself in the familiar rhythm of her steps.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time she reached Lilia’s house, the scent of something rich and savory drifted from the open window above. Rio inhaled deeply, already feeling a sense of comfort settle over her. She climbed the stairs two at a time, pushing open the door without knocking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia was in the kitchen, standing over the stove, her dark and silver curls pulled into a messy bun, a wooden spoon in her hand as she stirred a pot of something that smelled <em>amazing.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re early,” Lilia said without turning around, her voice warm and knowing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio dropped her bag by the couch and leaned against the counter, peering into the pot. “You’re the one who bribed me with food,” she pointed out, eyeing the bubbling tomato sauce with open appreciation. “What is this?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rigatoni with homemade marinara,” Lilia replied, grabbing a ladle and giving Rio a teasing glance. “And before you ask, yes, I made garlic bread. And no, you can’t steal a piece before we sit down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned dramatically, but her stomach growled in response, betraying just how little she’d eaten all day. She hopped onto the counter, watching as Lilia moved around the kitchen. The warmth of the room, the scent of fresh basil and simmering tomatoes—it was all so familiar, so <em>safe.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, neither of them spoke, the only sounds filling the space were the soft clatter of dishes and the faint sizzle of sauce in the pan. Rio let herself sink into the silence, into the unspoken understanding that always existed between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then Lilia glanced at her, arching a brow. “So,” she said casually, “how was the meeting?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled, running a hand through her damp hair. “Intense.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smirked, plating the pasta. “Of course it was. You’re working with <em>Dr. Harkness.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave her a look. “You say that like she’s some kind of academic boogeyman.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“From what you told me, she kind of <em>is</em>,” Lilia shot back, handing her a plate before grabbing her own. “But I know you. You like a challenge.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio twirled her fork through the pasta, considering that. “Yeah. I do.” She hesitated, then added, “But it’s… different with her. She’s <em>sharp</em>, Lilia. Everything she says has weight to it. And she expects a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia watched her for a moment, then took a sip of her water. “And that scares you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio frowned, pushing the pasta around on her plate before sighing. “No,” she admitted. “Not exactly. It’s more like… I don’t want to <em>fail</em>.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia reached across the table, nudging Rio hand. “You won’t.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked up, meeting her gaze. There was no doubt in Lilia’s expression—just quiet certainty, like the one Rio had leaned on more times than she could count.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a bite of her pasta, chewing thoughtfully before finally saying, “Yeah. I won’t.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And for the first time that evening, she beleived it.`</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dinner, Rio found herself sprawled on Lilia’s couch, her stomach pleasantly full and her limbs heavy with exhaustion. The warmth of the meal lingered, but so did the weight of her thoughts. She picked at the edge of the old throw blanket draped over the armrest, her mind drifting back to the meeting, the way every word the professor had said seemed to embed itself in her brain like a challenge waiting to be unraveled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia plopped down beside her, nudging rio’s foot off the cushion to make space. “You look like you’re thinking too hard,” she observed, tucking one leg under herself. “I thought dancing was supposed to help with that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Riio sighed, tipping her head back againts the couch. “It did. For a while. But my brain doesn’t have an off switch, apparently.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia gave her a knowing look. “No kidding.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a playful glare but didn’t argue. Instead, she exhaled deeply and let her eyes wander around the room. The soft glow of the old floor lamp in the corner, the framed photographs on the bookshelf—snapshots of moments that had shaped their lives. One of Rio and Lilia, taken years ago, laughing at something neither of them could probably remember now. Another of Rio with Alice, drumsticks tucked behind her ear, mid-soundcheck at some tiny venue. They were reminders of who she was outside of academia, outside of the pressure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia followed her gaze and smirked. “You know, you <em>are</em> allowed to think about things other than your thesis.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Am I?” Rio teased, nudging her with her foot. “Because I feel like Dr. Harkness would <em>strongly</em> disagree.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia rolled her eyes. “She can’t own your every waking thought, sweet girl. You’re not <em>just</em> your PhD. You’re the girl who loses her mind over new drumsticks or new pointe shoes. You’re the person who’d rather stay up arguing about whether or not ‘Spring and All’ is a hopeful poem than get a full night’s sleep. You’re the one who learned how to make pancakes at 3 a.m. because you were <em>convinced</em> it was a necessary life skill.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio snorted. “It <em>is</em> a necessary life skill.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia grinned, satisfied. “My point is—you’re <em>more</em> than this one thing, no matter how much your thesis looms over your soul like an academic specter of doom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio huffed a laugh but let the words sink in. It was easy to get caught up in it all, to feel like her entire worth was tied to her research, to meeting expectations. But Lilia was right—she <em>was</em> more than this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a beat, Lilia stood, stretching. “C’mon. Let’s do something that doesn’t involve thinking. <em>Movie night.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned. “If you put on some weird French art film again, I swear—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I make <em>one</em> mistake, and you never let me live it down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Three hours, Lilia. Three. Hours. And nothing <em>happened.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed, already grabbing the remote. “Fine. No weird Eurpean art films. Your pick.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed dramatically but took the remote. Maybe a dumb comedy was exactly what she needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That evening, after a long day of teaching, grading, and meetings, Agatha sat in her study at home, papers scattered across the desk before her, trying to vanquish her own solitude.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She exhaled, rolling the stiffness from her shoulders. It was almost time to pick up Nicky from Wanda’s. Her longtime friend had, as usual, been kind enough to get him from school, letting him play with her twin boys, Tommy and Billly, for a while. Agatha usually welcomed the extra time—it allowed her to get work done, to maintain the structure of her ever-demanding schedule. But tonight, her mind was frustratingly unfocused, her attention slipping through her fingers like fine sand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had essays to grade, research projects to review, and yet she caught herself staring at nothing, her fingers resting lightly on the edge of a manuscript she had barely skimmed. It was as though a thread of thought had unraveled, tugging her in a direction she wasn’t sure she wanted to follow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio Vidal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hadn’t meant to linger on it, but the memory of their meeting resurfaced unbidden, diruupting her usual discipline. There was nothing extraordinary about it on the surface—it had been professional, productive, no different from the dozens of student meetings she held each semester. And yet, something about it unsettled her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had been composed, articulate, sharp. Agata had expected as much. But there was something else—something about the way she spoke with such quiet conviction, the way she leaned into her ideas, not with arrogance but with a steady, deliberate confidence. She had held Agatha’s gaze without hesitation, unafraid to challenge, to push deeper, to <em>think.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t often that a student impressed her so quickly. Agatha wasn’t easily impressed in general. She had built a career on her high standards, on demanding the best from those she taught. But Rio had already begun to carve out a space in Agatha’s mind, lingering there like an unfinished sentence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back in her chair, running a hand through her long chestnut hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Perhaps it was just academic intrigue. It <em>should</em> be just academic intrigue. Rio was intelligent, and intelligence always caught Agatha”s attention. She had seen glimpses of that sharp mind before—like in her seminar a few weeks ago, when Rio had spoken about <em>The Waste Land</em> with a rare depth, her insights precise and thoughtful, her passion evident even in the careful restraint of her voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet… it wasn’t just the intellect that stood out. It was the way Rio carried herself, the contrast of certainty and something else—something quieter, more difficult to name. A guardedness? A weight she wasn’t quite revealing? Agtaha had spent enough years reading between the lines—both in texts and in people—to know when something was being left unsaid.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tapped her pen against the desk, frowning slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe it was that familiarity that unsettled her. The way Rio reminded her, just a little, of a version of herself from years ago. The same hunger to prove something, the same quiet intensity. Agatha had spent much of her own academic journey learning to sharpen herself into something untouchable, refining her intellect into a weapon, her solitude into a shield. She wondered if Rio had begun to do the same.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then there were the overalls.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agtaha exhaled sharply through her nose, a small, almost unwilling smirk ghosting across her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>No. Don’t go there.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sat up, shaking the thought away, reaching for the stack of essays as if sheer force of will could snap her out of it. This was nothing more than professional curiosity. That was all. Rio was bright, promising, worthy of attention—but no more than any other exceptional student Agata had mentored over the years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, as she reached for her pen, her fingers hovered over the page for just a beat too long.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With an irritated sigh, she pushed back from the desk and stood, grabbing her coat. It was time to get Nicky. Maybe some fresh air would clear her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped out into the crisp evening air, locking the door behind her. She welcomed the walk—it wasn’t far to Wanda’s, and she needed the movement, the sharp cold against her skin, something to ground her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mind, however, refused to cooperate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her student’s image curled in the back of her mind, stubbornly refusing to be dismissed. Agatha prided herself on her ability to compartmentalize, to separate the professional from the personal, to keep firm boundaries between what <em>mattered</em> and what was merely passing distraction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned a corner, boots clicking steadily against the pavement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This wasn’t the first time a student had caught her attention—she had mentored plenty of bright minds over the years, watched them flourish, challenged them, shaped them. It was part of the job. But this was different. There was something about rio that tugged at Agatha’s focus in a way she wasn’t entirely comfortable with.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe it <em>was</em> just the familiarity—the echoes of herself in Rio' determination, in the sharp way she spoke about her work, in the way she seemed to hold something back, just beneath the surface. A quiet sort of weight, an edge of vulnerability wrapped in intellect.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha had seen it before, in herself, in others. She had long since learned that curiosity—true curiosity—was dangerous. It made you want to look closer, to unravel, to <em>understand.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And understanding was not always safe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached Wanda’s house and took a steadying breath before knocking on the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A few moments later, it swung open to reveal Wanda, her red hair slightly disheveled, her expression warm but tired. “You’re late,” she teased, leaning against the doorframe. “Deep in thought? Or just buried under papers again?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave her a pointed look. “Both.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Wanda smirked. “Figures. Come in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped inside, immediately met with the distant sound of laughter and the unmistakable chaos of three children playing. Nicky was on the living room floor, utterly enthralled in a game with Billy and Tommy, the three of them surrounded by an assortment of action figures and Legos in a battlefield that only children could understand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her son looked up when he saw her, his bright blue eyes the exact same shade as hers lighting up. “Mama!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The warmth that spread through Agatha’s chest was immediate, dissolving whatever lingering thoughts had followed her here. She crouched slightly as Nicky ran toward her, wrapping his arms around her in a tight hug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Had fun?” she asked, smoothing a hand over his messy curls.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He nodded enthusiastically. “Billy and Tommy and I built a space fortress! And then a giant dragon attacked! But don’t worry, we won.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, glancing at Wanda, who shrugged. “I take no credit for this elaborate storyline.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, then stood, adjusting Nicky’s coat as he slipped into his shoes. “Come on, then. Let’s get home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they stepped back into the night, Nicky slipping his small hand into hers, Agatha felt herself settle. Whatever intrusive thoughts had plagued her earlier could wait.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For now, she had something more important to focuson.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Nicky walked home through the quiet streets, the city humming around them in its usual rhythm. The cold air nipped at their cheeks, but Nicky didn’t seem to mind—he swung their joined hands slightly, his small fingers curled tightly around hers, his energy still buzzing from his playtime with Billly and Tommy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced down at him. “Tired?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shook his head with the determination of a child who would rather collapse mid-step than admit to exhaustion. “Nope.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She smirked. “Liar.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He giggled but didn’t argue.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached their house, Agatha unlocked the door and ushered him inside, the warmth of home wrapping around them instantly. Nicky kicked off his shoes in the haphazard way all six-year-olds did, and Agatha sighed as she bent to line them up properly by the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I <em>will</em> teach you to put them away correctly one day,” she muttered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, you won’t,” Nicky said matter-of-factly, already making a beeline for the couch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed but didn’t press the issue. “Go wash up before bed,” she called after him as he climbed onto the cushions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Five minutes!” he negotiated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Now, Nicky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He groaned dramatically but obeyed, dragging his feet as he trudged toward the bathroom. Agatha used the brief moment of quiet to slip into the kitchen, setting a kettle on the stove. She pulled down a mug, selecting a tea bag from the tin in the cupboard. The simple routine helped clear her mind, offering a small reprieve from the weight of the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the water finally boiled, she poured it over the tea bag and let the steam curl up toward her face, gogging her glasses. A deep breath in, a slow breath out. The quiet was welcome, but it wouldn’t last.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sure enough, a few minutes later, Nicky appeared in the doorway, hands  freshly washed, dressed in his pajamas—an old set with tiny rockets on them, slightly too small but still his favorite. He padded over to the table and plopped down in a chair, swinging his legs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Teeth?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He groaned. “Yes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She gave him a long, scrutinizing look.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“<em>Yes,</em>” he insisted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mm-hmm.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Satisfied for now, she took a sip of her tea, then leaned against the counter, watching as Nicky fiddled with one of the tiny plastic dinosaurs he had smuggled into the kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can I have a story tonight?” he asked, not looking up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, feigning exasperation. “Another one?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” he said, grinning. “A <em>good</em> one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They’re <em>all</em> good.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky considered this. “Some are <em>extra</em> good.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, shaking her head as she set down her tea. “Fine. Go get in bed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He shot up from his chair and ran off toward his room, triumphant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Agatha followed, he was already tucked beneath the blankets, Blue Dragon snug in his arms, waiting expectantly. She sat on the edge of the bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’ll it be tonight?” she asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Something with dragons.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hummed thoughtfully. “Dragons, huh? Well, I <em>might</em> know a tale about a very clever little knight and the dragon that he outwitted…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky gasped, fully invested already. “Tell me!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And so, Agatha began, her voice soft in the dim glow of the bedside lamp. As the words wove their way through the quiet night, Nicky’s eyelids grew heavier, his small body sinking deeper into the blankets. By the time she reached the end of the story, his breathing was slow, even. Asleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled, allowing herself a small moment of peace as she watched him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, carefully, she stood, switched off the lamp, and slipped out of the room, closing the door behind her with a quiet click.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally alone, she returned to the living room, picking up her tea—now lukewarm—and sinking onto the couch. The day had been long. The week ahead would be longer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p align="justify">          (Eliot, “Burnt Norton”, <em>Four Quartets)</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The afternoon had the crisp bite of early autumn, the kind of cool air that made the warmth of a coffee cup feel like a small luxury and the sky was a soft, pale blue, streaked with wisps of clouds. It was the perfect kind of day to tuck into a familiar corner, away from the weight of deadlines and expectations, and that was exactly what Rio, Alice, and Jen had done.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The café, a cozy little spot nestled on the quieter side of campus, was as lively as ever. The scent of espresso and freshly baked pastries curled through the air, mingling with the gentle hum of conversation and the occasional burst of laughter from a nearby table. The three of them had claimed their usual spot by the window, where they could watch the steady stream of students passing by, bundled in scarves and jackets against the cool breeze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen leaned back in her chair, her dark brows arched in amusement, one leg casually draped over the other. “So, just so we’re all clear,” she said, smirking at Alice, “we’re <em>definitely</em> playing at the right venue this time? Because I, for one, would love to avoid another ‘surprise gig’ situation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice groaned dramatically, burying her face in her hands. “I will <em>never</em> live that down, will I?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, stirring a bit of cinnamon into her latte. “Not a chance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen leaned back in her chair, a smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “I’m just saying, Alice, if we <em>do</em> show up to the wrong venue again, at least this time we’ll be prepared for it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice groaned, dramatically dragging her hands down her face. “It was one time! And in my defense, the email was <em>very</em> unclear.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, stirring a bit of cinnamon into her coffee. “I don’t know, Al, I think you just have a talent for chaos.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice shot her a look, but the corners of her mouth twitched upward. “Says the person who nearly missed our last set because she got locked in the green room.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen snorted, nearly spilling her tea. “Oh, that was <em>legendary.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but laughed. “<em>That</em> was not my fault. The door handle <em>literally</em> broke off in my hand. That’s just bad venue maintenance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice pointed her spoon at her. “I still had to stall with an impromptu monologue about the history of punk drumming while you banged on the door like a trapped ghost.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen grinned. “And that monologue, by the way, was entirely unnecessary. We would have survived without it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Excuse me,” Alice said, feigning offense. “The audience was <em>riveted.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The audience was confused,” Rio corrected, taking a sip of her coffee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice huffed. “Details. <em>And your weren’t there</em>.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen shook her head, a laugh slipping past her lips before she sat forward, her expression shifting slightly. “Speaking of upcoming gigs, though—are we ready for Saturday’s set? We’re playing that new song, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tapped her fingers against the side of her cup, thinking. “I think so. We ran it a couple of times last practice, but I wouldn’t mind going over it again. The transition in the bridge still feels a little messy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice nodded. “Yeah, agreed. And I think I need to tweak the harmonies in the chorus. They’re not quite clicking yet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen smirked. “Translation: you need an excuse to belt dramatically in my face until you get it right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice grinned. “That is <em>exactly</em> what I need.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bell above the café door chimed, its familiar jingle lost beneath the steady hum of conversation and the occasional clatter of mugs being set down too hard on wooden tables. Yet, for Rio, the sound may as well have been a thunderclap. Her head snapped toward the entrance, her attention immediately caught by the familiar presence stepping inside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha Harkness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Of course.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She entered with the same composure that Rio had come to associate with her—dressed in sharply tailored black slacks and a dark coat, her movements precise, her posture straight as ever. She moved with quiet authority, her expression unreadable, flanked by two colleagues who seemed to naturally fall into place beside her, as though even they knew to follow her lead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is that Dr. Harkness?” Alice asked, her voice cutting through Rio’s moment of fixation. She had clearly caught the way Rio’s attention had locked onto Agatha the second she walked in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t answer right away. Her gaze followed Agatha as she crossed the café, her coat shifting slightly as she walked, before she took a seat in the corner of the room. It wasn’t a dramatic moment. It wasn’t some cosmic coincidence. Agatha was just here, like any other professor grabbing coffee with colleagues. And yet, Rio felt it—the flutter in her chest, the nervous jolt that made no logical sense.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She forced herself to look away, only to find Jen watching her with a knowing smirk. “You’re staring,” she said, stirring her drink leisurely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, caught off guard. “I’m not staring,” she muttered, but even as the words left her lips, she felt the heat creeping up her neck. “I just… notice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen snorted. “Uh-huh. <em>Noticing</em> just happens to involve intense, laser-focused observation?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes and stood abruptly, grabbing her empty cup. “I’m getting another coffee.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice arched an eyebrow. “Are you? Or are you just getting a better angle?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a glare. “I <em>need</em> more caffeine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen grinned, clearly enjoying every second of this. “Sure, sure. Let’s get another round, then.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They made their way to the counter, but despite her best efforts, Rio’s eyes flickered back toward Agatha’s table. She told herself it was accidental, but the moment her gaze landed on Agatha, she realized her mistake.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Because Agatha was already looking at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their eyes met across the room, a moment of wordless recognition that sent a spark of something—anticipation? Nervous energy? Rio couldn’t tell—straight through her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression didn’t betray anything. There was no obvious amusement, no warmth, no acknowledgment beyond the quiet intensity of her gaze. But something in the way she held Rio’s stare made the air feel heavier, charged with an unspoken understanding. It wasn’t just a casual glance—it was sharp, deliberate, like she was assessing something, searching for something.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught in her throat, her fingers tightening slightly around her empty cup. Then, just as quickly as the moment arrived, she looked away, forcing herself to focus on the counter in front of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“<em>Okay</em>,” Alice whispered beside her, eyes wide with amusement. “Now you’re <em>definitely</em> staring.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled sharply, turning toward her friend with an exasperated look. “For the last time, I’m <em>not</em> staring.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen leaned in, still grinning. “You know she’s not that scary, right? She’s just a professor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio scoffed. “I <em>know</em> that.”</p><p align="justify">  </p><p align="justify">Jen nudged her gently. “It’s just a coffee shop, Rio. No need to act like you’re in some sort of thriller.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio forced a laugh, though the uneasy feeling in her stomach didn’t fade. She took a deep breath, trying to focus on the conversation again, but her mnd kept returning to that brief exchange. What was that look? Was it just her imagination, or was there something more behind Dr Harkness’s eyes?</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio, Alice, and Jen settled back into their small table near the window, Rio pushed the moment with Dr Harkness from her mind, focusing instead on the conversation with her friends.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice was mid-sentence, animatedly talking about the band’s upcoming gig, her hands gesturing as she outlined the setlist she was debating. Jenwas already poking holes in the logistics, while Rio attempted to stay engaged. But despite the comfort of their familiar banter, her thoughts felt scattered, her attention divided by something dessed in purpke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, the door swung open with a sharp jingle, cutting through the café’s warm hum of noise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t mean to look. But something in her tensed, her body reacting before her mind even caught up. Her gaze flicked toward the entrance, drawn by a pull she should have learned to ignore by now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Maya.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her <em>ex</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She walked in like she owned the place. Ugh. Effortlessly put-together, striking in that way that had always made her hard to forget. Dark eyes sharp, a smirk already playing at the corner of her lips, she scanned the café as if she were expecting to find someone she knew. And, of course, she did find someone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s stomach tightened as Maya’s gaze landed on her almost immediately, recognition flashing in her expression before shifting into something more playful. And then, that grin—wide, teasing, knowing. Rio barely had a second to process it before Maya was making a beeline for their table, moving with the kind of confidence that had once been intoxicating, and now just felt like a storm rolling in before Rio had a chance to brace herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, well, well.” Maya’s voice was warm, familiar, laced with that casual amusement that always made it sound like she was in on some inside joke. “If it isn’t Rio and her intellectual squad.” She waved at Alice and Jen with exaggerated enthusiasm before tilting her head. “This seat taken?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen exchanged glances—equal parts unimpressed and unsurprised. Jen arched an eyebrow but said nothing, while Alice took a slow, deliberate sip of her coffee, making it abundantly clear she had no intention of making Maya feel particularly welcome.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, on the other hand, felt the tension coil in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya had always been like this. Bold. Intrusive. Inescapable. She had a way of inserting herself into spaces without hesitation, like she belonged there, like no one would dare tell her otherwise. And Rio, despite everything, despite how things had ended, found herself defaulting to old instincts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She forced a smile, nodding stiffly. “Sure. Sit down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya casually plopped herself down beside Rio, taking no issue with the awkwardness of the situation. Rio could feel the proximity of her ex, the familiar scent of Maya’s perfume, the warmth of her body too close for comfort. Maya’s fingers brushed against Rio’s arm as she adjusted in her seat, and it made Rio’s pulse quicken, both with uneasiness and the uncomfortable weight of history.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya smirked, clearly catching the way Rio’s shoulders tensed. “Relax, Ree,” she murmured, voice just low enogh that only Rio could hear. “I’m not here to cause trouble.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled slowly, staring down at the swirl of foam in her coffee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Somehow, she didn’t quite believe her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat at her table, her colleagues’ conversation only halfly-heard. Discussions of departmental politics, upcoming conferences, and research grants should have occupied her mind, but instead, her gaze kept flickering—against her better judgment—toward the table near the window.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha wasn’t actively listening, not really, until she saw the moment unfold.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A woman had joined Rio and her friends. Blond hair, sharp features, a casual confidence that made her presence impossible to ignore. Agatha’s eyes took in the way Rio stiffened, just slightly, at the woman’s arrival, the way her smile tightened before relaxing into something guarded.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They knew each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Intimately.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was an ease between them that was both startling and… unsettling. They leaned in close, stiffly laughing at something Rio’s friend had said, the connection between them palpable even from across the room. The way Maya casually touched Rio’s arm, how Rio flinched slightly away, the way their conversation flowed, as though they shared some past unspoken bond—it stirred something in Agatha’s chest. Something she couldn’t quite place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers tightened around the edge of her coffee cup as she watched.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A sharp, unfamiliar pang of discomfort shot through Agatha. She didn’t like it. She didn’t like the way Rio’s eyes closed in on the girl when she spoke, the way her lips curled into that faint, uncomfortable scowl. It was a look Agatha hadn’t seen from Rio before, not in their meetings or seminars. <em>What was that?</em></p><p align="justify">  </p><p align="justify">Agatha forced herself to look back at her colleagues, to pretend to care about the discussion on faculty research proposals, but her mind kept drifting, bits of irritation prickling in her thoughts. The woman’s presence, the way she seemed to naturally fill the space between them, the way she belonged so effortlessly in Rio’s world—it made Agatha’s own thoughts feel jagged, fragmented.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hated the feeling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s grip on her coffee cup tightened, and she felt a rush of frustration at herself for even caring about something so trivial. Rio was a student, nothing more. And the woman was part of her circle—whatever that meant for Rio, it was a chapter she didn't need to read.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But still, a quiet voice in the back of her mind insisted that she didn’t like seeing Rio so… <em>close</em> with someone else. Agatha couldn’t help it. She couldn’t stop herself from looking at them again, her gaze lingering just a moment too long before she forced her eyes away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Focus,</em> she told herself. <em>Focus on your colleagues.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But it was hard, very hard, not to be distracted by the subtle tension hanging in the air, the way Rio seemed to withdraw just slightly whenever that woman leaned in too close, yet always allowing it. As if there was a pull there, something Agatha didn’t fully understand but felt intensely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t her place to feel this way. Agatha had already established that in her mind, yet the thought remained.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Focus,</em> she reminded herself again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Agatha knew that something had shifted in her, and it wasn’t just her curiosity about Rio’s intellectual prowess. Something deeper had stirred, something she wasn’t ready to confront.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya didn’t linger long. Just long enough to disrupt the air, to remind Rio of her presence, to stir something unresolved before slipping away as effortlessly as she had arrived. With a final teasing remark and a grin that felt just a little too knowing, she turned and strolled out of the café, leaving behind the faintest trace of perfume and the unmistakable weight of tension.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door swung shut behind her, the bell’s chime fading into the low hum of conversation around them, but Rio still felt like she was holding her breath. When she finally let it out, it was slow, measured, as if releasing too much air at once might make everything unravel. Her fingers tightened around her coffee cup, seeking some kind of grounding, something solid amid the sudden unease coiling in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice was the first to break the silence. “You okay?” Her usual teasing tone was gone, replaced by something softer, more careful. She had seen it—the way Rio’s entire posture had shifted the second Maya walked in, the way her eyes had darkened with something too tangled to name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, her sharp eyes flicking toward the door as if Maya might come waltzing back in just to cause more chaos. “That was… a lot,” she said bluntly. “She still has that whole ‘look at me, I own the world’ thing going on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a dry laugh, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Yeah. She always did.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her voice was quieter than she intended, lost somewhere between exhaustion and frustration. It wasn’t just Maya’s confidence, or the way she always managed to draw her attention without even trying—it was the <em>history.</em> The long, complicated, messy history that Rio had spent so much time trying to leave behind. But history didn’t just disappear, did it? It lingered. It resurfaced when you least expected it, when you <em>wanted</em> it least.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wish I didn’t have to see her again,” Rio muttered after a moment, her voice low. “After everything… I thought it was over. I thought I could move on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice reached across the table and squeezed Rio’s hand. “You <em>have</em> moved on. She just likes to pretend you haven’t. That’s her problem, not yours.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen nodded in agreement. “Yeah, and you don’t have to let her get under your skin. She <em>wants</em> that. She <em>thrives</em> on that.” She leaned forward, her voice firm but not unkind. “You don’t owe her your time, your energy, or even a second thought. She’s not your problem anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, though the knot in her chest didn’t loosen. It wasn’t just Maya’s presence that unsettled her—it was the flood of memories that came with it. The late nights filled with passionate arguments that always ended with either fiery reconciliations or icy silence, always teetering between love and destruction. The way Maya could make Rio feel <em>alive</em> one second and <em>trapped</em> the next, like she was always walking a tightrope between exhilaration and exhaustion. And worst of all—the way it had <em>ended.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s unforgivable betrayal. The cold, finality of her walking away without hesitation, without so much as a second glance. Leaving Rio to pick up the pieces alone, to sit with the wreckage of something that had once felt too big, too intense to ever collapse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She swallowed hard and took a deep breath, pushing the memories back down where they belonged. “I’ll be fine,” she murmured, though the words rang hollow in her own ears. “It just… caught me off guard.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen exchanged a glance—quick, unreadable, but Rio caught it anyway. They wouldn’t push, not now. They knew her well enough to recognize when to let things lie.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead, Alice gave her a small, reassuring smile and changed the subject, steering the conversation toward something lighter. Something that didn’t feel like it carried the weight of a past Rio wasn’t ready to unpack.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Across the café, Agtaha watched the scene unfold from her corner, her colleagues chatting away about the upcoming department review. Her sharp eyes took in the tension in Rio’s posture, the slight slump of her shoulders as she stared at her coffee cup, her friends offering quiet comfort.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t Agatha’s place to wonder what had unsettled her so. It certainly wasn’t her place to feel this quiet, inexplicable pull of concern. And yet, she did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a practiced air of indifference, Agatha tore her gaze away, focusing instead on the discussion at her own table. She forced herself to engage, offering a well-placed remark here and there. But her thoughts kept circling back, wondering what had caused the crack in Rio’s usually composed exterior.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>This is none of your concern,</em> she reminded herself firmly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her attention back to her colleagues, forcing herself to engage with the conversation, but the image of Rio’s troubled expression lingered in her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, meanwhile, forced herself to take another sip of coffee, trying to steady the tremor in her hands. Maya might have left, but the echoes of her presence lingered, and Rio hated how easily she could still get under her skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s talk about something else,” she said finally, her voice firmer. “Anything else.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice nodded quickly, launching into a story about one of their band rehearsals gone hilariously wrong, and Jen chimed in with a quip about their setlist for the gig. Rio appreciated their efforts, even if the tension in her chest didn’t fully ease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced out the window, watching as the sun dipped lower in the sky. Maya was gone now, but the storm she’d stirred in Rio’s mind would take longer to settle. She lifted her coffee cup to her lips, her hands steady despite the storm inside her, and silently vowed to herself that she wouldn’t let Maya undo all the progress she’d made.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, Rio sat curled up on the couch in Lilia’s house, a mug of chamomile tea cradled in her hands as she recounted the events of the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Across from her, Lilia sat in her well-worn armchair, the same one she had always favored—the one Rio had found comfort in since she was a teenager, seeking refuge in Lilia’s home. Lilia listened intently, her expression darkening with every detail Rio recounted. When Rio finally mentioned Maya’s sudden, uninvited appearance at the café, Lilia’s jaw tightened, her brows knitting together in unmistakable displeasure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She walked right up to your table, uninvited?” Lilia asked sharply, her voice carrying that protective edge Rio had grown to expect whenever Maya’s name came up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her fingers tightening around the mug. “Yeah, like she belonged there. Same old Maya, I guess.” She forced a half-hearted shrug, but the tension in her posture made it clear it wasn’t as simple as she wanted it to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia exhaled sharply, shaking her head. “That girl has some nerve. After what she put you through, she has no business showing her face around you. None.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a small shrug, though the tension in her shoulders betrayed her attempt to downplay it. “It’s fine, Lilia. She didn’t stay long, and I’m not letting it get to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia gave her a long, measured look, unconvinced. “Rio, sweet girl,” she said, her voice quieter but no less firm. “It’s <em>not</em> fine. You’ve worked too hard to move on just for her to waltz back in and shake you up like this. She doesn’t deserve a second of your energy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, her fingers tracing the rim of her mug. “I know,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “Alice and Jen said the same thing. And they’re right. <em>You’re</em> right. But…” She hesitated, inhaling deeply before continuing. “Seeing her again—it just brought everything back. The mess, the hurt. I hate that she still has that effect on me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Lilia said nothing. Then, with the same quiet, steady care she had always shown Rio, she stood from her chair and moved to the couch, sitting beside her. Without hesitation, she wrapped an arm around Rio’s shoulders and pulled her close, like she had done countless times before—when Rio was younger, when the world felt too heavy, when she just needed to be held.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s okay to feel like that,” Lilia murmured, her voice gentle but certain. “But don’t forget how far you’ve come. You’re not the girl she hurt anymore, Rio. You’ve built a life without her, a life she has no claim to. <em>You</em> decide who gets a place in it. And Maya? She doesn’t get to take up space in your head or your heart—not anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled slowly, leaning into the embrace, letting Lilia’s words settle the ache in her chest. She wasn’t sure if she fully believed them yet, but she wanted to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” she whispered, her voice small but steady. “I needed that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia tightened her hold on Rio for a brief moment before pulling back just enough to meet her eyes, her gaze steady and unwavering. “You don’t ever have to face her alone, you hear me?” she said, voice firm with quiet conviction. “If she ever shows up again, you tell her exactly where she can go. And if you can’t, you call me, and I’ll do it for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help the small, tired smile that tugged at her lips. “I think that might scare her off for good.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good.” Lilia huffed, crossing her arms as if daring fate to test her. “She deserves worse after the way she treated you. You’re worth more than she could ever give you, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words landed deep, settling into places Maya had left fractured. Lilia had always been that steady force, the reminder of love that didn’t take more than it gave, of stability that didn’t come with conditions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled, slow and measured, letting the weight of the day roll off her shoulders. “I know,” she said, and this time, she meant it. Her voice was stronger, steadier. “You’re right. I’ve moved on, and she doesn’t get to change that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia gave her knee a firm, reassuring pat. “That’s my girl.” Then, as if sensing the moment had gotten just a little too heavy, she leaned back against the couch with a dramatic sigh. “Now, finish your tea, and let’s find something ridiculous to watch on TV. Something with bad acting, worse dialogue, and at least one explosion that makes no sense.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, the tension in her chest finally starting to ease. “You have very specific criteria for terrible movies.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve had years to perfect my taste,” Lilia quipped, reaching for the remote. “What time’s your class tomorrow?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Eleven.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good. Because you’re spending the night here,” Lilia said matter-of-factly. “Your room’s ready—I changed the sheets yesterday.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, smiling at the sheer determination in the older lady’s voice. No room for debate, no need for argument.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, ma’am,” she said with mock solemnity, and Lilia huffed, satisfied.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*<br /><br /></p>

  <em>As, in a theatre,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness.</em>
</p><p>         </p><p>          (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker”. <em>Four Quartets.) </em></p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, Rio walked into the lecture hall, her satchel slung over one shoulder and a takeaway coffee in her hand, her bag heavy with the tin box of cookies Lilia had made for her. The chatter of students filled the room, a mix of early-morning grogginess and last-minute cramming. She slid into her usual seat near the window, pulling out her notebook and pen as she sipped her coffee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Today was a new day, and Rio was determined to focus on what mattered—her work, her goals, and, for the next hour, Dr. Harkness’s seminar.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha entered the room a few minutes later, her presence as captivating as ever. She wore a tailored navy blazer over a sleek white shirt and wide deep purple pants, her hair swept back neatly. Her sharp blue eyes scanned the room briefly before she set her papers down at the podium. The room quieted almost instantly as the students turned their attention to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning,” Agatha began, her voice clear and measured. “Today, we’ll be continuing our discussion of the tension between life and finality in Modernist poetry. Specifically, we’ll examine how certain poets use Death as a metaphorical lens to explore identity and time. I know this subject is particularly interesting for some of you, so I figured sharing out insights might help everyone.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat up straighter, her pen poised over her notebook. This was her territory—the themes that had captivated her for years and the focus of her thesis. As Agatha began quoting lines from T.S. Eliot and W.B. Yeats, Rio couldn’t help but feel a spark of excitement. Agatha’s insight into the material was as sharp as ever, and Rio found herself completely engrossed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At one point, Agatha’s gaze flicked toward Rio as she posed a question to the class: “How does Yeats’s use of the mythological figure of Leda frame his understanding of mortality as intertwined with transformation?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment before raising her hand. Agatha acknowledged her with a small nod, her expression unreadable but attentive.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Rio began, her voice steady despite the subtle flutter of nerves, “Yeats uses Leda as a representation of forced transformation—an unavoidable encounter with something that fundamentally changes her. It mirrors how mortality forces us to confront the limits of our existence while also propelling us toward growth, even if it’s painful.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head slightly, her lips curving into a faint smile. “An astute observation, Miss Vidal. Yeats does, indeed, frame Leda’s experience as both an ending and a beginning—a violent upheaval that reshapes the world as much as the self.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a small flicker of pride at the compliment, though she quickly focused back on her notes, avoiding the curious glances of her classmates.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of the seminar passed in a blur of analysis and discussion, and by the end of it, Rio’s notebook was filled with scribbles of ideas and connections she wanted to explore further. As the students began packing up, Agatha lingered at the front of the room, organizing her papers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the lecture hall emptied, Rio lingered at her seat, pretending to organize her notes as she watched the other students shuffle out. Agatha remained at the front of the room, meticulously arranging her papers and sliding them into a sleek leather folder. Rio’s heart thudded in her chest, but she told herself it was just a friendly, responsible gesture. It wasn’t about finding an excuse to talk to Dr. Harkness. Definitely not.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Taking a deep breath, she walked down the aisle, her steps echoing in the now-quiet room. Agatha looked up as Rio approached, her sharp eyes softening slightly in recognition.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” she said, her tone neutral but not unkind. “Is there something you need?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, hoping she looked more casual than she felt. “Yes, uh, sort of. I sent you an email earlier this week, but I just wanted to remind you in person—Nicky’s ballet recital is on Saturday. He’s been really excited about it, and I figured it might be helpful to have a heads-up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression shifted, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips. “Ah, yes. The recital. Thank you for reminding me—I did see the email, but it’s been a busy week. I appreciate the follow-up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her fingers fidgeting with the strap of her satchel. “Of course. It’s no problem. He’s been practicing so hard; I’m sure he’ll do great. The kids are always adorable during these recitals.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, a sound Rio realized she didn’t hear often. “Adorable and, at times, unpredictable. I’ve attended enough of these to know that much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, relaxing slightly. “True. Last year, one of the kids got stage fright and ended up holding hands with their teacher for the whole performance. It was honestly kind of sweet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, her gaze briefly flicking to Rio with a glint of curiosity. “And let me guess, you were the supportive teacher, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, a hint of sheepishness in her expression. “Guilty as charged. The little lady just needed a bit of reassurance. It’s hard being six and performing in front of a crowd.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile lingered, and for a moment, the formal distance between professor and student seemed to blur. “It sounds like you’re very good with the children,” she said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I try,” Rio replied, feeling a warmth spread through her chest at the subtle compliment. “They make it easy. Nicky especially—he’s such a sweet kid.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened further, a flicker of pride crossing her face. “He is. Though he’s not always so sweet at home, I assure you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed at that, though she couldn’t quite shake the awareness of how close they were standing now, the air between them charged with something she couldn’t quite name. She felt the urge to say more, to keep the conversation going, but she also didn’t want to overstep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” she said finally, stepping back slightly, “I just wanted to make sure you knew about the recital. The kids are looking forward to seeing their families there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be there,” Agatha said, her tone firm but warm. “Thank you for reminding me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her cheeks feeling warm. “Great. I’ll see you Saturday, then.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a small nod of acknowledgment, and Rio turned to leave, her heart fluttering in a way that was entirely unprofessional but impossible to ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she stepped out into the hallway, she couldn’t help but smile to herself. It was just a small moment, a brief exchange—but it had been enough to brighten her day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning sun filtered through the curtains of Agatha’s home, casting a warm glow across the living room. Nicky sat on the edge of the couch, his tiny feet swinging nervously, the elastic straps of his ballet shoes snug against his ankles. His recital outfit—a crisp white shirt and black pants—was neatly pressed, but he kept fiddling with the hem of his shirt, his brow furrowed in worry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t think I can do it, Mama,” he said, his voice small. “What if I mess up? Everyone will be watching.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha knelt down in front of him, resting her hands gently on his knees. Her gaze softened as she took in the sight of her son, so tiny yet burdened with such big feelings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nicholas,” she said, her voice calm and steady, “it’s completely normal to feel nervous. It means you care about what you’re doing, and that’s a good thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked up at her, his wide eyes brimming with uncertainty. “But what if I forget the moves?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, brushing a stray curl from his forehead. “You’ve been practicing so hard, sweetheart. You know the routine. And even if you make a mistake, it’s not the end of the world. What matters is that you go out there and try your best.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He bit his lip, his feet still swinging. “But what if they laugh at me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression grew serious, her hands giving his knees a reassuring squeeze. “No one will laugh at you, Nicky. Everyone there is rooting for you. And do you know why?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He shook his head slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Because they love watching you shine,” she said. “You’re brave, you’re talented, and you’ve worked so hard for this. Everyone in that audience, including me, is there to support you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s lips twitched into a small smile. “Even you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Especially me,” Agatha said, her smile widening. “I’m your biggest fan, after all. And if you get nervous, just look for me in the crowd. I’ll be right there, cheering you on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her words seemed to steady him, and he nodded slowly. “Okay,” he said, his voice a little stronger.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood and held out her hand. “Come on, then. Let’s go show everyone how amazing you are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky slid off the couch, slipping his hand into hers. As they walked toward the door, he glanced up at her, his nerves still there but now accompanied by a spark of determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Mama,” he said softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha squeezed his hand, her heart swelling with pride and love. “Always, sweetheart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they stepped outside into the crisp autumn air, Nicky’s steps grew steadier, his head held a little higher. Agatha couldn’t help but smile as she watched him—her son, her brave little dancer—ready to take on the world, one jump at a time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The parking lot of the dance center buzzed with excitement, filled with the chatter of parents and the squeals of children dressed in recital attire. Agatha guided Nicky through the crowd, her hand resting lightly on his shoulder. Despite his earlier nerves, he seemed to be holding himself together, his small face a mixture of concentration and anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they approached the entrance, the familiar figure of Rio Vidal came into view. She stood near the door, clipboard in hand, her long dark hair pulled back into a sleek ponytail. She wore a fitted black ensemble—a soft cardigan over her usual dance leggings and light pink ballet flats—that marked her as both professional and approachable. Her smile was warm as she greeted each child by name, offering quick words of encouragement and calm reassurances to the parents.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When her eyes landed on Nicky and Agatha, her smile widened, and she crouched slightly to meet Nicky’s gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey there, superstar!” Rio said brightly, her voice filled with genuine warmth. “Ready for the big day?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hesitated for a moment before nodding shyly, his fingers gripping the edge of his shirt. “I think so,” he murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly and leaned in just a bit. “You’re going to do amazing, Nicky. Remember, we’ve practiced this a hundred times. You’ve got it in the bag.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched the exchange, a small smile tugging at her lips. There was an ease to Rio’s presence, a way she seemed to instinctively know how to put the children—and their parents—at ease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Miss Vidal,” Agatha said, her tone more formal than she intended. “He’s been looking forward to this for weeks.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s my pleasure,” Rio replied, straightening and glancing briefly at Agatha. There was a flicker of something in her expression—respect, curiosity—but she quickly turned her attention back to Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, champ,” Rio said, offering Nicky a high-five. “Go join your friends in the green room. We’ll be starting soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky returned the high-five with a small grin before scampering off, his earlier hesitation momentarily forgotten.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze lingered on her son for a moment before shifting back to Rio. “You have a way with them,” she remarked, her tone softer now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged lightly, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. “They make it easy. Plus, it’s hard not to root for them when they’re this dedicated. Nicky’s been a joy to teach.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her lips curving into a faint smile. “He’s very fond of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s blush deepened, but she returned the smile. “He’s a great kid. You’ve done a wonderful job with him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a moment of quiet between them, the bustling noise of the other parents and children fading into the background. Agatha felt the pull of Rio’s steady gaze, and for a fleeting second, the boundary between professor and student blurred once more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Rio said, breaking the silence with a lighthearted tone, “I should go make sure the kids are ready. We wouldn’t want any wardrobe malfunctions or missing ballet shoes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, nodding. “Of course. Thank you, Miss Vidal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a small, respectful nod before disappearing into the crowd, clipboard in hand. Agatha watched her go, an odd mix of admiration and curiosity stirring within her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shaking the thought from her mind, she turned her attention back to the recital hall, ready to take her seat and cheer on her son.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The lights dimmed in the recital hall, and a soft wave of hushed murmurs rippled through the audience. Agatha settled into her seat, her hands clasped in her lap as she waited for the performance to begin. Around her, parents leaned forward with cameras at the ready, their faces a mix of anticipation and pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The curtain rose slowly, revealing a row of tiny dancers standing in perfect formation. Nicky was front and center, his small figure practically glowing under the stage lights. Agatha couldn’t help but smile as she spotted him, his face a careful mask of focus and determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The piano music began, and the children moved into their first position, their tiny arms and legs mirroring the basic steps they’d practiced countless times. Agatha’s heart swelled as she watched Nicky concentrate, his little brow furrowing with effort. He was so earnest, so utterly himself, that it brought a lump to her throat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the performance continued, Agatha’s gaze drifted toward the wings. There, just out of sight of the audience, was Rio. She stood at the edge of the stage, her body angled slightly toward the dancers, her attention wholly on them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha observed as Rio moved in perfect synchrony with the children, her hands lifting gracefully, her feet subtly marking the rhythm. She wasn’t performing for the audience but for the kids, providing them with a quiet anchor. Her face was alight with encouragement, and every now and then, she mouthed a gentle “You’ve got this” or “Keep going.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When one of the little dancers hesitated, looking momentarily lost, Rio stepped slightly forward, her movements exaggerated just enough to guide the child back on track. The little one’s face lit up with recognition, and they quickly rejoined the routine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha found herself mesmerized—her attention split between her son and Rio’s unwavering focus and care. It wasn’t just her technical skill or her graceful movements; it was the quiet dedication she showed to the children. The way she gave all of herself to ensure their success.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small, unexpected warmth bloomed in Agatha’s chest. There was something profoundly endearing about the way Rio carried herself—so poised, so quietly assertive, yet so tender in her interactions with the kids.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky executed his final move—a slightly wobbly pirouette—and Agatha’s attention snapped back to the stage. The audience erupted in applause as the children beamed and took their bows, their pride radiating from their tiny forms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha clapped along with the crowd, her heart swelling as Nicky waved shyly in her direction. But as the curtain fell and the applause began to fade, her gaze instinctively returned to the wings, where Rio stood with a proud, almost maternal smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but think that Rio was more than just a regular student. She was a force—graceful and grounded, with a heart so big it seemed to encompass everyone around her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And for the first time in a long while, Agatha allowed herself the smallest indulgence of curiosity, wondering what it was about Rio Vidal that made her feel so… drawn.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The other age groups had their turns, some were clearly more experienced than others and Agatha slowly lost focus on what was happening on stage, as her son was no longer the star of the show, and that there was no one to watch in the wings anymore, not that Agatha would ever admit that to anyone, not even herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the show ended, the head of the dance school, a cheerful woman with a stern but warm presence, strode out onto the stage as the children took their final bows and scurried off to the wings. The audience, still buzzing with applause and chatter, quieted as she raised a hand for attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ladies and gentlemen,” she began, her voice warm and bright, “before we conclude this wonderful recital, we have one more surprise for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha noticed a ripple of curiosity sweep through the audience. She leaned slightly forward, intrigued.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Our amazing dance teachers, who have worked tirelessly to prepare your children, have put together a little something special to end the day on a high note,” the headmistress continued. “Please join me in giving them a warm round of applause!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The crowd erupted into cheers as the curtains parted once more. Agatha’s eyes immediately searched the line of teachers stepping onto the stage. And there she was—Rio Vidal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dressed in a sleek black leotard and flowing dance pants, like all the other teachers, Rio looked completely at ease under the bright lights. Her posture was straight and confident, her expression calm yet focused. She took her place among the other teachers, her movements fluid and practiced as they arranged themselves in formation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The music began—a vibrant, rhythmic piece with a contemporary flair. The teachers launched into their routine, a seamless blend of modern and classical styles that showcased their individual talents while weaving them together into a cohesive, breathtaking performance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes, however, were fixed solely on Rio. Her movements were a revelation—graceful yet powerful, every step deliberate and filled with energy. Her expressions were subtle but captivating, a quiet joy radiating from her as she moved. Rio was in her element, a stark contrast to the poised but reserved demeanor Agatha had come to know in the classroom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the routine progressed, Rio executed a series of intricate turns and leaps, her body seemingly weightless as she commanded the stage. The audience reacted with gasps and applause, clearly as entranced as Agatha. But what struck Agatha most wasn’t just Rio’s technical brilliance; it was the sheer passion she exuded.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Here was someone utterly alive, completely immersed in the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the performance reached its climax—a synchronized sequence that ended with the teachers forming a tableau—the audience was on its feet, cheering and applauding wildly. Agatha found herself clapping along, her usually reserved demeanor swept away by the infectious energy of the performance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the teachers bowed and the curtains began to close, Agatha couldn’t stop herself from lingering on Rio’s face. She looked radiant, her smile wide and genuine as she exchanged laughs and high-fives with her fellow teachers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Agatha wondered if she’d ever seen anyone so captivating. Then, catching herself, she forced her thoughts back into the appropriate box.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio Vidal was her student, of course she cared. Like any other student.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But as the applause continued to echo around her, Agatha couldn’t ignore the small voice in her mind whispering that perhaps Rio Vidal was something more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the applause thundered through the recital hall, Agatha’s gaze swept across the audience. Amidst the standing ovation, her eyes caught sight of an older woman standing near the back of the room, clapping enthusiastically and cheering loud enough to stand out even in the boisterous crowd.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The woman was striking, with an air of warmth and pride that radiated from her, her curly grey hair bunched on her head in a messy silver bun and exuding comfort with her patterned shawl. She had a confident stance, her hands moving energetically as she applauded, her expression beaming. Agatha noted the way her gaze was fixed on Rio, unmistakably directed at her and filled with unmistakable affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From the stage, Rio glanced toward the woman and smiled—a bright, genuine smile that softened her usually composed features. Then she waved, small but unmistakably directed at the woman.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The exchange was quick, but it left Agatha with a curious twinge she couldn’t quite place. She turned her attention back to the woman, wondering who she was. A relative, perhaps? A friend? She didn’t look like Rio at all, so maybe not her mom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The thought lingered as the teachers exited the stage and the headmistress returned to thank everyone for attending. Agatha clapped politely, her mind still half-focused on the brief interaction between Rio and the woman in the audience.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As people began gathering their belongings and moving toward the exits, Agatha stayed seated for a moment longer, her thoughts swirling. She wasn’t sure why it mattered—Rio’s personal connections were none of her business. But something about the pride and affection in that woman’s gaze stirred a quiet curiosity in her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eventually, Agatha rose, shaking off the thought. She had Nicky to fetch, a recital to celebrate, and little time to dwell on questions that didn’t concern her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, as she wove her way through the departing crowd, the image of Rio’s body moving on stage lingered in her mind, accompanied by the faintest sense of intrigue.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <em>Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing</em>

</p><p>
  <em>At the still point of the turning world.</em>
</p><p>       </p><p>       (Eliot, “Burnt Norton”, <em>Four Quartets)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">After the recital ended and the families began to filter out of the dance center, Rio stayed behind to help the other teachers tidy up the studio and ensure all the kids left with their belongings. She exchanged warm goodbyes with a few lingering parents, offering final words of congratulations to the excited children still buzzing from their performances.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the last of the families departed, Rio grabbed her bag from the back office and made her way outside, where she spotted Lilia waiting near the entrance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, sweet girl,” Lilia greeted with a wide smile, pulling Rio into a quick hug. “You were amazing up there. I swear, every time I see you dance, it’s like watching magic.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. “Thanks, Lilia. And thanks for coming. You didn’t have to, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course I did,” Lilia replied, mock-offended. “You think I’m going to miss a chance to cheer for you, even if you’re not a little kid anymore? Not a chance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, the warmth of Lilia’s unwavering support easing some of the fatigue from the day. “Well, I appreciate it. Want to grab a drink to celebrate?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smile widened. “Thought you’d never ask. Let’s go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The two of them strolled to a cozy bar a few blocks away, the kind of place with dim lighting, mismatched furniture, and a quiet hum of conversation. They found a small table near the back, settling in with a sense of ease born from years of familiarity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“To a successful recital,” Lilia said, raising her glass of wine as Rio lifted her own, a cider sparkling in the dim light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“To the best cheerleader I could ever ask for,” Rio replied, clinking her glass against Lilia’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they sipped their drinks, the conversation turned to the recital. Lilia couldn’t stop gushing about how adorable the kids were, particularly Nicky, whom she remembered Rio mentioning fondly in their chats.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That little boy in the middle—Nicky, right?” Lilia asked. “He was so focused. It was the cutest thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, her expression softening. “Yeah, he’s a sweetheart. Works really hard, too. His mom is really involved. She’s one of those parents who’s so on top of things, but not in a pushy way. He’s lucky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia leaned forward, smirking. “And what about his mom? Is she lucky to have you as his teacher?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t hide the faint smile tugging at her lips. “She’s my professor, Lilia. Let’s not start that conversation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, I’m not starting anything,” Lilia teased, leaning back in her chair with a knowing look. “Just making an observation. But seriously, you were incredible tonight. You should be proud of yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Rio said, her voice quieter now, touched by the sincerity in Lilia’s tone. “I am. And it means a lot to have you here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed at the bar for a while longer, reminiscing about old times and catching up on the little details of their lives. For Rio, the evening was a reminder of how lucky she was to have someone like Lilia in her corner—someone who had always believed in her, even when she struggled to believe in herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio sipped her cider, Lilia’s voice drifted in and out of focus. She nodded and smiled at the right moments, but her mind kept circling back to a moment earlier that evening—when she had caught sight of Professor Harkness in the audience.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha had been sitting near the middle, her dark hair neatly swept back, her posture as composed as ever. But there had been something different about her tonight. Gone was the cool, imposing air of the seminar room. Instead, she had looked softer, warmer, her sharp gaze replaced by something gentler as she watched her son on stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then there was Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had seen the little boy’s nerves as he arrived that evening, clinging to his mother’s hand like it was a lifeline. She’d heard Agatha’s soothing words, quiet but firm, coaxing Nicky into a smile. The memory made Rio smile now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was so unlike the Agatha she saw in class—the one who wielded words like weapons and demanded excellence from her students with a single arched brow. This Agatha was tender, patient, and undeniably loving. Watching her interact with her son had stirred something in Rio, though she couldn’t quite put her finger on it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She really is something, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, startled to find Lilia watching her with a raised eyebrow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What?” Rio asked, flustered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Whoever you’re thinking about,” Lilia said, her smirk widening. “You’ve got that look on your face. The dreamy one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t have a look,” Rio protested, though her cheeks burned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure you don’t,” Lilia teased, taking another sip of her wine. “So, who is it? Someone at the recital?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass. “It’s not like that. I was just… thinking about Professor Harkness.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh, really? And what about the good doctor has you so distracted tonight?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s nothing,” Rio said quickly, though the words felt hollow even to her. “I just—she was there for Nicky, her son. The one we just talked about. And she was just… different than I expected.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Different how?” Lilia pressed, leaning forward.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, searching for the right words. “In class, she’s so… precise. Intimidating, even. But tonight, she was softer. You could see how much she cares about him. The way she talks to him, the way she looks at him—it’s like the rest of the world disappears.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia tilted her head, her expression softening. “Sounds like she made an impression. Be careful though. Some lines shouldn’t be blurred you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged, trying to downplay the flutter of emotions rising in her chest. “I know, I know. I guess it’s just surprising. Seeing someone like her—someone who always seems so in control—be so human.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smirk returned, though it was gentler this time. “Well, maybe you’re starting to see her for who she really is, not just who she is in the classroom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t respond, her thoughts too tangled to untangle. All she knew was that the image of Agatha Harkness, leaning down to whisper something encouraging to her son, had rooted itself firmly in her mind—and no matter how much she tried, she couldn’t quite shake it. Lilia was a product of her time, having been a teenager in the late 70s, where lines were less strict and she knew she could be of good advice, but she wasn’t ready for that discussion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After leaving the bar, Rio made her way back to her campus apartment. The night air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of rain that had fallen earlier in the afternoon. She walked briskly, her bag slung over one shoulder, her thoughts scattered between the evening’s events and the tasks awaiting her at the library.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She climbed the stairs to her apartment, unlocking the door to the familiar, slightly cluttered space she called home. Books and papers were strewn across the small desk by the window, her old ballet shoes rested in the corner near her bed, and a mug sat forgotten on the coffee table. Plants were everywhere, on most of the surface, even hung above the window and on the shelves in her very small kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio set her things down and went straight to her room, rifling through her closet for something more comfortable to wear. She changed into a soft hoodie and jeans, tying her hair back into a loose bun. Her reflection in the mirror was tired but determined. A long evening of research with Alice loomed ahead, but instead of focusing on the books and notes waiting for her, her mind kept circling back to one thing—or rather, one person.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had seen her professor in many different lights—stern and commanding in the seminar room, sharp and witty during one-on-one meetings—but tonight had added a new layer. Seeing Agatha as a mother, so attentive and tender with Nicky, had caught Rio off guard. It was an intimacy she hadn’t expected, a warmth that lingered in her thoughts long after the recital had ended.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sat on the edge of her bed, staring at her phone. A part of her wanted to text Alice, to distract herself with her friend’s sharp humor and easy banter. But instead, she leaned back against the pillows, letting her thoughts wander.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The image of Agatha, standing in the audience, clapping proudly as Nicky danced, wouldn’t leave her mind. The way she had softened when her son looked at her, the subtle but undeniable joy in her expression—it was so unlike the composed, almost untouchable Dr. Harkness Rio had come to know in class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, rubbing her temples. “Get it together, Vidal,” she muttered to herself. “She’s your professor, not—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not what? Not someone she could be intrigued by? Not someone she could admire beyond an academic context?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shaking her head, Rio forced herself to her feet, grabbing her backpack and laptop. She needed to get to the library before Alice started texting her snarky reminders about being late.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, as she locked her apartment and headed out into the night, her thoughts remained frustratingly preoccupied. No matter how much she tried to push Agatha Harkness out of her mind, the professor’s shadow lingered, refusing to be ignored.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The campus library was quiet, its usual hum of activity replaced by the soft rustle of pages and the muted clicking of keyboards. It was late enough that most students had already called it a night, but Rio knew she and Alice thrived in the stillness of these late hours.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio stepped inside, she spotted Alice right away. Her friend was sprawled across a table near the philosophy section, her laptop open and surrounded by a chaotic array of notes, textbooks, and an oversized coffee cup. As always, Alice looked like she was simultaneously working on three different things and somehow thriving.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re late,” Alice greeted without looking up, tapping furiously at her keyboard.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re early,” Rio shot back, sliding into the chair across from her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice finally looked up, raising an eyebrow. “I’m always early. You’re just chronically distracted.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio ignored the jab, pulling out her laptop and notepad. “What are you working on?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Analyzing the use of leitmotifs in <em>The Ring Cycle</em>,” Alice replied with a dramatic sigh. “It’s either genius or torture. Possibly both.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled faintly, pulling up her own notes. “Sounds about right for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they worked, the silence between them settled into an easy rhythm. The occasional sound of a turning page or a whispered comment broke the quiet, but mostly they focused on their respective projects.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For Rio, though, focusing was easier said than done. Her notes blurred together, her thoughts drifting back to Agatha. The recital, her effortless grace in the seminar room, her quiet but powerful presence—it all swirled in Rio’s mind, unbidden and distracting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re doing it again,” Alice said, breaking the silence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, startled. “Doing what?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice gave her a knowing look. “Spacing out. Thinking about her, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You are,” Alice interrupted, smirking. “It’s written all over your face. So, what was it this time? Another brilliant comment in class? Or are you still stuck on the recital?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, dropping her head into her hands. “Alice, I swear—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, no judgment,” Alice said, holding up her hands in mock surrender. “I’m just saying, maybe you should lean into it. It’s obviously rattling around in there for a reason.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s my professor,” Rio muttered, her voice muffled against her hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And?” Alice countered. “Doesn’t mean you can’t think she’s fascinating. Or, you know, intimidatingly gorgeous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s head shot up, her cheeks burning. “Alice!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What?” Alice said, grinning unapologetically. “You know I’m right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, shaking her head but unable to stop a small smile from tugging at her lips. “I’m never telling you anything ever again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You love me,” Alice replied, spinning her laptop toward Rio. “Now, stop brooding and tell me if this analysis makes sense.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned forward, grateful for the distraction. Still, as they worked late into the night, her thoughts occasionally strayed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few more hours, Alice stretched dramatically, gathering her books and laptop. “Alright, I’m calling it. If I keep staring at this screen, I’m going to go blind or mad—or both.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced up from her own laptop, smirking. “Already giving up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Excuse me, I’ve been here for hours,” Alice shot back, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “Unlike some people, I don’t survive on coffee and denial.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, leaning back in her chair. “Fair enough. I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yep. Try not to stay too late,” Alice said, waving as she headed toward the exit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With Alice gone, the library felt even quieter. Rio returned to her work, forcing herself to focus, but the distraction of her swirling thoughts made progress slow. Finally, she decided to pack up for the night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The campus was eerily still as she stepped out of the library, her breath visible in the cool night air. She adjusted her bag on her shoulder and started down the path, the glow of the lampposts casting long shadows.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she rounded a corner, Rio nearly collided with someone coming the opposite way. She staggered back, startled, and looked up to see none other than Agatha Harkness standing in front of her, her hand on her arm to steady her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh! Professor Harkness,” Rio stammered, her voice breaking the quiet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyebrows lifted slightly, though her expression remained composed. “Miss Vidal. Burning the midnight oil, I see.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio flushed, struggling to recover. “Uh, yes. Just wrapping up some research. What about you? Late meeting?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her posture as effortless as ever. “Faculty business. Would rather have stayed with Nicky after his big day, but they didn’t give me a choice. It ran later than expected.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The lamplight caught the faint sheen of weariness in Agatha’s eyes, but her presence was as intimidating as ever. Rio suddenly felt self-conscious, acutely aware of the contrast between her casual hoodie and jeans and Agatha’s perfectly tailored coat. She realized that Agatha’s hand was still on her arm, and Agatha, following her gaze, immediately let her go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, they stood in silence, the night pressing in around them. Rio shifted her weight, unsure if she should excuse herself or say something else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You should be careful walking alone this late,” Agatha said finally, her voice calm but firm. “Campus is quiet, but that doesn’t mean it’s always safe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m okay,” Rio said quickly. “The library’s not far from my apartment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha studied her for a moment, then gave a small nod. “Still, it’s good to stay aware.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio said softly, the warmth of Agatha’s concern catching her off guard.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a faint smile, barely there but unmistakable. “Goodnight, Miss Vidal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Goodnight, Professor,” Rio replied, watching as Agatha turned and walked away, her figure disappearing into the shadows.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio continued her own path back to her apartment, her heart thudded in her chest. The encounter was brief, almost mundane, yet it left her feeling as though the night air had shifted somehow, charged with an energy she couldn’t quite name.</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <em>Sudden in a shaft of sunlight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Even while the dust moves</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There rises the hidden laughter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Of children in the foliage</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Quick now, here, now, always—</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ridiculous the waste sad time</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Stretching before and after.</em>
</p><p>         (T. S. Eliot, “Burnt Norton”, <em>Four Quartets)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound of distorted guitar chords and drum beats echoed through the small rehearsal space as Rio adjusted her drum kit. The band was in the thick of practice for their upcoming gig, with Alice on the keyboard and Jen shredding on her guitar. The energy in the room was lively, but Rio couldn’t shake the sense that something was… different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t the music. That was as tight as ever, their years of playing together creating an effortless synergy. No, it was something else—something between Alice and Jen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They’d always had a good rapport, but tonight, there was an added layer of familiarity to their banter, a warmth that hadn’t been there before. Jen leaned closer than usual when they talked, her sharp, playful remarks met with Alice’s soft smiles. At one point, Jen reached over to fix a loose strap on Alice’s keyboard, her fingers brushing Alice’s hand in a way that seemed more intentional than casual.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s sticks faltered on the cymbal, and she had to cover her slip by pretending to adjust her stool.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice noticed. “You good back there, Vidal?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Fine,” Rio replied quickly, rolling her shoulders. “Just need to get comfortable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Comfort is key,” Jen quipped, her grin directed more at Alice than at Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice laughed, her gaze lingering on Jen for a beat longer than necessary before she turned back to her keyboard.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yep. Something had definitely shifted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t mind—she was happy for her friends if something was happening between them. But it was… strange. She’d always seen Alice as the steady one, the one least likely to fall into the chaos of feelings. Seeing her now, with a softness in her eyes and an ease in her laughter, was almost surreal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, let’s run that last song again,” Alice said, her tone all business as she gestured to Jen. “And try not to show off too much this time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No promises,” Jen shot back, winking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t help smiling. She counted them in, the steady beat of the drums grounding her as they launched into the song.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the end of rehearsal, the tension in the room had settled into something more comfortable. They packed up their gear, chatting about the setlist for their gig, but Rio noticed how Alice and Jen stayed close to each other, their casual touches and glances speaking volumes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they walked out of the studio, Alice nudged Rio. “You were quiet tonight. Everything okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio said, smirking. “Just trying to keep up with all the <em>comfort</em> happening in there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice blinked, then groaned. “Oh, no. Don’t start.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I didn’t say anything,” Rio said innocently.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You didn’t have to,” Alice grumbled, but her cheeks were a little pink as she shoved her hands in her pockets.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Behind them, Jen called out, “What’s going on up there?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nothing!” Alice yelled back, glaring at Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio just laughed, her spirits lifting. Whatever was happening between Alice and Jen, it was good. She didn’t need to understand it fully to know that.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The walk back to campus was filled with casual conversation, but Rio couldn’t help noticing how Alice and Jen fell into step beside each other, their conversation flowing easily in a way that felt new. Jen carried Alice’s keyboard case without being asked, and Alice nudged her shoulder playfully as they joked about one of the songs they’d practiced.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio walked slightly behind them, watching with quiet amusement. Alice, normally so guarded and practical, seemed lighter around Jen, her usual sharpness tempered by a warmth that Rio rarely saw outside their closest moments.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached the student center, where they would part ways, Jen lingered. “You sure you’re good carrying this back to your apartment?” she asked Alice, gesturing to the keyboard case.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice rolled her eyes, smirking. “I’ve carried it a million times. I’ll survive, mom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen grinned. “Fine. Just don’t say I didn’t offer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Alice turned to go, Jen hesitated, then called after her, “Hey, don’t forget to check your email. I sent over those chord changes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll get to it,” Alice replied, waving as she walked away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen watched her go for a moment, then turned back to Rio, her expression shifting into something more neutral. “She’s stubborn.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Always,” Rio agreed, her tone light. “You’re good for her, though.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen raised an eyebrow, her lips curving into a faint smile. “You think so?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged. “Yeah. She hasn’t looked this happy in a while.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Jen seemed taken aback, but then she nodded, slinging her guitar strap over her shoulder. “Well, let’s see how long I can keep that streak going.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good luck,” Rio teased.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen gave her a two-fingered salute before heading off into the night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood there for a moment, watching her friends disappear into the distance. There was a warm satisfaction in seeing them find something special in each other, but it also stirred a strange ache in her chest—something she couldn’t quite name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a sigh, Rio turned and headed toward her own apartment. As much as she was happy for Alice, she couldn’t help wondering why her own life felt so… complicated in comparison. Her thoughts, predictably, drifted to Agatha again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Stop it,” she muttered to herself as she walked. But the thought of Agatha’s quiet strength, her presence, and the way she softened around her son wouldn’t leave her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Rio reached her apartment, she was exhausted, both physically and mentally. She collapsed onto her bed, staring up at the ceiling, and let her thoughts wander.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen had found something unexpected, something that seemed to just <em>fit</em>. Rio couldn’t help wondering if she would ever find that for herself—and what it might look like if she did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The crisp morning air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Agatha and Nicky strolled through the park. Nicky skipped ahead, clutching a small bag of birdseed he’d insisted on bringing to feed the pigeons. Agatha watched him fondly, her hands tucked into the pockets of her coat, her usual poised demeanor softened by the casual outing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not too far, Nicky,” she called as he darted toward a cluster of birds near a bench.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I won’t, Mama!” he shouted back, already scattering seeds with dramatic enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, a small smile tugging at her lips. It was rare for her to take time away from her usual schedule of teaching, writing, and meetings, but she’d promised Nicky they’d spend the morning together. She was glad she had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she walked toward where Nicky was crouched, another figure came into view—a familiar one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio Vidal was seated on the edge of the bench near the pigeons, a notebook balanced on her knees raised to her chest and a pen in her hand. She was dressed casually in a leather jacket and jeans, her dark hair loose and windswept by the breeze. Her focus was entirely on the page in front of her, her pen moving in steady strokes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for a moment, caught off guard. It wasn’t the first time she’d seen Rio outside of class—there was the dance recital, of course—but something about this chance encounter felt unexpectedly intimate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama!” Nicky’s voice broke her reverie as he ran back toward her. “Can I use the rest of the seeds? There’s a squirrel over there!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her attention shifting back to him. “Go ahead, but don’t chase it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky raced off, Agatha turned back toward the bench, only to see that Rio had looked up and spotted her. Their eyes met, and Rio smiled—a warm, slightly surprised expression that made Agatha’s chest tighten inexplicably.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Professor Harkness,” Rio said, closing her notebook and standing. “Good morning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” Agatha replied, her tone calm and measured as always, though her heart beat a fraction faster. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I come here to write sometimes,” Rio explained, tucking the notebook into her bag. “It’s quieter than the library sometimes, and the fresh air helps me think.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, glancing toward where Nicky was now crouched by a tree, offering seeds to a particularly bold squirrel. “We’re here for him, of course,” she said, her voice softening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio followed her gaze, smiling. “He’s really sweet. He talks about you all the time in class, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh?” Agatha raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio said, her smile widening. “You’re his hero. He told me he wants to be as smart and cool as his mom when he grows up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a rare flush of warmth rise to her cheeks. She glanced away, watching Nicky with an expression that was both fond and slightly embarrassed. “He’s a bit biased, I think.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know,” Rio said, her tone light but sincere. “He might be onto something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked back at her, caught off guard by the comment. There was no teasing in Rio’s voice—just a quiet admiration that felt almost… personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Agatha could respond, Nicky came running back, his cheeks flushed with excitement. “Mama, the squirrel took the seed from my hand!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did it?” Agatha said, crouching slightly to meet his gaze. “You must have been very patient.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I was! Oh hi Miss Rio, did you see it?” Nicky turned to Rio, his eyes bright.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I missed it,” Rio said, crouching to his level. “But it sounds amazing. Maybe you’ll have to show me again next time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay!” Nicky beamed, clearly pleased.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha straightened, watching the easy way Rio interacted with her son. The dynamic between them was effortless, natural, and Agatha felt an unfamiliar pang of… what? Longing? Curiosity?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We should let you get back to your writing,” Agatha said finally, her voice carefully neutral.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, I was about to leave anyway,” Rio replied, standing again. “It was nice running into you both.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio slung her bag over her shoulder and started down the path, Nicky waved enthusiastically after her. “Bye, Miss Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Bye, Nicky,” Rio called back, her smile lingering even as she walked away. But before she could get too far, her pulse quickened as a spark of boldness flared—an uncharacteristic urge to close the small gap between herself and Professor Harkness, to bridge the distance of formality that usually defined their interactions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned back, clutching the strap of her bag like it was the only thing grounding her courage. “Professor Harkness?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been watching Nicky skip in circles around a tree, looked up. “Yes?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a half step forward, her voice steady despite the flutter in her chest. “Um, I just thought I’d mention—my band is playing at O’Malley’s this Friday night. It’s nothing fancy, but if you’re free, it might be fun.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, her poised demeanor softening into something gentler. For a moment, she didn’t respond, as if weighing the invitation more seriously than Rio had expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s kind of you to mention,” Agatha said at last, a faint smile touching her lips. “I’ll see if I can make it. I don’t know if…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped, though she kept her tone light. “No pressure. Just thought I’d let you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, now tugging on his mother’s sleeve, piped up, “Are you in a band, Miss Rio? Like a <em>real</em> band?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, crouching to meet his curious gaze. “A real band. I even play the drums.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Whoa!” Nicky’s eyes widened with delight. “That’s so cool! Mama, can I go to her band thing?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, gently smoothing Nicky’s hair. “It’s at a bar, sweetheart. That’s not exactly a place for six-year-olds.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky pouted for a moment before brightening again. “Will you go, then? You can tell me all about it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll see,” Agatha said, her tone kind but noncommittal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio straightened, giving Nicky a playful grin. “Maybe I’ll play an extra cool drum solo just for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes!” Nicky pumped his fist, clearly thrilled at the idea.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Take care, Miss Vidal,” Agatha said, her voice tinged with something warmer than usual as she gently steered Nicky back toward the path.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You too,” Rio replied, her courage fading into a soft, lingering smile as she watched them walk away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she finally turned to leave the park, her heart raced—not from nerves but from the thrill of having taken a chance. Whether or not Agatha showed up on Friday, she’d done something she never thought she’d have the nerve to do.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched her go, the crisp air suddenly feeling warmer. Nicky tugged at her hand, breaking her thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom, can we go to the playground now?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” she said, her voice steady as she took his hand. But as they walked, her mind wandered back to Rio, her words, her presence, and the unexpected way she seemed to slip so easily into Agatha’s carefully controlled world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio walked away from the park, her heart raced, each step quicker than the last. The cool breeze against her face did little to calm the flush creeping up her neck and cheeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>What were you thinking, Vidal?</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her internal monologue spiraled as she replayed the moment over and over. She’d invited <em>Professor Harkness</em>—her <em>PhD supervisor</em>—to her band’s gig at a bar. A bar.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She groaned under her breath, clutching the strap of her bag tightly. “Smooth. Really smooth,” she muttered to herself, weaving through the park paths as though walking faster would somehow help her escape the weight of her embarrassment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Why had she done it? She’d been perfectly fine chatting about the park, Nicky, and squirrels. But then that spark of courage—no, foolishness—had flared, and the words had just spilled out. And now, she couldn’t take them back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>What if she actually shows up?</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio winced at the thought. The idea of performing in front of a crowd had never fazed her before; she loved the stage, the music, the energy. But the thought of Agatha Harkness sitting in the audience, her piercing gaze assessing—not papers or seminar contributions, but <em>her</em>—was enough to make Rio want to sink into the ground.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stopped walking, taking a deep breath to steady herself. “Okay, calm down,” she said aloud, earning a curious glance from an elderly man walking his dog. She shot him a sheepish smile and resumed walking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t as if Agatha had <em>said</em> she’d come. She’d just said she’d see if she could make it. That was probably her polite way of declining without hurting Rio’s feelings. And honestly, Rio hoped that was the case.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>But what if she does come?</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The thought sent another wave of panic crashing through her. She could already hear Alice and Jen teasing her mercilessly about it during rehearsal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, relax,” she told herself, finally slowing her pace. “You’re overthinking this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But no matter how many times she repeated it, the flutter of anxiety—and something else she didn’t quite want to name—lingered in her chest all the way back to campus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that evening, Agatha sat in her study, her desk illuminated by the soft glow of a desk lamp. Papers were spread before her—essays waiting to be graded—but her attention wasn’t on them. Instead, her thoughts drifted to the park, to Rio’s invitation, and to the unexpected boldness in her student’s voice as she extended it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It had been such a simple thing—a casual mention of a Friday night band performance. Yet it lingered in Agatha’s mind, unsettled and persistent, like a thread she couldn’t untangle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She leaned back in her chair, tapping her pen lightly against the wood. Could she really go?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was no rule forbidding it, of course. Professors were allowed lives outside of academia. But Rio wasn’t just a student—she was <em>her</em> student now, assigned under her supervision for the PhD program.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha thought of Rio crouched beside Nicky, patiently listening to his excited chatter, the way she’d waved goodbye with that warm, easy smile. She thought of how Nicky had lit up at the mention of Rio being in a band, his awe at the idea of her playing the drums.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her lips curved into a small, reluctant smile. It wasn’t just Nicky who’d been caught off guard. Seeing Rio outside the carefully structured world of academia had shifted something—nudged the perception Agatha held of her. Rio was not just the brilliant young scholar she saw in seminars or the calm, confident teacher guiding children at the recital. She was multifaceted, dynamic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But did that justify showing up?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha frowned, running her fingers through her hair. If she went, what would it mean? For Rio? For herself? Would it blur the professional boundaries she so carefully maintained?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s words replayed in her mind. <em>“Will you go, then? You can tell me all about it!”</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, resting her chin on her hand. Maybe it didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe it could just be about indulging her curiosity and supporting a student who, despite her composed exterior, had mustered the courage to invite her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced at the stack of essays on her desk. There was still time to decide. Friday was days away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For now, she resolved to focus on her work—but as she picked up her pen, her thoughts betrayed her, drifting once again to the vision of Rio Vidal behind a drum set, her presence as electric and mysterious as her intellect.</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p>        (T. S. Eliot. “The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets.)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">By the time Friday afternoon rolled around, Rio was a bundle of nerves. Her usual pre-gig excitement had been replaced with an anxious knot twisting in her stomach. She paced the small stretch of her apartment, muttering under her breath as she double-checked her outfit, her drumsticks, and even the setlist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Maybe she won’t come. Maybe she forgot.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But what if she <em>didn’t</em>?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Unable to keep it to herself any longer, she grabbed her phone and texted Alice:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Are you at the bar yet? I need to talk.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The reply came almost instantly:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>Getting there. What’s up? Nervous?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grimaced. Nervous didn’t even begin to cover it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>More like I might’ve done something really stupid.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Rio arrived at O’Malley’s, her drumsticks in hand and anxiety written all over her face, Alice was already at the bar, sipping a beer. She raised an eyebrow as Rio slid into the seat next to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, what’s this about doing something stupid?” Alice asked, her tone light and teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, then leaned in closer, lowering her voice. “Okay, don’t freak out. But… I kind of invited Dr. Harkness to the show.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a second, Alice just blinked at her. Then, she burst out laughing, nearly spilling her drink. “You what?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know, I know!” Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. “It was a heat-of-the-moment thing, and I didn’t think she’d actually come, but now I can’t stop thinking about it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice grinned, leaning back in her chair. “Rio, you <em>invited your professor</em>—your <em>supervisor</em>—to watch you play drums in a grungy bar. That’s amazing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s not amazing. It’s horrifying,” Rio muttered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice tilted her head, her grin widening. “Oh, come on. Worst-case scenario, she doesn’t show up, and you spent a week panicking for nothing. Best-case scenario, she does come, and we get to see you lose your cool on stage. Honestly, I’m rooting for the second option.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned again, her cheeks burning. “You’re not helping.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But I am,” Alice said, patting her shoulder. “Look, if she comes, it’s because she wants to. You’re not dragging her here against her will. And if she doesn’t, who cares? Either way, you’re still going to kill it tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, fiddling with her drumsticks. “I don’t know. It just feels… weird. Like I crossed some kind of boundary.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Relax,” Alice said, giving her a reassuring smile. “You’re allowed to have a life, Rio. Even if it includes being ridiculously fascinated by your professor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure you’re not.” Alice winked, cutting her off. “Now, let’s get to soundcheck before Jen starts texting us death threats.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reluctantly followed Alice toward the stage, her heart still racing. The bar was starting to fill up, and she scanned the crowd, half-hoping and half-dreading seeing a familiar face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Please don’t come,</em> she thought. Then, a beat later: <em>But if you do…</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t let herself finish the thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Friday afternoon stretched into evening, Agatha sat in her living room, a glass of wine untouched on the coffee table in front of her. Nicky was happily occupied with his new building set, chattering to himself as he constructed a tiny fortress on the rug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, however, was a world away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio Vidal’s invitation lingered in her thoughts, an echo she hadn’t been able to shake all week. It had been a casual offer, tossed out with more courage than Rio probably intended to reveal, and yet it had stirred something in Agatha—a flicker of interest she hadn’t entirely welcomed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her gaze drifted to the clock. If she left now, she could easily make it to O’Malley’s before the band started. But should she?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There were a dozen reasons not to go. It wasn’t exactly professional, showing up to a student’s band performance. There was the question of boundaries, of appearances, of how it might be perceived by others. Agatha was well aware of the fine line she walked as a professor, particularly now that Rio was under her direct supervision.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But then there was the other side of the argument—the quieter, more personal side she rarely let herself indulge.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha thought of Nicky at the park, looking up at Rio like she was the coolest person in the world. Of Rio’s easy smile and the way her eyes had sparkled with that nervous, fleeting hopefulness as she extended the invitation. There had been no expectation in it, no attempt to curry favor or blur the lines of their relationship. It had been a simple, genuine moment, offered without pretense.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And, she had to admit, she was curious. Curious about this other side of Rio, the one that existed beyond the seminar room and the dance studio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama?” Nicky’s voice cut into her thoughts, and she looked over to find him holding up a lopsided piece of his fortress. “Do you think this should go on top or on the side?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, leaning forward to inspect his work. “I think it’s perfect just as it is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He beamed, turning back to his creation, and Agatha’s heart softened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Maybe it wouldn’t be such a terrible thing,</em> she thought, reaching for her glass of wine and sipping it slowly. <em>Just this once.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The clock ticked forward. Agatha sat back, still undecided. There was time yet to make a choice, but the weight of it pressed against her, urging her to decide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled sharply, leaning back on the couch as the decision settled in her chest. She was going.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But it didn’t mean anything. It wasn’t unusual for a professor to support a student’s extracurricular activities. It wasn’t about Rio. It was about curiosity and support , she told herself, about broadening her understanding of the people she taught, so she could help them better.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, the flutter in her chest betrayed her attempt to keep it purely professional.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She picked up her phone and dialed Wanda.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Aggie!” Wanda’s warm voice answered almost immediately. “What’s up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled despite herself. “I need a favor. Are you free tonight to watch Nicky for a couple of hours?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Depends,” Wanda teased. “What’s the occasion? A hot date?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes, though Wanda couldn’t see it. “Hardly. One of my students invited me to see their band play at a bar.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a beat of silence, and then Wanda laughed. “A bar? Aggie, that’s a little out of your usual scene, isn’t it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t start,” Agatha warned, her tone half-serious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m just saying,” Wanda said, still amused. “You’re really going to a bar on a Friday night for a <em>student</em>? Must be a special student.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s not like that,” Agatha said firmly, though she could feel a blush creeping up her neck. “She’s… unique. Brilliant, really. And she works hard. I thought it might be nice to see this other side of her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Uh-huh.” Wanda’s voice was laced with playful skepticism.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wanda.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, alright,” Wanda relented, her laughter softening. “I’ll come over. What time do you need me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Seven should be fine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Agatha said, genuinely grateful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she hung up, she glanced at the clock and stood. There was still time to change her mind, but she knew she wouldn’t. This wasn’t about Rio. It was just a chance to see something different, to step outside her routine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That was all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Backstage at O’Malley’s, the air buzzed with pre-show energy. Jen was fine-tuning her guitar, Alice was tapping out a quick rhythm on the edge of a table, and Rio was… pacing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Will you <em>relax</em>, Rio?” Alice said, not even looking up as she adjusted her drumsticks. “You’re making me nervous, and I’m the calm one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine,” Rio muttered, though the edge in her voice betrayed her. She played the strap of her drum bag for the third time, glancing toward the slightly cracked door leading to the stage and the growing crowd beyond.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure you are,” Alice teased, her lips curling into a knowing smirk. “Totally fine. Except for the part where you keep peeking out there like you’re waiting for someone special.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m just checking the crowd,” Rio said quickly, trying—and failing—to sound casual.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised an eyebrow. “You’ve checked the crowd six times already. And the last time I checked, Lilia doesn’t exactly frequent grungy college bars.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can you not?” Rio hissed, her cheeks burning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, come on. Just admit it,” Alice said, leaning her drumsticks against the wall. “You’re hoping <em>Dr. Harkness</em> shows up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not—” Rio started, but Alice’s pointed look cut her off.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, maybe a little,” Rio admitted, running a hand through her hair. “But it’s not what you think.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, sure it’s not,” Alice said, smirking. “You’re just <em>really passionate</em> about faculty engagement in student bands.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a glare but couldn’t help the small, nervous laugh that escaped. “Shut up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Relax,” Alice said, standing and giving Rio a reassuring pat on the back. “Even if she does show, it’ll be fine. She’s just another person in the crowd. And if she doesn’t? No big deal. Either way, we’re gonna kill it tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, though her stomach still churned. She couldn’t help herself—she glanced toward the door again, her pulse quickening as the faint sound of the growing crowd reached her ears.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t know what she was hoping for more—that Agatha would show up, or that she wouldn’t.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment arrived. The band’s name was called, and the crowd erupted into cheers as Rio, Alice, Jen, and the others stepped onto the stage. The bar was packed, the low hum of chatter and clinking glasses giving way to a buzz of anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took her place behind the drum kit, her heart pounding in rhythm with the beat she was about to unleash. She gripped her drumsticks tightly, forcing herself to focus. Whether or not <em>she</em> was here didn’t matter now. This was her moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice adjusted her mic, grinning at the crowd. “Good evening, O’Malley’s! We’re <em>Three of Swords,</em> and we’re so stoked to be here tonight. Let’s make some noise!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The first song kicked off with a driving bassline, Jen’s guitar roaring to life as Rio found her rhythm. The music took over, drowning out everything else—the nerves, the doubts, the wondering. On stage, Rio felt invincible, the steady crash of her cymbals and the sharp crack of her snare drum grounding her in the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t see Agatha slip into the bar a few minutes later, pausing near the entrance as the music washed over her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha lingered for a moment, scanning the room. It was crowded, dimly lit, and alive with energy. Not her usual scene, and yet… she found herself intrigued. Her gaze settled on the stage, where Rio was a haunting presence behind the drum kit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Even in the chaos of the performance, Rio’s focus was sharp, her movements precise yet fluid. She wasn’t just playing; she was <em>in it,</em> the music coursing through her with a palpable intensity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha moved further into the bar, finding a spot near the back where she could watch without being noticed. She crossed her arms, leaning against the wall as she took it all in—the raw power of the music, the energy of the crowd, and Rio, utterly transformed under the stage lights.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a brief moment, Agatha let herself be carried by the music, the steady pulse of the drums resonating in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>She’s good,</em> Agatha thought, her lips curving into the faintest of smiles. She couldn’t help but stare at Rio, in her deep green almost see-through blouse, the top two buttons left open, letting a black lacy undershirt peak through, her hair wild around her head and her make-up a tad heavier than usual. She was mesmerizing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Boy I’m in trouble.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The final chord rang out, the echo lingering in the air before the bar erupted into applause. Rio leaned back, letting the drumsticks fall from her hands as she caught her breath. The performance had flown by in a blur of sound and motion, her nerves forgotten in the adrenaline of the stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She exchanged a triumphant grin with Alice and Jen before standing and waving to the crowd. They were cheering loudly, faces lit with excitement, but it wasn’t until Rio scanned the room that she caught sight of a familiar figure near the back.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Agatha Harkness.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart did an odd little stutter. Agatha was standing with her arms crossed, her expression composed but unmistakably attentive. Her dark eyes were fixed on the stage, on <em>her,</em> and for a split second, Rio forgot how to breathe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She blinked, half-convinced she was imagining it. But no, Agatha was very much there, framed by the low light of the bar’s sconces.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Rio,” Alice said, giving her a light nudge as they started moving offstage. “Earth to Vidal. You coming?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio said quickly, snapping out of it. She grabbed her sticks and followed the others, but her mind was still stuck on the image of Agatha in the crowd.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Backstage, Alice gave her a knowing look. “Saw someone out there, didn’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No,” Rio lied, too quickly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smirked. “Sure. Whatever you say.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t bother answering, her thoughts too tangled. The adrenaline from the performance was still pumping through her veins, but now it was mingled with a nervous energy she hadn’t expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>She came.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The realization hit her all over again as she sat down, trying to calm her racing thoughts. Agatha had come. And somehow, knowing that felt bigger than it should.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio fidgeted backstage, her hands restless as she glanced at the door to the bar, wondering if she should go over and speak to Agatha. The crowd was thinning out now, but Agatha was still there, leaning against the bar, a glass of white wine in hand, watching the last few patrons filter out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Alice,” Rio muttered, pacing back and forth. “What do you think? Should I go talk to her?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, who had just finished packing away her gear, raised an eyebrow at her. “Oh, <em>now</em> you’re asking for advice? After all the teasing you’ve done about <em>not</em> caring if she shows up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Shut up,” Rio groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I’m serious. I don’t know if I should. She’s a professor. I’m a student. I’m probably already weird enough for inviting her in the first place.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice looked at her like she was insane. “Are you hearing yourself right now? You’re overthinking it. You invited her because she’s your professor, and it’s a student thing. She came to support you. That’s a huge deal! You should go thank her for coming.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip, pacing again. “But… what if it’s weird? What if I’m too… forward?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Forward?” Alice repeated, her voice incredulous. “Rio, you’re over here practically having a panic attack because your professor came to see you perform. I think ‘forward’ is the least of your worries.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio paused, glancing at her friend, a bit of humor slipping through her nervousness. “You think it’s a bad idea?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think it’s a <em>fantastic</em> idea,” Alice said, her grin widening. “Go. You’ll regret it if you don’t.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment, but Alice’s certainty had a way of quieting her doubts. She took a deep breath. “Alright, fine. But if I embarrass myself, I’m blaming you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You won’t embarrass yourself,” Alice said confidently, giving Rio a reassuring push toward the door. “Now go. I’ll be right behind you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With one last glance at Alice, Rio steeled herself. This time, there was no turning back. She was going to go thank Agatha. And who knows? Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. Maybe it would even be… <em>good.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She walked toward the bar, her heart in her throat, as she approached Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her professor was dressed more casually than usual, but still stunning in her midnight blue shirt, tucked into dark-washed tailored jeans that made her look…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Vidal, what are you even thinking, get yourself together.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">As Rio approached Agatha, her mind raced, but her steps were steady, like a drumbeat she could no longer ignore. The closer she got, the more she could feel her heartbeat thrumming in her chest, the adrenaline from the performance still coursing through her veins. Agatha looked up as Rio neared, her sharp gaze softening for a brief moment when she recognized who was walking toward her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness,” Rio began, her voice almost too quiet as she stopped a few feet away. She fought the urge to fidget with her hands, forcing them to remain at her sides. “I just wanted to… thank you for coming tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curled into a faint smile, and she pushed off from the wall, her posture as poised as ever, but there was something warm in her expression now. “It was my pleasure, Miss Vidal,” she said, her voice rich and steady. “You were incredible up there. The performance was… impressive.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a heat rise in her cheeks. “I’m glad you liked it,” she said quickly. “I mean, we’ve been working really hard.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes gleamed with something unreadable, and she tilted her head slightly, her gaze flicking briefly to the band still milling about in the background. “It’s clear. You’ve got a lot of talent, Rio. It’s not easy to capture a crowd like that, especially with such energy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, suddenly unsure of how to respond. Agatha’s praise was unexpected, and it felt different from the academic feedback she was used to. It felt… personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I—thank you,” Rio said, her voice faltering slightly. She quickly glanced down at the floor, then back at Agatha, trying to steady her racing heart. “I didn’t think you’d come, honestly. I didn’t expect it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, stepping a little closer, her gaze flicking to Rio with a sharp yet somehow gentle intensity. “Why wouldn’t I? I said I’d come, didn’t I? It’s important to support students, especially when they’re… passionate about something.” Her eyes held Rio’s for a beat longer than necessary, and Rio felt a shiver of something — anticipation, excitement — pass through her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I guess I just thought you’d be busy or something,” Rio said quickly, unsure how to navigate the sudden tension that seemed to fill the space between them. “You know, with work and everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, the sound smooth and melodic. “I have my moments of free time too. Besides, I was sure your band’s performance was worth the effort.” She glanced toward the exit where the last few patrons were trickling out. “I’m glad I made it. It was… refreshing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a quiet pause, the air between them thick with unspoken words. Rio’s nerves flared again, but she was determined to hold her ground.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you… heading out soon?” Rio asked, her voice sounding a little unsure of itself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha regarded her for a moment, her gaze softening, before she answered. “I think I’ll stay a little longer, actually. If that’s alright.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat, but she nodded, her words feeling like they were stuck in her throat. “Of course. I just… I wasn’t sure if you wanted to stay or—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll stay,” Agatha said again, a playful hint in her tone that made Rio’s breath catch. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay… I need to go backstage, help the other tidy up a bit but… I’ll see you around?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a nod, her lips curling into a subtle but knowing smile. “I’ll be here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned to leave, but her heart was still racing, the weight of the brief exchange hanging in the air long after she stepped away. She could feel Agatha’s eyes on her back, and something told her that this was only the beginning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the night wore on, the bar slowly emptied out, but Rio and the band stayed, lingering around the stage, talking among themselves. Alice, as usual, was full of energy, bouncing between conversations with Jen and making plans for the next rehearsal. But despite her outwardly relaxed demeanor, Rio could feel her friend’s gaze drifting toward Agatha every so often.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At some point, Alice caught Rio looking, her eyes narrowing with a knowing grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Alice said, leaning toward Rio with a mischievous glint in her eyes, “I think it’s time to go make things interesting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio frowned, not quite following her friend’s line of thinking. “What do you mean?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Alice was already making a beeline for the bar, her mission clear. Rio’s heart dropped into her stomach as she watched her friend march right up to Agatha, who was still standing near the back of the room, now sipping a drink.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Here we go,” Rio muttered to herself, her hand instinctively moving to her face in embarrassment. She could feel her cheeks heating up, even from across the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s voice rang out, louder than Rio would’ve liked. “Hi, I’m Alice! You must be Dr. Harkness! I’ve heard all about you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been deep in conversation with someone else, turned at the sudden interruption, her expression polite but guarded. Rio could see the brief flicker of surprise in Agatha’s eyes before she composed herself, her gaze scanning the new intruder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah,” Agatha replied with a smile that was, unsurprisingly, just as controlled and perceptive as ever. “And you are?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alice,” she said brightly, sticking out her hand like they were old friends. “I’m Rio’s best friend. You know, <em>the</em> Rio Vidal, the one you just saw on stage.” Her grin was teasing but warm, as if she was proud of Rio’s performance—though Rio had no doubt the whole thing had the potential to be slightly embarrassing for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha eyed her hand briefly before shaking it, her grip firm but cool. “Nice to meet you, Alice. I’m afraid Rio hasn’t mentioned much about her band.” Her tone was polite, but Rio could sense the subtle shift in Agatha’s demeanor—she was definitely sizing Alice up, in the same way she always did in class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, undeterred by Agatha’s more reserved response, continued her chatter. “Well, we’re a package deal, you see. Rio, me, and Jen here. I’m a musicology PhD student, so I guess I’m technically also a scholar of sorts, but with a little more groove. You know how it is. But you! I’ve heard nothing but <em>amazing</em> things about you from Rio, especially about your classes and your seminars.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, at this point, was doing everything she could to avoid looking directly at the two of them, her face a bright shade of red as Alice continued to gush. She kept glancing at the stage, pretending to adjust her equipment, even though there was nothing to adjust. It was almost painful to hear Alice be so… <em>obnoxiously</em> charming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, though, remained unfazed, her cool composure never slipping. “I’m sure Rio has been very kind with her words. We do have a very interesting seminar series. I look forward to seeing how it all unfolds.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wait, wait,” Alice interjected, leaning in with a wide grin, “Did you actually see Rio play? Because she’s <em>amazing</em> up there. You should come to the next one, I bet Rio would appreciate it. Right, Rio?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice shot her a wink from across the room, and Rio couldn’t help but feel a little caught between a rock and a hard place. She wasn’t sure if Alice was trying to make things less awkward or just completely make a scene, but either way, the last thing Rio wanted was to hear her professor talk about how <em>good</em> her playing was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But to Rio’s surprise, Agatha looked at her for a moment, her gaze piercing through the space between them. She seemed to be thinking for a beat before she nodded slowly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I may very well take you up on that,” Agatha replied, her voice smooth but still holding that subtle authority. “It was a… rather enjoyable performance. I’ll keep an eye on the calendar.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, her heart suddenly beating in her throat again. Had Agatha just… said that? Was she implying that she might actually show up again?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before she could respond, Alice, of course, was already moving on, her enthusiastic nature carrying her to the next subject.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, if you do decide to come back, we’ll make sure Rio saves you a seat,” Alice teased, winking at her again as she finally turned to head back to where Rio was standing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood there, trying her best not to look completely mortified. As Alice rejoined her, she shot Rio a sly look. “I think she’s into you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. “Shut up, Alice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But deep down, despite the discomfort and the teasing, there was a spark of something—something that made her heart race again. As if Agatha’s presence wasn’t as strange as Rio had first thought. Maybe it was something more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>          (T. S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets.)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, the sunlight streamed through the kitchen window as Agatha prepared breakfast. Nicky sat at the table, kicking his legs back and forth, his cereal spoon hovering mid-air as his curious little mind worked overtime.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama,” he began, his tone that telltale mix of innocence and determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, darling?” Agatha replied without looking up, focused on buttering toast.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yesterday, you went to see Miss Rio’s band, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused, the knife still in her hand, her brow lifting slightly. She turned to face her son, who was looking at her with wide, curious eyes. “I did,” Agatha answered carefully, setting the knife down.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did you see them play?” he asked, leaning forward on the table now, his cereal entirely forgotten.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I did,” she admitted, returning to her task, though she could feel the weight of his gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What kind of band is it? Is it, like, a rock band? Or one of those with guitars and drums and stuff?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but smile faintly at his enthusiasm. “Yes, it’s that kind. They play music with guitars, drums, and other instruments. Very lively.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes lit up. “Was Miss Rio playing the drums? I bet she’s really good at it! She’s good at everything!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, finally turning around to fully engage in the conversation. “She was playing the drums, and yes, she’s quite talented.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned, sitting back in his chair with a look of triumph, as if he’d known all along. “Can I go see them play next time? Please, Mommy?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, folding her arms. “That might not where children should be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky pouted but quickly perked up again. “But you went! If you can go, maybe I can too. I really want to see Miss Rio play the drums. I bet it’s so cool.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, shaking her head with a soft laugh. “You’re persistent, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s important!” Nicky declared. “Miss Rio is the best teacher ever, and I want to see her do more stuff!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t reply immediately. Instead, she turned back to her toast, a thoughtful expression on her face. Her son’s unbridled admiration for Rio was both endearing and a little unsettling. She couldn’t deny the growing curiosity within herself either—about Rio’s many facets, about how someone so young carried herself with such passion and strength.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll see,” she said finally, her voice gentle but firm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Promise?” Nicky pressed, his grin widening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I said ‘we’ll see,’” she repeated with mock sternness, though the corners of her lips betrayed her amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Nicky said, clearly satisfied for now. He returned to his cereal with a happy hum, leaving Agatha to her thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she poured herself a cup of tea, Agatha couldn’t help but wonder how her life had suddenly intertwined so unexpectedly with Rio Vidal’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The day stretched ahead, warm and golden, as Agatha decided to devote the entire day to her son. It wasn’t often that she could set aside her workload entirely, but after the recital and the previous night at the bar, she felt like taking a step back and focusing on Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What do you want to do today, sweetheart?” Agatha asked as they finished breakfast, sipping her tea as Nicky wolfed down the last of his cereal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He looked up at her, his face lighting up with excitement. “Can we go to the park again? And maybe get ice cream after?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled. “The park and ice cream? You’re easy to please.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Parks are the best!” he declared, already bouncing out of his chair to grab his shoes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">An hour later, they were strolling through the park, the air crisp and refreshing. Nicky darted ahead to the playground, and Agatha found a bench nearby, keeping a watchful eye on him as he climbed and slid with uncontainable energy. Other parents sat around her, some chatting, others engrossed in books or their phones.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let herself relax, savoring the rare, tranquil moment. Nicky’s laughter rang out, a sound so pure it made her heart swell. She couldn’t help but think about how quickly he was growing—each day a little more independent, a little more curious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a while, Nicky ran back to her, his cheeks flushed from exertion. “Mom, did you see that? I went down the twisty slide <em>backwards!</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I did,” Agatha said with mock seriousness. “Very impressive.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled. Then his face lit up with another idea. “Can we go feed the ducks?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s go, then,” Agatha agreed, standing and brushing off her coat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They wandered over to the pond, where Nicky gleefully tossed breadcrumbs to a group of waddling ducks. Agatha joined in, watching as the ducks squabbled over the treats.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you think the ducks know Miss Rio?” Nicky asked suddenly, breaking her train of thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stifled a laugh. “I don’t think so, darling. I’m pretty sure they stay in the park.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, if she came here more, they might know her,” Nicky reasoned with the seriousness only a six-year-old could muster.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I suppose so,” Agatha replied, humor dancing in her voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After their duck-feeding adventure, Nicky tugged on her hand. “Now ice cream?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“As promised,” she said with a nod.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They walked to the little cart near the park entrance, where Nicky debated for several minutes between chocolate and strawberry before finally choosing both. Agatha opted for a simple cone of vanilla, which she licked absentmindedly as Nicky happily devoured his treat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you think Miss Rio likes ice cream?” Nicky asked between bites.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You seem very interested in Miss Rio today.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s cool,” Nicky said matter-of-factly. “And I bet she likes chocolate, just like me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, brushing a stray strand of hair from her face. “I suppose that’s possible.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the afternoon wore on, they returned home, where Nicky insisted on building a fort in the living room. Agatha let him take the lead, handing him cushions and blankets as he constructed his masterpiece.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time evening rolled around, Nicky was curled up in his fort with a book, his energy finally waning. Agatha sat nearby with her own book, stealing glances at him every so often.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Today was the best,” he murmured, his voice heavy with sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly. “I’m glad you think so, darling.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as she watched him drift off, she couldn’t help but feel grateful for the quiet, simple moments like these.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio woke up to the soft sound of rain tapping against her window. The overcast light filtered through her curtains, casting a muted glow over her small apartment. She stretched lazily, her body still sore from the performance and the whirlwind of emotions the night before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was rare for Rio to have an entire Saturday free—no classes to teach, no meetings, and no pressing deadlines that couldn’t wait until tomorrow. She decided to take full advantage of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a quick shower, she brewed herself a pot of strong coffee while she watered her numerous plants and settled by the window with her notebook. The rain outside set a soothing rhythm, and she let herself write freely, her thoughts spilling onto the pages without inhibition.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Most of it wasn’t for her thesis—just fragments of ideas, poetic musings, and sketches of moments that had stayed with her. She found herself scribbling something about the way Professor Harkness had looked at her last night, a glint of pride and something else in her sharp blue eyes. Rio’s pen hovered over the page for a moment before she shook her head, closed the notebook, and set it aside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By late morning, the rain had eased into a light drizzle. Rio slipped on a sweater and boots, deciding to walk to the campus bookstore. She wandered through the aisles, picking up a new collection of essays for her research and a slim volume of poetry that caught her eye.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With her purchases tucked under her arm, she headed to a nearby café. It was a quiet spot, the kind of place where she could linger with her books without being disturbed. She ordered a latte and a croissant, finding a seat by the window.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her thoughts drifted as she sipped her coffee. She thought about Alice and Jen, how something was undeniably blooming between them, and she wondered what it would mean for their little group. She thought about her performance last night, the rush of adrenaline as she played, and the way her heart had skipped when she spotted Agatha in the crowd.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sighed, shaking her head at herself. <em>Get a grip, Rio. She’s your professor.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of the day passed in peaceful solitude. Back at her apartment, Rio curled up with a book, the soft hum of rain outside a constant companion. By the time the sun set, the sky was a deep slate gray, and she felt the weight of the quiet day settle over her like a blanket.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she climbed into bed, her thoughts lingered on the unexpected ways her life had shifted recently—Agatha’s presence in her academic world, the tentative steps forward with her band, and the small moments that seemed to carry more weight than they should.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She drifted off to sleep, her dreams a jumble of poetry, music, and the faint echo of a warm voice saying her name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next day, the sun was now bright but not overbearing as Rio made her way to the café where she and Alice had agreed to meet. The streets were quieter than usual, the Sunday calm casting a relaxed spell over campus life.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio arrived, she found Alice already seated at a corner table, her fingers drumming nervously against the rim of her coffee cup. It wasn’t often that Alice looked anything less than self-assured, and the sight of her friend fidgeting piqued Rio’s curiosity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey,” Rio said as she slid into the chair across from her. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice glanced up, her eyes wide and a little hesitant. “Oh, it’s not a ghost. Just… a thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio arched an eyebrow, leaning forward with a sly smile. “A thing, huh? Sounds serious.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice groaned, dropping her head into her hands. “It is. It’s so serious that I think my brain might explode if I don’t get it out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed. “Well, don’t explode on me. What’s going on?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice took a deep breath, sitting up straighter. Her fingers wrapped tightly around her coffee cup, and for a moment, she stared at it as if it held all the answers. Then, with a sigh, she finally said, “I think I’m in love with Jen.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, caught off guard even though she’d seen this coming for weeks. “Alice,” she said slowly, a grin spreading across her face. “That’s amazing!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice groaned again, slumping in her chair. “No, it’s not. It’s terrifying. What if she doesn’t feel the same? What if I ruin everything?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alice,” Rio said firmly, reaching across the table to place a comforting hand on her friend’s arm. “First of all, have you seen the way Jen looks at you? She’s got it bad.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s eyes darted up, a spark of hope flickering behind her nervous expression. “You think so?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I <em>know</em> so,” Rio said with a chuckle. “The way she was practically glued to your side after our last gig? Come on. She’s into you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice bit her lip, her fingers tapping a frantic rhythm against the table. “Okay, but what if I’m wrong? What if I say something and it gets weird?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Then you’ll deal with it,” Rio said simply. “You’re brave, Alice. You always go for what you want. Why should this be any different?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice sighed, nodding slowly. “You’re right. I know you’re right. I just… this feels bigger, you know? Like it really matters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Because it does,” Rio said gently. “But that’s a good thing. If it matters, it’s worth the risk.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smiled weakly, her fingers finally stilling. “Thanks, Rio. You’re annoyingly good at this whole advice thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t mention it,” Rio said with a grin. “But seriously, just talk to her. You’ll feel better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will,” Alice promised, a determined glint returning to her eyes. “Soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice abruptly changed the subject. “What are you doing tonight? Do you want to catch a movie? Or a drink?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sorry I can’t, you know Sunday nights are Lilia nights.” Rio said, a smile on her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised her hands in the air. “Of course, sorry I forgot. Can you tell her to invite me next time? I miss her lasagnas.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled. “Oh, she will love to hear it. Consider yourself a guest next week.” Alice pumped her fist in the air in victory.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They spent the rest of the afternoon talking about anything and everything, the heavy tension in Alice’s shoulders slowly easing. By the time they parted ways, Alice looked more like herself, and Rio couldn’t help but feel proud of her friend.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio walked back to her apartment, she thought about how much things were shifting around her—Alice and Jen, her own tangled feelings for Agatha, and the delicate balance of her world. Change was in the air, and though it was daunting, it also felt oddly exciting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By late afternoon, Rio found herself on the familiar path to Lilia’s house. The Sunday ritual was as steady as the turning of the seasons—a quiet anchor in her otherwise hectic life. No matter how busy things got, there was always this pocket of time reserved for home-cooked meals, easy conversation, and the grounding presence of the woman who had taken her in when she’d had nowhere else to go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio arrived, Lilia was already on the porch, wiping her hands on a kitchen towel. Her face lit up when she spotted Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There’s my girl,” Lilia said warmly, pulling her into a tight hug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Lilia,” Rio replied, the tension from the week melting away at her touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The house smelled like roasted vegetables and fresh herbs, and Rio’s stomach growled in anticipation as she followed Lilia into the kitchen. The table was already set, the mismatched plates and glasses lending a charm that always made the place feel like home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How was your week?” Lilia asked as she stirred a pot on the stove.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned against the counter, stealing a piece of bread from a nearby basket and dove into the retelling of her week. Lilia listened with rapt interest, reacting when appropriate and giving advice when solicitated, while she busied herself at the counter. Rio tried to help a few times but was whisked away every time. She ended up on the high stool opposite Lilia, munching on vegetables offered to her every few minutes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they settled into dinner, the conversation flowed easily. They talked about the band’s gig, Alice’s nervous confession earlier that day, and even Rio’s academic life, though she carefully avoided mentioning Agatha again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When it was time to leave, Lilia handed her a container of leftovers, as she always did. “Take care of yourself this week, alright kid? And tell Alice I said hi.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will,” Rio promised, hugging her tightly before heading out into the night. “By the way, I told her she was invited next Sunday. She specifically asked for your lasagnas.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed. “That girl, I swear. Tell her she’s got it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With one last kiss to the cheek, Rio went on her way, tightening her jacket around her shoulder. As she walked back to campus, the streets quiet and the air crisp, Rio felt a sense of calm settle over her. Sundays with Lilia always reminded her of who she was and where she came from. And that, no matter what the week ahead might hold, she could handle it.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>           (T. S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets.)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">Monday morning came with the sharp chill of early winter creeping through the cracks of Rio’s apartment windows. She groaned as her alarm went off, pulling the blanket tighter around her. Mornings like this made her wish she didn’t have to leave the warm cocoon of her bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But duty called—there were classes to attend, papers to read, and, as always, the looming presence of her thesis demanding attention. She rolled out of bed, muttering curses under her breath, and went through her morning routine on autopilot: coffee, quick shower, and a mental pep talk in the mirror.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The campus was alive with its usual Monday bustle when Rio arrived, students hurrying to their first lectures of the week. She made her way to the English department, where she had a seminar scheduled with Agatha later in the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her first stop was the library. She found her usual corner desk and spread out her notes, her mind trying to refocus after the calm of the weekend. As much as she loved her Sundays with Lilia, it always took a little effort to transition back into the academic grind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By mid-morning, her phone buzzed with a text from Alice:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Alice</strong>: <em>How’s your Monday going? Wanna grab lunch after class?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, typing a quick reply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio</strong>: <em>Only if you bring me good gossip about Jen.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s response came almost immediately: <em>You’re relentless, Vidal.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a grin, Rio tucked her phone away and returned to her work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When it was time for Agatha’s seminar, Rio felt the familiar flutter of nerves in her stomach. She was early, as usual, and found herself lingering by the door. Students began trickling in, and finally, Agatha herself appeared, her presence commanding as always.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, everyone,” Agatha greeted as she strode into the room. Her voice had the same measured warmth that always set the tone for her classes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The seminar began, and Rio tried her best to focus on the discussion. Agatha had a way of drawing out insights from even the quietest students, her sharp intellect matched by an understated patience. Today, she spoke about the intersection of mortality and creativity in Modernist poetry—a topic that hit close to Rio’s research.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At one point, Agatha’s gaze lingered on her, and Rio felt her cheeks flush despite herself. She knew she had to speak up, if only to hide her reaction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think the idea of death as a silent collaborator in Modernist works is fascinating,” Rio said. “It’s not just a theme; it’s almost a presence, shaping the very structure of the poetry itself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips quirked into a small, approving smile. “An intriguing observation, Miss Vidal. Care to elaborate?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio spoke, she felt herself relax, the words coming more easily. Agatha listened intently, her expression thoughtful, and Rio couldn’t help but feel a quiet thrill at holding her attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the seminar ended, Rio stayed behind, pretending to organize her notes as the other students filed out. She glanced at Agatha, who was gathering her own materials, and for a brief moment, she considered saying something.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But the nerves got the better of her, and she simply said, “Thank you for the seminar, Dr. Harkness,” before hurrying out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The day wasn’t over yet, but as Rio headed to meet Alice for lunch, she couldn’t shake the warmth of Agatha’s approval or the way her heart had skipped when their eyes met.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The afternoon was heavy with the threat of rain as Rio left the library, her bag slung over one shoulder and her head buried in her notes. She barely noticed the world around her until she walked straight into someone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, sorry—” she began, looking up, only to freeze when she saw who it was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sight of her ex brought a sinking feeling to Rio’s stomach. Maya, with her perfect posture and that ever-so-slightly condescending smirk, looked like she was exactly where she wanted to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, well,” Maya said, brushing imaginary dust off her sleeve. “If it isn’t Rio Vidal. Still tripping over your own feet, I see. Weird for a so-called dancer, really.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio clenched her jaw, willing herself to stay calm. “It’s called being busy, Maya. Some of us don’t have time to linger in doorways.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya tilted her head, her smirk deepening. “Busy, huh? Is that what you’re calling it these days? I saw your little band performance the other night. Very… <em>quaint</em>.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s blood boiled, but she forced a smile. “I didn’t know you were there. I would have said hi—maybe pointed you to the exit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya let out a mock laugh. “Always the comedian. I just happened to be there with some friends. I guess it’s cute that you’re still playing at being a rock star.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s fists tightened around the strap of her bag. “What do you want, Maya?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nothing,” Maya said lightly, her eyes scanning Rio like she was a puzzle to be solved. “Just passing by and thought I’d say hi. Can’t let old times go to waste, can we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Old times are best left in the past,” Rio shot back, stepping around her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Maya wasn’t done. “You know, you’ve always been good at pretending you’re fine. But I can tell you’re still the same mess you were back then. Some things never change, do they?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hit Rio harder than she wanted to admit, but she didn’t turn back. She didn’t give Maya the satisfaction of a response, walking away with her heart pounding and her jaw clenched so tightly it hurt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time she reached her apartment, her head was spinning, and the encounter replayed in her mind like a bad song stuck on repeat. Maya had always known how to cut deep, and she still hadn’t lost her touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio dropped her bag and leaned against the kitchen counter, letting out a shaky breath. The frustration and hurt bubbled up inside her, and she knew there was only one way to deal with it tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She grabbed her phone and texted Alice:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio</strong>: <em>I need a drink. You in?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The reply came seconds later:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Alice</strong>: <em>Always. See you at the bar in 30.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled, already feeling a bit lighter. A drink, a distraction, and a little company were exactly what she needed to shake off the weight of Maya’s venomous words. Tonight, she wasn’t going to dwell—she was going to let it all go, at least for a little while.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bar was noisy, a steady hum of chatter and laughter blending with the low thrum of music, but Rio and Alice were in their own little bubble. After Maya’s harsh words, Rio had fully leaned into the evening, determined to drown the lingering bitterness in one too many drinks. Alice was being supportive, had matched her drink for drink, though she was handling it much better than Rio was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At some point, Alice’s phone buzzed loudly on the table. She glanced at the screen, her lips curling into a knowing smile as she answered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jen,” she said, her voice suddenly softer, and Rio groaned dramatically.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, come on,” Rio slurred, swirling the last remnants of her drink in its glass. “I don’t need to witness your <em>disgustingly cute</em> whatever-this-is right now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smirked, holding up a finger as she listened to Jen on the other end. “Yeah, I can come over. I’ll be there in fifteen,” she said, hanging up and pocketing her phone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow. “You’re leaving me for <em>chemistry Jen</em>?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Always,” Alice said with a teasing grin. “But seriously, are you gonna be okay getting home? You’ve had… a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine,” Rio insisted, though her words were slightly slurred. “I can totally make it back. Campus isn’t far.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice gave her a skeptical look but ultimately relented. “Text me when you’re home, okay? And don’t get into any trouble.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Trouble? Me?” Rio asked, feigning offense.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice laughed, giving her a quick hug before grabbing her coat and heading out. Rio watched her go, the realization that she was now alone hitting her in waves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wobbled slightly as she stood, grabbing her bag and heading for the door. The cold air outside was a sharp contrast to the warm haze of the bar, and it hit her like a brick wall.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, okay,” she muttered to herself, taking a deep breath and setting off in what she <em>hoped</em> was the direction of her apartment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The streets were quieter now, the occasional hum of a passing car or the rustle of leaves in the breeze her only companions. Rio’s mind was foggy, her steps uneven, but she was determined.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I got this,” she whispered, though she stumbled slightly on the curb.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her thoughts kept drifting to Maya’s words, to the sting of them and how they lingered. And then, inevitably, to Agatha—her poised, commanding professor, who seemed so far removed from the chaos of Rio’s own life. The thought of her brought a pang of something unfamiliar, something Rio wasn’t ready to name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Focus, Vidal,” she muttered, steadying herself against a lamppost.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify">The night was crisp and quiet as Agatha made her way to her car, the weight of an evening spent grading essays still heavy on her shoulders. The undergraduates’ grasp of modernist poetry had left much to be desired, and her mind swirled with a mix of exhaustion and frustration as she dug in her bag for her keys.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At first, she didn’t notice the figure on the sidewalk. A blur of unsteady motion caught the edge of her vision, someone weaving clumsily as if the very concept of a straight line was foreign to them. Agatha’s hand stilled on her bag as she turned toward the figure, her sharp eyes narrowing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused, her brow furrowing as recognition dawned. “Miss Vidal?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The woman stopped mid-step, teetering slightly as she turned toward Agatha’s voice. Recognition flickered in Rio’s glazed eyes, though it took a moment to settle. “Dr. Harkness!” she exclaimed, her voice too loud and unnervingly cheerful. She gave an uncoordinated wave, nearly overbalancing herself. “Fancy seeing you here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brow furrowed as she stepped closer, the harsh glow of a nearby streetlamp illuminating Rio’s flushed cheeks and unfocused gaze. “Miss Vidal,” she said again, her voice firmer this time. “Are you alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m <em>fine,</em>” Rio said, though the way she swayed on her feet betrayed her words. “Just… heading home. Or trying to.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crossed her arms, the sternness she reserved for particularly disruptive students creeping into her demeanor. “You don’t look fine. Have you been drinking?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked at her, her expression caught somewhere between defiance and sheepishness. “Maybe a little,” she admitted, her words slurring slightly. “Okay, maybe a lot. But, uh… it’s fine. I’m good.” She punctuated her statement with a half-hearted thumbs-up that only made her stumble further.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good is not the word I’d use,” Agatha muttered under her breath as she reached out instinctively to steady Rio, her hands firm on the younger woman’s shoulders. “You’re swaying like a tree in a storm.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I like trees,” Rio replied absently, her head lolling slightly as she looked up at the older woman. Her grin was wide but unfocused, and Agatha felt her frown deepen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” Agatha said, her tone softening as concern replaced irritation. “Where are you trying to go?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Home,” Rio mumbled, her expression briefly sobering. “But it’s… far. And the ground keeps… moving.” She gestured vaguely at the sidewalk, as though it had personally wronged her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, glancing around the empty street. The quiet was deceptive, offering no real assurance of safety. It was painfully clear that Rio wouldn’t make it home on her own in her current state. Agatha crouched slightly to meet Rio’s unfocused gaze. “Miss Vidal, do you have someone I can call? A friend, family member—someone who can come and get you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio frowned, her brow furrowing deeply as if the question required intense concentration. After a moment, she started rummaging through her bag, the effort clumsy and slow. Finally, she pulled out her phone, holding it out to Agatha with unsteady hands. “Call Lilia,” she slurred, her words stretching like syrup.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow as she took the phone, glancing down at it. “Lilia?” she repeated, her tone skeptical. “Who is Lilia?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned heavily against a nearby lamppost, her expression almost comically serious. “Lilia’s… Lilia,” she said, as though that explained everything. Her explanation—or lack thereof—was punctuated by a small hiccup that seemed to amuse her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose and exhaled through her teeth. “Of course. Very illuminating,” she muttered under her breath. Holding back the urge to lecture Rio about the consequences of her choices, she focused instead on unlocking the phone. Thankfully, Rio hadn’t set a password, a security oversight Agatha made a mental note to address later.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Scrolling through the contacts, she found one labeled simply “Lilia” and tapped the name. The phone rang twice before a warm, concerned voice answered. “Rio? Is everything alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not exactly,” Agatha replied, keeping her tone professional. “This is Dr. Agatha Harkness. I’m one of Rio’s professors. I found her trying to walk home, and… she’s quite inebriated. I was hoping you might be able to come and get her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a brief pause on the other end before the voice returned, tinged with exasperation and worry. “Oh, that girl. My car’s in the shop, so I can’t get there right now. But if you could drop her off at my place, I’d be grateful. I’m just a few blocks from campus.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, glancing at Rio, who was now humming softly to herself and swaying gently in time with music only she could hear. “Alright,” she said. “I’ll bring her to you. Can you text the address?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, I’ll send it to Rio’s phone right away. Thank you for looking out for her, Dr. Harkness,” Lilia said warmly before hanging up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The call ended, and within seconds, the phone buzzed with a message. Agatha opened it, scanning the address before tucking the phone back into Rio’s bag. She turned to Rio, who was now staring up at the lamppost like it held the secrets of the universe. “Alright, Miss Vidal,” Agatha said, placing a steadying hand on Rio’s arm. “Let’s get you to Lilia’s.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s head lolled toward her, a lazy grin spreading across her face. “You’re the best, Dr. Harkness. Did anyone ever tell you that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha huffed a quiet laugh as she began guiding Rio toward her car. “Not under these circumstances, no,” she said, unlocking the passenger door and carefully helping Rio into the seat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she buckled Rio in, the younger woman tilted her head and squinted at Agatha. “You’ve got a nice voice,” Rio said suddenly, her words drifting. “It’s like… warm tea. Or, like, a fuzzy blanket. Does that make sense?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused, caught off guard by the unexpected compliment. “I’m not sure I’d describe my voice as a fuzzy blanket,” she replied dryly, stepping back and shutting the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sliding into the driver’s seat, she glanced over at Rio, who was now leaning her head against the window, her breath fogging the glass. The drive to Lilia’s wasn’t far, but Agatha couldn’t help the lingering sense of responsibility pressing on her. Rio might have been reckless tonight, but there was something vulnerable about her that made Agatha’s usual stern demeanor soften, if only slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The drive was short, and Rio dozed lightly in the passenger seat, her head lolling against the window. When they arrived, Agatha helped her out of the car and walked her to the front door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door opened before Agatha could even knock, as if the person on the other side had been waiting. A familiar older woman stood in the doorway—the same one Agatha had seen at the dance recital, the one who had cheered so loudly and unabashedly for Rio. Her presence had been striking even then, her energy magnetic and her devotion to Rio impossible to miss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia, I presume?” Agatha said, her tone composed but curious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The woman nodded, her sharp, assessing eyes sweeping over Rio with a mix of emotions Agatha couldn’t quite parse—relief, concern, and a touch of exasperation. “That’s me,” she said, her voice steady but warm. “And you must be Dr. Harkness. Please, come in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped inside, steadying Rio as they crossed the threshold. The house was small but cozy, filled with mismatched furniture and the faint scent of lavender. A knitted throw lay draped over the back of the couch, and framed photos cluttered the walls—most of them of Rio, smiling brightly or caught mid-laugh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s get her on the couch,” Lilia said, already moving ahead of them. Agatha guided Rio to the soft cushions, lowering her down carefully. Rio let out a soft groan, her head lolling to the side as she sank into the comfort.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll grab her some water,” Lilia said briskly, disappearing into the kitchen before Agatha could offer to help. The sound of running water filled the small space, mingling with the faint hum of a heater.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha straightened, brushing a stray strand of hair from her face. Her gaze drifted to Rio, who was blinking slowly, her hands clutching at the edges of the couch as if trying to anchor herself. Despite her disheveled state, there was something childlike about the way she curled into herself, her usual fiery energy dimmed but not extinguished, as if being in this house brought out another version of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia returned moments later with a glass of water, kneeling in front of Rio. “Here, drink this,” she said, her tone firm but affectionate. She pressed the glass into Rio’s hands, steadying it when the younger woman’s grip wavered. “All of it, silly girl. You need it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pouted but obeyed, sipping slowly at first before draining the glass with a small hiccup. Lilia took it back and set it on the coffee table, her hands lingering for a moment on Rio’s knee as she studied her with a maternal intensity that made Agatha pause.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you for bringing her home,” Lilia said, finally turning to Agatha. Her voice was softer now, the initial edge of concern giving way to gratitude. “I don’t know what would’ve happened if you hadn’t found her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s no trouble,” Agatha replied, though her eyes lingered on Lilia, trying to piece together the connection between the two women. “I’m glad I was there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia sat down beside Rio, brushing a few strands of hair away from her face. “This one,” she said with a small, rueful smile. “She’s got a good heart, but she doesn’t always think things through. I swear, she’s going to be the death of me one day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio made a soft noise of protest, her eyes half-lidded as she murmured, “Not true. I’m a delight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed, the sound warm and rich. “A <em>delight</em> who can’t walk in a straight line after a few too many drinks.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha allowed herself a small smile at their exchange, though her curiosity continued to simmer beneath the surface. There was a story here, a dynamic that spoke of years of familiarity and trust. She glanced at the photos on the wall again—pictures of Rio at various ages, some with Lilia and others on her own. It was clear that Lilia wasn’t just a friend or a landlord. She was something more, though Agatha didn’t yet have the context to understand what.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha turned to leave, her hand already on the doorknob, Lilia’s voice stopped her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness,” Lilia said warmly, “would you like to stay for some tea? It’s the least I can offer after you went out of your way to bring my Rio here safely.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, her instinct to decline warring with her curiosity. It was late, and she had papers still waiting for her at home, and a babysitter to relieve. But the image of Lilia cheering so fervently for Rio at the recital lingered in her mind, along with the way Rio had immediately given her Lilia’s name. This woman clearly meant something important to her student, and Agatha couldn’t deny her interest in learning more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“If it’s not too much trouble,” Agatha finally said, stepping back inside and closing the door behind her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, the expression warm enough to melt any lingering hesitation. “Not at all. Make yourself comfortable. I’ll put the kettle on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced at Rio, who was now sprawled on the couch, clutching her glass of water like it was a lifeline. Her eyes were half-closed, her breaths slow and steady as if she were on the verge of falling asleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’ll be fine,” Lilia said as she passed through the cozy living room toward the kitchen. “She’s not a heavy drinker, so nights like these are rare. But every once in a while… Believe me, she will hear about it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a teasing affection in her words, the kind reserved for someone you cared for deeply but still wanted to shake some sense into. Agatha allowed herself a small smile and sank into an armchair opposite the couch. The room, though modest, had an undeniable warmth. Bookshelves lined one wall, crammed with everything from well-worn classics to mystery novels with eye-catching spines, lots of plants. A faint scent of lavender lingered in the air, likely from the candle flickering softly on a nearby table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her gaze wandered to the photos that adorned the walls. They were snapshots of a life lived in stages, most of them featuring Rio at various ages. In one, a teenage Rio stared at the camera with an expression that wavered between defiance and vulnerability. And then there were the ones with Lilia—a younger version of the woman standing proudly beside Rio at a high school event, or the two of them smiling in a kitchen, mid-laugh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You seem very close,” Agatha remarked, nodding toward one photo in particular—the one of teenage Rio, her arms crossed, her gaze sharp and unyielding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia appeared in the doorway, holding two steaming mugs. She followed Agatha’s gaze to the photo, her expression softening as she handed one of the mugs to her guest. “She’s a daughter to me,” Lilia said, settling into the chair opposite Agatha. “She came to me when she was sixteen. Foster care hadn’t been kind to her, but even then, she was fierce. I could tell right away she was special.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha wrapped her hands around the warm mug, leaning forward slightly. She hadn’t known that Rio had been a foster kid. “She’s never mentioned it,” she said carefully, not wanting to overstep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled, the sound carrying a mix of pride and quiet sadness. “She doesn’t like to dwell on it. Can’t say I blame her. The system… it leaves scars. But even at her worst, she had this fire in her. This refusal to give up, no matter how hard things got.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sipped her tea, leaning forward slightly. “It sounds like you’ve been the steady presence she needed. That’s rare for someone who’s been through the system.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smile widened, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I’d like to think so. I tried to give her a home, stability… the kind of love she should’ve had from the start. But…” Her voice softened, and her fingers idly traced the edge of her mug. “Sometimes I wonder how much she’s let me in, even after all these years. She’s got this wall, you know? She lets you close, but not too close.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her gaze drifting back to Rio, who now seemed fast asleep. “I’ve seen that wall,” she admitted. “In class, she’s sharp and confident, but sometimes it feels like she’s holding something back.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia sighed, her expression distant for a moment before she refocused on Agatha. “That’s Rio. She’s brilliant, stubborn, and so full of potential it makes me ache sometimes. But she’s also carrying things she doesn’t know how to put down. I just do my best to be here for her, whether she asks for it or not.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s respect for Lilia deepened as she listened. There was a quiet strength to her, a resilience born from years of shouldering the role of caretaker for someone who had likely resisted being cared for at all. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve done more for her than most would,” Agatha said finally, her voice gentle but firm. “That kind of consistency… it matters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled again, this time with a touch of gratitude. “Thank you, Dr. Harkness. That means a lot, coming from you. She’s told me about you before, you know. Said you’re one of the few people who sees her potential.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, surprised. “She said that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She wouldn’t admit it outright, of course,” Lilia said with a small laugh. “But I know her well enough to read between the lines.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a pause, the warmth of the tea in Agatha’s hands grounding her as she hesitated to ask her next question. “Do you have children of your own?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyes flickered with a trace of something unspoken, but her smile remained kind. “No. Rio is the closest I’ve had to that. She’s enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded slowly, sensing there was more beneath Lilia’s words, but she chose not to pry. Instead, Lilia shifted the conversation with a curious tilt of her head. “And you?” she asked, her gaze inquisitive but warm. “You mentioned being her professor, but do you have children, Dr. Harkness?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do,” Agatha replied, her voice softening instinctively, as it always did when she spoke about her son. “A boy. Nicky. He’s six.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At that, Lilia’s face lit with recognition, her smile broadening. “Of course! Rio mentioned him after the recital. She couldn’t stop talking about how charming he is and how much she enjoys teaching his class. She said he was quite the star that day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small, genuine smile tugged at Agatha’s lips, and for a moment, the stern professor façade fell away. “He’s quite taken with her as well. I’ve never seen him so excited for a class before. It’s all ‘Miss Vidal this’ and ‘Miss Vidal that’ at home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That doesn’t surprise me,” Lilia said, her tone warm. “Rio has a way with children. I think it’s because she remembers what it was like not to have that kind of connection growing up. She doesn’t just teach them—she sees them.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her fingers tapping lightly against her mug. “That’s a rare gift,” she said, her tone contemplative.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It is,” Lilia agreed. Her lips curved into a teasing smile as she added, “And she mentioned you were there at the recital. Sitting right up front, cheering Nicky on like the proudest mom in the room.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A faint flush crept up Agatha’s neck, but she maintained her composed exterior, sipping her tea before responding. “It was a lovely performance,” she said simply, though the hint of a smile betrayed her fondness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled knowingly but didn’t press the matter further. Instead, she glanced down at Rio, who had shifted slightly in her sleep, her brow furrowing as if caught in a dream. Lilia reached over, brushing a stray curl from Rio’s face with a tenderness that didn’t go unnoticed by Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s quite lucky to have you,” Agatha said softly, her gaze lingering on the scene before her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, her hand still resting lightly on Rio’s shoulder. “I’m the lucky one,” she said simply. “Like I told you, Rio came to me when she was sixteen. She just needed someone to believe in her. That’s all it takes sometimes—to know someone has your back, even when you don’t believe in yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly around the mug as she absorbed Lilia’s words. “She’s very bright,” she offered after a moment, her tone carrying genuine admiration. “Her ideas for her thesis are some of the most compelling I’ve read in years. She has a way of thinking that’s… different. Unique.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s face lit up with pride, her eyes glimmering with the kind of joy that only came from hearing someone recognize the person you love most. “She’s always had a way of seeing things others don’t,” Lilia said. “But she’s hard on herself. Too hard sometimes. She carries so much pressure to prove herself, and I just wish she could see what I see in her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, taking another sip of tea. She had seen that same relentless drive in Rio—her sharp wit, her thoughtful insights, and, beneath it all, a vulnerability that surfaced in fleeting, unguarded moments.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And you?” Lilia asked, tilting her head slightly, her gaze steady and curious. “Why did you go out of your way tonight? You didn’t have to.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, caught slightly off guard by the directness of the question. Her instinct was to give a polite, professional answer, something distant and detached. But something in Lilia’s tone—gentle but probing—made her reconsider.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I would’ve done the same for any of my students,” she began carefully, though even as she said it, the words didn’t sit right. She paused, glancing at Rio, who was still curled up on the couch, her breathing soft and even. “But… Rio is different. She has a spark, a presence. It’s hard not to notice her. Hard not to care.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s lips curved into a knowing smile, and she let out a quiet chuckle. “She has that effect on people,” she said, her voice warm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room settled into a comfortable silence, the only sounds the faint hum of the heater and the occasional soft rustle as Rio shifted in her sleep. Agatha cradled her mug, the tea’s warmth radiating through her hands, grounding her in a way she hadn’t expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I saw you at the recital,” Agatha said after a moment, breaking the quiet. She set her mug down on the coffee table, her gaze flicking to Lilia. “You were cheering for her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s expression softened, a fondness brightening her eyes. “Of course I was,” she said simply. “She worked so hard with those kids. Seeing her up there—performing, teaching, thriving—it’s everything I hoped for her. She’s built a life she can be proud of, and I’ll never stop cheering her on for that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt an unexpected warmth spread in her chest at Lilia’s words. There was something so genuine, so unwavering about the way she spoke of Rio. It reminded Agatha of her own quiet pride for Nicky, of the way she’d cheer him on in anything he chose to do.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She really is lucky to have you,” Agatha repeated, her voice quieter now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia shook her head with a soft laugh, her gaze drifting to Rio. “I think I’m the lucky one. She’s taught me more than I could ever teach her. Resilience, courage, how to find joy even when life tries to take it from you.” She glanced back at Agatha, her expression thoughtful. “She doesn’t let many people in, you know. So if she’s let you see even a fraction of who she really is, that means something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, unsure how to respond to that. She glanced at Rio again, noting the way her features had softened in sleep, the usual intensity of her expression replaced with a rare, peaceful vulnerability.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a moment, Lilia broke the silence. “She really did mention you, you know,” she said, her tone light but carrying an undercurrent of meaning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Did she?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, yes,” Lilia said with a sly smile. “She talks about you more than she realizes. Always with that mix of frustration and admiration that tells me you’re someone she respects. Even if she’d never admit it outright.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft laugh, shaking her head. “That sounds about right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyes gleamed with amusement. “Rio’s a handful, but she’s worth it. She just needs people in her life who see her for who she is, not who she tries to be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words lingered in the air, settling into Agatha’s mind like a seed waiting to grow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After they finished their tea, Agatha rose to leave, thanking Lilia for the hospitality.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you again, Dr. Harkness,” Lilia said as she walked her to the door. “For everything. For looking out for her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please,” Agatha said, offering a small smile. “Call me Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, her expression softening. “Agatha, then. I hope this won’t be the last time we see you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha inclined her head in acknowledgment before stepping out into the cool night air. As she made her way to her car, she couldn’t shake the feeling that tonight had been more than just a favor for a student. She had stepped into a deeper layer of Rio Vidal’s world—a world that was raw, complex, and unexpectedly captivating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sliding into the driver’s seat, Agatha allowed herself a rare moment of reflection. She hadn’t anticipated Rio becoming anything more than a name on her roster, another bright mind in a sea of students. But now, she wasn’t so sure. There was something about Rio—about her resilience, her fire, and the people who cared for her—that intrigued Agatha more than she cared to admit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as she drove away, the faint glow of Lilia’s porch light fading in her rearview mirror, she found herself quietly determined to understand that spark even more.</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>    (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The next day, as Agatha stood in front of the lecture hall, she noticed that something was off. Rio Vidal, usually so focused and engaged, sat at the back of the room with her gaze fixed on the desk in front of her, her posture slumped in a way that suggested she was miles away. Her usual sharp, perceptive eyes were dull, and she didn’t seem to be following the discussion as she usually did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes lingered on her for a moment before she refocused on the material at hand. She could feel the shift in the air, an unspoken tension in the room. While she’d always prided herself on being able to read her students, Rio had never been one to wear her emotions so openly, but today it was undeniable—something was wrong.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tried to keep her thoughts on the lecture, but her mind kept drifting back to Rio. Was she still affected by the night before, by the events at the bar – that she wasn’t sure she could remember much considering the state she had found her in -  and their conversation afterwards? Agatha wasn’t sure, but she could sense a change, an undercurrent of something more than just the usual tiredness from a long week.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After class ended, as students filed out, Agatha approached Rio, who was gathering her things slowly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” she said gently, her voice low enough not to draw attention. “Is everything all right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze for a moment, her hand hovering over her notebook. She looked up at Agatha, her expression guarded, before she forced a small smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, I’m fine,” she said, her voice softer than usual. “Just… a bit tired.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t buy it, but she didn’t press. She gave Rio a long, searching look. “If you need to talk, you know where to find me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Rio just stared at her, as if considering something, but then she nodded, closing her bag and standing up. “Thanks, Dr. Harkness,” she muttered before quickly walking out of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched her go, a sense of unease settling in her chest. She had a feeling Rio was far from fine, and it troubled her more than she wanted to admit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that day, as the campus quieted down, Rio found herself standing outside Agatha’s office. She had been thinking about it all afternoon—about the way she had acted last Friday night, about the lingering looks and the conversation that had felt too personal, too much. She felt embarrassed for her behavior, for inviting her professor to something as trivial as a band gig, for the way it had all felt too much like… well, something else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Taking a deep breath, she knocked on the door, her stomach twisting with nerves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come in,” Agatha’s voice called from inside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio entered, her heart racing, trying to muster some composure. Agatha was sitting at her desk, scribbling on a piece of paper. She looked up when Rio stepped in, her eyes soft but curious, like she was expecting her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” Agatha said, her voice warm but still formal. “What can I do for you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, gathering her words. “I just… I wanted to apologize for Friday night and inviting you,” she said, her voice quieter than usual. “I don’t know what I was thinking, really. I guess I got a little carried away.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha set down her pen and leaned back in her chair, her gaze thoughtful. “There’s no need to apologize, Rio. You didn’t do anything wrong.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable,” Rio continued, her hands fidgeting with the strap of her bag. “I know I probably crossed some boundaries.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at her, something unreadable in her expression, before she spoke again, her voice gentle but firm. “I don’t think you crossed any boundaries, Miss Vidal. It’s clear that you’re passionate about what you do, and it’s always nice to see a student so… alive, I suppose.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her heart thud in her chest at the unexpected softness in Agatha’s voice. She didn’t know if it was relief or something else, but the tension in her shoulders eased just a little.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I guess I just… I wasn’t sure if it was appropriate to invite you, or if you even wanted to go,” Rio admitted, her gaze dropping to the floor. “I didn’t want it to be weird or anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened, and she stood up from her desk, walking around to the other side where Rio stood. “It wasn’t weird,” she said, her voice low. “And I’m glad you invited me. I think sometimes we forget that there’s a person behind the title, behind the role of ‘professor.’”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, but she was still unsure. “I just… I didn’t want to make things awkward between us. I know I’m your student, and I don’t want to make anything feel strange.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused for a moment, considering her words carefully. “Rio,” she said, her voice calm but with a trace of something more genuine beneath it, using her first name for the first time, “we are all more than just the roles we play. And if anything, I admire your confidence. You don’t need to apologize for being yourself. But if you ever feel uncomfortable or if you feel like you’ve crossed a line, just let me know. I want this to be a space where you feel comfortable to learn and grow, not to feel constrained by fear.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, her heart stuttering slightly at Agatha’s words. She wasn’t used to such openness from someone in her position—especially not from someone like Agatha, who had always seemed so composed, so distant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll… try not to overthink things so much,” Rio said, a small smile tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a small, understanding smile in return. “We all overthink things sometimes. But you’re doing just fine, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a brief moment, their eyes met, and Rio felt something stir inside her, an odd mixture of relief and confusion. It was hard to tell if it was just the weight of the day lifting or something else entirely, but for once, she didn’t mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Dr. Harkness,” Rio said, her voice quieter now, more assured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Anytime,” Agatha replied, her gaze lingering on her for just a moment longer than usual before she turned back to her desk, signaling the end of the conversation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment, standing in the doorway, before she took a deep breath and stepped back into the conversation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, and… I also wanted to apologize for last night,” she said, her voice quieter than before, almost sheepish. “I didn’t mean to put you in that position. I know it must have been uncomfortable for you, having to take me home when I was so… drunk. I didn’t even realize how out of control I was.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened, and she didn’t look upset, just calm. “You don’t need to apologize for that, Rio. It wasn’t a problem either, I’d rather have you safe with me, than alone and vulnerable in the streets.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Rio pressed on, her gaze dropping to the floor, her words tumbling out. “I just… I don’t know why I let myself get so drunk. I don’t want you to think… I don’t know. That I don’t know how to handle myself, or that I’m some kind of mess. I don’t want you to see me like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back in her chair, considering Rio’s words carefully. Her voice was measured, calm, and yet there was something softer in it now. “Everyone has moments where they lose control, Rio. It’s part of being human. And it’s not about how we fall, but how we get back up. Besides, it wasn’t an imposition. I just made sure you got home safely. It didn’t even take that long.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised her eyes to meet Agatha’s, seeing nothing but understanding there, no judgment. “I appreciate that,” Rio said quietly. “I didn’t want to put you out, and I definitely didn’t want you to think badly of me. I don’t usually get like that, but… it was just a rough night, and I guess I couldn’t handle it well.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled faintly at the rambling, a touch of warmth in her expression. “It happens to the best of us. You don’t need to apologize. We all have our moments. Just be kind to yourself, Rio. You’ve got enough on your plate without carrying guilt around for things you can’t control.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a weight lift from her shoulders as Agatha’s words sank in. She nodded slowly, a quiet sense of relief settling over her. “Thanks, Dr. Harkness. That means a lot. Really.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re welcome,” Agatha replied with a small smile, her gaze lingering on Rio for a moment longer before she turned back to her desk, a silent signal that the conversation was coming to an end, this time for good.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a deep breath and, for the first time in days, felt something akin to peace. She had apologized for her mistakes, and Agatha, in her usual composed way, had handled it with nothing but grace and kindness. For all the uncertainty she’d been feeling lately, something about Agatha’s calm, reassuring presence made Rio feel like things could be okay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio left the office with a sense of quiet gratitude, still uncertain about the path ahead but feeling, for the first time in a while, that perhaps she wasn’t as alone in this as she had felt before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next day, as Rio and Alice sat down at their usual spot in the campus café for lunch, Alice wasted no time in asking the question that had been on her mind since the night before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, how did you get home after you left to go to Jen’s?” Alice asked, eyeing Rio with a mischievous glint in her eyes. “I was half-expecting you to end up passed out in the bar, and you didn’t answer my text asking if you made it home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze for a second, her spoon paused midair as she glanced at Alice. She hadn’t expected the question so directly, and a slight flush crept up her neck. She hesitated, unsure how much she should say. After all, it had been an eventful night, and now that she thought about it, it felt like a lifetime ago.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I… um,” Rio started, but she didn’t get very far before Alice’s teasing tone continued.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wait, don’t tell me you walked home drunk? That’s an accident waiting to happen!” Alice pressed, leaning forward, clearly feeling guilty about having left her friend to fend for herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a breath, running a hand through her hair. “No, actually… it wasn’t like that. I got… uh, help. Dr. Harkness, actually,” she said, her voice a little quieter now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Wait—what? She took you home?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio muttered, her face reddening even more. “She found me on my way home. I… I was very drunk. And, I guess I wasn’t doing too well walking, so she called Lilia for me and drove me to her place.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice sat back in her chair, her grin widening. “So, your professor… took you home? That’s… unexpected.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned and buried her face in her hands for a moment. “It was embarrassing. I was all over the place. I couldn’t even walk straight.” She could feel the awkwardness rising up in her chest again. “I just don’t want her to think badly of me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice chuckled, trying to stifle her laughter. “Oh, Rio, that’s actually kind of cute. I mean, Dr. Harkness is all cool and composed, and then here she is, taking care of you like you’re a damsel in distress.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, well, I didn’t want to make it a thing,” Rio muttered. “But she was really kind about it. I guess… I guess I was lucky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Kind about it?” Alice asked, her tone teasing. “Oh, I’m sure she was. I mean, if my professor took me home to my pseudo mom after a night of getting plastered, I’d probably never be able to look them in the eye again.” She leaned in closer. “So, tell me—did anything else happen? Did she stay with you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nearly choked on her drink at Alice’s comment, but she quickly recovered. “No! Nothing like that. She just dropped me off at Lilia’s and made sure I was okay before she left. I think they talked a little, but I think I passed out on the couch.” Rio added, hiding her face in her hands in embarrassment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice eyed her suspiciously, a mischievous smirk tugging at her lips. “Sure, sure. I’m not buying it. Guess, I’ll have to ask Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes. “I swear, Alice, she was just being… nice. Nothing happened. I think she just didn’t want me to do something stupid.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice didn’t look convinced, but she let out a sigh, clearly enjoying teasing Rio but deciding to back off for the moment. “Alright, alright. I’m not going to push. But it’s kind of sweet, in a weird way, don’t you think? Your professor looking out for you like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged, though inside, she felt a twinge of warmth at the thought. “I guess. It’s just… I didn’t expect it. I didn’t expect her to be so… kind. It’s not how I imagined her at all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice gave her a knowing look. “I mean, I’ve always said you had a thing for strong, capable women.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes again, though she couldn’t help the small, involuntary smile that tugged at her lips. “Stop it. It’s not like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. “Sure, Rio. Whatever you say.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For the rest of lunch, Alice continued to tease Rio about the unexpected encounter, but Rio couldn’t shake the image of Agatha from her mind. The way she had helped her, the way she had seemed so genuinely concerned without making it weird. For a moment, she felt… something she couldn’t quite place, and it made her a little uneasy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, she couldn’t deny the fact that it was nice to feel cared for, even if it came from an unexpected source.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio was finishing her lunch with Alice, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out to see Lilia’s name on the screen. With a quick glance at Alice, she answered, holding the phone to her ear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Lilia,” Rio said, her voice light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, kiddo,” Lilia’s familiar warm tone greeted her. “How are you feeling today? Better after last night?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples slightly. “Yeah, much better,” she replied, trying to sound casual. “I’m not exactly proud of myself, but… yeah, I’m good now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled on the other end of the line. “I imagine not. It’s not every day your professor has to play the role of designated driver. But I’m glad you’re okay. That was quite the… situation, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio winced, feeling the blush creep up again. “Yeah, a situation. I didn’t mean to make it a big deal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You didn’t make it a big deal,” Lilia reassured her. “You just had a rough night. You’re allowed to, you know? We all have our moments. Next time, maybe just give me a heads up, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled faintly at the reassurance, grateful for Lilia’s always soothing presence. “Thanks, I’ll try. And thanks for everything last night. I know it wasn’t your night and you might have had other plans.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It wasn’t a problem, Rio,” Lilia said, her voice soft but firm. “I’m always here for you. Don’t forget that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s throat tightened slightly at the words. “I won’t,” she whispered, feeling the sincerity of Lilia’s care. “I really appreciate it, Lilia. I don’t know what I would’ve done without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, you don’t have to figure that out,” Lilia said with a laugh. “I’ve got your back. Now, I’ll let you go, but if you need anything else, call me, okay? I’ll be around.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Rio said, her voice thick with gratitude. “Thanks again. I’ll talk to you soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Take care, sweetheart,” Lilia replied before the call ended.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio hung up the phone, she looked over at Alice, who had been silently watching the conversation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You okay?” Alice asked, her voice softer now. “Are you in trouble with Lilia?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, a smile tugging at her lips. “Yeah. Just… I don’t know. It’s been a lot, you know? But no, Lilia’s been pretty cool about the whole thing. She knows I know how much trouble she got it when <em>she</em> was my age.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice gave her a knowing look. “That sounds like Lilia. But hey, you’ve got people who care about you, Rio. That’s what matters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a small breath, feeling a mix of relief and something else. “I guess so.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her phone buzzed again, this time a text from Lilia: <em>Remember, if you need to talk, I’m here anytime.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio read it and smiled before putting her phone down. “I know,” she murmured quietly to herself, grateful for the people in her life who made sure she wasn’t alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, after the day’s work was done and the house was quiet, Agatha sat in her study, surrounded by papers and books that usually occupied her attention. But tonight, her mind kept drifting away from the academic concerns she usually buried herself in. Her thoughts kept returning to Rio—specifically, to everything Lilia had revealed to her last night once she had been sure Rio was safe and sound.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The conversation had started innocuously enough, with Lilia offering tea after Agatha had dropped Rio off. But as they spoke, Lilia had offered pieces of information that Agatha hadn’t expected. She had learned about Rio’s past—about the foster care system, had gotten a glimpse of the challenges she had faced growing up, and how Lilia had been the one constant in Rio’s life when so much had been unstable. She had also mentioned the close relationship Rio had with her, the kind of support Lilia had offered her over the years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just the facts of Rio’s past that lingered in Agatha’s mind, but the way Lilia spoke of her. There was a warmth in her voice when she talked about Rio, a kind of quiet pride in how far Rio had come despite the odds stacked against her. It made Agatha’s thoughts about Rio deepen, and the softening of her usual skepticism towards people, especially students, became evident.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was something in the way Rio carried herself, even when she wasn’t aware of it. A vulnerability hidden under a layer of strength. Agatha had always admired resilience, but something about Rio was different. The way she handled herself in the classroom, how she had been so unguarded when she’d had to rely on her that night. It was all adding up to a picture that Agatha hadn’t fully understood until now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sipped her tea, letting the warmth of the cup settle in her hands, her thoughts circling back to last night, when she had ended up taking Rio home. The image of Rio, unsteady and apologetic, still lingered in her mind. It wasn’t just the way Rio had looked, disoriented and yet trusting towards her in her inebriation. It was how she had trusted her enough to let her take control of the situation, even when it must have felt like she was losing control of herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha had seen it before in her work as a professor—students who seemed so composed on the outside, but who hid so much beneath the surface. Rio wasn’t like that, she was much more than a broken little thing hiding behind a mask. There was a fragility to her, something raw and real that Agatha couldn’t ignore. And now, with everything Lilia had shared, Agatha found herself thinking about Rio in ways she hadn’t expected. She found herself wondering about the story behind Rio’s quiet strength, what it was that had shaped her into the woman she was today.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The more she thought about it, the more Agatha realized that Rio had intrigued her long before their awkward encounter that night. The way Rio’s eyes had glimmered with something more when she had shared her research, how fiercely she defended her ideas in class, even when she wasn’t sure of herself, the way she had been so confident on stage. Agatha could sense there was more to her, more layers waiting to be peeled back. And that fascinated her more than she cared to admit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She leaned back in her chair, the quiet stillness of the house surrounding her, and she allowed herself a rare moment of introspection. She tried to push away the flicker of something else she was feeling—a spark that she hadn’t expected to feel toward one of her students. It was a dangerous thought, one that she didn’t have time to entertain, but it was there, lurking at the edges of her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A student was a student even if they were grown adults, and Agatha knew the boundaries she had to maintain. She knew how easy it could be to let herself get swept up in the fascination of someone like Rio. She wasn’t a young woman anymore, and she had responsibilities—both as a professor and as a mother. The thought of mixing personal feelings with professional ones was something she couldn’t allow herself. But still, as she set her empty tea cup down and gazed out the window into the dark night, she couldn’t deny the strange pull Rio had on her, one that had only intensified over time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She pushed her thoughts away, turning back to the work that waited for her. But in the back of her mind, Rio’s name echoed faintly, like a song she couldn’t forget.</p><p align="justify">

</p><p align="justify">      (T.S. Eliot. “East Coker.” Four Quartets.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The day had been long, drawn out by an exhausting lecture and the endless trickle of students filtering through her office hours. By the time Agatha finished responding to the last question, closed her laptop, and leaned back in her chair, she finally allowed herself a moment to breathe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, like an ill-timed punchline, reality set in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The conference.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She was supposed to leave early the next morning for a day-long event—something that had been etched into her schedule for weeks. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was that her carefully laid plans had just fallen apart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her usual babysitter had canceled at the last minute. And Wanda, reliable as she was, was completely swamped with her own work commitments and had already sent her twins to their grandparents on her husband’s side. Agatha had already run through every other viable option—colleagues who owed her favors, friends who had helped in the past—but each possibility collapsed under scrutiny.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a logistical nightmare, one she had neither the time nor the energy to deal with. She pinched the bridge of her nose, exhaling sharply as she turned the problem over in her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, quite suddenly, a name surfaced.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hesitated, considering the potential awkwardness of the situation. It wasn’t exactly professional to ask a student to babysit your child. But she was desperate, and there wasn’t anyone else. Plus, there had been something in Rio’s demeanor, her presence, that made Agatha feel like she could trust her with Nicky. The memory of the way she had reassured him before the recital only comforted her in the thought that Rio might be the person she needed.  </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The thought of asking her made Agatha’s stomach churn with a combination of reluctance and, unexpectedly, a small tinge of hope.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a sigh, Agatha gathered her papers and walked out of her office. The hallway was quiet, the last of the students trickling out for the day as she began her search for her student. She spotted Rio at the end of a corridor, making her way toward the library. Agatha hesitated for only a second before speaking out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” Agatha called out, her voice carrying just enough authority to catch Rio’s attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned, a bit surprised to hear her name. “Dr. Harkness?” she said, pausing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed the distance between them with careful, measured steps, aware of how strange this request was—how personal. <em>How unprofessional</em>. But she was out of options.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I hope I’m not catching you at a bad time,” Agatha began, trying to sound casual despite the awkwardness. “But I have a rather unusual request, and I understand if it’s too much, but I’m in a bit of a bind.” She paused, glancing around to make sure no one was within earshot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m attending a conference tomorrow, and my regular babysitter is unavailable. Nicky is a bit too young to stay home alone, and my friend Wanda has work commitments she can’t change. I was wondering…” She hesitated, feeling a strange nervousness building up. “Would you be willing to watch him for a few hours tomorrow evening? Because he already knows you and everything. Just until I’m back.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, clearly taken aback by the request. For a moment, she wasn’t sure she had heard Agatha right. Babysitting? For Agatha’s son?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mind stumbled over itself for a moment, trying to process the sheer <em>domesticity</em> of the request. She had, of course, always liked Nicky—he was a sweet kid, funny and bright. She had felt oddly protective of him ever since the recital, when she had seen just how much he idolized his mother. And it wasn’t as if she had plans tomorrow night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still. This was <em>Dr. Harkness</em>. Asking <em>her</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for half a second too long, and Agatha took it as a refusal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I understand if you’re uncomfortable with it,” she said quickly, her voice carefully neutral. “I know it’s an unusual request, and I wouldn’t normally put a student in this position, but given the circumstances—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll do it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words tumbled out of Rio’s mouth before her brain had fully caught up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “You—really?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, finding her footing now. “Yeah. It’s no problem. I mean, I teach kids, I’ve been around them my whole life. Nicky’s great—I’d be happy to help.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Something in Agatha’s posture softened just slightly. Relief flickered over her face, though she still looked vaguely surprised that Rio had agreed so readily.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s… very kind of you,” she said, her voice quieter now. “Are you sure? It’s not an imposition?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, shoving her hands into her pockets. “If it was, I wouldn’t have said yes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a slow breath, the tension in her shoulders finally easing for the first time all day. She hadn’t realized just how much stress she’d been carrying until now—until Rio’s quiet, easy agreement lifted the weight of her unsolvable dilemma.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Rio,” she said, and for once, there was no strict professionalism in her tone, just genuine relief. “I really appreciate it. You’re saving me in a big way. I’ll send you the details and make sure Nicky has everything he needs.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, still processing how this turn of events had happened, offered a small smile. “No problem. I’ll bring him home after dance class.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a curt nod, but something in her expression softened at Rio’s words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“If you give me your number, I’ll text you later with the address,” she said, pulling out her own phone. “And if anything comes up, just let me know. Thank you again. I owe you one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for only a second before handing over her phone, her pulse skipping unreasonably fast as Agatha typed in her number. When Rio took it back, she glanced at the new contact—<em>A. Harkness</em>. Professional. No unnecessary familiarity. It suited Agatha perfectly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, Agatha gave a small nod and turned to leave, her sharp heels clicking softly against the floor as she disappeared down the corridor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood frozen for a moment, staring at the contact name on her screen as if it might suddenly change into something else. What the hell just happened?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Babysitting. For Agatha Harkness’s kid. Tomorrow night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The thought was so bizarre she almost laughed out loud. Of all the ways she had imagined being around Agatha outside of class, <em>this</em> was not even remotely on the list. And yet…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio slipped her phone back into her pocket and walked toward the exit, her mind still reeling. A part of her was nervous—not about taking care of Nicky, but about what it meant to be invited, however indirectly, into Agatha’s <em>personal</em> life.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Because that’s what this was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This wasn’t office hours, or a lecture hall, or an academic discussion. This was her, stepping into Agatha’s world in a way she never had before. She would be in her home, trusted with the one person Agatha seemed to truly let her guard down for.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled as she pushed open the doors and stepped outside into the crisp evening air. <em>Not what I expected when I started my PhD,</em> she thought wryly, shoving her hands into her jacket pockets.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But somehow, it felt… right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By late afternoon the next day, as the golden light of the setting sun streamed through the dance center’s tall windows, Rio found herself slipping into the familiar rhythm of teaching. It was muscle memory by now—guiding her students through their warm-ups, offering corrections with steady hands, and watching as they slowly but surely grasped the movements.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wasn’t the one teaching the little ones’ class today, instead have been scheduled for the junior team.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But beneath her usual focus, something else hummed in the back of her mind. The rest of her evening stretched ahead like uncharted territory. Babysitting Agatha Harkness’s son wasn’t something she had ever imagined herself doing, but somehow, it felt strangely fitting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As her class wrapped up, Rio rolled her shoulders, the familiar ache of a good teaching session settling in. She waved off her last student and made her way toward the entrance of the studio, where she was supposed to pick up Nicky from his own class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She spotted him before he saw her—a small bundle of energy, bouncing on his feet as he chatted animatedly with his other dance instructor. The moment his eyes landed on her, his entire face lit up with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio!” Nicky’s voice rang through the space as he practically launched himself toward her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, crouching down to his level. “Hey there, buddy. How was class today? What did you learn?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes sparkled as he held up a brightly colored ribbon. “We did a dance with ribbons! Look! Miss Geraldine even said I could keep it!” He twirled it through the air, his tiny feet bouncing in place as he eagerly demonstrated the movement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, genuinely delighted by his enthusiasm. “Wow, that’s amazing! You’ve got some serious skills. Keep this up, and you’re going to be an incredible dancer one day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He beamed at her praise, stuffing the ribbon into his bag before reaching for her hand. “Ready to go home?” she asked, giving his fingers a light squeeze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah! Let’s go!” he chirped, swinging their joined hands as they made their way to the parking lot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they strolled through the parking lot, Rio reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone, quickly dialing Agatha’s number. The call connected after just a couple of rings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hello, Dr. Harkness, it’s Rio,” she said, adjusting her grip on Nicky’s hand as he swung their arms back and forth. “Nicky just finished his dance class, and we’re heading to your place now. We’ll be there soon. Just thought I should keep you updated.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s voice came through the speaker, lower than usual, as if she were whispering. “Thank you so much, Rio. I really appreciate this. You’re helping me out more than you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio could hear the faint murmur of voices in the background, no doubt the conference still in full swing. Agatha sounded tired but composed, her usual precise articulation softened by what Rio could only assume was exhaustion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No problem at all,” Rio replied easily, giving Nicky’s hand a small squeeze. “We’re going to have a great time, right, Nicky?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The little boy perked up. “Yeah! It’s going to be so fun!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, before turning her attention back to the call. “So don’t worry about a thing. Focus on your conference, and we’ll see you when you get back.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled a breath that almost sounded relieved. “I should be home quite late, but I’ll try not to wake Nicky when I get in.” There was a small pause before she added, more sincerely, “Thank you again, Rio. Truly.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Something about the way she said it sent a warmth through Rio’s chest. She pushed it aside, keeping her tone light. “It’s really no trouble. Nicky’s great company.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hummed in acknowledgment before they said their goodbyes. As Rio tucked her phone away, she glanced down at Nicky, who was still beaming up at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Was that Mama?” he asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yup,” Rio confirmed as they reached the car. “She says she’ll be home late, but we’ll have fun in the meantime.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded, seemingly unbothered. “That’s okay! Can we watch a movie later?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll see, buddy. First, let’s get home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio helped him into the car seat Agatha had lent her for the occasion, making sure the straps were secure before climbing into the driver’s seat. As she started the car and pulled out onto the road, she felt an odd mix of emotions settle over her—excitement, nerves, and something else she couldn’t quite place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe it was just the novelty of it all. Spending an evening with Nicky, in Agatha’s home, stepping just a little further into a world that had always felt just out of reach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From the backseat, Nicky swung his legs and asked, “Are we going to see Mama soon?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Probably not tonight, kiddo. She will be here when you wake up tomorrow, though.” Rio answered, hoping that it wouldn’t trigger a meltdown from the little boy. The child was surprisingly fine with the idea of spending the evening with only Rio. “And I bet she’ll be happy to hear about your ribbon dance!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed. “Yeah, Mama’s going to love it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled. “I think so too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> The drive to the Harkness’ house took about twenty minutes, during which Nicky talked nonstop, filling the car with his animated chatter. He told Rio all about his ribbon dance, his favorite part of class, and even a detailed account of a squirrel he had seen outside the dance studio earlier that day. Rio nodded along, chiming in at all the right moments, finding his enthusiasm strangely grounding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she pulled into the driveway, she took a moment to take in the house in front of her. It was big but not ostentatious—modern, sleek, yet still warm in a way that made it feel like a home rather than just a house. The glow of the porch light cast a soft hue over the front steps, and Rio could see potted plants arranged neatly along the windowsill. It was exactly the kind of place she would have imagined for Agatha—put together but lived-in, elegant but practical.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as Rio unbuckled him, Nicky wriggled out of his seat and sprinted toward the front door, bouncing on the balls of his feet as he waited for her. She followed at a more measured pace, fishing the spare key Agatha had given her this morning out of her pocket. Unlocking someone else’s front door felt oddly intimate, but she pushed the thought aside and turned the key.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, in you go, Nicky,” Rio said, stepping inside and flicking on the hall light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t hesitate, practically vibrating with energy as he tugged at her sleeve. “Can we do something fun, Miss Rio?” he asked, his eyes wide with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, crouching down to his level as she helped him unbutton his coat. “You know, you can just call me Rio when we’re not at the studio. All my friends call me that, and you’re my friend, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed. “Yeah! I’m your friend, Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hung up his coat and set her own bag down near the door. “So, what do you want to do?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky scrunched up his nose, clearly giving the question deep consideration. After a dramatic pause, he gasped. “Can we make cookies?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed. “Cookies? You got it. Let’s get the kitchen ready.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes!” Nicky cheered, already darting ahead. His enthusiasm was infectious, and Rio found herself grinning as she followed him toward the kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio stepped further into Agatha’s home, she was struck by the contrast between this space and the one she usually associated with her professor. Agatha’s office, with its shelves of carefully arranged books and its cool, intellectual air, had always felt slightly untouchable—like stepping into a place where emotions were secondary to thought. But here, in the quiet glow of her house, Agatha’s world unfolded in an entirely new way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The warmth of the space wrapped around Rio almost immediately. Soft lighting cast a golden hue over the wooden floors and plush furniture, and there was an unmistakable feeling of lived-in comfort. A few small toys were scattered across the floor near the couch, evidence of a child’s imagination left mid-adventure. On the mantle above the fireplace, a framed photo of Agatha and Nicky caught Rio’s eye—Agatha, mid-laugh, holding Nicky close as he grinned at the camera. She looked so different from the sharp, enigmatic professor Rio had grown used to. Softer. Happier.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart Riot a little faster, but not in a nervous way. She felt oddly comfortable here, especially with Nicky pulling her into the kitchen to help with cookies.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky chattered excitedly in the kitchen, Rio couldn’t help but feel a quiet admiration for Agatha. She had expected her life to be neat and composed, something orderly and intellectual, but seeing Agatha with Nicky, with the way she balanced work and motherhood, made Rio feel like she had only seen half of the woman she was. It made Agatha feel more real. Rio found herself wanting to learn more about that part of her, to understand how the brilliant, commanding professor could be so effortlessly tender with her son.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced around the house once more, taking it all in—the toys, the books, the subtle signs of a life well-lived, and felt a quiet sense of peace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio followed the excited boy into the spacious kitchen. The space was as stylish as the rest of the house, with marble countertops and sleek cabinets, but with various touches of warmth here and there.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On the fridge, among a few neatly arranged notes and reminders, was a colorful drawing. A child’s rendering of a tall figure (Agatha, no doubt) holding hands with a smaller one (Nicky). Above them, a bright yellow sun beamed down, and written in large, careful letters was: “Me and Mama!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s chest tightened unexpectedly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had never really pictured Agatha in this way—not just as a professor or an intimidating academic presence, but as someone who came home to bedtime stories, tiny hand-drawn masterpieces, and the boundless love of a child who clearly adored her. The image settled deep inside her, stirring something she couldn’t quite name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio, come on!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s voice snapped her out of her thoughts, his small hand grabbing hers and tugging her toward the counter. She laughed, allowing herself to be pulled along, the warmth of his grip anchoring her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you know where the baking stuff is?” Rio asked, rolling up her sleeves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded confidently. “Mama and I make muffins sometimes! I know where everything is!” He scampered over to one of the lower cabinets and started pulling out mixing bowls with the precision of a kid on a mission.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio watched him with a smile, already pulling out her phone to search for a simple cookie recipe. This was already turning out to be a more fun evening than she had anticipated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“All right, Chef Nicky,” she said, placing the phone on the counter. “Let’s make some magic happen.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finding the ingredients was easy enough—Agatha’s kitchen was neatly organized, everything in its rightful place. Rio set the sugar, flour, eggs, and chocolate chips on the counter, then turned to see Nicky struggling to climb onto the stool beside her. His little hands gripped the edge as he hoisted himself up, determination etched on his face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a chuckle, Rio scooped him up and placed him on the counter. “There you go, buddy. No need to scale the furniture like a ninja.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, swinging his feet beneath him. “I’m not a ninja, Rio! I’m a dragon!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, my mistake.” Rio grinned. “Well, Mr. Dragon, you ready to make some cookies?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded enthusiastically, but then his face turned skeptical. “Are you sure you know how, Miss Rio?” He peered up at her with wide, serious eyes, as if the success of their entire evening depended on her answer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gasped, hand to her chest. “Are you doubting my cookie-making abilities?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He giggled but remained unconvinced.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll have you know,” she said, grabbing a mixing bowl, “I’m a cookie expert. But I still need a top-notch assistant to make sure they turn out perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His face lit up. “I can do that!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good.” She handed him a measuring cup. “Then let’s get started.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Together, they mixed the dough, with Rio guiding Nicky through each step. He was in charge of stirring, though the flour ended up more on his hands (and the counter) than in the bowl. When they added the chocolate chips, Nicky tried to sneak a few into his mouth, but Rio caught him mid-act.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, hey! Those are for the cookies!” she scolded playfully.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But I have to make sure they taste good!” Nicky argued, already chewing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed dramatically. “Fine. Quality control is important, I guess.” She popped a chocolate chip into her mouth too, making him giggle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they finished shaping the dough onto the baking sheet, Nicky’s small hands were coated in flour and chocolate. Rio wiped a bit off his nose with her thumb before sliding the tray into the oven.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Now we wait,” she announced, dusting off her hands. “Got any ideas for what we should do?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tapped his chin thoughtfully. “Hmm… can we read a book?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Absolutely.” Rio followed him into the living room, where he immediately flopped onto the couch, grabbing a well-loved picture book from the coffee table. He nestled against her side as he flipped through the pages, eagerly pointing at the illustrations.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This one’s about a dragon,” he informed her. “But he’s a nice dragon, not a scary one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio played along, reacting to his enthusiastic commentary with exaggerated gasps and nods of agreement. “A friendly dragon, huh? That’s the best kind.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The warmth of the house, the quiet hum of their voices, and the soft weight of Nicky leaning against her—all of it settled something inside Rio that she hadn’t even realized was restless.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before long, the rich scent of warm chocolate filled the house, and the oven beeped.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cookies!” Nicky shouted, bolting off the couch and racing to the kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed as she followed, carefully pulling the tray from the oven. The cookies were golden brown, slightly uneven in shape, but undeniably delicious-looking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She placed them on a cooling rack while Nicky practically vibrated with excitement beside her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, okay,” she said, waving her hands. “They need a minute to cool, or we’ll burn our tongues.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky groaned dramatically but waited, eyes locked on the cookies as if willing them to cool faster.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few minutes, Rio handed him one. He grabbed it eagerly, holding it in both hands like it was a treasure, before taking a big bite. His eyes went wide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mmm!” he hummed, mouth full. “These are the best cookies ever, Miss Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a bite of her own and nodded approvingly. “Not bad, huh? I think we make a pretty great team.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, already reaching for a second cookie.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio watched him, completely content with his sugar-filled evening, she felt something settle deep in her chest. There was something so simple, yet so meaningful, about this moment—sitting in Agatha’s kitchen, baking cookies with her son, feeling like she belonged, even if just for a night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening wore on and Agatha still hadn’t returned, Rio found herself still on the couch with Nicky, who was now winding down from the excitement of their cookie-making adventure. He was curled up on the couch, eyes heavy with sleep but still holding onto the last bits of energy. Rio sat beside him, gently rubbing his back as he snuggled closer to her, his small body warm and comforted by the simple presence of someone looking after him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shifted slightly, brushing a few stray curls from his forehead. “You getting sleepy, buddy?” she murmured, her voice low and soothing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded, though he made no move to leave the warmth of their spot. “Rio, can you tell me a story?” he asked, his words slurred with drowsiness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, glancing at the clock. It wasn’t too late, but she knew Nicky needed his rest. “Okay, but just a short one, alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stood carefully, taking his hand to help him off the couch. “Come on, let’s get you ready for bed first.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky made a tired noise of protest but didn’t fight her as she led him up the stairs, her hand steady against his back to make sure he didn’t stumble in his sleepy state. The upstairs hallway was dimly lit, the soft glow from a small nightlight casting gentle shadows on the walls. Agatha had mentioned Nicky’s bedtime routine earlier in the day, and Rio followed it as best as she could—helping him change into his pajamas, reminding him to brush his teeth, making sure his stuffed dragon was in its rightful place on his pillow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When he was finally tucked under the blankets, Nicky blinked up at her expectantly, waiting for his promised story.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio thought for a moment before settling into the chair beside his bed, her voice hushed. “Alright, let’s see… Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved to dance. He danced everywhere she went—through the fields, in the village square, even when it rained, he twirled through the puddles.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky listened with half-lidded eyes, his breathing slowing as Rio continued.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“One day, he wandered into a magical forest, where the trees whispered secrets, and the flowers swayed to music only they could hear. As he danced along the winding path, he met a talking rabbit who needed help finding his way home, a shy owl who had never learned how to fly, and a family of fireflies who had lost their glow.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced at Nicky, watching the way his small fingers curled against the blanket as he clung to the sound of her voice. “So he danced for them,” Rio continued, her voice softer now. “He showed the rabbit how to follow the rhythm of the wind, taught the owl to trust the beat of his own wings, and helped the fireflies remember the joy of their own light.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky let out a tiny sigh, his hand sleepily reaching for Rio’s sleeve again, his grip loose but present.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He wasn’t a prince, or a hero with a sword,” Rio murmured, “but she had something special—a heart big enough to share, and a kindness that changed the world around her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the story came to an end, Nicky was already slipping into sleep, his small body fully relaxed against the mattress. Rio carefully adjusted the blanket around him, tucking it in just the way she imagined Agatha would. She hesitated for a moment, watching the steady rise and fall of his chest, feeling something settle deep within her—a quiet, unexpected connection.</p><p align="justify">  </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door creaked open as Agatha stepped into the dimly lit living room, the cool night air still lingering on her coat. She hadn’t expected to be out so late, but the conference had run longer than anticipated. Now, as she stepped into the quiet of her home, the first thing that caught her eye was Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There she was, sitting on the couch, legs curled up beneath her, a book open in her hands. The soft glow from the lamp above cast a gentle light on her face, highlighting the features Agatha had come to watch more and more — the focused student, the eager learner, the caring dance teacher, the lively drummer. But tonight, here in this private space, Rio looked different. She looked… comfortable. At ease. Like she belonged here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Agatha just stood there, watching her, the sight stirring something unfamiliar in her chest. She had seen Rio in class, always poised, always trying to impress, but here in her living room, there was a quiet intimacy that felt almost surreal. Seeing Rio in her own environment was strange. She wasn’t just a student anymore. She was someone who could step into her life, into her world, and make it feel less lonely somehow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha finally said, her voice soft, hesitant in a way she hadn’t meant it to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s head lifted, her eyes widening for just a second before recognition set in. A small smile touched her lips, effortless, natural. “Oh, hey, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha caught the slight shift in Rio’s posture—how she straightened just a little, as if remembering who she was speaking to, yet there was no tension, no urgency to retreat into formality. She had been comfortable here. That was what struck Agatha most. Rio had settled into the house as if it were familiar, as if it had welcomed her just as easily as Nicky had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused for a moment before she said, “You can call me Agatha when we’re not in class. No need for formalities when you’re here.” She said it with a lightness in her voice, trying not to sound too caught off guard by the unexpected ease of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, then nodded, her cheeks flushing slightly. “Right. Of course. Agatha,” she repeated, testing the name on her tongue. It felt different, more personal. The air between them shifted just slightly, the boundary that had always been there now just a little bit smaller. Agatha noticed it immediately, the subtle change in how they both held themselves, how Rio’s posture softened, how Agatha couldn’t seem to look away from her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I hope Nicky wasn’t too much trouble,” Agatha added, shaking off the strange feeling as she stepped fully into the room. She rolled her shoulders slightly, allowing herself to exhale now that she was home. She slipped off her coat, draping it over the arm of a chair, and set her bag down with a quiet sigh. The night had stretched on longer than she had anticipated, and though the conference had been productive, she was grateful to finally be home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, still seated on the couch, tilted her head slightly and smirked. “No trouble at all. We made cookies.” Her voice was lighter than usual, a warmth in her tone that she almost seemed to catch herself trying to suppress. “There are some left on the counter if you want one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced toward the kitchen, the faint scent of something sweet still lingering in the air. The thought of coming home to freshly baked cookies wasn’t something she had expected, but it made the house feel… softer, more lived-in, as if Rio’s presence had left something behind even in such a short span of time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He’s great,” Rio continued, stretching slightly as she closed her book. “We had a good time.” Then, with a teasing lilt in her voice, she added, “I think he likes me better than his usual sitter.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, the sound quiet but genuine. “I wouldn’t be surprised. He can be hesitant with new people, but once he warms up to someone, he’s all in.” She shook her head fondly. “And if cookies were involved, you definitely won him over for life.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned. “So what you’re saying is, I’m officially on the permanent babysitter list?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, amusement dancing in her eyes. “It’s looking that way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, the conversation drifted into silence—not the awkward, searching kind, but something easy, something <em>settled</em>. Agatha found herself surprised by how natural it felt, standing here in the dim light of her living room, speaking with Rio as if this were just any other evening, as if it were normal for her to be here, for them to share this kind of quiet familiarity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I didn’t mean to stay so late,” Agatha admitted, running a hand through her hair as if to shake off the weight of the evening. “But thank you for staying with him. I really appreciate it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio met her gaze, and something in the way she looked at her made Agatha pause. There was no expectation, no formality—just sincerity, a quiet understanding that felt different from their usual dynamic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Anytime, Agatha,” Rio said simply, her voice steady, certain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The name lingered in the air between them, soft but carrying a weight that neither of them fully acknowledged. Agatha felt it settle somewhere in her chest, an almost imperceptible shift in the space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Strange.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But somehow… right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a Riot, she finally said, “Would you like some tea? You’ve been reading for a while. I could use a bit of quiet myself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, a small but genuine smile on her lips. “I’d love some, thank you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha moved toward the kitchen to prepare it, she couldn’t help but glance back at Rio, still curled up on the couch, a quiet part of her feeling like she was seeing this student for the first time. There had been a lot of those lately.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha returned to the living room with two steaming cups of tea, the soft scent of chamomile filling the air. As she set them down on the coffee table, she noticed Rio had moved slightly, her legs now tucked neatly underneath her, sitting up with a careful balance of curiosity and caution. Her eyes, once warm and open, now held a new intensity, as though the atmosphere had subtly shifted. Agatha couldn’t help but feel the change too.</p><p align="justify">  </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio said softly, her fingers brushing against the warm cup before bringing it to her lips. Her voice, though steady, carried an undertone that Agatha wasn’t used to hearing from her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Agatha replied, sitting across from her, trying to keep her own composure in check. Her eyes couldn’t help but trace the curve of Rio’s jaw, the way the light seemed to settle around her in a way that felt too intimate, too personal. She quickly looked away, taking a slow sip of her tea, trying to steady the quiet storm inside her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, neither of them spoke. They simply drank their tea, both of their minds clearly preoccupied, yet neither willing to break the silence too soon.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio cleared her throat, her gaze flickering up to meet Agatha’s. “I… uh, I just wanted to say again, thank you for trusting me with Nicky tonight. I know it must not have been easy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head slightly, watching her. There was something in Rio’s voice that wasn’t just politeness—it was careful, deliberate, as though she knew exactly what it meant to be trusted with something precious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curled into a small smile, though she was suddenly aware of the way her pulse quickened, the way this moment felt heavier than it should. “You don’t have to thank me, Rio.” Her voice was softer than intended. “If anything, I should be thanking <em>you</em>. You were a huge help tonight. I don’t know what I would’ve done otherwise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hesitated, then added, “Nicky’s a good kid. He’s lucky to have someone like you looking out for him when I can’t.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, like she hadn’t expected that, and then something in her expression shifted. A slow, quiet smile formed—not the confident grin Agatha was used to seeing from her, but something gentler. More <em>honest</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He’s great,” Rio murmured. “Really.” Her voice dropped just slightly, like she was admitting something she wasn’t sure she should. “I’ve spent so much time with kids like him… kids who like just a little bit more attention. So when I can, I try to give them a little extra.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched her closely, her mind racing with thoughts of what Rio had just shared—of the quiet compassion that seemed to lie just beneath the surface of her usual composed demeanor. She had spent years trying to balance her world between academia and motherhood, never quite sure if she was doing enough for Nicky, if she was being <em>enough</em> for him. And yet, here was Rio—<em>young, bold, bright Rio</em>—who had stepped into her home tonight and simply <em>understood</em>. Not just Nicky, but the weight of it all. The unspoken fears. The quiet loneliness of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly around her mug as she studied Rio, her mind racing through everything she had learned about her tonight—about this <em>other</em> side of her, the one that had nothing to do with the eager student or the passionate musician. It was a side of Rio that had nothing to prove and everything to give.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And somehow, that made her even more dangerous.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s dark eyes met hers again, steady and unwavering, and for a moment, Agatha found herself lost in them—<em>swimming</em> in something neither of them had put into words, yet both could feel pressing against the quiet space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room felt smaller, the soft hum of the night outside barely cutting through the weight of the moment. Agatha should have looked away, should have reached for something—her tea, her book, <em>anything</em>—but she didn’t. Instead, she let herself hold Rio’s gaze, let herself feel the warmth curling at the edges of something she wasn’t sure she was ready to name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re very different from how I imagined,” Agatha found herself saying, before she could stop herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t a calculated observation. It wasn’t the kind of thing she would normally say, but there it was, slipping past her lips—quiet, unguarded.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s brows lifted slightly, intrigued rather than offended. “Different how?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her voice was light, but there was something beneath it—curiosity, maybe, or something deeper, something testing the boundaries of what they <em>were</em> in this moment. The question lingered between them like an invitation, like a thread waiting to be pulled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, exhaling softly as she glanced down at the untouched tea in her hands. She had thought about Rio more than she wanted to admit. More than she <em>should</em>. At first, it had been easy to categorize—student, drummer, stubbornly intelligent, sharp with a confidence that made her stand out in a room. But then came moments like this, when the image she had crafted of Rio unraveled at the edges, revealing something softer, something unexpected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know,” Agatha admitted at last, shaking her head with a small, self-conscious laugh. “Just… more than I expected.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She looked up at Rio again, and this time, she let herself smile—genuine, unforced. It wasn’t the professional smile she wore in lectures or the polite one she gave colleagues at conferences. It was real. It felt almost like a release, like breathing a little easier now that the words were out in the open.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved, her expression shifting into something thoughtful. She tilted her head slightly, as if weighing Agatha’s words before deciding how much of herself to give in return.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I get that,” Rio said after a moment, her voice quieter, more careful. “People always expect me to be… something else. I guess I don’t always fit the mold they put me in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart skipped <em>just slightly</em> at the way she said it—so matter-of-fact, but with an undercurrent of something deeper. She knew that feeling too well. The feeling of being seen one way while knowing there were entire parts of herself that no one even thought to look for.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Rio definitely had more layers than Agatha had ever considered before tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha set her tea down, watching Rio with careful curiosity, aware of the way her pulse thrummed just a little too fast, the way this moment felt almost <em>dangerous</em> in its stillness. “I think most people are more than what they appear to be,” she murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hummed softly in response, her gaze flickering down for a second before returning to Agatha’s with something unreadable, something Agatha wasn’t sure she wanted to define.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The silence stretched, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It wasn’t something either of them felt the need to break.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was the first to break the stillness, though it took more effort than she expected. “I should… let you get some rest. I know you’ve had a long day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her expression slightly wistful, but there was something in her gaze that told Agatha she wasn’t quite ready to leave, Agatha could tell. And if she was being honest with herself, she wasn’t sure she was ready to let her go, either.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, again,” Rio said as she stood, the quiet finality in her voice carrying more weight than simple politeness. Her movements were unhurried, as if part of her was waiting for Agatha to say something—<em>anything</em>—to make her stay just a little longer. “I really did enjoy tonight. And I mean it—anytime you need me for Nicky… I’m here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips parted, and for a second, she considered saying something more, letting herself reach for the unspoken thing between them. But instead, she swallowed it down, offering Rio a small, grateful smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” she said softly. “And I appreciate it. More than you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio lingered for a fraction of a second longer, her dark eyes searching Agatha’s face like she was memorizing something, tucking it away for later. Then, with a small nod, she turned toward the door, her footsteps slow and deliberate, as if she, too, felt the weight of the moment stretching between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha followed her with her gaze, watching as Rio slipped on her jacket, as her fingers hesitated on the doorknob before finally pulling it open. A rush of cold night air swept into the warm space between them, a stark contrast to the lingering heat of everything unsaid.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Goodnight, Agatha,” Rio murmured, and the way she said her name—soft, unguarded—sent something curling deep in Agatha’s chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door clicked shut behind her, and Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. The room felt quieter now, <em>emptier</em>, as if something tangible had left with Rio, something Agatha wasn’t quite ready to name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She exhaled slowly, rubbing her fingers over her temple before moving to clean up the forgotten tea cups on the table. The house was silent except for the faint ticking of the clock, but Agatha’s mind was far from still.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The feeling hadn’t dissipated. If anything, it had only grown stronger.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as she stood there, staring at the door Rio had just walked through, she knew—this wasn’t the end of something.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was the beginning.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p>

Eliot. “East Coker”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha walked into the lecture hall the next day, the air felt different. The familiar hum of students settling into their seats was accompanied by an unspoken tension that she couldn’t quite shake off. Her gaze briefly flickered across the room, landing on Rio, who sat in her usual spot, her expression serene but her body language slightly more guarded than usual.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but notice the subtle shift. It wasn’t anything dramatic—there were no overt signs of discomfort or awkwardness—but there was a certain quietness, a deeper focus to the way Rio was sitting. Her shoulders were slightly squared, her chin tilted just a little higher, as if she were bracing herself for something.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just Rio, though. Agatha could feel the change in the room as a whole. The students seemed to be a little more aware of the space between them, a little more conscious of their place in the class, as if the dynamic had subtly adjusted overnight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart thudded against her chest, the words she had shared with Rio the previous night—so carefully measured and laden with meaning—lingering in the back of her mind. She had tried to dismiss them, but they had stayed with her, settling into her thoughts like a seed that refused to be ignored.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she took her place at the front of the room, Agatha cleared her throat, attempting to push the uneasy feeling aside. She started the class as usual, but her eyes couldn’t help but dart back to Rio more often than before. There was something magnetic in her presence now, a connection Agatha hadn’t anticipated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, for her part, was just as focused as ever, but her eyes seemed to linger on Agatha just a fraction longer than necessary. Their gazes met once, twice, and every time it was like a little electric spark traveled between them—something they both felt, but neither spoke aloud.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was subtle—too subtle for anyone else to notice—but Agatha could feel it, could sense the quiet understanding growing between them, like a hidden thread weaving its way through the fabric of their interactions. It wasn’t something either of them had asked for, but it was undeniably there. And with every glance, every unspoken word, it pulled them closer together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a particularly intense discussion about Williams and his wheelbarrow, Agatha caught herself lingering on the way Rio’s lips curved slightly when she disagreed with a point. It was almost as if Rio’s passion for the subject was mirrored in the way she held herself—poised, but with a fierce undercurrent that Agatha had never noticed quite so vividly before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When class ended, Agatha closed her notebook slowly, giving herself a moment to breathe. The room began to empty, but Rio remained seated, her fingers lightly tapping the surface of her desk as she appeared lost in thought. Agatha couldn’t resist the urge to approach her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” Agatha began, her voice gentle but firm, as if anchoring herself in the present. “You’re quiet today. Everything alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes lifted to meet hers, a soft smile tugging at her lips, though there was something in her gaze that made Agatha’s heart skip. “Yeah, just… thinking,” Rio replied, her voice carrying an almost unspoken weight, a quiet admission that Agatha couldn’t quite place. “I’ve been doing a lot of that lately.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her mind racing as she held her gaze. The words that lingered between them were thick with possibility, but she couldn’t find the right ones to bridge the gap. Instead, she chose to let the silence speak for itself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, don’t overthink it,” Agatha said with a half-smile, though her heart was pounding a little faster than she cared to admit. “I’ll see you next class.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio stood up, their eyes met once again. And for a moment, it felt like time had stopped, the weight of their unspoken connection pressing down on them both. There was a tension between them now that hadn’t been there before—an uncharted territory neither had ventured into, but both were clearly aware of.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“See you, Dr. Harkness,” Rio replied quietly, her voice soft, almost like a promise. And then she was gone, leaving Agatha standing there, the room suddenly too quiet, too still.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched her go, her thoughts swirling as she stood rooted to the spot. Something had definitely changed between them. And Agatha knew, deep down, that it couldn’t be ignored any longer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could feel the pull, and it was undeniable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio made her way out of the lecture hall, her thoughts buzzed, swirling around one thing, one person—Agatha Harkness. It was almost impossible to focus on anything else. Her mind kept returning to the way Agatha’s voice had sounded when she spoke to her, how her gaze had lingered just a little too long when they exchanged glances.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>God,</em> Rio thought, her hands pressing against the cool metal of the door as she stepped outside. <em>I’m down bad.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just the way Agatha spoke—though that was enough to send a thrill down her spine every time. It wasn’t even the way she commanded the room, effortlessly drawing the attention of every student without seeming to try. No, it was more than that. It was the way Agatha looked at her sometimes. The way she <em>saw</em> her, as if no one else in the world mattered at that moment but Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And it didn’t make sense. Not at all. Agatha was her professor—her <em>supervisor</em>. She was older, experienced, and far too composed for someone like Rio, who was still figuring everything out. Rio had always been careful not to cross lines, to keep her boundaries in check, but lately, those boundaries felt more and more like they were shifting. Every interaction with Agatha made it harder to ignore the way her heart beat a little faster, the way her stomach did flips when their eyes met.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio paused on the steps, pressing her palm against her forehead as if she could physically stop the thoughts from overwhelming her. <em>It’s just a crush,</em> she told herself. <em>That’s all it is. Just a fleeting little thing. Get over it.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But deep down, Rio knew it wasn’t that simple. This was more than a casual infatuation. There was a weight to it, an intensity that made her feel like she was on the edge of something dangerous, something she didn’t know how to handle. Agatha wasn’t just anyone. She was powerful, intelligent, and so unbelievably captivating. Every word that came from her lips seemed to carry more meaning than it should.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>And the worst part?</em> Rio thought, her chest tightening. <em>I think she knows. She’s got to know.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The way Agatha had looked at her after class, the way she’d spoken so gently, as if <em>her</em> presence in the room was important. Rio had tried to brush it off, but the truth was, it had been hard to ignore the way she felt seen, in a way she hadn’t experienced before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a deep breath, forcing herself to move, to keep walking. But no matter how hard she tried, the thoughts of Agatha lingered in her mind, like an unshakable tune playing on repeat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Maybe I’m not down bad for her, but damn, she’s got a hold on me,</em> Rio thought, the weight of her feelings pressing down harder than before. <em>And I don’t even know what to do about it.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For now, though, there was nothing she could do. She had to focus on her thesis, on the band, on everything else. But as she walked through campus, the idea that Agatha Harkness was more than just her professor, that she could be something else entirely, was impossible to ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as much as Rio wanted to forget about it, to push it all aside, she couldn’t. Because now more than ever, the lines between student and professor felt blurred—and Rio wasn’t sure she wanted to draw them back again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, as Rio walked across campus, still feeling the weight of everything that had been swirling in her mind, she realized she couldn’t keep bottling it up. She needed to talk to someone. Alice, of course, would be the perfect person. They’d been through everything together, and Rio trusted her with just about everything—except maybe this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But today, as they sat at a coffee shop during a break, Alice noticed something was off.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You okay?” Alice asked, eyeing Rio carefully as she stirred her coffee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment, then let out a long breath. “It’s… Agatha,” she muttered, staring down into her cup.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised an eyebrow. “Ah, Professor Harkness. The one who’s been making your heart race for the last couple of months?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, resting her forehead in her hands. “I don’t know what’s going on. I mean, it’s just a stupid crush, right? I’m being ridiculous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alicedindn't back down. “Well, you’re not the first person to have a crush on their professor, Rio. It’s not <em>that</em> unusual.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a pointed look. “Yeah, but she’s my <em>supervisor</em>. It’s… complicated. I’m confused. I don’t know how to deal with it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned back in her chair, her lips curling into a mischievous smile. “Okay, I did some research.” She paused, watching Rio’s eyes widen. “I looked up the guidelines in the student handbook. About relationships between PhD students and their supervisors.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes narrowed. “What? Alice, no—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, hear me out!” Alice waved her hands dramatically. “It’s not forbidden. At least, not technically. As long as both parties are adults, it’s not like there’s some big rule that says it’s <em>illegal</em> or anything. It’s just not encouraged, because of all the power dynamics and, you know, the potential for awkwardness.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, processing. “You actually read that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, well, you’re my best friend. Of course I did. You didn’t think I’d let you spiral about this without a little bit of research, did you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rubbed her temples. “You’re being ridiculous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned forward, her tone softening. “Listen, I’m not saying you should go for it or anything. But I just want you to know that it’s not the end of the world, and you’re not breaking any rules if you—” She stopped herself, grinning. “If you, I don’t know, <em>did</em> something about it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head quickly, a blush creeping up her neck. “Stop. Seriously. Agatha would <em>never</em> want me like that. She’s my professor. I’m just… being weird, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice laughed, tapping her fingers on the table. “I’m not saying you’re going to jump into a relationship with her tomorrow, Rio. I just think you should acknowledge that whatever’s going on here, it’s probably more than just a passing crush. And maybe, just maybe, you should <em>talk</em> about it. Before you go insane trying to figure it all out yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio huffed, her thoughts still clouded with confusion. “I don’t know if I can talk to her about this. It feels… it feels like everything would be ruined if I said something. Like, it’s so stupid. She’s my <em>supervisor</em>. This is all so messed up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice looked at her seriously for a moment, then cracked a smile. “You’re not the first person to get all tangled up in something like this. But remember—<em>nothing</em> is ever as simple as it seems. And maybe the only way to really figure this out is to stop running from it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t know how to respond to that. Her stomach churned at the thought of confronting Agatha about it. It felt impossible. There was just no way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Anyway,” Alice said, standing up and grabbing her coat, “just think about it. No pressure.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat there for a long moment, the weight of Alice’s words sinking in. She had to admit—deep down, part of her did want to talk to Agatha. To at least <em>acknowledge</em> whatever this was between them. But the fear, the uncertainty, made her feel like she was standing at the edge of something that could break everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just a crush. It felt bigger than that. And for now, Rio had no idea how to make sense of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio knew she needed to focus on something else before she completely spiraled. She couldn’t keep fixating on Agatha, or how the thought of her made her heart race and her stomach twist. She needed an outlet—something to distract her. The band was always a safe place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So, that evening, Rio threw herself into practice, letting the rhythms of the drums ground her. She had a rehearsal with the band later that night, and she was determined to leave her thoughts about Agatha behind for a few hours. But, as always, the music offered only temporary relief. The beats echoed in her mind, but the moment she let her guard down, her thoughts wandered back to her professor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice could tell Rio was distracted, her usual energy a little more subdued than usual. As they played through a new song, Rio’s drumming was tight but lacked the passion she usually brought to their performances. Jen shot her a glance, but Rio just forced a smile, brushing it off.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Everything okay?” Alice asked, catching Rio’s eye during a break.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded quickly, shifting the conversation before Alice could press any further. “Yeah, yeah. Just… lots of things on my mind, I guess.” She forced another smile, trying to shake off the lingering tension.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But even as she said the words, she knew it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t just about the band, or even the stress of her thesis—it was Agatha. She couldn’t stop thinking about her, the way her voice sounded when she was stern in class, and the way she smiled that was just a little too kind when they talked one-on-one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time practice ended, Rio was exhausted, but not from the music. It was the same weight she’d been carrying all week. She was still tangled in that web of uncertainty, and she had no idea how to untangle it. She’d hoped that losing herself in the music would give her some peace, but instead, it had only amplified her frustration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On her way back to her apartment, she passed by the dance studio. A class was ending, and she caught a glimpse of some of the kids she taught. The familiar faces were like a balm to her frazzled mind, and she found herself stepping inside. She hadn’t planned to, but the urge to move, to feel her body in motion, was too strong to ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio quickly changed into her dance clothes and stood at the barre, stretching as the class filed out. The rhythmic motions calmed her, but her thoughts—like a song on repeat—kept returning to Agatha. The way she seemed to watch her, the quiet moments between them after class, and how that one simple conversation, after their gig, had made everything feel… different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She danced through the evening, pushing herself harder than usual, using every movement to try and quiet the storm in her head. She swirled across the floor, each step more powerful than the last, but the one thing she couldn’t shake was the nagging thought: <em>What if Agatha felt the same way?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She couldn’t keep hiding behind the music, and she knew it. But tonight, she would try.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio danced her frustrations away, Agatha sat at her desk at home, papers scattered in front of her, the faint glow of the lamp illuminating her tired eyes. The conference she had attended had been exhausting, and the late-night work she’d done catching up on grading didn’t help ease her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But it wasn’t the workload that kept her up tonight—it was Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha had tried to ignore the pull she felt toward her student, tried to convince herself that her thoughts were just that—thoughts. Yet every time she saw Rio in class, every time their eyes met in passing, it felt like something deeper. The subtle shifts in their interactions were not lost on Agatha, and the confusion was growing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hadn’t planned on feeling this way. Rio was her student, and she was her supervisor. That should be enough to set clear boundaries. And yet… whenever Rio smiled at her, or when they shared a quiet moment together, it stirred something Agatha hadn’t felt in a long time—a longing, an attraction, and a sense of vulnerability that she couldn’t seem to escape.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tea with Rio at her house after she had babysat Nicky, the way Rio had taken care of him, had only added to her confusion. It was one thing to see her in the classroom, where the structure was clear. But in her home, around her son, Rio had been so different—so warm, so grounded. And the kindness she showed her son had unsettled Agatha in ways she hadn’t expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could still hear Rio’s soft laugh as they shared that quiet conversation. The ease between them, despite the distance that should have been there, had felt almost… natural. And when Rio had said her name for the first time, something inside her had jolted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the hours dragged on, Agatha found herself returning to the same thoughts again and again. She had always prided herself on being professional, on keeping personal and academic lives separate. But this… this was something different. Something far more complicated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stared at the stack of papers in front of her, but she couldn’t focus on them. All she could think about was Rio—her energy, her passion, her gentle presence. How every time their paths crossed, Agatha’s heart seemed to beat just a little faster.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The silence of the room grew heavier, the ticking of the clock the only sound breaking through her thoughts. Agatha pushed her chair back, rubbing her temples. She was overwhelmed, and she hated the feeling. She hated how she couldn’t keep her thoughts in check when it came to Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>What am I doing?</em> she wondered, her hands gripping the edge of the desk. She had always been in control, always so sure of herself. But now? With Rio? Everything felt like it was slipping, slowly but steadily, into something she didn’t know how to handle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And so, she stayed there, sitting in the dimly lit room, the weight of her thoughts pressing down on her. Even though she was so very aware of the professional boundary that should exist between them, the connection she felt with Rio — subtle and undeniable — made her question everything she thought she knew about herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For the first time in a long time, Agatha didn’t have the answers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p>

Eliot. “The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next day, Rio tried to push her thoughts of Agatha aside. She had to focus—on her thesis, her little dance students, and the band. She couldn’t afford to get caught up in whatever was happening between them. It was complicated, and she knew it. It had to be the stress of the semester, the tension from being in Agatha’s class, and the confusion that came with seeing her outside of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But no matter how hard she tried to convince herself that she was overthinking, the truth lingered in the back of her mind, stubbornly persistent. Every glance she shared with Agatha, every soft word, every subtle moment where their hands brushed—it all added up. And now, after babysitting Nicky and the tea at Agatha’s house, it felt like something more was being hinted at, something more real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She couldn’t get the image of Agatha out of her head. The way Agatha looked at her, the way she seemed to genuinely care about her. Rio had spent so long in her own head, distracted by the chaos of life, that she hadn’t let herself focus on another person in a long time. But with Agatha? It felt different. Too different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sighed, watching the band practice in the studio, trying her best to immerse herself in the music. Alice was playing her usual loud guitar riffs, Jen was adjusting the sound, and Rio’s drumsticks clicked against the cymbals in rhythm. But her mind wasn’t fully here. It never fully was these days.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve been zoning out a lot lately,” Alice remarked, glancing over at her after a particularly long pause between beats. “Everything okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio replied, her voice quieter than usual. “Just tired.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. “Tired, huh? You sure it’s not something else? You’ve been acting a little… distracted. Something on your mind?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated. She could feel Alice’s piercing gaze on her, waiting for an answer with her knowing glance as if she knew exaclty what was on her friend's mind. But Rio couldn’t say it. Couldn’t bring herself to admit that she was thinking about her professor again, the one woman she knew she shouldn’t be thinking about.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s nothing,” Rio muttered, shifting her focus back to the drums. She knew Alice wouldn’t let it slide for long, but she didn’t feel ready to talk about it again with Alice — not yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later, as the band wrapped up their rehearsal and they all gathered their things, Alice leaned in with a mischievous grin. “So, when are you going to tell Agatha about our next gig? Maybe she’ll actually come back.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat at the mention of Agatha’s name. She smiled, a little awkwardly. “I don’t know. She’s… busy with work and everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, right,” Alice teased, winking. “I’m sure she’s <em>very</em> busy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t hide the small blush creeping up her neck. “Stop it, Alice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, as Rio sat in her small apartment, trying to work on her thesis, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Lilia.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“How are you holding up, darling? Anything exciting happening at school?”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled at the message, knowing Lilia would always be there to offer comfort and guidance. She typed back quickly, telling her about her day and the latest band rehearsal, but she kept the other thoughts hidden, tucking them away in the back of her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wasn’t ready to confront them just yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But as the evening wore on, the quiet buzz of her phone interrupted her thoughts once more. It was an email from Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“I’ve been thinking about your thesis topic. I’d like to meet sometime this week to discuss your progress and some ideas I have. Let me know when you’re available.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The email was short, professional. But Rio couldn’t help the way her heart fluttered at the thought of meeting Agatha again. Her thoughts immediately went to how she had felt during their last meeting—those moments of connection, however brief, that seemed to speak volumes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Get a grip,</em> Rio thought, forcing herself to breathe deeply. She knew she had to focus on her work, not get distracted by anything else. But no matter how many times she told herself that, the pull toward Agatha was growing stronger with every passing day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hit reply, agreeing to meet Agatha in a few days, and closed her laptop. For now, all she could do was wait. And think. And hope she didn’t make a fool of herself when the time came.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The meeting was set for mid-afternoon in Agatha’s office, a quiet, serene space filled with bookshelves brimming with literary works. Agatha had asked Rio to come by so they could discuss her thesis — an academic subject, something to keep their conversation grounded. But as soon as Rio stepped into the room, the air between them felt charged in a way it hadn’t before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a seat across from Agatha’s desk, her hands folded in her lap. She had dressed carefully, opting for something simple but professional—no distractions. She wasn’t sure what to expect, but she knew that whatever it was, she needed to focus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you for meeting with me,” Rio said, trying to keep her tone light. “I appreciate it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, offering a soft smile. “Of course. I’ve been thinking about your thesis, and I think it has great potential. »</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And just like that, they were off, talking a subject they were both passionate about.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded to very thing Agatha said, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s face as the professor spoke. She was <em>so</em>composed, so sharp, her words resonating in a way Rio hadn’t expected. She hadn’t realized how much she would hang on every word Agatha spoke, how the sound of her voice seemed to sink under her skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked up from her notes, meeting Rio’s gaze for just a moment longer than necessary. It was quick, but it was enough to send a jolt of recognition through both of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her breath catch in her chest as Agatha leaned back slightly in her chair, still holding her gaze. “That’s a good place to start,” Agatha continued. “But perhaps you could explore <em>how</em> death shows up in their writing, both directly and through omission. The presence of Death, <em>and</em> the absence of Death, their duality. How they mingle together to become one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, nodding quickly. She was trying to concentrate, to listen, but the way Agatha’s words seemed to echo in her mind… it was hard to keep her thoughts in line.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right. Of course,” she said, barely managing to keep her voice steady. She pulled out her notes, trying to hide the sudden heat rising in her cheeks. “I’ll look into that. Thanks, Dr. Harkeness.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha.” The single word hung in the air, making Rio’s pulse spike. Agatha had said it so casually, but something about the way it sounded—so familiar—felt like a subtle invitation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s throat went dry as she glanced up at Agatha, who was still watching her with an expression that was both professional and something else—something that Rio couldn’t quite place. It felt as though they were standing on the edge of something unspoken, something precariously close to crossing a line neither of them had been ready to acknowledge.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Agatha,” Rio finally managed to say. She had to break the silence before she completely lost herself in the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her lips curling into a tight smile. “No problem. I’m looking forward to seeing where you take this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood up, gathering her notes, but the moment felt charged in a way it hadn’t before. Agatha’s presence was a weight in the room, and Rio couldn’t help but notice how close they were, how Agatha’s gaze lingered just a second longer than necessary.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let me know if you need any further guidance on your direction,” Agatha said as Rio moved toward the door. “I’m happy to help.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Rio responded, though her voice was quieter now, tinged with something she couldn’t quite explain. “See you later… Agatha.” As she stepped into the hallway, she felt the weight of Agatha’s gaze on her back, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the door clicked shut behind her, Rio’s heart raced in her chest. <em>What was that?</em> She couldn’t stop herself from thinking about Agatha, about the way their conversation had unfolded, and how hard it was to separate the professional from something much more personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She couldn’t be sure what this was—whether it was just academic admiration or something else entirely. But one thing was clear: whatever it was, it was only getting more complicated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the weight of the day pressed heavily on her chest, Rio grabbed her phone and dialed Lilia’s number. The warmth of Lilia’s voice answered almost immediately, and the familiar sound brought a small measure of relief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio! How’s my girl?” Lilia greeted cheerfully.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Lilia,” Rio said, trying to keep her voice light, though she suspected Lilia would sense the undertone of unease anyway. “I was wondering… is it okay if I come over for dinner tonight?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a pause, and Rio could almost see Lilia tilting her head in curiosity. “Of course, sweetheart. You don’t even have to ask. Everything okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment, her hand tightening around her phone. “Yeah,” she said quickly, forcing a small laugh. “I just… need some good company, you know? And your cooking.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia didn’t press further, though Rio could tell she was tempted. “Well, you’re in luck. I made too much arroz con pollo, just like the one you like, and I was just thinking it’d be nice to share it. Come on over whenever you’re ready.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Lilia. I’ll be there soon,” Rio said, her shoulders relaxing slightly as she hung up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she arrived, the cozy scent of spices and home cooked food greeted her as Lilia opened the door. She was wearing her usual warm smile, her apron dusted with flour from what Rio suspected was an earlier baking experiment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on in,” Lilia said, ushering Rio inside. “You look like you’ve had a day. Sit down, I’ll fix you a plate.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let herself be led to the small kitchen table, where she sat and watched Lilia bustle around, humming softly. It was a kind of comfort she hadn’t realized she’d been craving—Lilia’s house, with its slightly mismatched furniture, walls lined with family photos, and the gentle hum of life in every corner, always felt like a refuge.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So,” Lilia said as she set down a steaming plate of food in front of Rio, “what’s on your mind, sweet girl? You don’t have to tell me everything, but I know something’s eating at you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, swirling her fork through the rice. “It’s nothing, really. Just… school stuff. My thesis. You know how it is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia raised an eyebrow but didn’t push. “School stuff, huh? Well, whatever it is, you’ll figure it out. You always do. And if you need me to set anyone straight…” She gave a playful grin, her tone teasing but her protective streak unmistakable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio managed a small laugh. “I’ll let you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they ate, the conversation drifted to lighter topics—old stories, updates on Lilia’s neighbors, and the latest antics of her cat. For a little while, Rio let herself get lost in the normalcy, the safety of this space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When dinner was over, Lilia brought out a slice of peach cobbler for dessert, insisting that Rio couldn’t leave without something sweet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Gracias, Lilia,” Rio said softly, as she scraped the last bite from her plate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Anytime, my love,” Lilia replied, reaching across the table to squeeze her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Rio left, the knot of tension in her chest had loosened just enough to breathe. She didn’t have all the answers, but for tonight, that was okay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, Rio arrived at the dance center just as the sunlight began filtering through the studio’s large windows, casting warm, golden rays across the polished wooden floor. It was her favorite time of the week: ballet class with the little ones. Their energy, curiosity, and occasional silliness were infectious, and teaching them always felt like a reset button for her chaotic mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she tied her hair into a neat bun, a group of tiny voices echoed down the hallway, growing louder as the kids approached. They burst into the room like a bundle of giggles and excitement, their little ballet shoes tapping against the floor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the children filed into the studio, Rio noticed a familiar, dark-haired boy trailing slightly behind the others. Nicky, Agatha’s son, clutched his small dance bag and looked around the room with wide eyes before spotting Rio. His face immediately lit up, and he waved enthusiastically.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi, Miss Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi, Nicky,” Rio replied warmly, kneeling to greet him. “Ready for class?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He nodded vigorously. “I practiced my pliés with Mama last night!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but smile at the image of Agatha Harkness, poised and composed in her academic world, crouching in a living room to help her son with ballet. “Well, let’s see how much you’ve improved, superstar.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> The other kids were also quick to demand her attention, as always.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio! Miss Rio!” a little girl called, tugging at her leg. “I also practiced my pliés at home! And my jumps”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did you?” Rio crouched down to her level, smiling as the child demonstrated. “Very nice, but remember, knees out, okay? Like this.” She showed the proper form, and the child nodded earnestly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio, I got new shoes!” another chimed in, proudly lifting a pink slippered foot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They’re beautiful,” Rio said warmly, standing up and clapping her hands to get their attention. “Alright, everyone, to the barre! Let’s warm up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The class began with stretches and basic movements. Rio moved through the rows, gently correcting postures and offering encouragement. The children followed her lead, some with improving form, others with wobbly determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">One of the younger ones, a shy girl named Sophie, struggled with her balance during a little dégagé. She frowned, her small brows furrowed in frustration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry, Sophie,” Rio said, kneeling beside her. “Even the best dancers fall sometimes. Let’s try it together, okay?” She held Sophie’s hand and guided her through the motion, earning a timid but triumphant smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio kept an eye on Nicky the whole time. He was clearly trying hard to focus, his little brow furrowing with determination as he copied her movements. He wasn’t the most coordinated dancer, but his enthusiasm made up for it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">During tendus, he wobbled a bit too far and stumbled, landing on his bottom with a small “oof.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh no! Are you okay?” Rio asked, hurrying over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded, his cheeks turning pink. “I’m okay. Falling’s part of the learning, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart melted at his resilience. “That’s exactly right. You’re a quick learner.” She extended a hand to help him up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Miss Rio,” he said, brushing off his pants and hopping back into line.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the class progressed, the room filled with laughter and tiny triumphs. By the end, the kids were buzzing with excitement, proudly showing off their progress to each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, everyone,” Rio announced as the class wrapped up, “you did amazing today! Give yourselves a big round of applause!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The children clapped enthusiastically, and as they gathered their belongings, a few lingered to hug Rio goodbye.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the children began trickling out with their parents, Nicky lingered near her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, Nicky?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you think Mama will come to the next recital?” His voice was soft, uncertain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio crouched to his level, her smile reassuring. “I’m sure she will. She’s really proud of you, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed at her answer, his small chest puffing up. “Okay. I’ll practice extra hard!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He waved goodbye as his sitter arrived to pick him up, leaving Rio alone in the now-empty studio. She chuckled to herself as she gathered her things, the image of Nicky’s determined little face warming her heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed contentedly, leaning against the barre. Despite everything swirling in her life, these classes grounded her in a way nothing else could.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned off the studio lights and grabbed her bag, heading toward the lobby. Another class was about to begin, but for her, the rest of the day lay ahead—a mix of research, writing, and, undoubtedly, thoughts of her professor sneaking into her mind when she least expected it.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot; “The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">That night, as exhaustion overtook her, Agatha fell into a restless sleep. The weight of the day seemed to blur as her subconscious took over, and soon she found herself in a dream that felt too vivid, too real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She was back at the recital, seated in the front row. The stage lights were warm and golden, casting long, dramatic shadows. The children had just finished their performance, and applause echoed in the room. Agatha’s gaze was fixed on the wings, where Rio stood, guiding the children offstage with her usual grace and patience.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, unexpectedly, Rio stepped forward onto the stage. The audience faded into a distant hum as Rio began to dance. It wasn’t like the ballet performances Agatha had grown accustomed to seeing Nicky attempt—it was something more raw, more expressive. Her movements were fluid, deliberate, and magnetic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t look away. There was something intoxicating about the way Rio moved, the way she seemed to pour herself into every step, every twist of her body, leaving Agatha’s chest tight with an unfamiliar longing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned her head mid-spin, her gaze locking with Agatha’s in the crowd. Her expression was unreadable, but her eyes burned with intensity. Agatha felt as though she were being drawn in, the distance between them shrinking without either of them moving.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Rio whispered, though her lips hadn’t moved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound of her name in Rio’s voice reverberated in Agatha’s mind, sending a thrill down her spine. The spotlight seemed to dim, leaving only the two of them bathed in a soft, ethereal glow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped closer, her hand reaching out as if to touch Agatha’s cheek—</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha woke with a start, her breath catching in her throat. The room was dark and silent, the dream still clinging to her like a second skin. She ran a hand through her hair, her heart racing as the images replayed in her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is ridiculous,” she muttered under her breath, but the flush in her cheeks and the lingering ache in her chest betrayed her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She lay back down, staring at the ceiling, unable to shake the dream.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed as she swung her legs over the edge of the bed, the dream’s vivid remnants still clinging to her like static. Sleep was clearly a lost cause. She padded softly down the hallway, her bare feet cool against the floorboards.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She peeked into Nicky’s room, her heart softening at the sight of him curled up in his bed, one hand clutching his stuffed dinosaur. The steady rhythm of his breathing brought her some comfort, grounding her in the quiet normalcy of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sweet dreams, love,” she whispered, brushing a stray curl from his forehead before quietly pulling the door closed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Back in her study, she switched on the lamp, the warm glow spilling over her desk. A stack of essays loomed in front of her—an ever-present reminder of her responsibilities. “Might as well make use of this insomnia,” she muttered, settling into her chair and picking up the top paper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She froze when her eyes landed on the name typed neatly at the top: <em>Rio Vidal<strong>.</strong></em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” she murmured, a dry laugh escaping her lips. It was almost comical how the universe seemed intent on putting Rio at the forefront of her mind tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled and began to read. As usual, Rio’s work was exemplary—sharp, insightful, and brimming with passion. Her analysis of the pervasive shadow of trauma and silenced voices in poetry was hauntingly beautiful, her voice confident yet tinged with a vulnerability that struck a chord in Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She found herself lingering over certain phrases, rereading them not just for their academic merit but for the glimpses they offered into Rio’s mind. There was a rawness in her writing, a deep understanding of grief and mortality that felt almost too personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Brilliant,” Agatha murmured, making a note in the margin. Her pen hesitated for a moment before she added, <em>“Your insights continue to impress, Miss Vidal. Your voice is one of a kind.”</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she set the paper aside, Agatha leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. The dream, the paper, the lingering emotions—all of it swirled together in her chest, refusing to settle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I need to get a grip,” she muttered, standing and heading for the kitchen to make herself some tea. But as she waited for the kettle to boil, her thoughts drifted back to Rio, to the way her eyes sparkled when she spoke of her thesis, the quiet confidence in her demeanor, the graceful way she moved both in and out of the classroom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, trying to dismiss the warmth spreading through her. <em>It’s just fascination,</em> she told herself. <em>Pure admiration for a bright student. Nothing more.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But the whisper of doubt in the back of her mind suggested otherwise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed her palms flat against the countertop, the cool surface grounding her as the kettle began to whistle. She moved mechanically, pouring the boiling water over a tea bag, letting the steam rise and swirl around her. But the ritual didn’t calm her tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the back of her mind, she knew it wasn’t just fascination or admiration. It was something more. Something she didn’t want to name, didn’t dare to name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a sip of tea, the heat sliding down her throat, but it didn’t burn away the truth that had been quietly building.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had awakened something in her—something Agatha hadn’t felt in years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her fascination had turned into a kind of preoccupation. The moments they spent together, whether in the formal confines of her office or the fleeting encounters outside class, lingered far longer than they should have. The memory of Rio curled up on her couch, reading and waiting for her to come home, felt oddly intimate in a way that kept her awake at night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And the way her heart had fluttered when Rio called her <em>Agatha,</em> the way she’d agreed to it so easily, as though it were natural—<em>too</em> natural.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is dangerous,” Agatha whispered into the stillness, her tea forgotten in her hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wasn’t naïve. She knew the risks of crossing certain lines, and she had no intention of doing so. But no matter how firmly she told herself this, her thoughts betrayed her, replaying stolen glances and quiet moments between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound of the clock ticking in the corner brought her back to the present. Agatha set the mug down with a soft thud, her resolve hardening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This needs to stop,” she said to herself, her tone firmer this time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She would focus on being Rio’s professor, her mentor, her guide. Nothing more. Because allowing it to be more—allowing herself to acknowledge the feelings she didn’t want to name—would jeopardize everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, as she moved to turn off the kitchen light, the image of Rio’s smile lingered, a soft glow she couldn’t quite extinguish. She shook her head, forcing her head to quiet down.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she settled back in bed, a new wave of determination washing through her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This ended now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped into the classroom with her usual confidence, the steady click of her heels punctuating the quiet hum of pre-class chatter. She reminded herself of her resolve: today, she would be the model of professionalism, nothing more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wouldn’t indulge the wayward thoughts that had been creeping into her mind or the subtle pull she felt toward Rio Vidal. This was her domain—a space of intellect and discipline. Emotions had no place here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning,” she greeted the class with a brisk nod, setting her leather-bound notebook on the desk. Her gaze swept across the room, briefly settling on Rio before moving on. It took every ounce of her willpower not to linger. Rio looked tired but focused, her pen already poised for notes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The seminar began smoothly, with Agatha launching into an analysis of E. E. Cummings’ <em>Tulips and Chimneys</em>. She kept her tone measured and her interactions strictly academic. No stray glances, no warm smiles. Just her lecture and the occasional question to the group.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But as the minutes ticked by, the detachment felt wrong. It wasn’t her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio raised her hand to contribute, Agatha almost hesitated before nodding and calling on her. “Miss Vidal,” she said, her voice carefully neutral her tone sharp.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio faltered briefly but pressed on. Her response was thoughtful, weaving in an analysis of the aesthetic of fragmentation as occupying both the positive and negative space of the page in Cummings’ work. Her insight was sharp, her delivery impassioned, and for a moment, Agatha’s resolve faltered. She could feel the class watching Rio with admiration, but Agatha’s own reaction went deeper. She had always respected her student’s intellect, but now it felt like a tug she couldn’t ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s an interesting interpretation,” Agatha replied, her voice cool. “Though it seems to lack sufficient textual evidence. Your argument could benefit from more grounding in the poem’s language.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes flickered with a mix of confusion and hurt, but she nodded politely and sank back into her seat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hated herself instantly. It wasn’t that Rio’s point lacked merit—if anything, it had been one of the most insightful contributions of the session so far. But Agatha couldn’t let herself soften, couldn’t risk slipping into familiar ease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of the class passed in a blur of stilted discussion. Agatha kept her tone impersonal, her interactions brisk. When another student repeated an idea Rio had already presented, Agatha praised them without acknowledging Rio’s earlier contribution.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the end of the hour, a palpable tension hung in the air. Agatha dismissed the class without so much as a glance in Rio’s direction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the students packed up, Rio lingered at her desk, organizing her notes with deliberate slowness. Agatha felt the weight of her presence but didn’t look up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Have a good day, Professor,” Rio said softly as she passed the desk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha only managed a nod, her throat too tight to form words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the door closed behind Rio, Agatha slumped in her chair, head in her hands. Her attempt at professionalism had crossed into coldness, and she’d taken it out on the one student who didn’t deserve it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t supposed to feel like this. It wasn’t supposed to <em>hurt.</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">Rio felt the shift the moment Agatha walked into the classroom that day. The usual warmth, subtle and steady like a low-burning ember, had been replaced by something distant and cold. It wasn’t overt, but it didn’t need to be—Rio had always been finely attuned to the way people carried themselves, and today, Agatha seemed different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At first, Rio told herself she was imagining it. Agatha Harkness wasn’t known for being overtly warm, especially in a professional setting. But the curt tone, the sharp responses, the lack of acknowledgment—those were new, and they stung more than she wanted to admit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the seminar ended, Rio’s chest felt heavy with a mix of confusion and unease. She replayed the class in her mind as she walked back to her apartment. Had she said something wrong? Did her analysis truly lack evidence, or was Agatha simply having a bad day?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her stomach churned with the thought that it might be something else entirely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Maybe she regrets letting things get so casual.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That possibility gnawed at her more than it should have. Rio had always been careful, even when her feelings for Agatha had started to grow beyond admiration. She’d kept her tone neutral during office hours, avoided lingering too long after class—she’d done everything to stay professional.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, here she was, fretting over what felt like a rejection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time she reached her building, Rio was exhausted—not from the walk, but from the emotional weight she’d been carrying all day. She slumped onto her couch, staring at the ceiling, willing herself to stop overthinking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But the truth was, it hurt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not just because Agatha had been cold, but because Rio had begun to hope—against all reason—that maybe there was something more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And today had felt like the sharp closing of a door she hadn’t even realized she’d been standing in front of.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That evening, Agatha sat at the kitchen table with a glass of wine in one hand and a pile of essays in front of her. She hadn’t been able to focus all day, and her thoughts kept returning to Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her decision to be strictly professional had seemed logical—necessary, even. But the way Rio’s face had fallen during class… Her thoughts kept circling back to the day’s class and the way Rio’s shoulders had seemed a little more slumped, her voice a little quieter. It hadn’t been her intention to be cruel. Agatha had merely wanted to create distance, to remind them both of their boundaries. Agatha had told herself that being professional was the right thing to do—for both of them. But the cold distance she’d forced between them had felt wrong in every possible way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead, it seemed she’d only succeeded in hurting Rio, and the knowledge sat like a lead weight in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her brooding was interrupted when Nicky shuffled into the kitchen in his dinosaur pajamas, holding a stuffed dragon under one arm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mommy?” he said softly, hugging the dragon close.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, sweetheart?” Agatha forced herself to smile at him, though her chest felt tight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you think dance class made Miss Rio sad today?” he asked, his little brow furrowed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question struck her like a blow. She blinked, caught off guard. “What makes you think she was sad?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked down at his dragon, fiddling with its tail. “She didn’t smile as much. And when she did, it wasn’t the same. Like…” He searched for the right words. “Like her heart wasn’t happy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha swallowed hard, guilt twisting in her stomach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe…” Nicky continued, “she didn’t like dance today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The innocence of his question made Agatha’s heart ache. “Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured, pulling him into her lap. She pressed a kiss to his head, inhaling the comforting scent of his shampoo.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dance class hadn’t made Rio sad. Agatha had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nestled against her, still holding his dragon. “I like Miss Rio,” he said sleepily. “She’s the best teacher.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know you do,” Agatha replied softly, stroking his hair. “She’s wonderful.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And I hurt her today, she thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, pressing a kiss to Nicky’s temple. “Thank you for telling me, sweetheart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she tucked Nicky into bed later that night, his innocent question lingered in her mind. She had tried to protect herself, to create boundaries, but all she had done was make someone she cared about feel small.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat on the edge of Nicky’s bed, watching his little chest rise and fall in sleep. She resolved to fix things—to apologize, somehow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But more than that, she resolved to stop running from the truth that had been building quietly in her heart: she cared about Rio. Perhaps too much. But pretending otherwise wasn’t an option anymore. At some point, honesty would be necessary.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, Agatha stopped by the local café near campus for her usual coffee. She had been up most of the night, alternating between grading papers and trying to suppress the growing guilt over her behavior toward Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She was stirring her coffee absentmindedly when a familiar voice broke through her thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked up to see Lilia standing a few feet away, balancing a tray of pastries and a cup of tea. She was as composed as Agatha remembered from their first meeting, her warm smile slightly disarming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia,” Agatha said, straightening in her seat. “What a surprise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled. “Small world, isn’t it? Mind if I join you for a moment?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gestured to the seat across from her. “Not at all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Lilia settled into the chair, Agatha found herself studying the older woman, remembering the protective, almost maternal energy she’d radiated the night Rio had been drunk. It was clear she cared deeply for Rio. They talked about everything and anything for a bit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Speaking about work, how’s my Rio doing?” Lilia asked casually as she sipped her tea.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, her guilt flaring again. “She’s been quiet in class lately,” she admitted, trying to keep her tone neutral.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia frowned, setting down her cup. “I’ve noticed the same thing. She’s been… off. I can’t put my finger on it. She didn’t even say much when she came over for dinner the other night, and that’s not like her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a pang in her chest. “Did she say why?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia shook her head. “No, and I didn’t want to push. But something’s weighing on her, I can tell. She’s good at hiding it, but not from me.” She gave Agatha a pointed look, as if trying to gauge her reaction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha managed a small nod, her mind racing. She couldn’t help but wonder how much of Rio’s mood was because of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio’s resilient, though,” Lilia continued, her voice tinged with pride. “She’s been through a lot, but she always finds her way back. Still, I worry. She doesn’t let many people in, you know?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s throat tightened. She wanted to ask more, to understand what Lilia meant, but she knew it wasn’t her place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead, she offered a quiet, “I’ll keep an eye on her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, but her gaze lingered on Agatha, as though she was trying to decipher something unspoken. “I’m glad Rio has someone like you in her corner,” she said finally.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha forced a polite smile, her guilt growing tenfold, but as Lilia left, her words hung heavy in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Someone like me? Agatha thought bitterly. All I’ve done is push her away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She finished her coffee, but the bitterness on her tongue had little to do with the drink. If Lilia, someone who clearly knew Rio inside and out, was worried, then perhaps Agatha needed to stop pretending she could keep her distance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio spent the afternoon in the dance center, her favorite escape from the spiraling weight of her thoughts. The rhythmic thud of the piano keys and the soft shuffling of the children’s feet as they practiced their steps filled the room with a soothing energy. But despite her best efforts to focus, a part of her mind remained snagged on the coldness that had seeped into Dr. Harkness’s demeanor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the kids left class, waving excitedly and chattering about their next recital, Rio leaned against the barre, exhaling slowly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Snap out of it, Vidal,</em> she scolded herself silently. She had promised herself she wouldn’t let this situation drag her down further. Yet, no matter how many times she told herself it didn’t matter—that Agatha’s distant behavior was probably just a fluke—it still hurt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And it stung even more to realize how much she <em>wanted</em> Agatha’s approval.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She looked up to see Nicky standing at the door, his tiny dance bag slung over his shoulder. He hesitated, then padded over to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s up, buddy?” she asked, crouching down to his level.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He wrung his hands. “Are you sad?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, startled. “What makes you say that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You look sad,” he said simply, his wide, earnest eyes searching her face. “Mama says people shouldn’t hide their feelings.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled faintly, her heart softening. “I’m okay, Nicky. Just had a lot on my mind. But thank you for asking—that’s very sweet of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The boy grinned, clearly satisfied with her answer. “Okay. I’ll tell Mama you’re not sad anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her stomach twisted at the mention of Agatha, she didn’t think she would have been a subject of conversation between mother and son, but she quickly pushed it aside. “That sounds like a plan. Now, scoot—your mom’s probably waiting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky bounded out of the studio, Rio straightened and grabbed her bag. She was determined to shake this off, even if it meant faking it until she made it. She couldn’t let her feelings for Agatha—whatever they were—consume her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She pulled out her phone and texted Alice: <em>Are you free tonight? I need a distraction.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s response was almost immediate: <em>Always. Bring wine.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, tucking her phone away. She would push forward, even if it was easier said than done. Because the alternative—letting this spiral of confusion and rejection take over—wasn’t an option.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio arrived at Alice’s apartment a little while later, carrying two bottles of wine, the weight of the glass offering her some small sense of stability. She knocked on the door, and within seconds, it swung open to reveal Alice, already grinning in anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re here! I’ve got the perfect spot on the couch ready,” Alice said with a wink, pulling her inside. “What’s the deal, huh? You’ve been texting me like a fiend all day, and now you’re bringing more wine than I thought you would. Sounds like a serious mood to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “It’s complicated. I think I’ve made everything more complicated than it needs to be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice led her to the couch and grabbed a corkscrew, uncorking one of the bottles and pouring them each a glass. “Complicated sounds like a special kind of disaster. Spill.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a sip of the wine, savoring the warmth as it slid down her throat. She hesitated, unsure where to start. “It’s about Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised an eyebrow, leaning back against the arm of the couch. “Ahh, of course. I should’ve known. You’ve been out of sorts for weeks now. What happened?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio set her glass down on the coffee table, her fingers fidgeting around the base. “I don’t know… she’s been distant. Like, <em>really</em> distant. It's been a few days an I haven’t been able to shake it off. I don’t even know if she <em>cares</em> about me outside of being her student.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice tilted her head. “What makes you think she doesn’t care? Because she’s been a little colder in class?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded. “Yeah, and I’ve tried to give her space, but I <em>feel</em> it, Alice. It’s like… she’s pulling away. And it hurts, especially because I don’t know why. I thought… I thought there was something there before, you know?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice sipped her wine thoughtfully, tapping the side of her glass. “Maybe it’s more complicated for her than it is for you? Like, maybe she’s trying to keep it professional and she doesn’t know how to handle whatever <em>this</em> is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know,” Rio murmured. “She’s been so cold. It feels like she doesn’t even want to look at me, like she’s… regretting everything. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing to regret, nothing happened. I just want things to go back to normal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice gave her a knowing look. “But you don’t want them to be normal, do you? You’re craving something else—something more.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze, meeting her friend’s gaze. She didn’t even have to say it out loud. Alice always understood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this,” Rio admitted quietly, her voice almost a whisper. “I’m not sure if I want to forget about it or… make it work somehow.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice placed a hand on Rio’s shoulder. “Rio, look. I know it’s messy, but what you feel is real. And the fact that Agatha is so complicated about it only makes it more real, you know?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a long breath. “But what if it’s just my imagination? What if I’m reading too much into everything and making things worse than they are?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Then we’ll deal with that when it happens,” Alice said with a grin. “But until then, we’re drinking wine and making bad decisions tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh. Alice was always the right kind of distraction when things got too heavy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Bad decisions sound good right about now,” Rio said, leaning back into the couch, her fingers tapping the side of her glass. “I just need to figure out what to do next.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised her glass with a smirk. “One step at a time, my friend. And for now, that step is enjoying this wine and getting out of your head for a little while.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, taking another sip, feeling the wine beginning to work its magic. Maybe she wasn’t going to solve everything tonight, but at least for now, she didn’t have to think about it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio woke with a groan, the familiar dull throb of a hangover quickly reminding her of last night’s excess. She blinked, squinting at the clock on the wall. Her heart skipped a beat. <em>8:15.</em> She was late for class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She shot up from the couch, her limbs stiff and heavy, the remnants of her wine-induced haze still clouding her thoughts. Alice was still asleep, sprawled on the opposite side of the couch, a blanket tangled around her legs. Rio didn’t have time to be quiet. She threw off the pajamas Alice had leant her and threw on the nearest clothes, the same outfit she’d worn the night before—now crinkled and slightly disheveled from the spontaneous couch nap.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Panic set in as she rushed to grab her bag and dashed out the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Rio entered the lecture hall, she was out of breath, her face flushed from the rush. She hadn’t even had a chance to check herself in the mirror, but she knew she looked disheveled. Her hair was wild, her shirt wrinkled, and her eyes were slightly bloodshot from both the alcohol and lack of sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, of course, her gaze met Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tried to shake off the sudden wave of anxiety, but Agatha’s expression was unmistakable. It was brief, almost imperceptible, but Rio could tell. There was something in the way Agatha’s gaze lingered on her for just a moment too long.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>She noticed.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart sank. She felt a sudden pang of self-consciousness. Was it the way she looked? Agatha wasn’t exactly the type to comment on appearances, but Rio could tell something was bothering her. As she made her way to her seat, she tried to shake it off, but she couldn’t stop the thought from nagging at her—<em>Agatha must think I was with someone else last night.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mind raced as she sat down, her heart still pounding. She was late, and worse, her professor was clearly <em>looking</em> at her. It wasn’t just a glance—it was a stare, a subtle flicker of something unreadable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Agatha did nothing to acknowledge it. She was all business as usual. She began the lecture, her tone detached, professional, and steady, but Rio could swear there was a new coldness to it today. Was it just her, or had Agatha’s demeanor shifted yet again?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Agatha was having her own internal battle. Seeing Rio so disheveled, so <em>unpolished</em> as she entered the room stirred something deep within her. She didn’t know why it bothered her so much. Maybe it was the fact that Rio had spent the night out, and it wasn’t with her. Agatha couldn’t help but feel an unexpected jealousy gnaw at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She watched Rio settle into her seat, trying to act casual, but Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed. <em>What did that mean?</em> she wondered, but quickly pushed the thought aside, focusing on the lecture.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She told herself not to think too much into it. <em>Rio is her student.</em> That was it. No more, no less. Agatha couldn’t afford to feel any other way about her—especially not jealousy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But despite her best efforts to push it away, the thought lingered, as did the nagging delicious unease that now seemed to follow her whenever Rio was around.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha walked across campus, her mind still slightly distracted by the morning’s lecture and her complicated thoughts about Rio, something caught her eye—a brightly colored flier pinned to a bulletin board. It was hard to miss, the bold letters and striking design almost daring anyone to glance at it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Three of Swords – Live Friday Night!”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her gaze lingered on the flier. The band’s name jumped out at her. <em>Three of Swords.</em> She felt a flicker of recognition. Rio’s band, of course. She remembered the energy of the night, Rio on stage, the rawness of the music filling the air, and the way Rio had looked when she’d caught her eye in the crowd. She couldn’t help but feel a slight shift in her chest at the memory.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The date for the gig was this Friday night. It was almost strange to see it in print, as if a reminder had slipped its way into her consciousness. The last time had been unexpected and she had been invited. This time, however, Agatha couldn’t help but wonder if she should go again. There had been something about the way Rio had performed, something that lingered with her long after the night had ended. But had promised herself to distance herself, to put an end to what could very easily into dangerous territory.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her phone buzzed, breaking her out of her thoughts. She quickly glanced at it but couldn’t quite shake the feeling that she was being drawn to the idea of going again. It had been a spontaneous choice the first time, but now there was that pull again—a curiosity, yes, but something more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe it was the way Rio had looked at her then. Or the way Agatha had found herself looking at Rio. She couldn’t exactly pinpoint it, but there was something unresolved. Agatha knew she should keep her distance, that she couldn’t get more involved than she already was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Maybe just one more time, and then never again</em>—she told herself. But deep down, she already knew that it wouldn’t be <em>just</em> one more time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tucked the flier into her bag, her fingers lingering on it for just a moment longer than necessary.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She just couldn’t stay away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night had finally arrived. The low hum of anticipation buzzed in the air, the kind of energy that could only come before a live performance. The band members, already backstage, could feel the familiar mix of excitement and nerves knotting their stomachs as they prepared for their set.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood with her back to the wall, eyes closed, trying to center herself. She could hear Alice and Jen chatting and warming up nearby, but her mind was elsewhere. She had spent the whole day pushing the thought of Agatha’s rejection out of her head, but now, as the night approached, the reminder of her professor’s absence loomed. Agatha had come to the last performance because she had invited her, and Rio had caught glimpses of her in the crowd, but now—tonight—there was an unfamiliar weight in her chest. She couldn’t stop thinking about what it would mean if Agatha showed up again. She didn’t think she would, considering the way things were between them at the moment, and she hadn’t invited her. But still, she couldn’t help but hope.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Just focus on the music,</em> she told herself, though the mantra wasn’t as soothing as it usually was. She took a deep breath, trying to focus on the drumsticks in her hands, tapping them against the side of her leg rhythmically, trying to find the steady beat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice noticed her distant expression and smirked. “Nervous about something besides the performance?” she teased, nudging Rio with her elbow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen laughed from across the room, strumming a few chords on her guitar. “Oh, we know what’s going on. You’re still thinking about the professor, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen didn’t know the whole thing but has noticed the admiration Rio had for her supervisor and had joined in on the teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot them both a look of mock annoyance, but deep down, she knew they were right. The memory of Agatha’s cool demeanor, her gaze that lingered just a bit too long at the last gig, made her stomach twist with something far more complicated than just nerves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can we not talk about her right now?” Rio muttered, though a blush crept up her neck, betraying her. “Let’s just focus on the show. That’s the only thing that matters tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right, right,” Alice said with a wink, although she couldn’t completely hide her grin. “You got it, Rio. Just… try not to blush too much if she shows up, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could respond that she wouldn’t, the manager poked his head into the room, giving them the signal that they were about to go on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Five minutes, people!” he called.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a collective breath, the band stood up from their seats and gathered around their instruments. Rio adjusted her drum kit, checking the tuning of everything. The music was what she loved—what she had always loved—but there was something about the weight of tonight that made it different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The chatter from the crowd outside the venue grew louder, the anticipation swelling with every passing moment. The lights dimmed, and the opening song was cued.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright,” Rio muttered under her breath. “Let’s do this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And with that, she walked onto the stage, her heart pounding—but this time, she wasn’t sure if it was just the music she was nervous about.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The first chords rang out, the energy of the crowd hit her, and the band was in motion. Rio settled into the rhythm, her focus shifting to the sound of her drumsticks striking the skins. She was back in the music, no longer thinking about anything else. Or at least, she tried not to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But as the performance continued, there was one thing Rio couldn’t ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the back of the crowd, a familiar face watched her from the shadows. Against all odds, Agatha was there.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood at the back of the crowd, her eyes fixed on the stage, watching Rio with a fascination that she couldn’t quite shake off. The way Rio moved, the energy she exuded—there was something captivating about her. It wasn’t just the raw power of the music or the way she hit the drums with such intensity. It was the way she seemed completely absorbed, lost in the rhythm, and how her focus seemed to pull Agatha in, making everything else blur into the background.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Here, on stage, the young woman was so unapologetically herself. The way Rio’s eyes sparkled with passion, the way she leaned into the music—it was like watching someone come alive in front of her eyes, and Agatha couldn’t look away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha watched Rio, she noticed everything about her in a way she hadn’t before. The way her hair framed her face—wild and untamed in the best possible way—made her look so effortlessly beautiful. The way her hands remained graceful, despite the force of her movements, the way her eyes sparkled with the thrill of the music—it all made Agatha’s pulse quicken, her thoughts straying to places she hadn’t wanted to go.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Rio’s outfit, simple yet striking, seemed to add to her charm. It wasn’t flashy, but it suited her perfectly, the kind of casual attire that somehow made her look both carefree and completely confident. Her black oversized shirt hung loosely on her frame, the fabric soft and flowing in the dim glow of the stage lights, almost as though it had been designed to accentuate her every movement. With every subtle shift of Rio’s body, the shirt caught the light, sending small ripples across the fabric, causing it to shimmer in the most tantalizing way. It highlighted the curves of her arms, the lines of her collarbone—those soft, elegant contours that Agatha had somehow found herself memorizing, no matter how hard she tried not to. And then there was the way the shirt grazed the curve of her neck, unbuttoned a few buttons more than necessary, the delicate space just below her jaw that seemed to beckon for Agatha’s attention and lower…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>No</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was when Rio took a moment to glance at the audience, locking eyes with Agatha for a split second, that Agatha felt something shift in her chest. The connection was brief, but it was enough to send a jolt of awareness through her. Her heart fluttered, and in that moment, it was as if the entire world around them disappeared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She caught herself, pushing the thought away immediately, trying to focus on the music, on the band, on anything but the way Rio was making her feel. But it didn’t work. Every note, every strum of the guitar, every beat of the drums—Agatha noticed it all, but it was Rio who dominated her thoughts. She felt herself falling, little by little, into something she couldn’t control.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio spotted Agatha in the crowd, her heart skipped a beat. It wasn’t just the surprise of seeing her there—it was the rush of emotions that came with it. She hadn’t expected Agatha to show up tonight. After all, she hadn’t even told her when the gig was happening, and Agatha had been so distant all week, keeping their interactions purely professional in class. The sight of her, standing there, her posture poised and her eyes locked on Rio, brought something to the surface that Rio hadn’t anticipated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The music seemed to intensify in Rio’s ears, her heartbeat matching the rhythm of the drums, but it wasn’t just the adrenaline of performing. No, it was the way Agatha was looking at her, like she was truly seeing her in a way that made everything feel different. Her gaze wasn’t just assessing—there was something deeper, something more personal. Rio felt a warmth spread through her chest, an undeniable pull that sent a jolt of electricity through her body.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a brief moment, she faltered, her focus wavering as she locked eyes with Agatha, but it was only for an instant. The connection between them, brief yet intense, gave Rio a burst of energy, something she couldn’t quite explain. It was as though her entire body was alive with a new kind of fire, her movements sharper, more confident, more alive than before. She didn’t know why, but seeing Agatha there, even after the way the professor had been keeping her distance, made everything feel like it mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was confusing, exhilarating, and frightening all at once. She wanted to break the distance between them, wanted to do something—anything—that would make that look Agatha had given her real. But for now, all she could do was keep playing, keep performing, letting the music carry her through the tension that lingered in the air between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the song came to an end, Rio caught her breath, her eyes searching for Agatha in the crowd once again. She couldn’t tell if it was the excitement of the performance or the effect Agatha had on her, but there was no denying that something had shifted. She couldn’t get the image of Agatha’s gaze out of her mind, and it was making it harder to focus on anything else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She exited the stage before her thoughts could linger any longer. Agatha had made it clear that she didn’t want anything to do with her. But why was she here then?</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify">As the buzz of the performance faded, Rio slipped out the back door of the venue, letting it creak shut behind her. The cool night air was a shock against her flushed skin, still warm from the stage lights and the pulsing energy of the crowd. She let out a deep breath, the adrenaline from the show coursing through her veins like a wild current. She loved performing, but it always left her feeling a little unmoored, as if the rush had taken a piece of her she wasn’t ready to give up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Reaching into her jacket pocket, Rio pulled out a slightly crumpled pack of cigarettes. Her hands trembled faintly as she tapped one out and lit it with a flick of her lighter. The sharp scent of tobacco mixed with the faint tang of city air, grounding her. She leaned back against the cool brick wall, her head tilting up to look at the stars barely visible above the streetlights.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The muffled hum of music and voices from inside the venue carried faintly on the air, but out here, it was quieter. Calmer. She closed her eyes, taking a long drag from her cigarette and letting the smoke curl lazily out of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her solitude lasted only a moment. Footsteps echoed faintly from the alleyway, measured and deliberate. Rio didn’t open her eyes, assuming it was just another band member or someone sneaking out for their own moment of peace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mind if I join you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The voice was low, smooth, and immediately recognizable. Rio’s eyes snapped open, her pulse quickening for an entirely different reason. She turned her head to see Agatha standing a few feet away, her hands tucked casually into the pockets of her long coat. The dim glow of the streetlamp caught the glint of her necklace and cast shadows across her sharp, elegant features.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could respond, Agatha stepped closer, her gaze flicking to the cigarette between Rio’s fingers. Without asking, she plucked it from her hand, her movements so smooth that Rio didn’t even think to protest. Agatha brought the cigarette to her lips, taking a deliberate drag, her eyes never leaving Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio watched, her breath catching for reasons she didn’t fully understand. Agatha exhaled slowly, the smoke curling in the air between them like some kind of spell. “Nasty habit,” Agatha remarked, but not handing the cigarette back to Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio snorted softly. “You’re one to talk.” Her lips twitched, but she didn’t smile. Instead, she leaned back against the wall, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studied Agatha. “You don’t seem like the type to hang around backstage at gigs like this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And you don’t seem like the type to need a smoke break to collect yourself,” Agatha countered smoothly, her voice calm but probing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio watched her, her heart thumping in her chest. It felt surreal. There was something about the way Agatha stood there, so composed, yet so close, that made Rio feel… exposed. Not just physically, but emotionally. It was as if everything she had been trying to suppress, all the feelings that had been building up in her chest, were suddenly on the verge of spilling out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, they both stood in silence, the only sound the occasional hiss of the cigarette burning and the distant hum of the night. Rio wasn’t sure if Agatha had come out here to say something, or if she was just seeking a bit of solitude too. Either way, Rio didn’t know how to break the silence. She wasn’t sure what to say, or if she should say anything at all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was no safety in Agatha’s presence, not in the way Rio usually defined it. Agatha wasn’t soft edges and soothing words. She was edges honed sharp, her calm presence stripping away the protective armor Rio had spent years perfecting. It left her feeling raw, unguarded, as if every thought she’d been keeping locked away had suddenly risen to the surface, ready to spill over with one wrong move.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a slow drag from the cigarette, her eyes briefly breaking away to watch the smoke dissipate into the night air. Her movements were unhurried, each one precise, as though she were in no rush to break the tension stretching between them. But Rio could feel it—Agatha’s awareness, her ability to read the spaces people didn’t want to share. And it made Rio want to hide even as she fought the pull to stay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha finally glanced back at her, Rio felt herself stiffen. That unreadable expression made her stomach twist in knots. Was it curiosity? Amusement? Or something else entirely? Whatever it was, it unsettled her in a way that was equal parts thrilling and terrifying.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha held her gaze for what felt like an eternity, then exhaled, the smoke leaving her lips in a steady stream. Still, she said nothing, though her presence spoke volumes. Rio thought she might’ve preferred if Agatha would just say something—anything—to break the spell. But then Agatha extended the cigarette, her hand brushing against Rio’s as she passed it back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Agatha murmured, her voice so soft it barely cut through the quiet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The contact was fleeting, no more than a second, but it left Rio’s skin tingling, as though Agatha’s touch had somehow left an imprint. She took the cigarette back, her fingers lingering over the filter as if it might hold the answer to whatever was happening between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio inhaled deeply, but even the smoke didn’t seem to ground her this time. Her mind was racing, her pulse hammering in her ears. She told herself she was imagining it, the way Agatha’s presence seemed to draw out emotions she’d buried long ago. It wasn’t real, she reasoned. It couldn’t be. And yet, the air between them felt alive with unspoken possibilities.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted slightly, leaning back against the wall beside Rio. The move felt deliberate, almost casual, but the space between them felt even smaller now, like they were occupying the same breath of air. Rio wasn’t sure if she wanted to move away or lean in closer, to say something or keep the silence intact.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re quiet tonight,” Agatha said finally, her voice low and smooth, with just a hint of something teasing beneath the surface.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced at her, lips twitching into the faintest of smirks. “You’re the one who came out here. Figured you wanted the quiet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a knowing smile, her gaze flicking to the cigarette still between Rio’s fingers. “Maybe I did. But quiet doesn’t mean empty.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung in the air, heavier than they should’ve been. Rio turned them over in her mind, trying to figure out if Agatha meant something more, or if she was just reading too much into things.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You always talk in riddles, or is it just for me?” Rio asked, her voice laced with an edge of sarcasm that felt safer than letting her real feelings show.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, the sound low and warm. “Maybe it’s just for you,” she said, her tone light but her gaze anything but.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her breath hitch. For a moment, it was like the rest of the world didn’t exist—the distant music, the muffled laughter from inside, the city buzzing beyond the alley. It all faded away, leaving just the two of them in this strange, intimate bubble.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t get you,” Rio said, the words slipping out before she could stop them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her head, her eyes meeting Rio’s with that same piercing intensity. “Maybe you’re not supposed to.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The response wasn’t what Rio expected, but it didn’t surprise her either. Agatha always seemed to operate just outside the lines of what was predictable, and it was part of what made her so maddening—and so captivating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Rio found her voice, though it felt like a fragile thing. “You didn’t have to come out here,” she said, trying to sound casual, but the tremble in her words betrayed the vulnerability she couldn’t hide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened for just a split second, her lips pressing into a thin line before she spoke. “I wanted to,” she replied, her tone simple but weighted with something more. She shoved her hands deep into her pockets, the movement so casual it almost made the moment feel normal, when nothing about it was. “You were good up there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat. She wasn’t sure if Agatha was talking about the performance or something else, something unsaid that hung in the air between them like a secret neither of them was ready to share. The way Agatha’s eyes lingered on her made Rio want to ask, but the words wouldn’t come. Not now, not when everything felt too delicate, too fragile to risk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They both stood there for a few more moments, the silence between them now thick with unspoken things. Agatha’s presence was overwhelming, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It was like something had shifted—something delicate, fragile, and Rio couldn’t help but wonder if Agatha felt it too.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s fingers twitched, the only movement breaking the stillness as she reached for the cigarette. She stubbed it out in the ashtray beside her, the sudden motion feeling too loud, too final. She didn’t want to break the moment, but it was slipping away, too quiet and too full of things she couldn’t name. She stood there, eyes fixed on the ground, unsure of what to do, what to say. There was so much weight in the air, in the way Agatha stood so close, and yet there was a space between them that felt like an abyss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tension grew heavier, thickening in the air as Agatha shifted, her weight slightly moving as though she was preparing to say something. Rio could feel it—a shift in the energy, like Agatha was about to speak, to explain something, maybe to apologize. Rio’s heart pounded in her chest as she braced for it. She thought she could read it in Agatha’s stance, in the way she opened her mouth, but before Agatha could say whatever was on her mind, something in Rio snapped.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without thinking, without fully realizing what she was doing, Rio closed the distance between them. She stepped forward, her breath shallow as she moved instinctively, drawn to Agatha like a magnet. She reached up, her hand trembling, betraying her as she cupped Agatha’s face. The moment her skin made contact with Agatha’s, everything seemed to pulse with something electric, something undeniable. Her heart raced, and she almost expected Agatha to pull back, to question it, but there was no time for that. Her hand moved on its own accord, and before she could second-guess herself, Rio kissed her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The world seemed to freeze for a moment, as though time itself had decided to hold its breath. Rio’s mind went blank, her heart pounding in her chest as her lips met Agatha’s in a brief, electrifying kiss. It was everything and nothing all at once—soft, quick, yet determined, as though the kiss was the culmination of something they both hadn’t been able to express until now. Every nerve in Rio’s body seemed to wake up, alive with the sensation of it, but just as quickly as it had started, Rio pulled away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her breath came out in sharp, uneven gasps, her wide eyes locked on Agatha in stunned disbelief. She hadn’t meant for it to happen. She hadn’t planned it. It was reckless, impulsive—everything she usually kept tightly under control. Her hands dropped to her sides, her face burning with embarrassment. It was as though the entire world had just shifted beneath her feet, and she was unsure how to stand on it anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry,” she said quickly, her voice trembling. “I—I shouldn’t have done that.” The words felt foreign on her tongue, and she regretted them as soon as they left her mouth. Her mind raced, her thoughts chaotic and unorganized. She couldn’t make sense of it, couldn’t reconcile what she had just done with everything she had known to be true. It was like the earth had tilted, and she was falling, helpless to stop it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before she could apologize again, before she could stumble over more words, Agatha’s hand reached out. It was soft at first, but it held a quiet power. Agatha’s fingers gently touched her lips, stilling the apology that had started to form. Rio froze, looking up at Agatha with confusion, guilt, and a thousand questions swirling in her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But before Rio could find her bearings, Agatha acted. In one swift motion, she pulled Rio back into a kiss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This time, there were no apologies, no hesitation. Agatha’s kiss was firm, deep, and unmistakably real. It wasn’t tentative or uncertain. It was a quiet assertion, a statement in itself—an unspoken declaration that this was right, that it was something more than the brief, stolen moment Rio had tried to run from. Agatha’s lips were warm, insistent, pulling Rio closer as though she were the gravity that held Rio in orbit, her presence both grounding and consuming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat, the pulse in her ears deafening, and in that instant, everything else faded into the background. There was no more room for thought, no more space for the doubts that had clouded Rio’s mind just moments before. All that remained was the sensation of Agatha’s kiss—daring, intense, and overwhelmingly powerful. Rio’s body responded before her mind could catch up, her hands lifting to rest on Agatha’s wrists, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric. The kiss deepened, and Rio’s chest tightened as Agatha’s arms wound around her neck, pulling her in closer, if that was even possible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In that moment, everything felt like it was exactly where it was meant to be—perfectly balanced, yet completely out of control. Rio felt a surge of emotion, of heat, running through her veins. It was raw and exhilarating, a feeling she couldn’t quite name but didn’t want to escape. And for a fleeting moment, she let herself be lost in it, allowed herself to surrender to the connection, to the pull between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha finally pulled away, just enough to catch her breath, her blue eyes were dark, intense, and searching Rio’s face as if she were trying to read her very soul. The space between them was charged, heavy with unspoken words and the residue of the kiss still lingering in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t apologize,” Agatha whispered, her voice low, thick with something that Rio couldn’t quite place—something raw, vulnerable, and dangerous. “You’re not the only one who’s been struggling with this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hit Rio like a wave, washing over her and leaving her breathless. She stood there, frozen, her heart pounding in her chest as the weight of what had just happened pressed down on her. She had kissed her professor. She had kissed Agatha—someone she had admired, respected, and tried to keep at a distance for so long. And now, in this strange, electric moment, Agatha was telling her that she had been struggling too.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s head spun, her thoughts tangled in a chaotic mess. “I—I didn’t know if…” she managed to say, her voice unsteady as she fought to process the rush of emotions swirling inside her. “I thought…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t let her finish. A soft, almost imperceptible laugh escaped her lips, the sound rich with a mix of relief and something else—something deep and knowing. Her thumb brushed against Rio’s cheek, tender, yet firm, as if to ground them both in the reality of what was happening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re not the only one who’s confused,” Agatha said again, her eyes softening, the tension between them shifting from uncertainty to something more comfortable, more intimate. “But we’ll figure it out, won’t we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words settled over Rio like a blanket, wrapping her in the warmth of Agatha’s quiet certainty. The vulnerability that had held her captive moments before began to ease, replaced by a fragile hope. She didn’t know what this was—what it could be—but the way Agatha was looking at her, the way she was holding her, made it feel like something possible, even inevitable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t know what to say, how to explain the surge of feelings bubbling up in her chest. She had been running from this for so long—this connection, this pull she couldn’t deny. But now, with Agatha standing there, so close, so real, something shifted in her. She could feel the weight of this new reality between them, and it didn’t feel impossible anymore. It felt like something they could navigate together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A gentle silence passed between them, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It was a silence filled with understanding, with a sense that they were both on the verge of something, unsure of exactly what it was, but unwilling to pull away from it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as Rio opened her mouth to respond, to say something—anything—more, the sharp sound of footsteps echoed down the alley, cutting through the quiet like a knife. Rio flinched, as if burned, and instinctively took a step back, her heart leaping in her chest. The unmistakable voice of Alice rang out, full of her usual playful mischief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio!” Alice called, her voice bright and teasing, clearly unaware of the tension in the air. “There you are. I was wondering where you—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice rounded the corner and stopped dead in her tracks, her gaze darting between Rio and Agatha. Her eyes flicked from Rio, still standing a little too close to Agatha—close enough to be intimate, but far enough to maintain some semblance of professional distance—to Agatha herself, her expression unreadable yet faintly amused. Alice’s eyebrows shot up, the surprise unmistakable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s stomach lurched, a knot tightening in her chest. She wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved or mortified by Alice’s sudden appearance. Her heart was still racing, the echoes of the kiss reverberating through her like an electric current, and now, with Alice standing there, it felt like everything was crashing back down. Her pulse was erratic, her mind a whirlwind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, for her part, didn’t flinch. She remained composed, her expression cool, but there was a subtle shift in her posture as she took a small step back, giving Rio a little more space. She didn’t speak right away, simply nodding in acknowledgment of Alice’s presence, her lips pressing into a tight smile that was still graceful, even in this awkward moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt,” Alice continued, her smirk lingering as she took in the scene before her, studying Rio and Agatha with a raised eyebrow. Her tone softened slightly, but there was no hiding the curiosity behind her teasing demeanor. “But seriously, Rio, we’ve got an afterparty to get to. You coming?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was still frozen for a moment, her mind scrambling to process everything. She wanted to laugh, to joke about the timing, but she couldn’t find the words. It was like the world had shifted beneath her feet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a small smile, her gaze flicking to Rio with a hint of Agatha, ever composed, gave a small, polite smile. Her eyes flicked to Rio with a subtle glimmer of amusement, a look that sent a strange shiver of warmth through Rio. That look—so soft, so understanding—finally broke through the haze of confusion clouding Rio’s mind. “Maybe next time, Alice,” she said smoothly, her voice still low. She wasn’t about to let this moment slip into awkwardness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised an eyebrow but didn’t push. “Right,” she said, her voice light. “I guess I’ll just leave you two to… whatever you’re talking about.” Her grin widened as she gave Rio a wink. “Don’t stay out here too long. It’s chilly, and we’ve got people waiting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face burned, a mixture of embarrassment and something else—something she couldn’t name—coursing through her veins. She wanted to disappear, to hide from the situation, but she couldn’t. “I—uh—I’ll be right there,” Rio finally managed to say, her voice unsteady and still shaking from the emotions swirling inside her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice didn’t seem to mind the stumble. With one last wink and a teasing smile, she turned on her heel and headed back toward the bar, her voice trailing off as she disappeared around the corner, leaving Rio alone with Agatha once more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now, in the stillness that followed, Rio looked up at Agatha, unsure of what to say. Alice’s unexpected interruption had cut through the tension, leaving them with the remnants of the moment hanging in the air between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was the first to break the silence, her voice soft but carrying an undertone of something that Rio couldn’t quite place. “I should go, too,” she murmured, though she made no move to leave just yet. She lingered, standing just a little too close, and Rio could still feel the heat from her presence, the magnetic pull between them still palpable in the quiet. Her pulse hadn’t settled, still racing from the kiss, from the electric tension in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, trying to steady her breath, her chest still tight with everything that had just transpired. She wanted to say something, anything, to keep the moment going, but words felt too fragile in the face of what was unfolding between them. Instead, with her heart still beating erratically, she gave a shaky smile, though it was unsure, uncertain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe… maybe next time?” Rio’s voice was tentative, like she wasn’t entirely sure if she had the right to ask for another moment, another chance at something she wasn’t sure she was ready for, yet couldn’t seem to let go of.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a soft smile, her eyes warm, but with a layer of thoughtfulness that made Rio’s chest tighten. “Maybe next time,” Agatha agreed, her voice carrying the weight of both possibility and caution. The air between them was thick with quiet tension, and Rio could feel it—the unspoken things hanging between them, fragile as glass but undeniably real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, without another word, Agatha stepped back, turning toward the street. Rio watched her for a long moment, standing still in the alley, surrounded by a swirling tide of emotions she couldn’t quite make sense of yet. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted—something irrevocable. The pull between them hadn’t faded. If anything, it had deepened. And though Agatha was walking away, it didn’t feel like it was over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But just as Agatha reached the mouth of the alley, she stopped. Rio’s breath caught as Agatha turned slightly, just enough to face her again. The brief moment of silence that followed felt heavy, laden with something Rio wasn’t sure how to interpret. And then Agatha spoke again, her voice lower, more serious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha began, her gaze steady and unwavering. “We both know this… this can’t get out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hit Rio like a cold wave. Her chest tightened at the gravity of them, and for a moment, everything around her seemed to fall away. It was as if the night had frozen in place, leaving only the echo of Agatha’s voice. She nodded, her throat tight, understanding all too well what Agatha meant. The boundaries between them—professional, ethical, personal—had been blurred, and if anyone found out, it would unravel everything. Their positions were precarious, and the consequences would be far-reaching. It wasn’t just about them. It was about everything they had worked for, everything they’d built.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Rio whispered, her voice quiet but resolute. “I don’t want to cause trouble. For you… or for me.” Her words felt like an apology, but they were also a promise—an acknowledgment that she understood the weight of the situation. And yet, even as she said it, there was a strange ache deep inside her, a longing for something that seemed impossible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened, though there was still an unmistakable caution in them. She nodded, her expression unreadable, but Rio could sense the resolution in her. “We need to be careful. It’s for the best, for both of us,” Agatha said, her tone unwavering but not unkind. There was something firm in her words, something that Rio knew was meant to protect them both, to keep them safe from the fallout of their desires. It wasn’t a rejection—far from it—but it was a boundary that had to be respected, a line that couldn’t be crossed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Rio responded, her voice thick with a mix of emotions she couldn’t quite untangle. She felt the flutter in her chest, a surge of hope mingling with the weight of reality. It was like standing on the edge of something dangerous and beautiful, wanting to leap but knowing the fall could be too great. She understood why it had to be this way, but that didn’t make it easier.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze lingered on her for a beat longer, her eyes searching Rio’s face as if she were trying to read her, to understand what was going on inside her. Finally, with a soft sigh, she took a small step back, as if preparing to leave, as if she were ready to pull herself away from the moment they had shared. “I’ll see you Monday, Rio. Let’s keep it professional. For now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words stung, but Rio didn’t flinch. She nodded, swallowing the lump in her throat, even though it felt like something was being taken from her. “Right,” Rio whispered, her voice almost distant, a faraway ache settling in her chest. “Monday.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, Agatha turned and walked away, her figure receding into the night. And just like that, the moment between them seemed to slip away, as if it had never happened at all, leaving Rio standing in the alley, surrounded by the aftermath of what had just passed. The night seemed colder now, quieter, the weight of Agatha’s absence pressing on her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio remained standing there for a few moments longer, her thoughts swirling like a storm inside her mind. The kiss. The way Agatha had looked at her. The way she had kissed her back. It had all felt so real, so undeniable. And yet, now, with the quiet of the night closing in, it felt like everything was slipping through her fingers, out of reach. She knew why it couldn’t happen. Knew why they had to keep it quiet. But that didn’t make it hurt any less.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, she took a deep breath, shaking off the lingering tension in her body as best as she could. She turned toward the bar, forcing herself to move forward, to step back into the reality she had to face, leaving the chaos of the night behind her. But as she walked inside, her heart still pounded in her chest, each beat a reminder of the connection they had shared. Agatha’s words echoed in her mind like a warning, a reminder of the line they couldn’t cross. “No one can know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, even as she heard the words in her mind, a part of her couldn’t shake the feeling that this wasn’t the end of their story.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>            (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">Over the weekend, both Agatha and Rio found themselves caught in the pull of their thoughts, each wrestling with the memory of the kiss and the undeniable chemistry that had sparked between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For Agatha, the days following the moment they shared were an emotional storm. As much as she tried to focus on work and Nicky, her mind kept drifting back to Rio—how soft her lips had been, how right it had felt in that instant, despite everything telling her it was wrong. The kiss lingered in her memory like a melody she couldn’t shake.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha had spent hours pacing her house late at night, trying to convince herself that it was a mistake, a fleeting moment of weakness. She had her son to think about, her career, and the consequences that would come from crossing that line. But no matter how many times she told herself it was wrong, the memory of Rio’s kiss kept circling back, haunting her thoughts with its intensity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Rio spent the weekend in a haze of confusion. She hadn’t expected to feel such a rush of emotions after the kiss, nor had she anticipated how deeply it would affect her. Each time she closed her eyes, she could still feel the press of Agatha’s lips against hers. It was a kiss that had made her heart race and her breath catch. But the guilt had followed quickly after, and the weight of their positions had crushed the excitement. They couldn’t do this, not without risking everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had tried to distract herself—playing drums with the band, spending time with Alice, even attending her usual dance class—but nothing seemed to pull her focus away from Agatha. Rio had hoped the kiss would fade into just another moment, but instead, it had cemented itself as something significant she couldn't erase.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Neither of them had reached out, not yet, and the silence between them only made things worse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Monday approached, they both knew they’d have to face each other again. But what would they say? What was left to say? Neither of them was sure, but the tension between them was undeniable, and now, a line had been crossed and there was no going back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Monday morning arrived, and the tension between Agatha and Rio was palpable, even though they were both doing their best to pretend nothing had changed. The events of the weekend, the kiss they shared, still hung heavily in the air, unspoken and unresolved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha walked into the seminar room, her usual composed demeanor felt more like a mask than usual. She couldn’t help but glance at Rio, who was sitting in the front row as always, her posture perfect, but the air between them seemed charged with something unspoken.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but notice how Rio was avoiding her gaze, focusing on her notes and refusing to meet her eyes. It felt like a delicate game—each of them trying to act as if the kiss had never happened, trying to keep up the pretense of normalcy, when both knew deep down that things had shifted drastically between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Throughout the class, their interactions were clipped and formal, and any glance or word exchanged was brief and carefully calculated. Agatha stuck to the syllabus, focused on the material, and refrained from letting her thoughts wander to Rio, even though it was nearly impossible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the same vein, Rio threw herself into her work, absorbing every word Agatha said without allowing herself to react. She couldn’t help but wonder if Agatha was as affected by what had happened as she was. Her mind was a mess, her emotions tangled and conflicted, but she couldn’t let it show—not in class, not where anyone might notice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The entire time, both women remained as professional as possible, pretending to not notice the weight of what had happened, but inside, they were both painfully aware. It was a strange, almost unbearable game of distance they played. Each avoided the other, hoping to escape the consequences of what they’d shared, yet neither could forget.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The week stretched out painfully, each day more uncomfortable than the last, as neither Agatha nor Rio could bring themselves to bridge the distance that had grown between them. They avoided each other with practiced precision, and though they were both present at the university, their paths never seemed to cross. The days blurred into one another, filled with work, distractions, and a lingering unease neither of them knew how to address.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha buried herself in her responsibilities, as she always did when life felt unmanageable. Between grading papers, preparing lectures, and looking after Nicky, she had little time to think about the kiss or what it had meant—or had it meant anything at all? She told herself it was a mistake, a lapse in judgment, something that could be written off, something to never be mentioned again. But in quiet moments, when she was alone with her thoughts, Agatha couldn’t shake the memory of the feeling of Rio’s lips against hers, the warmth of her breath, the tenderness that had surprised them both. It had felt like a spark, a dangerous one, but one that left her wanting more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, she refused to acknowledge it. She kept a tight grip on her emotions, pushing them down, convincing herself that everything would return to the way it had been. The past few days, though, had proven to her that nothing would be the same again—not with Rio, and certainly not with herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Rio found herself spiraling. She threw herself into rehearsals with the band, trying to lose herself in the music, hoping it would drown out the thoughts of Agatha that kept intruding at the most inconvenient times. Every song, every chord, felt hollow, as if she were just going through the motions. The band noticed, but they said nothing, offering knowing glances when she would drift off mid-song, her fingers halting in the middle of a riff.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She spent her time thinking about the kiss, about Agatha, about what it had meant—or what she had hoped it meant. Had it been a moment of weakness for Agatha, or had Rio misread the situation entirely? It was impossible to ignore the way Agatha had kissed her back,the soft words she had uttered afterwards, the fire that had sparked between them, but she couldn’t shake the doubt that it had all been a mistake. Agatha had been her professor, her supervisor, and Rio had always respected that boundary. But now, it was blurred, and Rio felt lost.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she wasn’t at rehearsal, she was either at the dance center, in class or at the library, trying to stay focused on her research for her thesis. It was almost an escape from everything else, a way to block out the emotions she didn’t want to face. She would lose herself in pages of poetry, trying to decipher the language of death that she had come to obsess over. There was something about the way those poets danced with the idea of mortality that felt comforting—perhaps because she felt like she, too, was dancing around something she didn’t fully understand. But no amount of poetry or analysis could block out the memory of Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The weekend passed in a blur. Saturday came and went without so much as a glance from Agatha. Rio performed with her band at a small venue, but the night felt empty. The music, her usual escape, couldn’t help her this time. Every note she played felt like it was floating in a void, without purpose, without meaning. She didn’t know why, but she couldn’t stop thinking about Agatha, about the way she had looked at her during their last encounter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By Sunday, Rio had made up her mind. She couldn’t keep avoiding Agatha. They needed to talk, to figure out what had happened between them—if only to stop the gnawing feeling that was driving her mad.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Monday rolled around, she found herself sitting in Agatha’s office once more. It had become a familiar space for her over the past months, but today, it felt different. The air between them was thick with unspoken tension. Agatha was busy with her papers, not even glancing up as Rio entered, but Rio could feel her presence, feel the weight of her gaze even when it wasn’t directed at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness,” Rio said softly, trying to sound professional, to keep herself together. “I think we need to talk.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t look up immediately, but the way her shoulders tensed told Rio everything she needed to know. When Agatha finally did look up, her expression was unreadable. “About what?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, then sat down across from her. “About what happened. Last week.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes flickered with something Rio couldn’t quite place, and for a moment, there was silence between them. The kind of silence that was too loud to ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know what you want me to say, Rio,” Agatha replied finally, her voice softer than usual. “I shouldn’t have—” she paused, clearly struggling with her own words. “It was a mistake.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart sank. “You think it was a mistake?” she asked, almost too quietly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha ran a hand through her hair, her gaze not meeting Rio’s. “I don’t know what I think. But it was wrong.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words stung, more than Rio had expected. She fought back the hurt, the anger, the confusion. “I don’t think it was wrong,” she said, her voice firm, despite the emotions threatening to spill over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes met hers then, and for a brief moment, the world seemed to stop. They were both holding back, both trying to figure out what to say, how to navigate the complicated mess they had found themselves in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think we need to figure this out, just like you said” Rio said, the words coming out before she could stop them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a breath, clearly torn, her fingers curling into fists on the edge of the desk as she looked at Rio, trying to find the right words. But the truth was, she was too afraid of what had happened, and even more terrified of what could come next. The kiss had been a mistake—she’d convinced herself of that over and over. It was a lapse in judgment, something that had thrown everything off balance, and now she wanted to put it behind them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” she began slowly, her voice tinged with uncertainty. “I think it’s best if we just forget about what happened. We should pretend it didn’t happen.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart dropped at the words, and for a moment, she thought she had misheard her. She blinked, trying to process Agatha’s request. Her mind raced, but her mouth felt dry, the words stuck in her throat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Forget?” Rio asked quietly, as though testing the word. She swallowed hard. “Just forget?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her eyes searching Rio’s face, her expression conflicted, torn between her own feelings and the overwhelming need to maintain professionalism, to push this complication aside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We can’t let this affect our work,” Agatha continued, though her voice lacked its usual certainty. “You’re my student, and I’m your supervisor. This… this complicates everything. We can’t let it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio wasn’t sure if it was the hurt, the confusion, or the shock that made her voice waver, but she couldn’t stop herself from speaking the words that had been haunting her since that night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But I don’t want to forget it,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t want to pretend it didn’t happen. It meant something to me. It was real to me."”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung in the air between them, thick with tension. Agatha’s gaze softened, but she quickly masked it, her professional composure returning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, please,” Agatha said, her tone firmer now, though the quiet vulnerability behind it was still there. “We can’t let this ruin everything we’ve worked for. It’s too risky—too complicated.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a rush of emotions surge through her: frustration, disappointment, and confusion. She had expected Agatha to at least acknowledge what had happened, to consider that it might not have been a mistake after all, but instead, she was asking Rio to erase it from her memory.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know if I can do that,” Rio said, standing up from her seat, her hands clenched at her sides. “It’s not that simple.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at her with a mixture of sadness and resolve, and for a moment, Rio thought she saw something like regret flicker across her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m asking you to try,” Agatha said softly, her voice almost pleading. “For both of our sakes, Rio. Just… pretend it didn’t happen.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words were like a cold slap to Rio’s heart, but she tried to steady herself. She didn’t want to be pushed away, didn’t want to let go of something that felt so real, but Agatha’s request—her plea—left Rio feeling small, insignificant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t just pretend,” Rio said, her voice stronger now, a hint of defiance slipping through. “I can’t pretend like it didn’t matter to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, neither of them spoke. Agatha’s eyes were soft, conflicted, and Rio could see the internal battle playing out behind them. She wanted to reach out, to make Agatha understand, but the distance between them felt too vast.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Agatha sighed, a tired sound, and nodded. “I know this isn’t easy, Rio,” she said, her voice breaking slightly. “But it’s for the best. We both have to move on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t respond immediately. She felt as if the ground had shifted beneath her feet. She wasn’t sure if Agatha’s words were meant to protect them both—or just to push Rio away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio left the office without another word, her heart pounding in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning felt different, quieter, and Agatha couldn’t pinpoint exactly why. She stood at the front of the classroom, staring out at the row of students who had settled into their seats, all appearing eager, if not slightly indifferent. But her gaze kept drifting to the empty spot near the front of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s seat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had hoped Rio would be there—she always was, even if just a little late, always with that subtle defiance in her posture. But today, there was no sign of her. No light click of her well-worn Converse against the floor, no rustling of papers, no bright, quiet energy that seemed to fill the space when she entered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tried to keep her focus on the lesson, tried to carry on as though everything was normal, as if the absence of Rio didn’t loom over her like a thick fog. But it did. The class felt incomplete without her—without Rio’s sharp, insightful questions, the way she would challenge Agatha’s interpretations, always bringing something new to the table. It was a feeling Agatha had become uncomfortably aware of in the past weeks, though she hadn’t let herself examine it too closely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a deep breath, brushing a hand through her hair and pushing the thoughts aside. <em>Focus.</em> She had a class to teach. But even as the lecture continued, her mind kept returning to Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hadn’t been in class yesterday either, but Agatha had told herself that perhaps she was just busy, or maybe there was something personal going on. But today… today felt different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She missed the way Rio would raise her hand, her thoughtful gaze always locked on Agatha’s as she processed everything in her usual quiet way. Rio wasn’t just a student; she was a force in the classroom, someone who breathed life into the material in a way no one else did. Without her, the room felt static.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tried to ignore the tightness in her chest, the pang of missing her presence. It was wrong to feel this way, she reminded herself. She had been the one to tell Rio to move on, to pretend like nothing had happened between them. She had asked for it, for both of them to act as if the kiss—what they had shared—hadn’t existed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Rio’s absence and the way it made her feel told Agatha everything she needed to know.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was the quietness in the way Rio had looked at her, the hurt that had flickered across her face when Agatha had asked her to forget. She had seen it then, but she hadn’t acknowledged it. And now, seeing Rio’s empty seat, the knowledge gnawed at Agatha, and she couldn’t escape it: Rio wasn’t here because of their conversation, because Agatha had pushed her away, told her to act like nothing had changed when everything had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And it hurt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The lesson came to an end, and the students began to pack up, chatting among themselves, most of them oblivious to the weight of the atmosphere in the room. Agatha’s eyes flickered once more to the spot where Rio always sat. She could almost picture her there—her thoughtful expression, her hand shooting up to ask a question, or her subtle, but profound, contribution to a discussion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And now, there was nothing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stayed behind for a few moments after the students had filed out, staring at Rio’s empty desk, trying to push down the sense of guilt that was rising in her throat. She shouldn’t have let things get so complicated. She should have handled the situation differently—no, she <em>shouldn’t</em> have kissed Rio in the first place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha ran a hand over her face, cursing herself under her breath. She knew she had asked for space, but this silence, this distance, felt like it was breaking something inside of her. She should have checked on Rio, maybe reached out, apologized. But what could she say? What could she do to fix the mess she’d made?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A part of her had hoped—foolishly, she now realized—that Rio would come in today, that maybe things would go back to normal. That they could pretend, at least for a little while, that nothing had changed. But Rio hadn’t come. And that absence felt heavier than anything Agatha had felt in the past few days.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha grabbed her bag, gathered her notes, and slowly walked out of the classroom. Her mind was still reeling, thoughts racing in circles. As she searched for her car keys in her bag, she felt a crumpled piece of paper meet her fingers. She pulled it out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Three of Swords – Live Friday Night.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha froze. This was the flier she had picked up last time and that she had followed to go see Rio and her band. That same night that led to their current predicament.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And she realized with a sinking feeling in her stomach that this was the perfect excuse—an opportunity to see Rio again if she didn’t show up again, to make things right, to see if there was even a chance of fixing whatever had broken between them. Next time the band would perform, she could go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But would Rio even want that? Her not being there today nor yesterday had made it quite clear that Rio didn’t want to see her. What right did she have to infringe that?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at the flier again, her heart pounding in her chest. She didn’t know what to do anymore. All she knew was that it was getting harder to stay away, and the longer she let this silence stretch, the more it hurt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her thoughts were interrupted when she caught sight of a student walking by, one of her undergraduates, who asked her about the upcoming exam. Agatha forced herself to focus on the conversation, to refocus her mind. But in the back of her mind, she couldn’t help but wonder whether Rio would show up in class tomorrow, whether their paths would cross again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had spent the last few days in her apartment, lost in a haze of confusion and guilt. The walls felt too close, too tight around her, and the silence in the air seemed suffocating. She hadn’t gone to class, hadn’t gone to the library to work on her thesis, and hadn’t even gone to the dance center to teach her kids, calling in sick for the first time ever. For the first time in a long time, she felt completely stuck.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She couldn’t even remember the last time she had properly left her apartment, save for quick trips to get food or necessities. Every time she thought about stepping outside, about facing the world, it felt like a mountain too steep to climb. Her mind kept circling back to the same question: What had she done?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The kiss had been a mistake. It had felt like a mistake as soon as it happened, even as her lips had brushed against Agatha’s, even as she had pulled away and apologized in a panic. She hadn’t expected Agatha to kiss her back. She certainly hadn’t expected Agatha to even <em>want</em> to kiss her back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But she had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just the kiss that was eating at Rio. It was the way Agatha had handled it afterward. The way Agatha had shut her down so completely. Rio had tried to tell herself it wasn’t personal, that maybe Agatha had just regretted the whole thing, that maybe it had just been a moment of weakness. But deep down, Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t just about the kiss. There was something else, something more complicated between them that neither of them could admit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The worst part was the silence that followed. The distance. Agatha had become cold, distant even in class. She was professional, but there was a sharpness to her demeanor, a wall Rio couldn’t break through. She could feel it, that invisible barrier, and it was suffocating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The more she tried to ignore it, the more it ate away at her. And the more she thought about it, the more she realized that <em>she</em> was the one who had caused it. She had crossed a line. She had made a fool of herself. She’d let herself get caught up in something she shouldn’t have, and now Agatha was pulling away. It hurt more than Rio was willing to admit, but it also felt like she deserved it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So she had stayed there, hiding from everything—hiding from Agatha, from the class she was supposed to attend, from her friends, even from Lilia. She couldn’t even bring herself to pick up the phone. Alice had texted her, asking if she wanted to come out, but Rio had ignored it. She didn’t want to explain herself. She didn’t want to tell anyone the truth, not when she didn’t even know what was going on inside her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, her phone buzzed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a message from Lilia.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Lilia</strong> : Hello, sweet girl. Are you okay? I haven’t heard from you in a while. Let me know if you want to come over for dinner tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stared at the message, her heart heavy. She didn’t want to burden Lilia with this. She didn’t want to tell her how confused she was, how much the conversation with Agatha had hurt her. She didn’t want to admit that she was spiraling, that she hadn’t been able to get out of bed for days.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could just lie, pretend everything was fine. But Lilia would know. She always did. And Rio couldn’t stand the idea of lying to her, not when she was so lost.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a sigh, Rio set the phone down. She needed to get out of this apartment, to stop feeling like she was suffocating in her own thoughts. But even as she resolved to leave, even as she thought about stepping into the world again, the only thing that lingered in her mind was Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">How had it gone so wrong? </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice had had enough. She was sick of seeing Rio retreat into her apartment, avoiding everyone, and most importantly, avoiding herself. When she knocked on the door and didn’t get an answer, she didn’t hesitate. She barged in, pushing the door open without waiting for a response.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio!” Alice’s voice was sharp, her irritation evident as she stepped into the dimly lit room. Rio was sitting on the couch, her body curled up, her face buried in her blanket. She looked like she hadn’t moved in days. It broke Alice’s heart, but it also made her furious. “Alice…” Rio said, not even turning her head towards her friend.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t ‘Alice’ me,” Alice snapped, crossing her arms over her chest. “You’ve been hiding in here for days. What the hell is going on?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t move, didn’t even look up. She just shrugged, trying to play it off as if nothing was wrong, but Alice wasn’t buying it. She dropped her bag on the floor with a loud thud and marched over to the couch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Seriously?” Alice asked, her voice softening but still tinged with frustration. “You’ve been avoiding me, avoiding everyone. I know you’re going through something, but this isn’t healthy. I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s going on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio finally looked up, her eyes red and swollen from the days spent hiding away. She opened her mouth, but nothing came out. Her lips trembled as she fought with herself, trying to keep the flood of emotions at bay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice didn’t back down. She sat next to Rio, placing a hand on her friend’s shoulder gently.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Whatever it is, we can figure it out. Just talk to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a long moment, Rio just stared at the floor, her breath shaky. She had kept this to herself for so long, not wanting to burden anyone with it. But now, with Alice’s presence next to her, she felt the weight of it all crashing down. She couldn’t hide anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Rio said finally, her voice barely a whisper. She took a shaky breath, collecting her thoughts before she spoke. “I messed up. I… I kissed Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice blinked, processing the words, but Rio continued before she could say anything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know, I know, it’s crazy. She’s my professor. And I… I shouldn’t have. And then she kissed me back. And... Alice, it was so perfect. And then, she told me it was a mistake. She told me to forget it. Like it never happened. And now… now I don’t know what to do. She’s distant, she’s cold, and I—I feel like I ruined everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s face softened as she listened. She could see how much this was weighing on Rio, how much it hurt. But there was something else in her friend’s eyes, a desperation, a longing that Alice couldn’t ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, listen to me,” Alice said gently. “You didn’t ruin anything. I know it might feel like that right now, but it’s not the end of the world. You two—Agatha and you—you’re both adults. It’s complicated, sure, but… there’s no need to shut yourself out like this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes. “But I promised. I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone. I can’t… I can’t be the one who messes everything up. I don’t want to hurt her, I don’t want to make things worse.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s heart broke for her. She had always known how much Rio cared, how deeply she felt everything. But this… this was something she could help with.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You have to stop blaming yourself, okay?” Alice said firmly, wiping a tear from Rio’s cheek. “You need to get out of here. Go see her, talk to her. I know it’s hard, but running away isn’t going to fix anything. And I promise, I won’t tell anyone. But you’ve got to stop hiding from your own feelings, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, her chest tightening at the thought of facing Agatha again. The kisses, the words, the way Agatha had shut her down—it all felt like a mountain she couldn’t climb. But Alice was right. She couldn’t keep avoiding it forever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll try,” Rio said softly, nodding, though her voice was still full of doubt. “I just need to figure out what to say…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice gave her a small smile, squeezing her hand. “Start with the truth. That’s all you need to do. The rest will follow.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked up at Alice, grateful for her friend’s unwavering support. She didn’t have all the answers, and she still wasn’t sure how to fix everything. But for the first time in days, she felt like there might be a way out of this mess.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll talk to her,” Rio said quietly. “I’ll figure it out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned back against the couch, relieved to see Rio finally coming to terms with the situation, even if just a little. “Good,” she said. “Now, go get some sleep. You’ve got a big conversation ahead of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave her a weak smile. “Thanks, Alice. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Probably drink more wine and wallow in your apartment,” Alice teased, lightening the mood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, feeling a bit lighter. </p><p align="justify">

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">            (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice had watched Rio wrestle with this for too long. The weight of her confusion, her self-imposed guilt, the constant overthinking—it was all eating away at her, and Alice was done standing on the sidelines. If Rio wasn’t going to pull herself out of this spiral, then Alice would <em>drag</em> her out of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just that Rio was suffering—it was the fact that she was suffering <em>unnecessarily</em>. And Alice had finally found proof of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The idea struck late one evening after band practice. Rio hadn’t shown up <em>again</em>, something that had become an unfortunate trend lately, and Alice had reached her limit. She had spent the past few days picking up on murmurs from other students, hearing snippets of conversation about the university’s stance on student-faculty relationships. And while she wasn’t one to put much stock in rumors, she had actually read the damn thing herself once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There <em>was</em> a section in the PhD student handbook that addressed relationships between students and faculty. And as it turned out, the situation wasn’t as dire as Rio had convinced herself it was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">While these relationships weren’t encouraged, they weren’t outright <em>forbidden</em> either. There were no hard-and-fast rules banning them—only a vague, lukewarm recommendation to <em>avoid them when possible</em> for the sake of professional integrity. That was it. No threats of expulsion. No career-ending consequences.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had been tormenting herself over something that wasn’t even an insurmountable obstacle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So Alice did what any good friend would do—she took matters into her own hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, after everyone had packed up their instruments and left, she sat down with her laptop and pulled up the student handbook. With a few quick clicks, she scrolled to the section on professional conduct and relationships, highlighting the exact wording. Then she took a series of screenshots, making sure to capture the most relevant parts—the parts Rio <em>needed</em> to see.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t bother adding an explanation when she sent the screenshots. No dramatic speech. No pushy text.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just: <strong>[Attachment: 4 Images]</strong></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio would get the message.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Alice wasn’t done.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, she took it a step further.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She printed out the entire page from the handbook twice, folded them neatly, and slipped it into two different envelopes. No note. No signature. No trace of where it had come from. If Rio wanted plausible deniability, she’d have it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, with all the stealth of a woman on a mission, Alice slipped into Rio’s apartment building, found her mailbox, and casually dropped one of the envelopes inside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio could keep agonizing over <em>what ifs</em> all she wanted, but after this?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wouldn’t be able to pretend she didn’t know the truth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice wasn’t done meddling—not yet. If she was going to help Rio get out of her own way, she needed to go the extra mile. And that meant making sure Dr. Agatha Harkness saw those rules, too.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So, that afternoon, she found herself wandering past the faculty offices, keeping her steps casual, her demeanor nonchalant. The hallway was quiet, save for the distant murmur of conversation from a nearby classroom. Most students were off in lectures or tucked away in the library, and the professors who actually used their offices were either inside or nowhere to be found.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Perfect.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice strolled past Agatha’s door, her gaze flickering toward the sleek nameplate mounted beside it. <em>Dr. Agatha Harkness</em>. The name alone carried an intimidating weight, but Alice wasn’t about to let that stop her. She spotted the office mailbox just beside the door—where students often dropped off assignments, letters, or official department notices.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached into her bag, fingers brushing against the second envelope she had prepared earlier. No note, no name, no identifying marks again. Just the page from the student handbook, printed in black and white. A cold, hard fact—one that neither Rio nor Agatha could ignore now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a quick glance over her shoulder, Alice slipped the envelope inside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was done.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A slow smirk tugged at her lips as she turned and walked away, hands in her pockets. She wasn’t one to meddle <em>too</em> much in other people’s business—at least, not without reason. But this? This was worth it. If she could plant even a <em>seed</em> of realization in Agatha’s mind, then maybe—just maybe—Rio wouldn’t be the only one rethinking things.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, when Rio showed up at her apartment again, Alice could still see the hesitation clinging to her like a heavy coat. The same uncertainty, the same overthinking, the same <em>Rio</em> who was too damn afraid to want what she wanted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But this time, Alice didn’t push. She didn’t bring up the envelope.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wanted to give it time—time for Rio to sit with the reality of the situation, to understand that the obstacle she thought was standing in her way wasn’t as immovable as she’d feared. Time for Agatha to find that envelope in her mailbox and <em>read</em> those words for herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Would it change everything? Probably not overnight. But maybe it would be enough to nudge things in the right direction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Because at the end of the day, Rio needed to make her own choices.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Agatha?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Well, Alice had a feeling she wasn’t as indifferent as she pretended to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So now, all she could do was wait—and watch as the inevitable played out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha had been buried in her work that afternoon, the monotonous rhythm of grading essays serving as a poor distraction from the gnawing thoughts she had been wrestling with for days. The faculty lounge was quiet, save for the occasional clatter of mugs and the distant murmur of a conversation between two professors by the window. She should have welcomed the silence, let it pull her into focus, but instead, her mind wandered—back to Rio, back to that awful, necessary conversation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Forget about it</em>, she had told Rio roughly. <em>Forget about whatever you think is happening here.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And she had meant it. Or at least, she had wanted to mean it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But if that were true, why did she feel like she had lost something she never even allowed herself to have?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She exhaled sharply, shaking her head as if that alone could dispel the ache settling in her chest. <em>Work. Just focus on work.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was around mid-afternoon when she stood up to stretch and grab another cup of coffee. As she walked toward the small cabinet near her office door, her eyes landed on the mailbox hanging just outside. A small envelope had been slid into it, tucked neatly among the usual administrative letters and flyers for campus events.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, a slight frown tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Most of what she received here was routine—student requests for extension approvals, committee notices, dry university correspondence. But this? No name, no return address, no markings at all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Something about it felt different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached for it, her fingers brushing over the crisp paper as she flipped it over. Still nothing. Carefully, she slid her finger under the flap and pulled out the single sheet of paper inside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her breath caught in her throat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a page from the PhD student handbook—specifically, the section regarding relationships between faculty and doctoral candidates. Agatha’s eyes skimmed the words, her pulse quickening despite herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Relationships between faculty members and doctoral candidates, while not expressly prohibited under university policy, are explicitly discouraged to uphold the integrity of professional boundaries. Supervisors are strongly advised to abstain from entering into personal relationships with their supervisees. Nonetheless, no formal sanctions may be imposed upon either party, provided that both individuals are consenting adults. In the absence of explicit regulatory prohibitions, such associations are not deemed to contravene institutional policy.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, reading over the text again, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew what this meant. She couldn’t believe it, but the implications were clear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mind raced, torn between embarrassment and the uncomfortable realization that she had been mistaken in thinking that the boundaries between her and Rio were so clear-cut. She had spent <em>so much</em> time convincing herself that the line between her and Rio was absolute. That there was no room for blurred boundaries, no space for <em>anything</em> beyond the carefully defined roles of professor and student. She had told herself it was impossible. Forbidden.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, here was proof that the university itself had not drawn as firm a line as she had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her grip on the paper tightened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A bubble of frustration rose up in her throat. She knew it couldn’t have been Rio printing that, so it meant that Rio had told someone, even when she had promised not to. They both had. But she forced herself to think clearly. The paper in her hand was not a trick, no threats or blackmail or anything. It was simply a copy of the rules, and rules it turns out they weren’t even breaking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The frustration that had initially bubbled up inside her slowly began to give way to something else—a strange mixture of relief and gratitude. Whoever had sent this knew exactly what had happened between them. They understood the complexities of the situation, understood what she was struggling with, and most importantly, they had done this out of a desire to help.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha ran a hand through her hair, trying to sort through her emotions. She couldn’t deny that the thought of someone knowing about what had happened made her feel vulnerable, but at the same time, she couldn’t ignore the fact that whoever had left this message was offering a way forward.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced at the envelope one more time, then at the paper she still held in her hands. Her stomach churned, realizing that this wasn’t just some anonymous piece of advice—it was a message, a wake-up call that had come from someone who cared about Rio, who understood what she was going through.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha knew she needed to make a choice. But as she sat down, the weight of the situation pressed heavily on her, and she couldn’t escape the feeling that whatever she did next, there would be no turning back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a sigh, she crumpled the paper in her hand, not in anger, but in frustration, and tossed it into the recycling bin. But the truth was, it had already planted a seed in her mind—one that she couldn’t ignore, no matter how much she wanted to. <em>Whoever you are,</em> Agatha thought, <em>thank you.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had to confront Rio. And this time, there would be no more pretending.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood by her office window, her gaze distant as she mulled over the possibilities. Her fingers drummed lightly against the edge of the windowsill as she stared out at the campus below, lost in thought. For days, she had been circling around this conversation in her mind, running through the possible scenarios like a scholar dissecting a complex theory. What to say. <em>How</em> to say it. How much to reveal without completely unraveling the careful restraint she had spent so long constructing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now, she had finally accepted the truth: she couldn’t avoid this any longer. She had to see Rio, had to talk to her, had to set things right—or at least try.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But the next question loomed large: <em>Where?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They definitely couldn’t have this conversation after class. The formal setting of a lecture hall would be too suffocating, too detached and definitely not appropriate, way too public. The last thing she wanted was for their emotions to feel like an academic debate, a sterile exchange of ideas. No, it had to be somewhere personal, somewhere where they could be themselves, away from the pressures of their roles as teacher and student.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">No, it had to be somewhere else. Somewhere private, but not too personal. A place where they weren’t professor and student, but just… Agatha and Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her first thought was a park—open air, a sense of freedom. But just as quickly, she dismissed it. Too public. Too many wandering eyes, too much risk of being overheard. If this conversation took the turn she feared—or <em>hoped</em>—it might, she didn’t want to feel exposed, vulnerable in front of strangers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s mind wandered to the quieter, more intimate places—somewhere private, where they could talk freely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s house came to mind. She remembered it from the night she’d dropped Rio off, the warm, cozy atmosphere that had immediately felt comforting. But it didn’t seem quite right, did it? That place was Rio’s sanctuary, not the place for an apology. Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that it might be too personal, too tied to Rio’s private life. Besides, Lilia might be there, and this conversation needed to be theirs alone. And Agatha could hardly picture herself walking to Lilia’s house announced, hoping Rio would be there. She had no right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">What about Agatha’s own house? She knew she could create a safe space there, a calm atmosphere for them to talk. It was where she had been most herself, where she had let her guard down with Rio without any expectation of what might happen. She could invite her over after Nicky had gone to bed. But the thought of inviting Rio to her home again made her uneasy in those circumstances.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, an idea struck her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A café.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not just any café, but one she had been to a few times—a small, tucked-away place about twenty minutes off campus. It was the kind of spot people overlooked, hidden between two larger buildings, its entrance framed with ivy and worn brick. Every time she had been there, the atmosphere had been the same—quiet, low-lit, a gentle hum of jazz playing over the speakers, the kind of place where people spoke in hushed voices and let the world slow down for a little while.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">More importantly, she had never seen a student there.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Neutral ground.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was informal enough to strip away the rigid expectations of a professional setting, yet private enough to ensure that no one else would overhear. A place where they wouldn’t feel trapped, where the conversation could breathe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yes. That was it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She knew it wouldn’t be easy. She had no idea how Rio would react to seeing her again, especially after everything that had transpired. But if there was a chance to make things right, to explain herself, this was as good a place as any to start. The quiet hum of the café would be a gentle backdrop to what she hoped would be a long-overdue conversation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a knot in her chest. <em>I hope she’s ready to hear me out.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took her phone out of her pocket, fingers hovering over the keyboard, her mind racing with uncertainty. The conversation she had been dreading—and yearning for—was just a text away, yet it felt like the weight of a thousand decisions pressed on her shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had tried to convince herself that it was better this way—detached, professional. But the truth was, the thought of leaving things unresolved gnawed at her. She wanted to fix this. She <em>needed</em> to fix this. She <em>wanted</em> this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a deep breath, she tapped out the message, her heart pounding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <strong>
    <em>Agatha</em>
  </strong>
  <strong> </strong>
  <em>: Rio. I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to ask if you’re available to meet tomorrow evening. I think we need to talk. Let me know if that works for you.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stared at the words, reading them over again and again. Too formal? Too distant? Did it sound like an obligation? Her thumb hovered over the keyboard, hesitating. Then, almost without thinking, she added one more word: <em>Please.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The single addition shifted something in her. It made the message feel… vulnerable. Honest. She inhaled sharply. <em>Just send it.</em> And yet, for a long, excruciating moment, she didn’t. What if Rio didn’t want to meet? What if she had already decided to put distance between them for good? What if she had already <em>moved on</em>? The thought made something in Agatha’s chest twist uncomfortably. But she knew, deep down, that she had to try. If there was any chance of repairing what had broken between them, she couldn’t keep avoiding it. She couldn’t let the what-ifs paralyze her. Not anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a final breath, she pressed “send.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The text left her screen, but the knot in her stomach only tightened. Now, it was up to Rio to decide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her move.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stared at the screen of her phone, the message from Agatha blinking up at her. Her heart skipped a beat, but she quickly pushed the feeling aside. She had spent the past week avoiding Agatha, avoiding the thought of what had happened between them. She had promised herself she wouldn’t think about it, that it had been a mistake—a moment of weakness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But now, here it was. Agatha was reaching out, asking to meet, to talk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a surge of conflicting emotions. Part of her wanted to ignore the message, to bury herself in the safe, familiar distance she had created between them. It felt easier that way—safer. But another part of her, the part that still couldn’t shake the memory of the kiss, of the way Agatha had looked at her, couldn’t deny the urge to respond.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a deep breath, her fingers hovering over the screen. She thought about all the ways she could reply—simple, neutral, distant—but in the end, her fingers typed out a message that was neither too guarded nor too open. It was a fragile bridge between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Tomorrow evening works for me. Where should we meet?”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words felt heavy as she hit “send,” and for a moment, she stared at her phone, waiting for Agatha’s reply, trying to suppress the flutter of hope and anxiety that had suddenly bloomed in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood outside the café, the crisp night air biting at her cheeks as she tucked her hands deeper into her coat pockets. Her breath curled in the cold, dissipating as she stared through the window, heart hammering against her ribs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Inside, Agatha sat near the back, her silhouette outlined by the soft glow of the hanging lights. A book was open in her hands, though Rio could tell she wasn’t truly reading—her finger tapped idly against the table, betraying a nervous energy that Rio wasn’t sure she had ever seen in her before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had told herself she wouldn’t hesitate. That she would walk in, sit down, keep it simple. That this was just a conversation. But now, standing there, unseen, Rio allowed herself to just watch her—really see her—the way she had avoided doing in the last few weeks. The way the lines of her face softened in the warm light, the way her fingers gently turned the pages of the book, the faint crease between her brows as she tried to concentrate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The warm light softened her sharp features, casting a golden hue over her skin, catching in the loose strands of her dark hair as they fell past the middle of her back. She was dressed immaculately, as always—deep red blouse neatly tucked into black slacks, effortlessly elegant in a way that made Rio’s stomach tighten. It suited her, the color, the shape, the way it highlighted everything Rio had tried so hard <em>not</em> to notice. Her fingers ghosted over the edge of the book before turning the page, her brow creased in thought, lips slightly parted as if she might be mouthing the words to herself. Rio had always admired her, had always found something mesmerizing about the quiet strength Agatha carried, but this? <em>This</em> was different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Because now, she wasn’t just admiring her from the safety of distance. She wasn’t just another student in a lecture hall, stealing glances, cataloging the subtle shifts in Agatha’s expressions like she was some untouchable figure of intrigue. No, now she <em>knew</em> what Agatha’s hands felt like on her skin. What her voice sounded like when it was softened by something unspoken.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, suddenly feeling vulnerable under her own scrutiny. She hadn’t prepared for this moment—hadn’t prepared to see Agatha in this way, with this strange new awareness that made her heart Riot faster and her mind go blank. Her fingers twitched in her coat pockets. One step. That was all it would take. One step forward, one push of the door, one exhale, and she would be inside, facing the one person who had managed to unravel everything she thought she understood about herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shaking her head, Rio exhaled sharply and pushed the door open, stepping inside. The scent of fresh coffee and warm spices wrapped around her, but she barely registered it. The second she crossed the threshold, Agatha’s head lifted from her book, as if she had sensed Rio’s presence before actually seeing her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a heartbeat, the world around them dimmed—the low hum of conversation, the clinking of mugs, the soft jazz playing from the speakers—all of it faded into the background. Rio felt something warm and insistent bloom in her chest, spreading heat up to her cheeks. Was it nerves? The weight of their unspoken words? Or was it just Agatha, sitting there, looking at her in that way that made Rio’s pulse stutter?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze lingered, searching, holding onto her for a second too long. There was something unreadable in her expression, something caught between restraint and something softer—something that made Rio want to look away and hold her gaze all at once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Steeling herself, she forced her legs to move, crossing the room with careful, deliberate steps. The closer she got, the heavier the air between them seemed to grow, thick with the unspoken weight of everything they had left unresolved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi,” Rio said softly, offering a tentative smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed the book in her hands, setting it aside with quiet precision. Her lips curved slightly, though there was a hesitance there, as if she were treading carefully. “Rio,” she said, her voice smooth yet measured. “I’m glad you could make it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded and slid into the chair across from her, acutely aware of every inch of space between them—every breath, every shift, every glance. It felt like something unseen was threading through the air between them, an invisible pull that made it impossible to fully relax. She tried not to think about how her stomach fluttered the way it always did around Agatha. About how, ever since that kiss, it had only gotten worse. She had spent so much time convincing herself that this was nothing, that it was something fleeting—something she could ignore. But now, sitting across from her, she wasn’t so sure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes flickered over her, careful and studying. Rio felt it like a touch, like fingertips trailing over the curve of her jaw, the corner of her mouth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She licked her lips, forcing herself to breathe. “So,” she started, voice quieter than she intended, “we’re really doing this, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips parted slightly, a small exhale escaping as she studied Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” she said, voice just as quiet. “I think we have to.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt the weight of it pressing down on her—the conversation they were about to have, the questions she wasn’t sure she was ready to answer, the way her heart was betraying her with every Riot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was the first to break the silence, though even as she spoke, her voice carried the weight of hesitation. She cleared her throat, her fingers curling slightly around her coffee cup, as if grounding herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I… I know this isn’t exactly the easiest conversation,” she said, her voice soft but steady. “But I wanted to make sure we were on the same page about everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a small nod, her throat suddenly dry. She knew this moment had been inevitable, but knowing that didn’t make it any easier. And yet, she couldn’t look away from Agatha’s eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled, something in her expression shifting as she continued. “I’m sorry,” she said, quieter now, the vulnerability creeping in. “For how I handled things. For making you feel like it was a mistake.” Her gaze dropped, fingers lightly tracing the rim of her coffee cup, a small, nervous movement that Rio wasn’t used to seeing from her. “I don’t want you to think I’m ashamed of what happened between us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio could feel the weight of Agatha’s words pressing on her chest. She was silent for a moment, unsure of how to respond. She wanted to say something that would make things right, but her mind was racing, a swirl of confusion and longing. Instead, she let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding, and met Agatha’s eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t have to apologize,” Rio said, her voice quieter than she intended, though still steady. “I—I get it. I know it’s complicated. You’re my professor, and I didn’t think you’d want… this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But even as she said the words, she knew it wasn’t true. She knew there was more to it. There had to be. The way Agatha looked at her, the way they’d shared that kiss—it was impossible to ignore. The mutual attraction was undeniable. The pull between them was magnetic, a constant hum in the air that neither of them could escape.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened, and there was a flicker of something—desire, maybe—before she carefully placed her hands on the table, palms down. “It <em>is</em> complicated,” she admitted, her voice almost a whisper now. “But Rio… I can’t deny that there’s something between us. Something I can’t ignore. And maybe… maybe it’s more than just a mistake.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The weight of her words hit Rio like a wave, washing over her, leaving her breathless. She wanted to lean into it, to let herself believe it, but fear held her back. She didn’t know how to navigate this—didn’t know what it meant for them, for their relationship.</p><p align="justify">  </p><p align="justify">Rio reached out, her hand trembling slightly as it rested on the table between them. The brief touch of their fingers made the air between them feel electrified, charged with an intensity that was undeniable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know what this means,” Rio said, her voice low, vulnerable. “But I don’t want to lose whatever this is between us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could feel her heart pounding, a steady Riot that seemed to echo in her ears. The uncertainty was overwhelming, but the pull between them was stronger, undeniable, and it left her breathless, caught in the gravity of their connection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at her, her gaze unwavering, those eyes so filled with unspoken thoughts that Rio felt as if she could drown in them. Her lips parted, and for a long moment, neither of them spoke. The silence between them was heavy, but not awkward—it was full of things they both wanted to say, things they were too afraid to voice out loud. It was a silence full of hope, fear, and anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, Agatha moved. Slowly, carefully, she reached out, her fingers closing around Rio’s, gently, as if she were afraid of breaking the fragile bond between them. “Neither do I,” Agatha said softly, her voice barely above a whisper, but the warmth and sincerity in it made Rio’s heart race in her chest. It was a simple statement, but it held so much—so much unspoken promise, so much vulnerability. “But we’ll figure it out. Together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung in the air between them, like a promise that both of them were too scared to break. And in that moment, something inside Rio softened. All the uncertainty, all the fear that had been building for days, seemed to fade away, leaving only the quiet understanding between them. It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t easy. There were still so many questions, so many unknowns. But the connection they shared, the way they were looking at each other now, was something neither of them wanted to walk away from.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the sun began to dip behind the horizon, casting a warm golden glow over the quiet streets, Rio and Agatha stepped out of the café, the evening air crisp against their skin. They began walking side by side, making their way toward the small park tucked away at the edge of town, a place that felt far removed from the weight of their earlier conversation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t know what to say, her mind still swirling with the things they had discussed, the emotions that had come flooding back. She felt a quiet tension in the space between them, a space that had been full of both unspoken words and promises.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How’s Nicky?” Rio asked suddenly, her voice sounding more casual than she felt, the question tumbling out almost as a way to break the silence. Her feet shuffled against the cool pavement as they left the warmth of the café behind, the shift from the familiar to the unknown settling heavily on her shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, walking beside her, noticed the subtle change in Rio’s tone, the way she seemed to guard herself just a little more. But she was thankful for the change in topic, for the breath of normalcy it offered in the midst of their uncertain conversation. A soft smile curved Agatha’s lips as she glanced at Rio, feeling the chill of the evening air against her skin. It was like a reset, a moment to regain some balance, a way to breathe without the weight of everything else hanging so heavily in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He’s good. Always full of energy,” Agatha replied, her voice warm, the affection she felt for her son evident in the way she spoke. “He started reading on his own a bit more lately. And his dance moves… I swear, he’s got rhythm, but you know that already.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, her nerves loosening just a little, her thoughts shifting to something more lighthearted. “I bet you’re a proud mom,” she said, the question lingering in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile deepened, a soft sigh escaping her as she glanced forward, the park just ahead. “I am,” she said, her gaze softening as she spoke of her son. “It’s not always easy, but he makes it worth it. You’d probably like him even more if you met him outside of dance class.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled at the thought, the warmth of Agatha’s words settling into her chest. There was a quiet invitation there, something she couldn’t ignore. “I’m sure I would,” she said, her tone light, almost absentmindedly. “He’s got a lot of energy, though. He seems like he’d be fun to teach at school.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her eyes twinkling with affection. “He is. He’s got this infectious enthusiasm. He’s not shy either, which can be both a blessing and a curse.” She let out a quiet chuckle, the sound soft in the growing evening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced over at her, a playful glint in her eyes. “Sounds like someone else I know,” she said lightly, her attempt to keep things easy, to keep the conversation flowing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, a teasing smile curling on her lips. “Oh? And who’s that?” she asked, her voice laced with amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You,” Rio said, the words coming more easily now. “You’ve got that… energy about you. A little intimidating at first, but it grows on you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Intimidating, huh? I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, but her smile faltered a bit as her mind drifted back to their earlier conversation. She wasn’t sure if she was ready to confront the deeper feelings she had for Agatha, or if they could find a way to make things work between them. But for now, the banter, the distraction, was just what she needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, tell me,” Rio said, hoping to shift things once more, “what’s Nicky’s favorite thing to do when he’s not dancing?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced at her, clearly appreciating the change in topic. “Oh, he’s obsessed with dinosaurs, dragons, and Legos. He’ll spend hours just getting lost in them. He builds everything from cars to castles, to spaceships. You name it, he’s figured out a way to make it.” Agatha’s tone was filled with both amusement and pride. “He’s got this incredible knack for it. Sometimes, I think he might become an architect one day, or at least a very well-paid Lego designer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, imagining the little boy’s small hands maneuvering brightly colored Lego pieces into imaginative structures. “That’s so cute. You’ll have to keep me posted on his latest projects. I bet his creations are amazing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Honestly, I could spend hours listening to him explain his designs,” Agatha replied, her smile widening at the thought. “He’s got this contagious enthusiasm for everything he does. And when he gets really into something, it’s like nothing else matters. He’s so fully absorbed, it’s impressive.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they walked along, the conversation drifted to lighter topics. Rio found herself genuinely enjoying the time with Agatha, even though the complexity of their feelings was never far from her mind. She wasn’t sure what was going to happen next, but in this moment, walking alongside Agatha, she felt like they could at least be normal—two people talking, laughing, finding comfort in each other’s presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The walk from the park to Rio’s apartment was brief, but in the quiet of the evening, it felt like an eternity for Agatha. The space between them, once charged with tension, seemed to ebb away, leaving behind a strange calm, as though they had finally navigated the depths of their conversation. They had shared something in that walk—something unspoken, but understood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they arrived at the door, Rio hesitated for a moment, then looked up at Agatha with a smile. “Would you like to come up for a drink? I have a bottle of wine I’ve been meaning to open.” The question hung in the air, casual, but with an underlying invitation that made Agatha pause. She was tired, her mind still swirling with everything they had discussed, but the thought of leaving Rio alone, of parting ways just yet, didn’t sit right with her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure,” Agatha said softly, offering a small, almost imperceptible smile. She didn’t need to think twice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they walked up the stairs to Rio’s apartment, Agatha couldn’t help but notice how different the building felt from the outside world. She had always seen Rio as something of an enigma—bright, quick-witted, but with a certain depth that seemed just out of reach. Maybe this would be her first glimpse of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached the door, Rio unlocked it with a soft click and stepped inside, holding the door open for Agatha. The apartment was cozy, with an almost earthy feel to it, and as Agatha stepped over the threshold, she immediately noticed how… <em>alive</em> it felt. Everywhere she looked, plants flourished—lush ferns and trailing ivy, cacti standing tall in their pots, hanging succulents that seemed to grow effortlessly from the ceiling. It was a jungle, but one carefully tended with love and attention. The apartment smelled faintly of earth, fresh air, and a lingering sweetness—perhaps from the flowers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wow,” Agatha breathed, taking in the vibrant space. She had imagined Rio’s living space before, but nothing had quite prepared her for how well this reflected who she was. The plants gave the room a sense of growth and warmth, of life continuing to bloom, even in the smallest corners. The mismatched furniture was homey and comfortable, and there were books everywhere—stacked on the coffee table, piled neatly on shelves, and scattered across the small kitchen counter. A few records rested against the wall, and soft, dim lighting gave the room a calm, inviting glow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s a bit much,” Rio admitted, a soft laugh escaping her lips as she turned on the little lamp next to the couch. “But they’re kind of like my therapy. I’ve had some of these plants for years, and they’ve seen me through a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took it all in, the quiet beauty of the space, the life in every corner. She smiled softly, something tender in her gaze. “It’s beautiful,” she said, her voice filled with sincerity. “It suits you.” She looked around again, noticing how every corner seemed to tell a story—of growth, of patience, of time spent nurturing something living. “I can see why you’d want to be surrounded by them.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment before she moved toward the small kitchen area, glancing over her shoulder at Agatha. “Wine?” she asked, as she rummaged through the cabinet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, please,” Agatha replied, still taking in the details of the apartment. There was something about it that felt so… real. So <em>her</em>. Rio, in all her complexity, seemed to live in this space in a way that Agatha couldn’t quite explain. It was as if everything here—every plant, every book, every trinket—was a part of Rio’s quiet story, pieces of her life scattered around in plain sight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio poured the wine, Agatha wandered over to a small bookshelf near the window. She ran her fingers lightly over the spines of the books, all of them well-loved. There were books on art, philosophy, literature. She pulled one from the shelf, opening it to find notes written in Rio’s neat handwriting on the margins—lines of thoughts and observations jotted down like tiny glimpses into Rio’s mind. She smiled softly as she read, hearing Rio’s voice in her mind as she took in the words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you read often?” Agatha asked, glancing over her shoulder, her voice casual, though there was an undertone of curiosity. “I mean, outside of your research and thesis, of course.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio paused as she poured the wine, her movements slowing for a moment. She turned to Agatha, a small, knowing smile curling on her lips as she handed her the glass. “All the time,” she replied, settling next to Agatha on the couch, the soft clink of their glasses a small sound in the otherwise quiet room. “Reading helps me sort through things. It’s kind of how I deal with… everything.” She looked down at her hands for a moment, as if considering her next words. “It’s like tending to my plants. Each book is another way to nurture my thoughts, my feelings.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her eyes softening as she looked at Rio. She took a sip of the wine, savoring the taste, the warmth it brought, but her mind was still partially on Rio’s words. “I understand,” she said quietly. Her voice was almost reverent, as though she was giving Rio’s vulnerability the space it deserved. “I’ve always found comfort in books, too. They’ve been my way of… grounding myself when things get chaotic. When I can’t find the right words, I find them in the pages.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, they simply sat there, sipping their wine and enjoying the quiet. The weight of everything that had passed between them—the conversation, the kiss, the unspoken connection—lingered in the air, but there was no rush to talk about it now. The room, with its warmth and peaceful energy, gave them space to just <em>be</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but feel the soft pull of attraction again as she glanced at Rio, who was now casually lounging on the couch, her eyes focused on something else, her lips curling into a faint smile every now and then. She was at ease here, surrounded by her life, by her plants, her books, and the quiet hum of the apartment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The silence between them hung heavy in the room, yet it was comfortable—no longer strained, no longer filled with uncertainty. As Rio leaned back into the couch, her eyes flickered toward Agatha once more. There was a soft intensity in the way Agatha was looking at her, something that mirrored what Rio had been feeling for the past week, something she couldn’t ignore any longer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a slow burn, a pull between them that had been there from the moment they’d met, but now, after everything that had happened—the tension, the awkwardness, the words unspoken—it was as if a dam had finally broken. The energy in the room shifted, becoming charged with an undeniable magnetism.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her heart race in her chest. She could hear the soft Riot of it in her ears, louder than the music playing faintly from the record player. She tried to look away, to distract herself by taking another sip of wine, but her gaze kept drifting back to Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then Agatha leaned in, just a fraction, her breath catching in her throat as her eyes locked onto Rio’s. There was something unspoken between them now, a shared understanding. Neither of them needed to say anything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio set her glass down on the coffee table, her pulse hammering in her ears. Before she could second guess herself, she reached out, cupping Agatha’s cheek with a tender touch. Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut for a moment at the contact, her breath shallow. The space between them closed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then it happened. Rio leaned in, just enough for their lips to meet in a soft, tentative kiss. It wasn’t like the first one—rushed, a little desperate—but this time, it was slower, more deliberate. A slow, measured movement as they explored this newfound connection. Agatha’s lips were soft against hers, and Rio could taste the faint bitterness of wine, but it was nothing compared to the warmth that bloomed between them, a warmth that felt like it was seeping deep into her soul.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Neither of them pulled away this time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand found its way to Rio’s waist, drawing her closer, the connection between them deepening, their bodies aligning in a way that felt natural, inevitable. Rio’s hand moved to Agatha’s neck, pulling her in closer, as though she needed more of her—needed to feel the softness of Agatha’s skin, the warmth of her body pressed against hers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They kissed, slower now, more assured. Agatha’s fingers traced the line of Rio’s jaw, the movement so gentle, as if she were afraid Rio would disappear if she held her too tightly. Rio responded by deepening the kiss, her heart thundering as every nerve in her body seemed to hum in response to Agatha’s touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally pulled apart, breathless, neither of them spoke immediately. The silence between them felt different now — charged with emotion, raw with everything that had built up between them. Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, both of them still so close that they could feel each other’s breath, still warm from the kiss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s voice was soft, barely a whisper, but it carried so much weight. “I can’t stop thinking about you,” she admitted, her fingers still lightly tracing patterns on Rio’s skin. “And I don’t want to.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught in her throat. She looked up at Agatha, her heart racing in a way it hadn’t in years. There was something about Agatha—something that made her feel alive, that made her want to be more than just the sum of her doubts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t stop thinking about you either,” Rio replied, her voice thick with emotion. “I’ve tried… but I can’t. It’s like… everything I’ve felt is just… here now. Between us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, her thumb brushing over Rio’s cheek. “Then let’s stop fighting it,” she said quietly, the words filled with a sense of surrender. “Let’s just… see where this goes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And just like that, everything that had been uncertain between them—the boundaries, the fear, the hesitation—melted away. It wasn’t about being careful anymore. It wasn’t about avoiding what they felt. It was about the rawness of the moment, the truth of their connection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The world outside Rio’s apartment faded away as the warmth between them enveloped them both. The intensity of the kiss, the vulnerability they had shared, and the quiet understanding that had blossomed between them all seemed to dissolve as they sat there together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their bodies, still so close, settled into the couch, naturally moving to lay down, arms wrapped around each other. Agatha’s hand rested lightly on Rio’s waist, while Rio’s fingers brushed gently through Agatha’s hair. The silence between them now wasn’t charged, but soothing—comforting, even.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s head rested against Agatha’s chest, feeling the steady rhythm of her heartRiot beneath her ear, grounding her, reminding her that she was no longer alone in this uncertainty. Agatha’s breathing slowed as she closed her eyes, her cheek resting against Rio’s hair. In the quiet, they found solace in the simple act of being together—no need for words anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s thoughts, once a chaotic whirlwind of confusion, seemed to calm in the steady presence of Agatha beside her. She felt a warmth in her chest, a softness she hadn’t allowed herself to feel in a long time. All the fear, all the doubt, faded into the background as she drifted off, her mind quieted by Agatha’s touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, too, let herself relax, her usual reservations slipping away. She hadn’t realized how much she needed this—how much she needed Rio’s presence, her sincerity, her unspoken understanding. In this moment, Agatha allowed herself to let go of all the complications she had been carrying, just letting herself be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just before the gentle pull of sleep started to claim them both, Rio’s voice broke the stillness. Her words were quiet, almost hesitant, as though she wasn’t sure she should be asking at all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha… don’t you have to go home? To Nicky?” Rio asked softly, lifting her head just enough to glance up at Agatha’s face. Her fingers brushed lightly against the sleeve of Agatha’s shirt, searching for some reassurance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened at the question. She felt the weight of Rio’s concern, and it touched something deep inside her. With a slow, quiet breath, she reached up, brushing a stray lock of Rio’s hair gently away from her face as she answered. “Nicky is staying at a friend’s house tonight,” she said, her voice low, comforting. “I’m free for the night.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let her words sink in for a moment, the thought that Agatha was staying because she wanted to, not because she had to, something that felt new and comforting. It was a simple truth that made Rio’s heart flutter just a little, and she smiled softly before settling back against Agatha’s chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Rio whispered, the uncertainty easing in her chest. The tension that had been there for days, even weeks, began to dissolve. With Agatha here, with her warm presence so close, everything felt right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha’s hand brushed lightly over Rio’s back, the peacefulness of the moment wrapped them both in a quiet embrace. Neither of them needed to say anything more. The night stretched on with them simply being there, in each other’s company, and that was enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a small, simple thing, but in that moment, it felt like the beginning of something new, something both uncertain and full of promise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the night deepened, their breathing synced, slow and steady. Rio, no longer burdened by the weight of the past few days, let herself fall into a peaceful sleep, her body curled against Agatha’s in a way that felt so right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, for the first time in what felt like forever, allowed herself to drift into sleep into someone’s arms, her arm around Rio, holding her close, knowing that whatever would come next would come in time. For now, all that mattered was the warmth of the moment they shared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, Rio stirred first, her body still curled up against Agatha’s warmth, the steady rhythm of her breathing grounding her in a way she hadn’t realized she needed. She blinked slowly, the quiet of the room filling the spaces between her thoughts. It was soft, comfortable, like waking up in a dream she didn’t want to leave.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was still asleep, her face relaxed, a few stray locks of hair falling across her forehead. Her arms were wrapped around Rio, a comforting weight that made Rio feel safe, even in the stillness of the morning. There was something so simple and intimate about this moment—nothing needed to be said. It felt like they had found a new, unspoken rhythm, a peacefulness that had been missing from both of their lives for far too long.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a deep breath, savoring the quiet, the feel of Agatha’s presence beside her. Her fingers lightly traced the curve of Agatha’s arm, the skin soft beneath her touch, but it was gentle, tentative, like she was still waiting for this to feel real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted slightly, her eyes fluttering open, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips when she saw Rio looking at her. There was no rush, no urgency to break the calm. Instead, they just stayed there, tangled up in sheets, in warmth, and in a softness that felt like the start of something new, something they both didn’t want to interrupt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning,” Agatha murmured, her voice low and husky from sleep, her hand finding Rio’s and giving it a gentle squeeze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning,” Rio replied, her voice also still a little rough but with an ease to it, as if the night had somehow smoothed over all the rough edges that had been building in her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They didn’t move right away, not yet. They just stayed there, in the quiet, letting the warmth of the moment settle around them. Neither of them knew what would come next, but for the first time in a long time, neither of them felt the need to rush or figure it all out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next time they saw each other, it was in class. The usual setting was far from the softness of their shared morning, but the lingering quiet between them was undeniable, even in the presence of the other students. Agatha entered the room last, as usual, her commanding presence filling the space as she made her way to the front of the lecture hall. She glanced around, her gaze briefly meeting Rio’s, and for a moment, time seemed to pause. There was a knowing in her eyes, something unspoken yet felt between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was already seated, trying to focus, but the memory of last night, of waking up with Agatha still close to her, made it difficult to keep her thoughts grounded in the class. She tugged at the sleeve of her shirt, her fingers fidgeting with the fabric as she tried to settle her mind. The last few days had been a whirlwind, and seeing Agatha now, in a professional setting, only reminded her of the layers between them—the layers they hadn’t fully untangled yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha began her lecture, her voice steady and focused, but Rio couldn’t shake the delicious tension that had settled in the pit of her stomach. There was something about the way Agatha spoke, the way she moved, that kept Rio’s thoughts drifting back to the night they’d shared. Every word felt laden with an unsaid promise, every glance seemed to carry a weight that Rio wasn’t sure how to carry herself, but welcomed with open arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Throughout the class, they were careful—very careful—not to let any sign of their connection show. Agatha maintained her usual professional demeanor, her lectures sharp and authoritative, while Rio, despite her best efforts to focus, found herself distracted. Her thoughts kept drifting back to the way Agatha’s fingers had touched her in the quiet of the night, the warmth of her body next to hers, the way it had felt so right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When class ended, Agatha quickly packed up her things, but there was a moment, just before she stood, where she glanced over at Rio again. Her eyes softened for a fraction of a second, but it was enough to remind Rio of everything they had shared, and of the distance they both now tried so hard to maintain here, despite the <em>pull</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll see you later, Miss Vidal,” Agatha said, her voice almost too casual, but Rio noticed the subtle tremor in her words, the soft smile and the reassuring eyes. She nodded, trying to keep her composure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah. Later,” Rio replied, her heart Rioting just a little faster than usual as Agatha walked out of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They both left the classroom, but the space between them felt heavier and lighter at the same time now, filled with the unspoken delicious tension of what they hadn’t said, what neither of them could yet voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The day of their usual meeting regarding Rio’s thesis arrived, and while everything between Agatha and Rio had shifted, their professional responsibilities remained even though there was no denying that the connection between them was undeniable, a force neither of them could resist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio arrived at Agatha’s office with a quiet determination. She hadn’t been avoiding Agatha; on the contrary, she was still finding ways to see her during office hours, always discussing her thesis with the same level of care and respect as before. Yet, there was something different now—something unsaid that hung in the air every time their eyes met. The chemistry between them was palpable, but they both understood that it couldn’t be acknowledged in public.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was already seated at her desk when Rio entered, her usual composure masking the swirling emotions she had tried to suppress all week. She stood, offering Rio a small, almost imperceptible smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha greeted softly. “I’m glad you’re here. Let’s go over your progress.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat down, setting her notebook in front of her. The task should have felt normal, but it didn’t. It was impossible for her to ignore the tension that pulsed in the space between them. Agatha, so carefully professional, yet Rio could see the way her gaze lingered on her just a moment too long, and the subtle shifts in her posture when they spoke, how her fingers lingered close to hers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they dove into her thesis, Agatha kept her focus on the work, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of Rio’s latest draft. Rio followed her lead, throwing herself into the discussion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the meeting concluded, Agatha paused, setting Rio’s draft down on the table. She looked at her with that familiar softness in her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, I know things have changed between us,” she began carefully. “And I want to make sure you’re still able to focus on your thesis. You’re brilliant, and I don’t want this to affect your work.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, feeling the weight of Agatha’s words settle into her chest. She had been distracted — there was no denying that. How could she not be when the woman she admired and respected so much, the woman with whom she had shared kisses and a night, was right there, just across the desk? But she understood Agatha’s concern, and she knew she needed to prove to herself and to Agatha that she could handle both their professional and personal lives with the same level of respect.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Rio said quietly. “I’ve just been… adjusting, but I’m still focused. I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha studied her for a moment, her gaze soft but intense. She seemed to be searching for something in Rio’s face, as though trying to gauge whether or not her words were enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll make sure this doesn’t affect your work,” Agatha said finally, her voice firm but gentle. “You’re too talented for that. Whatever happens, we’ll keep this… private.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, understanding what she meant. They both knew they couldn’t let anyone else know about their connection, not yet—not when Rio still had so much to prove as a student, and Agatha had her career and reputation to consider.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll keep things professional.” Agatha continued before smiling. “At least, in the ways that matter.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught slightly at those last words. <em>In the ways that matter.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She nodded, her voice steady despite the way her pulse had begun to race. “Of course. I want to keep working with you—on my thesis and… everything else.” She exhaled slowly. “But I won’t let anything interfere.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a moment of silence between them, as if both were considering how their agreement was already testing them. It was tempting, so very tempting to let the barriers between them slip. But for now, both of them were resolved to stay focused on their goals.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the meeting drew to a close, Agatha hesitated before standing, her fingers still resting lightly against the edges of Rio’s draft. She glanced up, her gaze softening in that way that made Rio’s chest ache with something unnameable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re doing well,” Agatha murmured, her voice quieter now, more personal. “Keep working hard. You’re on the right track.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, nodding, but her attention was caught on the way Agatha’s fingers lingered just a second longer than necessary as she passed the papers back to her. Their hands brushed, a fleeting touch, but it sent warmth curling through Rio’s skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled softly, as if steadying herself. Then, instead of gesturing for Rio to leave, she reached out—gentle, unhurried—her fingertips grazing Rio’s wrist before curling around her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Walk with me,” Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper, but there was something intimate in the way she said it, something that made Rio’s breath catch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t hesitate. The reached the door, and Agatha let go of her hand before they stepped outside. Rio already missed the contact.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they stepped out into the hallway, the hum of the university around them, they walked in quiet synchronicity, their bodies naturally falling into step. The distance between them was respectful, professional—but every so often, Agatha’s hand would brush against Rio’s, lingering just a little too long before retreating, as if testing a boundary neither of them wanted to enforce.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head toward Agatha, stealing a glance, only to find Agatha already looking at her. There was a softness there, an understanding, something unspoken that they didn’t need to put into words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just before they reached the point where they would have to part ways, Agatha slowed, turning slightly toward Rio. For a moment, it seemed like she might say something more—but instead, she reached out once again, fingers ghosting over Rio’s wrist before squeezing gently, just once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a small, simple gesture. But Rio felt it everywhere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“See you soon,” Agatha murmured, the promise in her voice wrapping around Rio like warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her heart thudding. “Yeah. See you soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Neither of them looked back when they parted ways this time. They didn’t need to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Because this time, there was no denying it—this wasn’t going away. And neither of them wanted it to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a quiet afternoon, and Agatha had just finished a meeting when she glanced at the time and realized that it was nearly time to pick up Nicky from his dance class. She had been distracted lately, her thoughts constantly drifting to Rio, but now she had to focus on her responsibilities. It was a simple task—picking up Nicky—but for some reason, it felt different today. She hadn’t seen Rio since their meeting about her thesis, only a few hours ago,  but she already missed her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe seeing Rio, even just in passing, today would make it easier. Or maybe it would make it worse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Either way, she wanted to see her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha drove to the dance center, parking in front of the building. She stepped out of her car and walked inside, her eyes immediately scanning the room for Nicky. The small, brightly lit space was filled with young children practicing their routines under Rio’s watchful eye.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was teaching her ballet class, leading the children with such grace and focus that Agatha momentarily forgot the reason she was there. Her movements were fluid, her voice gentle but firm, guiding the little ones as they performed their pirouettes and leaps. Her presence in the classroom was commanding, yet so naturally warm. Agatha watched her for a moment, feeling the familiar flutter in her chest. Rio, so passionate about teaching and dancing, was captivating in a way that Agatha couldn’t and didn’t want to shake.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha cleared her throat, and Rio’s head snapped around, her eyes meeting Agatha’s almost immediately. There was a moment of surprise in Rio’s expression, and then a quick flash of something else—perhaps a question, an unspoken acknowledgment of what had passed between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice steady but warm. She gave a small smile, as though the space between them had been momentarily erased by the simple greeting. “I didn’t expect you to pick up Nicky today.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for just a second before answering. “I had a gap between meetings,” she said, offering a smile of her own. “I thought I’d come by and see him in action.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips quirked slightly, a knowing glint in her eyes. “Right,” she murmured, turning back to her students. She gave a gentle correction to one of the students before looking back at Agatha. “I’m sure he’s excited to see you.”</p><p align="justify">  </p><p align="justify">Nicky, who had been practicing near the back of the room, suddenly spotted Agatha standing by the door. His face lit up, and he quickly bounded over to her, his little ballet slippers scuffing the floor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama!” he exclaimed, his arms outstretched.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha bent down to scoop him up, grinning as he wrapped his arms around her neck. She chuckled softly, brushing a strand of hair from his face. “Hey, buddy,” she said, kissing the top of his head. “Did you have fun today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded enthusiastically, practically vibrating with excitement. “Yeah! Miss Rio taught us a new turn, and I almost didn’t wobble this time!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He wriggled out of her arms, his tiny feet touching the floor before he spun in place, arms outstretched, determination written all over his face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Look, I’m getting better!” he declared proudly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched, amusement flickering across her expression as she crouched down to his level. “I see that!” she said, her voice full of genuine admiration. “You’re amazing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, rocking back on his heels. “Miss Rio says I have to keep practicing my balance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze lifted to Rio, their eyes meeting again. Rio smiled, soft and fond. “He’s a quick learner,” she said. “A little fearless, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, brushing her fingers through Nicky’s curls. “That doesn’t surprise me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio crouched next to them, her presence so close now that Agatha could catch the faintest scent of her perfume—something warm and familiar. “You did really well today, Nicky,” Rio said, reaching out to tap his nose playfully. “I think you’re going to master that turn in no time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, practically glowing under the praise. “Can I show you next week, Mama?” he asked, turning back to Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, smoothing down the collar of his shirt. “Of course. I wouldn’t miss it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced at Rio, who had been quietly watching the exchange between them. There was a moment of silence, and Agatha felt the familiar pull in her chest. “Hey Nicky, go get you bag, okay?” she said, her eyes never leaving Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, Mama!” Nicky chirped before dashing off toward the cubbies in the corner, his excitement making his little ballet slippers squeak against the floor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as he was out of sight, Agatha acted on impulse. She took a single step forward, closing the small distance between them, and before she could overthink it, she leaned in and pressed a soft, quick kiss to Rio’s lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught, but she melted into the kiss almost instantly, her fingers instinctively brushing against Agatha’s wrist. When Agatha pulled back, Rio’s smile was wide and unguarded, something bright and genuine that made Agatha’s chest tighten in the best way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as Rio began to lean in again, just as her hand ghosted higher over Agatha’s arm, the sound of small, hurried footsteps broke them apart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I got it!” Nicky announced proudly, holding up his bag like a trophy as he bounced back toward them. He paused for a second, glancing between Agatha and Rio, completely oblivious to what had just happened. “Can we get ice cream, Mama?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft chuckle, smoothing a hand over his curls. “It might be a little late for that, buddy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was watching them with an affectionate expression, warmth lingering in her eyes. Agatha turned back to her, her voice softer when she spoke again. “Thanks for teaching him,” she said, sincerity woven into every word. “He really loves coming here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips twitched into something that wasn’t quite a smirk, but something close. “It’s my pleasure,” she murmured. “He’s a quick learner. A natural.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers flexed at her side, resisting the urge to reach for Rio again. There was something about the way she was looking at her—like she knew exactly what Agatha was thinking but was letting her figure it out on her own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A few quiet seconds passed, the kind that were neither awkward nor rushed. Just… filled with something unspoken, something weighty.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio broke the silence first, her voice light but carrying an underlying meaning. “I’ll let you two go. I’ll see you next time, Nicky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded eagerly and grinned, giving her a dramatic wave. “Bye, Miss Rio!”         </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But before he could take off, Agatha’s hand found his shoulder, gently guiding him back toward her. She gave Rio one last look, an unspoken message passing between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“See you later, Rio,” Agatha said softly, her voice carrying a hint of something more—something unspoken, but shared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a quiet nod in return, her smile warm but with a subtle undertone of something more. “Take care, Agatha. See you soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart gave a quiet, traitorous skip at the sound of her name on Rio’s lips. There was something about the way Rio said it—like it belonged to her alone, like it meant something more than just a simple farewell. And though the complexities of their situation pressed at the edges of her mind, for now, Agatha chose to let them rest, to allow herself this moment of quiet happiness as she turned toward Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took his small hand in hers, grounding herself in the weight of his warmth, his presence. But as they stepped outside, something pulled at her, an invisible thread tugging insistently at her ribs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was still standing by the classroom door, leaning lightly against the frame, watching them leave. When their eyes met, Rio’s smile deepened just slightly, just enough for Agatha to feel it settle in her chest like a secret only they shared. It was soft, knowing. A promise, unspoken but understood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned away before she let herself linger too long, but even as she and Nicky stepped out into the crisp afternoon air, Rio’s expression stayed with her, woven into the fabric of her thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Inside the dance center, Rio remained by the doorway, watching as Agatha and Nicky disappeared from sight. The world moved around her—children giggling as they packed their bags, parents chatting with one another, the faint rustle of ballet slippers against the wooden floor—but for just a moment, none of it touched her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her chest felt light, warm in a way she hadn’t expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The way Agatha had kissed her—quick, fleeting, yet impossibly soft—still lingered on her lips, a ghost of something she already missed. It was a stolen moment, but those were the ones that meant the most, the ones that made her heart race and settle all at once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She thought about earlier that day. The stolen glances in the hallway, the way Agatha’s fingers had brushed against hers with deliberate slowness, the way her voice had softened when speaking to Nicky. It wasn’t just the kiss that made Rio’s chest flutter—it was all of it. It was Agatha, entirely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Every time their eyes met, every time Agatha said her name in that way—half a whisper, half a confession—it felt like a spark catching fire. A fire that didn’t burn or consume, but warmed her from the inside out. And even when they were apart, Rio could still feel the pull of it, like an invisible thread tying them together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She let out a slow breath, her fingers grazing her own wrist absentmindedly, remembering the feeling of Agatha’s touch from earlier.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They were a secret to the world, but Rio didn’t feel burdened by it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">No, this—whatever it was between them—felt like a quiet, thrilling intimacy. Something that belonged to them and them alone. They didn’t need to share it with anyone; it was theirs, and it was enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">In the weeks that followed, Rio and Agatha became masters of stolen moments. Every glance across the lecture hall, every brief touch exchanged in the quiet corners of the dance center or the dimly lit corridors of campus, carried a charge that neither could ignore. They weren’t always together, but when they were, it was electric—an unspoken connection that made every moment feel significant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a thrill in their secrecy, a shared understanding that only deepened their bond. Late at night, when Rio’s phone buzzed softly with a message from Agatha—<em>Are you awake?</em>—her heart would leap. She’d reply instantly, and minutes later, they’d find themselves sharing soft, hurried conversations over the phone, voices low, as if the world might hear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Other times, they’d meet in person. Agatha had started coming to the dance center under the pretense of picking up Nicky, but those stolen five or ten minutes were worth every risk. They lingered in the quiet corners of the studio, their hands brushing as they exchanged hushed words. Once, Agatha had leaned down as if to adjust her bag, her lips just brushing Rio’s ear as she whispered, “You look beautiful today.” The compliment had stayed with Rio for hours, warming her through every mundane task.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The best moments, though, were when they could truly be alone. On rare evenings, Agatha would sneak away from the demands of work and motherhood to visit Rio’s apartment. Rio would greet her at the door, pulling her inside before anyone might notice. Behind closed doors, all the tension melted away. They’d curl up together on Rio’s small couch, the soft glow of lamplight illuminating their faces. Agatha would read passages from Rio’s latest thesis draft, her voice steady and rich, while Rio traced lazy patterns on her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Those evenings were filled with stolen kisses, whispered confessions, and quiet laughter. Agatha, who always seemed so composed and untouchable in class, was softer here, more vulnerable. She’d bury her face in Rio’s neck, her arms wrapped tightly around her, and Rio would stroke her hair, marveling at how this brilliant, passionate woman had chosen her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t perfect, of course. There were moments of doubt, flashes of guilt when they remembered the rules they were skirting or the risks they were taking. But then Agatha would look at Rio with that rare, unguarded smile, and every fear would fade. How could something that felt so right be wrong?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They were careful, always careful. No one could know. It wasn’t just about the rules—it was about protecting what they had, this fragile, precious thing they’d built between them. In public, they maintained their professionalism, never giving anyone a reason to suspect. But in private, when it was just the two of them, there was no need for pretense.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Every moment was worth it. The sneaking around, the waiting, the longing—it all became part of the connection they shared. And when they were together, nothing else mattered. The world outside could wait. In those stolen moments, they were free.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It had been a long day at the dance center, and Rio was eager to head home. She was juggling too many emotions these days—confusion, longing, and that maddening thrill she couldn’t shake whenever Agatha crossed her mind. But as she stepped out onto the quiet street, her thoughts scattered like leaves in the wind when she saw her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air seemed to shift, thick and oppressive, as Rio froze mid-step. Maya was leaning casually against a lamppost, scrolling through her phone like she had all the time in the world. When she looked up, a smirk spread across her face, sharp as ever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, well. If it isn’t Rio Vidal,” Maya drawled, slipping her phone into her pocket. Her voice had that same velvet edge to it, both familiar and unsettling. “It’s been a while.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart pounded against her ribs. Her throat tightened, and she felt that familiar, sinking sensation—a combination of dread and anger. “What are you doing here?” she managed, her voice barely steady.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s smirk didn’t falter. “Relax. I’m not stalking you, if that’s what you’re thinking. I was just passing through and—what do you know? There you were.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, clutching the strap of her bag as though it could ground her. She didn’t believe her. Maya’s sudden appearance felt too calculated, too convenient, but what could she do? Confrontation had never been her strength, especially not with Maya.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You look good,” Maya continued, her eyes scanning Rio in a way that made her skin crawl. “Really thriving, huh? New place, new life. Good for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bristled at the patronizing tone, but the words still burrowed under her skin. That was Maya’s talent—she didn’t need to shout or insult outright; her words carried the weight of quiet manipulation, cutting deeply without seeming cruel.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I need to go,” Rio said abruptly, moving to step around her. But Maya wasn’t finished.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wait a second.” Maya’s hand shot out, gently grabbing Rio’s arm. Not hard enough to hurt, but enough to stop her in her tracks. “Don’t be like that. We had something, Rio. You don’t just throw that away. Don’t you miss it, even a little?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled her arm free, her stomach twisting in knots. “What we had wasn’t healthy, Maya,” she said, her voice sharper now, though her hands trembled. “You made sure of that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s expression faltered for a brief moment, but then her smirk returned, colder this time. “Oh, so that’s how you see it now? All my fault, right? Convenient.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s chest felt tight, the weight of old wounds pressing down on her. She didn’t owe Maya anything—not an explanation, not her time, not her attention. But years of letting Maya’s words dictate her emotions made it hard to break the habit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Goodbye, Maya,” she said firmly, not waiting for a response this time. She walked quickly down the street, not daring to look back. Her pace didn’t slow until she reached her apartment building, her hands fumbling with the keys as she tried to steady her breathing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha arrived at Rio’s apartment that evening, she immediately noticed the change in her demeanor. Rio had always been vibrant around her, a spark of life and confidence, but tonight, she was subdued. Her smile was forced, her laugh hollow. It didn’t take long for Agatha to press gently, her hand resting on Rio’s knee as they sat together on the couch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you alright, darling?” Agatha asked, her voice soft, her thumb tracing soothing circles over Rio’s skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, her gaze flickering to the window as if searching for the right words. Finally, she took a deep breath. “I ran into someone today. Maya.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brows furrowed. The name was unfamiliar, but the way Rio said it, heavy and loaded with emotion, spoke volumes. “Who is Maya?” she asked carefully.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s throat tightened. “She’s… my ex. We were together for a while, but it was… complicated. Toxic, really. She had this way of making me feel like I wasn’t enough, like everything was my fault. And seeing her again… I don’t know. It just messed me up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s jaw tightened. Anger flared in her chest—not at Rio, but at whoever had made her feel like this. “Did she say something to you?” she asked, her voice calm but firm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged, her fingers nervously tracing the hem of her sweater. “She didn’t have to. Just seeing her was enough. She always had this power over me, you know? She could twist anything, make me doubt myself without even trying. And for a moment today, it felt like I was right back there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached out, cupping Rio’s face and tilting it up so their eyes met. “She doesn’t have that power anymore,” she said firmly. “You’re stronger than that. And you’re not alone.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes glistened, and she leaned into Agatha’s touch. After a moment, she added, almost in a whisper, “I think you’ve seen her before. Remember the café, when you ran into me, Alice, and Jen? She was there. Sitting with us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s mind flashed back to that day. The image of the woman sitting with Rio surfaced, her sharp gaze and possessive demeanor suddenly making sense. The thought of Maya’s influence over Rio left a bitter taste in her mouth, but Agatha pushed it aside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She doesn’t deserve a place in your life, not even in your thoughts,” Agatha said softly, her lips brushing Rio’s temple. “And if she ever tries to bother you again, you tell me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled lightly, her tears finally spilling over. “What are you going to do? Hex her?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t tempt me,” Agatha replied, a small smirk tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed like that for the rest of the night, Agatha holding Rio close, her warmth and presence chasing away the shadows of Maya’s reappearance. Wrapped in Agatha’s arms, Rio finally felt the weight of the encounter begin to lift.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky had always been an observant child, even if Agatha occasionally underestimated just how much he picked up on. As they sat together in the living room that evening, with Nicky sprawled across the floor coloring while Agatha graded papers, he suddenly looked up at her with his big, curious eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama,” he said thoughtfully, his crayon poised mid-air, “you look happier these days.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown off by his comment. “Happier?” she repeated, lowering her pen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Nicky replied, nodding seriously. “Like when I get ice cream after dinner happy. Or when you find one of your favorite old books happy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She chuckled softly, her chest warming at his innocent comparison. “That’s a very specific kind of happy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, it’s true,” Nicky insisted. “You’ve been smiling more. And you don’t do the sigh thing as much anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The sigh thing?” Agatha echoed, raising an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, you know. When you’re tired or mad, you go…” Nicky scrunched up his face dramatically and let out an exaggerated sigh that made Agatha laugh outright.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, okay, I get it,” she said, holding up her hands in mock surrender. “I’ll try to keep the sighing to a minimum.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But why are you happier, Mama?” Nicky asked, tilting his head like a puppy trying to solve a puzzle. “Is it because of Miss Rio?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha froze for a fraction of a second before recovering, keeping her expression neutral. “What makes you say that?” she asked carefully, her heart picking up speed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cause you smile different when you talk to her,” Nicky said matter-of-factly, returning to his coloring. “And she’s nice. I like her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed her lips together, hiding a smile. Leave it to her six-year-old to point out the things she thought she’d kept so well-hidden. “I’m glad you like her,” she said softly, ruffling his hair as he giggled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is she gonna babysit me again?” Nicky asked, looking up at her hopefully.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, unsure how to answer that without giving too much away. “Maybe,” she said with a small smile. “We’ll see.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed and went back to his drawing, humming a tune to himself. Agatha, meanwhile, leaned back in her chair, her thoughts drifting. It wasn’t just that Rio made her happier—it was the way she made everything feel lighter, brighter, as though the weight Agatha had carried for so long wasn’t quite so heavy anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her son was right. She was happier these days. And as terrifying as it was to admit, the reason was unmistakably clear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The practice space was alive with the sounds of strumming guitars, rhythmic drumbeats, and Jen’s voice humming as she tuned her instrument. Rio adjusted her stool behind the drum kit, tapping the sticks together absently, trying to focus on the rhythm she’d been working on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But, as had become a recurring theme lately, Alice and Jen were impossible to ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, lovebirds,” Rio finally said, exasperation lacing her voice as she watched Alice lean into Jen, their heads close together as they whispered something that had absolutely nothing to do with music. “Are we here to rehearse or for date night?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice grinned unapologetically, not bothering to remove her arm from where it rested casually over Jen’s shoulder. “Both, obviously,” she quipped, stealing one of Jen’s picks and flipping it through her fingers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen rolled her eyes but was clearly amused, her smile soft as she glanced at Alice. “It’s not my fault Alice keeps distracting me,” she said, her tone mock-innocent.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey!” Alice protested with a laugh. “I’m inspiration, not distraction.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned dramatically, throwing her head back. “Inspiration for what? A ballad about your inability to keep your hands to yourself?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen laughed, plucking her guitar strings in a way that mimicked the dramatic tone of a soap opera. “<em>Oh, Alice, my muse, my heart, my relentless interruption.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice nudged her, pretending to pout. “You love my interruptions.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do,” Jen admitted, her voice softening in a way that made Rio immediately avert her gaze, feeling like an intruder on a private moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Guys,” Rio interrupted loudly, rattling her sticks against the drum rims to regain their attention. “Seriously, can we play at least one song all the way through without you two being… whatever this is?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smirked, clearly unbothered. “Whatever this is, is love, Rio. You wouldn’t understand.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Love or not, <em>Three of Swords</em> has a gig in two weeks, and I’m not gonna let you two derail it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen held up her hands in mock surrender. “Okay, okay. No more PDA. We’ll behave.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Doubt it,” Rio muttered under her breath, earning a laugh from Alice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The band finally settled into a groove, the room filling with the sound of their music. But even as Rio lost herself in the rhythm, the sight of Alice leaning into Jen between songs lingered in the back of her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s teasing remark echoed in Rio’s mind long after the band had finally managed to get through a full song.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Whatever this is, is love, Rio. You wouldn’t understand.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She’d brushed it off with a sarcastic retort, but now, as she sat behind her drum kit during a short break, her hands still fidgeting with her sticks, the words refused to leave her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Did she understand?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her thoughts drifted to Agatha. The way her sharp wit could make Rio laugh even when she felt like she was at her lowest. The way her gaze would linger just a second longer than necessary, softening in those rare, unguarded moments. The way her touch—so brief and careful in public, but warm and grounding when they were alone—left Rio yearning for more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She thought of the quiet evenings spent in stolen moments, curled up together on Agatha’s couch or tangled in the warmth of each other’s arms at Rio’s apartment. The way Agatha’s voice softened when she said her name. The way her heart raced when Agatha smiled at her, a private smile meant only for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">If that wasn’t love, it was something awfully close.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, she wasn’t sure she could call it that. Not yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t because it didn’t feel real—it did, so intensely it sometimes took her breath away. It was because it still felt fragile, like a glass ornament perched on the edge of a shelf, precariously balanced. What they had was so private, so secret, and despite how good it felt to be with Agatha, Rio couldn’t ignore the weight of everything that came with it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t like Alice and Jen, so carefree and open. What Rio and Agatha had required quiet corners, unspoken promises, and stolen time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Earth to Rio,” Alice’s voice broke through her thoughts, accompanied by a light smack to the back of her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, looking up at her best friend, who was grinning at her. “What?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You were zoning out,” Alice said, plopping down on the stool beside her. “Don’t tell me I’ve made you all broody and introspective with my genius observations about love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please,” Rio scoffed, feigning indifference. “It takes more than your mediocre observations to get under my skin.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure, sure,” Alice teased, leaning in with a knowing smirk. “So what were you thinking about? Or, let me guess—<em>who</em>were you thinking about?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, swatting Alice’s arm. “None of your business.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice chuckled, clearly satisfied with herself. “Fine, keep your secrets. But don’t say I didn’t try to enlighten you about the magic of love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Alice wandered off to bother Jen again, Rio let herself smile faintly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe she didn’t fully understand love—not yet. But when she thought of Agatha, she couldn’t deny that it looked an awful lot like what she felt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat cross-legged on the worn rug in her living room, papers and books sprawled around her like the aftermath of a hurricane. Her laptop was balanced precariously on the coffee table, the screen filled with a chaotic web of notes, references, and highlighted excerpts. A pen was tucked behind her ear, and her fingers drummed rhythmically on the keyboard as her mind churned through her ideas.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For weeks, she had been circling the same questions, trying to tie together the threads of her thesis. It had felt like chasing smoke—every time she thought she had a grasp on something, it slipped through her fingers. But tonight, something was different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mind buzzed with clarity she hadn’t felt in months.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The spark had come from an offhand comment Agatha had made during their last meeting. It had been a small observation, almost a throwaway, but it had lodged itself in Rio’s mind, stubborn and insistent. Tonight, she had finally unpacked it, and the connections were clicking into place like pieces of a puzzle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“God,” she muttered, running a hand through her hair. “Why didn’t I see this before?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached for the stack of articles on the floor, rifling through until she found the one she needed. Her eyes scanned the page, and a grin spread across her face as she realized it was the missing link she’d been searching for.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just that she had an idea—it was a breakthrough. A real one. The kind of epiphany that could shape the entire trajectory of her research.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She grabbed her pen and began jotting notes furiously. The connections she had been chasing between mortality and the collapsing boundaries of time and space in Modernist works finally emerged with clarity. The idea of death not as an ending but as a transformation—a place where time and space dissolved—became her central argument. It felt like her thesis finally had a heartbeat, its skeleton solidifying under her touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help herself. She laughed, the sound startlingly loud in the quiet of her apartment. Grabbing her phone, she almost called Alice, but a glance at the clock told her it was too late for her friend’s patience.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead, she found herself staring at Agatha’s number.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before she could overthink it, Rio typed out a quick message:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <strong>Rio: </strong>
  <em>Agatha, I think I’ve had a breakthrough with my research! I’ll email you the details tomorrow, but I’m excited to show you. Thanks for your insight—it helped a lot. :)</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hovered over the send button for a moment before pressing it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Setting her phone aside, Rio leaned back, staring up at the ceiling with a satisfied smile. For the first time in weeks, she felt like she was on solid ground with her thesis. The weight of uncertainty that had been pressing down on her had lifted, replaced by a giddy sense of accomplishment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her phone buzzed, and she glanced at it. Agatha’s reply was almost immediate:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <strong>Agatha: </strong>
  <em>I’m glad to hear that, Rio. Looking forward to seeing what you’ve come up with. I’m sure it’s brilliant as always. Well done. You’re amazing.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, warmth blooming in her chest. It wasn’t just the words—it was the acknowledgment, the encouragement. Agatha had a way of making her feel like her work mattered, like <em>she</em> mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next day, Rio walked into Agatha’s office, her mind buzzing with excitement about her latest breakthrough. Her thesis had been a labyrinth of thoughts and ideas, but now, everything was starting to click. She could barely contain her enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, as always, was already there, sitting behind her desk. Her sharp eyes flickered up from the papers she was grading when Rio entered, her lips curving into a small smile. It was a smile that sent warmth flooding through Rio’s chest, a warmth that had nothing to do with her thesis.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning,” Agatha greeted, her voice soft but with an underlying strength. “You’ve made progress, I see.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped in and nodded, her nerves barely contained. “Yes, I think I’ve finally figured out how to connect the ideas of mortality and timelessness in a way that actually makes sense. It’s like… it all clicked together last night.” She handed Agatha her notes, her hands shaking just a little.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took the papers, glancing through them with her usual keen attention. The silence between them was comfortable, filled only by the sound of Agatha’s quick but steady reading. Rio couldn’t help but watch her, her heart doing that thing where it seemed to beat a little faster in Agatha’s presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a moment, Agatha set the papers down, her gaze returning to Rio. “This is good. You’re not just writing about Death. You’re exploring how it reshapes our understanding of time, space… of ourselves. It’s… powerful.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her chest swell with pride. The words of approval meant more than they should have. “I’ve been working through the connection between time and death—how death doesn’t necessarily imply an end but a transformation of how we perceive space and time. There’s this idea in the poetry I’ve been working on that time isn’t linear, that it’s fragmented, and death becomes this punctuation, but not necessarily the final one…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded thoughtfully, her fingers tapping lightly against the desk. “Yes, I see what you mean. It’s a challenging concept, but you’re handling it well.” She paused, her eyes softening as she studied Rio. “You’re making it your own. This isn’t just a thesis, Rio. It’s your personal exploration.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, a quiet laugh escaping her lips. “It feels personal, doesn’t it?” She shifted uncomfortably, but the warmth of Agatha’s praise still lingered. “It feels like I’m really starting to find my voice in all of this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room fell into silence, but this time, it wasn’t uncomfortable. Agatha studied her for a moment longer before leaning back in her chair, her eyes never leaving Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve always had a strong voice,” Agatha said softly. “I think… I think it’s just taken you a little while to find the confidence to let it out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her heart beat a little faster. Was Agatha talking about her thesis, or was she talking about something else? There was always a certain intensity in Agatha’s gaze, but today it felt… different. Rio couldn’t quite place why.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few moments of lingering silence, Agatha stood up, walking to the small window of her office. She glanced outside for a moment, her back turned to Rio. When she spoke again, her voice was quieter, more contemplative.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know you’ve been working hard,” Agatha began. “Not just on your thesis, but with everything… I know this past month has been… difficult.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, the weight of the unspoken words hanging between them. The last few weeks had been a whirlwind of emotions, of trying to balance their professional and personal lives, of pretending nothing had changed when, in truth, everything had. It wasn’t just about their relationship; it was about the complexities of everything they were both juggling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve been trying,” Rio said softly. “Trying to figure everything out. It’s not always easy to separate the personal from the professional.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned to face her, her eyes meeting Rio’s. “No. It’s never easy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In that moment, Rio realized how much she needed to hear those words. How much she needed to feel understood, to feel seen. It was as if Agatha had read her mind, understood the conflict she’d been feeling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could say anything else, Agatha walked over to her, a deliberate movement, almost as though she were waiting for Rio to respond. The air between them had thickened, charged with something neither of them could deny anymore. It was as if the whole world had shifted, and now the only thing that mattered was the space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without thinking, Rio reached out. Her fingers brushed against Agatha’s, just the briefest touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, and she didn’t pull away. Instead, she reached forward, her hand gently cupping Rio’s face, tilting it upwards.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha murmured, her voice a little rough. “We have to be careful.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, her breath coming in uneven gasps. “I know,” she whispered back. “I know. But I can’t help it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, their lips met in a kiss that was softer than usual, but no less intense. There was no hesitation this time, no pulling away. It was as if they were both in this moment, completely and entirely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally pulled apart, it wasn’t with regret. It was with a sense of understanding, as if they both knew that this—what they shared—was worth navigating the complexities for. It wasn’t just a kiss. It was something deeper, something they had both been quietly craving.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I… I don’t want to pretend anymore,” Rio said, her voice barely a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she brushed her thumb against Rio’s lips, as if committing the feeling to memory. “Then don’t,” she said finally. “We’ll take this one step at a time. Together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved into a small, mischievous smile. “I guess that’s one way to motivate me to keep working on my thesis.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, smoothing a strand of hair from Rio’s face. “Then consider it my continued encouragement.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled once again, before steeping away, conscious of the time running out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gathered her papers and Rio packed her notes, and they exited Agatha’s office. As they walked, they shared another quiet moment, walking side by side at an appropriate distance, finally going their separate way at entrance of the building.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha arrived back at her house that evening, Nicky in toe, she set her bag down on the kitchen counter, the weight of the day still hanging over her. She moved to make herself some tea, the familiar routine offering a small comfort. Nicky had already disappeared in his room, probably busy with the new Lego set Wanda had given him last week.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she rummaged through her bag, her fingers brushed against something unfamiliar—something small, folded, and tucked into the side pocket.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Curious, Agatha pulled the note out, her heart suddenly quickening in her chest. She unfolded it carefully, recognizing Rio’s handwriting immediately—neat, yet with a soft curve to the letters, as if it was written with the same care Rio put into everything she did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Agatha,</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>I’m not sure how to say this without making everything too complicated, but I need you to know this:</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>I’m scared. Not of us, but of everything we have to navigate to be together. I don’t know what it all means yet, but I feel something real between us. Something that makes me want to take risks, even if it’s scary. I just needed to say it out loud, even if it’s only on paper.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>I’m here, Agatha. And I’m willing to figure this out with you. You’re the reason I feel like I’m finally stepping into who I’m meant to be. </em>
  <em>Thank you—for everything.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Rio</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she read the words, her pulse picking up with every line. The note was raw, honest, and everything she’d wanted to hear, even if she hadn’t realized it. The vulnerability in Rio’s words made Agatha’s chest tighten, a warmth spreading through her that had nothing to do with the tea she had planned to make.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stared at the note for a long time, the weight of it heavy in her hands, before slipping it into her pocket. Rio had said she didn’t want to pretend anymore, and now this—this note—was the confirmation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Everything was real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha leaned against the counter, her heart racing, she realized just how much she had been holding back. She’d spent so much time trying to stay professional, trying to keep things in their proper boxes, but now it felt like all those walls were crumbling. Rio was here, willing to be with her, despite everything—despite the risks, the complications.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Agatha didn’t want to hide it anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had never been one for false pretenses, for pretending that what she felt didn’t matter. With Rio, it mattered. It mattered more than anything else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Taking a deep breath, Agatha folded the note again and tucked it safely into her bag, already anticipating the next time she would see Rio. Because now, she knew they were ready to face whatever came next, together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha knew she couldn’t let it sit unacknowledged.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next day, she found Rio alone in the PhD office after hours, sifting through her notes. The faint sound of music playing softly from her phone filled the room, and Rio looked up when Agatha knocked gently on the doorframe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey,” Rio said, offering a small smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped inside, closing the door behind her. “I found your note.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile faltered slightly, a faint flush creeping up her neck. “Oh. Right. I wasn’t sure if you’d see it or if it would get lost in your bag.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I found it,” Agatha assured her, taking a seat across from Rio. “And I wanted to say…thank you. That was—it meant a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio relaxed slightly, though the hint of pink on her cheeks remained. “I meant every word,” she said softly. “You’ve done so much for me, Agatha. More than I think you realize.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The way she said Agatha’s name sent a ripple through her, a gentle reminder of how much had shifted between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m glad,” Agatha said quietly. “But I want you to know it’s a two-way street. Working with you—it’s one of the most fulfilling things I’ve ever done. You remind me why I love this work in the first place.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze softened, and for a moment, they simply looked at each other, the silence between them charged but comforting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached into her pocket and pulled out the note, holding it up with a faint smile. “This is staying with me,” she said. “But next time, don’t slip something like this into my bag without warning. It nearly gave me a heart attack.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, the sound light and easy, and it broke through the lingering tension. “Noted,” she said, her eyes sparkling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tucked the note back into her pocket, her expression turning thoughtful. “I’m glad you’re stepping into who you’re meant to be, Rio. But don’t forget—you’re the one doing the work. I’m just lucky enough to be here with you while you figure it out. And I’m scared too, you know. But you’re right, it feels right, <em>you</em> feel right, so I’m willing to try and fight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And without another word, Agatha left the office. Rio’s smile lingered long after Agatha left the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

</p><p align="justify">The afternoon sunlight filtered through the blinds of Agatha’s office, casting golden stripes across the scattered papers and books on her desk. She had been reviewing a stack of drafts with Rio when one lingering touch led to another, and suddenly, the space between them had dissolved.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span>Agatha had looked up at her, her expression unreadable but her eyes dark with something Rio couldn’t quite name—or maybe didn’t dare to. “Rio…” Agatha’s voice was low, a warning, a question, and an invitation all at once.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now, Rio had crossed to the other side of the desk, practically in Agatha’s lap, her lips brushing against Agatha’s with a mix of urgency and tenderness. The faint scent of Rio’s perfume filled the air, intoxicating and grounding all at once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is reckless,” Rio murmured between kisses, though her hands betrayed her words, tangling themselves in Agatha’s long dark curls.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Agatha replied breathlessly, her lips ghosting over Rio’s jawline. “But I can’t seem to stop.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their kisses grew deeper, the world outside the office fading into irrelevance. Agatha’s hand found Rio’s waist, pulling her closer, while Rio tilted her head to deepen the kiss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A sudden knock on the door shattered the moment like a pane of glass.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness?” a voice called from the other side. “Are you in there?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha froze, her eyes wide as she glanced at the door. Panic flared in her chest as she registered the voice—it was Professor Davies, one of her colleagues, an oldish woman, whose name Agatha always had trouble remembering.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes widened as well, her cheeks flushed. “What do we do?” she whispered frantically, her voice barely audible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s mind raced, her heartbeat thundering in her ears. Without a word, she gestured toward the small nook behind a bookcase near the window. Rio didn’t hesitate, slipping behind it as quietly as possible, her movements quick and fluid.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once Rio was out of sight, Agatha smoothed her skirt, adjusted her hair, and hurried to the door. She opened it just enough to meet Professor Davies’ gaze, keeping the rest of the room concealed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, yes Sharon, what can I do for you?” Agatha asked, her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I just had a quick question about the faculty meeting tomorrow,” Sharon said, holding up a folder. “I wasn’t sure if you had seen the revised agenda.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha forced a polite smile, glancing briefly at the folder. “I did, yes. Everything looks in order. Is there something specific you’re concerned about?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the conversation continued, Rio remained hidden behind the bookcase, her heart pounding in time with Agatha’s words. She could hear every exchange, her mind racing with what might happen if they were caught. Her hand pressed lightly against her mouth to stifle any sound, though she couldn’t suppress the faint rush of adrenaline that came with the thrill of it all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After what felt like an eternity, Sharon finally nodded and said, “Well, that’s all I needed. Thanks, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No problem,” Agatha replied smoothly. “Have a good afternoon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as the door clicked shut, Agatha let out a shaky breath and turned back toward the bookcase.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You can come out now,” she said softly, her voice tinged with relief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped out cautiously, her cheeks still flushed. “That was close.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Too close,” Agatha agreed, though a small smile played at the corners of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh, the sound soft and full of nervous energy. “This is what I get for sneaking around with my professor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched a brow, stepping closer to her. “If I recall, you were the one who kissed me first.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And you were the one who kissed me back,” Rio shot back, though her voice was teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s face. “We really need to be more careful.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, though the glimmer in her eyes suggested she wasn’t entirely opposed to the risk. “Agreed. But I have to admit…that was kind of exhilarating.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head with a laugh, pulling Rio into a brief but tender kiss. “You’re impossible,” she murmured, though her tone was filled with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned. “And yet, here we are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they settled back into the relative quiet of the office, still buzzing from their near-miss, a sense of sobriety began to creep into the moment. Agatha perched on the edge of her desk, her arms crossed, while Rio leaned against the bookcase, her arms wrapped around herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We need to talk about this,” Agatha said softly, her voice steady but carrying an undertone of concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, already sensing where the conversation was heading. “Yeah, I figured we couldn’t just…ignore it forever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked down at her hands for a moment before meeting Rio’s gaze. “This…us, it’s amazing. But it’s also complicated. You’re my student, my advisee. If anyone finds out—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Rio interrupted, her voice quiet but firm. “It could get messy. People might think you’re giving me special treatment, or worse, that I’m using this to my advantage.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha flinched slightly, hating the implications. “That’s the last thing I’d ever want for you—or for me. Our work together has always been so…collaborative. Your thesis is brilliant, Rio. It’s all you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked away for a moment, a slight flush rising to her cheeks at the praise. “And you’ve made it better. You challenge me in ways no one else ever has. I don’t want to lose that just because of…” She gestured vaguely between them, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “…this thing we’re figuring out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s shoulders relaxed slightly, but her expression remained serious. “Neither do I. But if at any point this feels wrong—if the professional boundaries get too blurred, or you feel like you’re not getting the mentorship you deserve—we have to be honest with each other. We’ll find a way to transfer you to another supervisor if we need to. No hesitation, no regrets.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, her fingers playing with the hem of her shirt. “Do you think that’s what we should do now?” she asked, her voice quieter, almost hesitant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head. “No. Not unless you think so. We work too well together, Rio. I trust you, and I hope you trust me to keep this balanced.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved into a small, genuine smile. “I do trust you. And I don’t want to go anywhere else. This…relationship, whatever it’s turning into, doesn’t change how much I respect you as my supervisor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A warm flush spread across Agatha’s chest at Rio’s words, but she kept her expression steady. “Then we keep going,” she said, her tone firm. “We keep our relationship private and separate from our work. And if either of us feels it’s becoming a problem, we promise to say something. Agreed?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her smile widening. “Agreed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, her hand brushing against Rio’s lightly before she pulled her into a soft embrace. “We’ll make it work,” Agatha murmured, her voice low but resolute.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder, exhaling a deep breath. “Yeah. We will.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, the worries and complications faded, leaving only the warmth of each other’s presence. It wasn’t perfect, and it wasn’t simple, but they both knew it was worth it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood at the counter, stirring a pot of sauce while glancing at the clock. Rio would be arriving any moment, and though she had framed this as a casual dinner, her nerves buzzed beneath the surface.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky was busy setting the table, placing plates and cutlery with an enthusiasm only a six-year-old could muster. “Is Miss Rio going to dance after dinner?” he asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, sweetheart,” Agatha said with a soft chuckle. “She’s just coming to eat with us tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shrugged. “Okay. I like when she dances, though.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her heart warming at the innocent statement. Nicky had grown fond of Rio over the past months, often chatting about her after dance class. It was another layer of complication—keeping their relationship quiet while knowing Rio had already become a beloved figure in her son’s life.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The doorbell rang, and Nicky raced to open it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio!” he exclaimed, pulling her inside before she could even say hello.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, her arms full with a bottle of wine and a bag of cookies she’d baked. “Hi, Nicky. You’re getting faster every time I see you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on, we’re eating spaghetti,” Nicky said, dragging her toward the kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned from the stove, her breath catching for a moment at the sight of Rio. She wore a simple forest green sweater that set off her eyes, her hair falling loose around her shoulders. Agatha forced herself to focus on the task at hand, though her fingers itched to reach out and touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Perfect timing,” Agatha said, offering a smile. “I hope you like spaghetti.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Who doesn’t?” Rio replied, setting the wine and cookies on the counter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they sat down to eat, Nicky launched into a detailed story about his day at school, his animated gestures making Rio laugh. Agatha watched the two of them interact, her chest tightening with a mix of affection and longing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio caught her gaze across the table, her eyes warm and knowing. She reached for the breadbasket, her fingers brushing Agatha’s as she passed it over. The touch was fleeting but sent a jolt through both of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Throughout the meal, there were small moments like that—Rio’s knee brushing against Agatha’s under the table, a shared look when Nicky said something particularly funny, the softening of Rio’s features when Agatha spoke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">If Nicky noticed anything, he didn’t show it. He was too busy twirling spaghetti onto his fork and asking Rio about her favorite animals.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dinner, while Nicky worked on a drawing at the kitchen table, Rio and Agatha stood side by side washing dishes. Their shoulders bumped occasionally, and Agatha leaned in just slightly to murmur, “Thank you for coming tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced sideways at her, her smile soft. “Thanks for having me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finished, Nicky bounded over to show them his drawing of “Super Rio,” a caped version of his dance teacher holding what appeared to be a plate of spaghetti.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is going on the fridge,” Agatha declared, laughing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Soon, Nicky started to yawn loudly, rubbing her eyes with his sleeves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, off too bed, Mister.” Agatha said, putting all the crayons back in their box.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you coming to dance class tomorrow, Miss Rio?” he asked, his eyes sleepy but wide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Rio said, ruffling his hair. “I’ll see you there, buddy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky smiled widely, and threw his little arms around Rio’s middle, catching the young woman off guard. The little boy disentangled himself and walked to his mom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama, you’re smiling weird,” Nicky said, tugging at her sleeve.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She laughed, scooping him up into her arms. “Am I? Must be because I had such a good night.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky wrinkled his nose. “It’s just spaghetti.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sometimes, it’s more than spaghetti,” Agatha murmured, her eyes finding Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha excused herself to tuck him in, leaving Rio alone in the living room. She wandered around, taking in the cozy space that was so inherently Agatha—bookshelves brimming with well-worn spines, a couple of plants thriving in the warm glow of a nearby lamp that Rio remembered having seen the last time she was over and thinking they would need a little tending and watering, even if their number not nearly as much as the ones adorning Rio’s apartment, and a soft throw draped over the arm of the couch. It felt lived-in, a space that carried its owner’s presence in every corner.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha returned, her steps were quiet, her face softened in that particular way it always was after moments with Nicky. “Out like a light,” she said, settling into the armchair opposite the couch where Rio sat. “Bedtime stories never fail.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled. “He’s a great kid.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, a glimmer of pride in her expression. “He is. Thank you for being so good with him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t have to thank me for that,” Rio replied, her voice warm. “I enjoy spending time with him. He’s got your sharpness, you know. Always observing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The compliment hung in the air between them, drawing out a comfortable silence. Agatha leaned back in her chair, her gaze drifting to Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m glad you stayed,” she admitted, her voice softer now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wasn’t sure if I should,” Rio replied, tilting her head. “Didn’t want to overstep, with Nicky and everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled. “You’re not overstepping. It’s nice to have company.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words were simple, but the way Agatha said them felt heavy with meaning. Rio shifted slightly on the couch, her fingers brushing over the armrest, leaning closer. “Well, if you’re sure.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood, moving toward the small cabinet by the kitchen. “I’m sure. Besides, I was about to open a bottle of wine. Care to join me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips quirked into a smile. “How could I say no?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha poured them each a glass, handing one to Rio before taking a seat beside her on the couch. The distance between them felt deliberate, but it didn’t stop the charge of awareness that hummed in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So,” Agatha began, swirling her wine. “Are you going to tell me what you really thought of dinner? Nicky said you’d love spaghetti, but he’s biased.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, the sound light and genuine. “It was perfect, honestly. But I think it was more the company than the food.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her cheeks warming slightly. She sipped her wine, glancing at Rio over the rim of her glass. “You always have a way of saying things that feel like they mean more than they do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe they do,” Rio murmured, her eyes meeting Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung there, a quiet invitation that neither of them dared to break. Agatha set her glass on the table, leaning slightly closer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” she said softly, her voice low and intimate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, her heart racing. “Yeah?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for a moment, as if weighing whether to speak or act. Then, slowly, she reached out, her fingers brushing against Rio’s cheek. Rio leaned into the touch, her eyes fluttering closed for a moment before reopening to find Agatha watching her with an intensity that made her breath catch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Stay,” Agatha said, barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wasn’t planning on leaving,” Rio replied, her voice trembling slightly, though her resolve was steady.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed the gap between them, their lips meeting in a slow, deliberate kiss. It was different from their previous stolen moments—less urgent, more deliberate, as if they were both savoring the chance to just <em>be</em> with each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally pulled back, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, her hand still cradling her cheek. “You make it very hard to stick to rules.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her fingers lightly tracing the edge of Agatha’s hand. “Maybe some rules are meant to be bent.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back into the couch, pulling Rio into her arms as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Rio rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder, letting out a deep, contented sigh. It felt surreal, being here in this moment—no stolen seconds, no hurried exchanges. Just them, in the quiet sanctuary of Agatha’s home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Rio began softly, her voice slightly muffled against Agatha’s sweater, “I don’t think I’ve ever felt this… safe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand instinctively began tracing gentle patterns along Rio’s arm. “Safe?” she echoed, her voice tinged with curiosity and a hint of concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio admitted, tilting her head to look up at Agatha. “Like I don’t have to hide or worry. Like I can just… breathe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a small, tender smile. “You deserve that. To feel safe, and seen, and cared for.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached up, her fingers brushing a strand of hair away from Agatha’s face. “I feel all of that when I’m with you. It’s kind of terrifying, honestly.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, dipping her head to press a lingering kiss to Rio’s forehead. “Terrifying how?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, her cheeks flushing slightly. “Like, what if this doesn’t last? What if I screw it up somehow? You’re…you’re so <em>you,</em> Agatha. And I’m just me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brows knitted together, and she cupped Rio’s face gently. “Rio, don’t ever think that way. You’re brilliant. Passionate. Kind. You make me feel things I didn’t think I’d ever feel again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught, her heart racing at the raw honesty in Agatha’s words. She swallowed hard, her fingers gripping Agatha’s sweater as she leaned in, capturing her lips in a kiss that was slow and deep, as if she could pour all her gratitude and adoration into that single moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they broke apart, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, her hands cradling her face. “I’m not going anywhere,” she whispered, her tone resolute. “Whatever this is, we’ll figure it out. Together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her eyes shimmering with emotion. “Together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they lounged together on the couch, Rio traced absent-minded patterns on Agatha’s arm. The room was bathed in a soft golden glow from the lamp in the corner, creating an atmosphere of intimacy and ease. Yet, Rio’s face grew contemplative, her fingers stilling as if she were gathering the courage to speak.</p><p> </p><p align="justify">“Can I tell you something?” she asked quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned toward her, her expression immediately open and attentive. “Of course,” she said gently, her voice a quiet reassurance. “You can tell me anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Rio didn’t speak. Her teeth caught her bottom lip, and she toyed with the hem of her sweater as though trying to anchor herself. “It’s not something I talk about often,” she admitted, her voice trembling slightly. “Or…at all, really.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest tightened, but she kept her response measured, offering Rio the space she needed. She rested her hand on top of Rio’s, giving it a light squeeze, her thumb brushing against her knuckles in a rhythm that said <em>I’m here. </em><em>Take your time.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I grew up in foster care,” Rio said finally, her words heavy yet steady. “It wasn’t all bad, I guess. But it wasn’t good, either.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened, her grip on Rio’s hand tightening just slightly. She remembered that night—when she had met Lilia and learned about the person who had taken Rio in. But she kept that knowledge to herself, sensing that this moment was about Rio sharing her truth, on her terms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I was bounced around a lot,” Rio continued, her voice quieter now, almost detached. “Different houses, different rules, different people. It made it hard to feel…connected to anything or anyone. And just when I’d start to settle, just when it felt like maybe this time it would be okay, I’d be uprooted again. Sometimes for reasons I didn’t even understand.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand tightened slightly on Rio’s, but still, she said nothing, her silence an invitation for Rio to keep going if she wanted to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“By the time I hit my teens, I stopped trying to attach to anyone. I figured it hurt less that way. If you don’t get attached, you don’t get disappointed, right?” Rio let out a hollow laugh, but her face betrayed the weight of those words, the years of exhaustion and loneliness buried beneath them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha wanted to speak, to tell her how wrong that was, how much she deserved connection, love, and permanence, but she bit her tongue. This wasn’t her moment to fill.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Then there was Lilia,” Rio said, her lips curving into a faint, bittersweet smile. “She wasn’t a foster parent, officially. I met her when I was a teenager. I was angry at the world, and she… she just saw right through it. She took me in. No paperwork at first, no conditions. She gave me a home when no one else would. She saved me, honestly.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She sounds incredible,” Agatha said softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She is,” Rio agreed, her gaze distant for a moment before returning to Agatha’s. “But even with her, it’s like…I don’t know if I ever stopped feeling like I had to prove that I was worth keeping.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s breath hitched at the quiet confession. She reached up, cupping Rio’s face gently. “You don’t have to prove anything to me, or to anyone. You are enough, Rio. You’ve always been enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked rapidly, a small laugh escaping her as she looked away. “You’re too good at this whole ‘saying the right thing’ thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, brushing her thumb across Rio’s cheek. “Maybe I just mean every word.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, they simply looked at each other, the weight of Rio’s words hanging in the air. Agatha wanted to tell her that she already knew, that Lilia had shared pieces of this story that night. But she also understood that this wasn’t the time to reveal that. This was about Rio trusting her, choosing to share the parts of herself she usually kept locked away. Agatha wouldn’t take that away from her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead, she leaned forward, her movements slow and deliberate, and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to Rio’s forehead. Her lips lingered there for a moment longer than necessary, a silent assurance that she wasn’t going anywhere. “Thank you for telling me,” she whispered against Rio’s skin, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio closed her eyes, leaning into the touch, her body relaxing in a way that spoke of trust hard-earned. “Thank you for listening,” she replied softly, her voice barely audible but heavy with sincerity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They settled back into their embrace, the conversation shifting to lighter topics—Nicky’s antics, Rio’s recent breakthroughs in her research, Agatha’s frustration with grading essays. They laughed, kissed, and shared quiet moments of just holding each other, as if the world outside didn’t exist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At one point, Rio teased, “I should’ve guessed you were a cuddler.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Don’t let it get around. I have a reputation to uphold.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, the sound light and free, and kissed her again. “Your secret’s safe with me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening stretched into the night, and they didn’t bother keeping track of time. It didn’t matter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

Eliot. “The dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">For weeks, Rio and Agatha had been stealing moments whenever they could, savoring the quiet intimacy of their secret. Their relationship had become a collection of stolen glances and whispered words, moments that felt more precious because of their rarity. Late-night talks in Rio’s apartment turned into hours of laughter and quiet confessions. Fleeting touches in Agatha’s office sent sparks between them, leaving them both breathless and giddy. Even a stolen kiss or two in the hidden corners of campus felt like a dangerous yet thrilling dance on the edge of discovery.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was exhilarating, yes—but also increasingly complicated. The weight of their secrecy pressed down on them, not heavy enough to break them, but enough to make them question how much longer they could keep their relationship entirely to themselves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The decision to tell someone had come up one evening as they lay tangled together on Rio’s couch, a bottle of wine half-empty on the coffee table. Agatha had been tracing lazy, absent-minded patterns on Rio’s arm, her brow furrowed in thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve been thinking,” she murmured, her voice hesitant but steady.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, her dark hair spilling over the armrest as she looked up at Agatha. “Oh no,” she teased lightly. “That tone means you’re about to say something serious.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave her a dry look but smiled faintly. “Maybe it’s time we tell someone about us,” she said, her words measured but firm, as though she’d been turning them over in her mind for days.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stilled, her curiosity flickering into her dark eyes. She shifted slightly, propping herself up on one elbow to better face Agatha. “Yeah?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded slowly, her fingers pausing in their gentle tracing to rest against Rio’s skin. “We’ve been careful—so careful—but keeping this completely to ourselves…it’s starting to feel impossible. And honestly? I’d like to know how someone we trust would react. Just one person, for now. Before we even think about anything more public.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio considered this, her fingers lightly brushing against Agatha’s. “You’re right. It’s not that I want to shout it from the rooftops—” She broke off with a laugh. “Okay, maybe a little. But having someone know, someone who’d support us…that might be good.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Agatha said. She tilted her head, watching Rio thoughtfully. “Do you have someone in mind?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip, her mind immediately going to Lilia. If anyone would understand, it would be her. Lilia had always been a steady, compassionate presence in her life, her unwavering support a foundation Rio could always rely on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia,” Rio said at last. “She’s…she’s family to me. I think she’d be okay with it. And I trust her to keep it private.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her expression softening. “She sounds like the perfect person to tell.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a beat, her brow furrowing. “Do you think I should tell her alone? Or would it be better if you were there, too?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha studied her for a moment, her fingers reaching out to gently tuck a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “That’s entirely up to you,” she said softly. “If you want me there, I’ll be there. But if you think this is something you need to do on your own, I’ll support that, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips parted, a flicker of doubt flashing across her face. The thought of facing Lilia without Agatha’s steady, grounding presence felt daunting. But at the same time, this was a conversation she felt she needed to have one-on-one. Lilia had always been there for her, and this moment needed to be hers first.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think I should do it alone,” Rio said finally, her voice steady but quiet. “At least at first. If it goes well, maybe we could both sit down with her after. I’d like her to meet you properly. I think she’d love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened even further, her eyes glimmering with something tender and unspoken. She reached out, her fingers brushing against Rio’s jaw before trailing down to rest lightly on her shoulder. “I trust you,” she said, her voice low but firm. “And I’ll be here when you’re ready to tell me how it went.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a wave of affection so strong it nearly overwhelmed her. She leaned in, brushing a kiss to Agatha’s lips. “Thank you. For trusting me. For everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha cupped her cheek, her voice soft. “You’re worth it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening continued, the weight of the decision settled between them, not as a burden but as a shared commitment. They were in this together, navigating the risks and rewards of their love, one step at a time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sunday came faster than Rio had anticipated, and by the time the day arrived, her nerves were a tangled mess. She spent the morning pacing her apartment, replaying the conversation she was about to have over and over in her mind. Every possible reaction Lilia might have spun through her thoughts in an endless loop. Would she be angry? Disappointed? Hurt that Rio had kept something this big a secret? Or—maybe, hopefully—supportive? The uncertainty was what unsettled her most.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, ever her anchor, had been a calming presence all week. “Lilia loves you,” she had said just the night before, her voice steady as her hands rested firmly on Rio’s shoulders. “She’s been there for you through so much. She’ll understand. And even if it doesn’t go perfectly, we’ll figure it out together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had clung to those words, replaying them in her head like a mantra as she stood in front of Lilia’s house. The small bouquet of wildflowers in her hand felt almost silly now, but she needed something to do with her hands. A deep breath steadied her as she reached up and knocked on the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It didn’t take long for Lilia to answer, her familiar, warm smile easing some of the tension knotting Rio’s chest. “Rio, my sweet girl!” Lilia exclaimed, pulling her into a tight hug that smelled of lavender and fresh-baked bread. “It’s been too long. Come in, come in. I just put the kettle on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let herself be drawn inside, the familiar coziness of Lilia’s home wrapping around her like a favorite blanket. Everything about the place was steeped in warmth—from the worn, overstuffed couch to the soft glow of the lamp in the corner. She placed the bouquet on the kitchen counter, where Lilia immediately fussed over them, finding a vase.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“These are lovely. You didn’t have to, you know,” Lilia said, giving Rio a gentle pat on the cheek.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wanted to,” Rio replied, her voice quieter than usual.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia didn’t seem to notice Rio’s nerves as she moved around the kitchen with practiced ease, chatting about the casserole she had in the oven and the new book she’d started reading. She handed Rio a bowl of salad and directed her to toss it, putting her to work as she always did during these dinners. Usually, this routine soothed Rio, but tonight, her fingers trembled faintly as she picked up the wooden salad spoons.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The aroma of the vegetable casserole baking in the oven filled the room, mingling with the soft clinking of dishes as Lilia set the table. It was a scene Rio had lived countless times, but tonight, it felt different. The air seemed heavier, and the words she needed to say sat like a weight on her chest, refusing to come out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, bring that salad over, would you?” Lilia called from the dining table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, coming,” Rio said, her voice tight as she carried the bowl over and placed it on the table. She lingered for a moment, watching Lilia move about with her usual grace, before taking her seat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dinner started like it always did, with Lilia asking about Rio’s classes, her research, and the band. Rio answered each question, but her responses were clipped, distracted. She couldn’t seem to focus on anything but the conversation she’d come here to have.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How have you been?” Lilia asked, setting a steaming cup in front of her, to go with dinner, something they always did together. “You look…good. Happier, I think.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The observation caught Rio off guard, and she couldn’t help but smile faintly. “I’ve been…good. Busy, but good.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia raised an eyebrow, her keen gaze fixing on Rio as she settled into the chair across from her. “Alright, out with it. I know that look. Something’s on your mind.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, her fingers fidgeting with the handle of the mug in her hands. The warmth of the tea did little to settle the nerves coursing through her. “I… I need to tell you something. And I really hope you’ll understand.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The shift in Rio’s tone softened Lilia’s expression instantly. She leaned forward slightly, resting her elbows on the table, her posture open and inviting. “Of course, Rio,” she said, her voice gentle but firm. “Whatever it is, you can tell me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart raced, her mind scrambling to put her feelings into words. After a deep breath, she finally said, “I’ve been seeing someone. For a while now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s lips curved into a small, knowing smile. “That’s wonderful,” she said warmly, but there was a glimmer of curiosity in her eyes. “Why does it sound like you’re about to confess to a crime?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a nervous laugh, the tension in her shoulders easing just slightly. “Because it’s… complicated.” She paused, gathering her courage. “The person I’m seeing is… Agatha Harkness. My supervisor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung in the air, the weight of them making the room feel a little smaller. Lilia’s smile faltered for a moment, her brow furrowing as she processed the revelation. Her silence stretched just long enough to make Rio’s palms sweat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Lilia repeated slowly, as though testing the name. Her eyes searched Rio’s face, not with judgment but with curiosity and careful thought. “I met her, didn’t I? That night you were…well, less than sober. And I think I saw her once at the coffee shop.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face flushed a deep crimson, and she nodded. “Yeah, that was her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung in the air, heavy with anticipation. Rio braced herself for Lilia’s reaction, her heart thudding in her chest. Lilia’s face remained unreadable for a long, agonizing moment as she leaned back in her chair, her hands resting lightly on the edge of the table. Finally, she exhaled softly, her gaze steady and thoughtful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Lilia began, her voice measured. “I can see why you’d be nervous to tell me. It’s not… the most conventional situation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Rio blurted out, the words rushing out of her like water breaking through a dam. “And we’ve been really careful—professional where it matters. We didn’t plan for this to happen, Lilia. It just… did. And she makes me happy. Really happy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia tilted her head slightly, her expression softening, though her eyes still held a glimmer of caution. “Okay,” she said slowly, her tone calm but probing. “Tell me everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. She had known Lilia wouldn’t jump to conclusions, but still, the calmness in her tone felt like a lifeline.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Rio began, her fingers nervously tracing the edge of her napkin, “it kind of just… happened. We started spending more time together because of my thesis. She was helping me refine my arguments, and we’d have these long discussions about poetry and mortality and everything in between. But then—” Rio paused, searching for the right words. “It became more than that. We connected in ways I didn’t expect. She’s amazing, Lilia. She’s kind, brilliant, and—God, she gets me in ways I didn’t think anyone ever could. She’s been nothing but supportive of me—both as a student and as… more.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia listened intently, her elbows resting on the table as she laced her fingers together. “How long has this been going on?” she asked, her voice calm but laced with curiosity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“A few weeks,” Rio admitted, glancing down at her tea before looking back up at Lilia. “We’ve been taking things slow—really slow—because we both know how delicate this situation is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And are you sure about her? About this?” Lilia’s voice was gentle but carried the weight of her concern. Her eyes searched Rio’s face, looking for any trace of doubt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes.” Rio’s response came without hesitation, her voice steady and resolute. “I know it’s unconventional, and I know people might not understand. But it’s real, Lilia. What we have—it’s not just a fling or a distraction. It’s… it’s serious.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s brow furrowed slightly as she absorbed Rio’s words. “And what about her?” she asked after a moment. “Is she as serious about you as you are about her? Because, Rio, you deserve someone who’s all in. No half-measures.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She is,” Rio said quietly, her voice unwavering. “We’ve talked about it—about what it means to navigate this, about how to make sure we don’t cross any lines professionally. She’s just as cautious as I am, maybe even more. Neither of us wants to do anything that would hurt the other, and we’re both committed to making this work.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia let out a thoughtful hum, her fingers tapping a soft rhythm against the edge of the table. Her gaze was steady, warm but tinged with concern. “Rio,” she began carefully, her voice low and calm, “you know I’ll support you no matter what. But I have to ask—are you safe? Emotionally, I mean. Relationships like this can be… complicated, and I want to make sure you’re not putting yourself in a position where you could get hurt.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question hit Rio harder than she expected, tightening her chest and twisting her stomach. Still, she appreciated it. This was Lilia, after all—steady, caring, and always looking out for her. Rio swallowed hard, taking a moment to gather her thoughts before answering. “I am. I mean, I’ve thought about that a lot. I know there are risks—big ones. And yeah, it’s not easy, but…” She paused, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “With her, it doesn’t feel like a risk. It feels… right. Like it’s where I’m supposed to be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s face softened, her sharp concern giving way to an expression of quiet understanding. She reached across the table, her hand warm and grounding as it closed over Rio’s. “Okay, then,” she said, her tone softer now. “If you’re sure, and if she’s treating you well, then I trust your judgment. Just promise me one thing—if anything changes, if you ever feel uncertain or need to talk, you’ll come to me. No matter what.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The lump that had formed in Rio’s throat threatened to grow larger, and she nodded quickly, her fingers curling instinctively around Lilia’s. “I promise. And Lilia, she does treat me well. Better than I ever thought I deserved. She makes me really happy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Lilia didn’t speak, her gaze searching Rio’s face with the kind of care only someone who truly loves you can muster. Then, a small, knowing smile crept across her lips. “I can see that,” she said lightly. “You’ve been practically glowing these past few weeks.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, her surprise evident. “You noticed?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled softly, leaning back in her chair. “Of course, I noticed. I know you, Rio. You’ve been… lighter, happier. It’s like a weight you’ve been carrying finally lifted.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her chest swelling with relief and affection. But a flicker of doubt crossed her face, and her voice dropped slightly. “You’re not… mad?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia shook her head, her expression reassuring. “No, I’m not mad. Concerned, sure—because I want to make sure you’re not putting yourself in a difficult position, professionally or emotionally. But mad? No.” She leaned forward again, resting her elbows on the table as her tone softened further. “If she makes you happy, and you’re both going into this with your eyes open, who am I to judge? You’re an adult, Rio, and you’ve always been thoughtful about the choices you make.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Relief flooded through Rio, and she let out a long, shaky breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. “Thank you,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “That means so much, Lilia. I was so scared you’d… I don’t know, be disappointed or something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s brow furrowed, and she reached over to give Rio’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “Disappointed? Sweet girl, I could never be disappointed in you. You’ve faced so much in your life and come out of it stronger and more resilient than most people ever could. And now, you’ve found someone who makes you happy. That’s all I’ve ever wanted for you—happiness. And if Agatha is part of that, then I’m happy for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They talked for a while longer, Lilia asking thoughtful questions about how they managed to balance their professional and personal lives. Rio felt lighter, her heart full of gratitude for Lilia’s unwavering support.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, her warmth radiating across the table. “Good. Now, let’s clear these dishes before dessert. I made your favorite.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, the tension easing from her shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">While Lilia had gone to fetch dessert in the kitchen, Rio took out her phone to text Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>I told her. She’s okay with it. More than okay, actually.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s response came almost immediately, as if she’d been waiting for this moment just as anxiously as Rio had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Agatha<em>: </em></strong> <em>I knew she’d understand. I’m so proud of you, darling.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled at the screen, a warm feeling settling in her chest. For the first time in weeks, she felt like everything might just work out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dinner, as Rio carried the dishes to the sink, she could feel Lilia’s watchful gaze on her. It wasn’t the kind of scrutiny that made her uncomfortable—just the thoughtful consideration of someone who cared deeply for her. Once the last plate was set on the counter, Lilia dried her hands and turned back to Rio, a small smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Lilia began, leaning against the kitchen counter with an air of casual contemplation, “if you’re serious about her—and it sounds like you are—it might be a good idea to bring her here. Let me meet her properly.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze, the sponge suspended in her hand as her heart skipped a beat. <em>She wants to meet Agatha?</em> The question lingered in her mind, and she felt her chest tighten in an unexpected rush of nervousness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You want to meet Agatha?” Rio’s voice was quiet, tinged with surprise, as if she hadn’t anticipated this conversation so soon.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smile never wavered. “Of course,” she replied, her tone steady and matter-of-fact, as though it were the most natural request in the world. “I’ve met plenty of your friends before, even some of your girlfriends. Why would this be any different? Besides, if she’s important to you, I’d like to know her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, biting her lip. “It’s just…complicated, you know? With her being my supervisor and all. We’ve been keeping it quiet, and bringing her here feels like…a big step.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, her expression understanding but firm. “I get that, Rio. You don’t want to rush anything. But, sweetheart, you can’t keep sneaking around forever. If you trust me enough to tell me about her, maybe it’s time to take another step. It might help you feel a little less like you’re carrying a secret around all the time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio considered this, her fingers drumming against the countertop. Lilia had a point. The secrecy—while necessary—had been weighing on her. The idea of Agatha meeting someone from her life, someone who had been there for her through everything, felt both terrifying and thrilling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Rio said finally, her voice soft but resolute. “I’ll talk to her about it. Maybe next Sunday?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smile widened, and she pulled Rio into a quick hug. “Good. I promise I’ll be on my best behavior. No interrogation, just a nice dinner.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed despite her nerves, leaning into the embrace. “Thanks, Lilia. That means a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they finished tidying up, Rio felt a cautious sense of excitement settle over her. The idea of bringing Agatha into this part of her life was daunting, but it also felt like a step forward—a chance to deepen what they already had. </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t suppress the grin tugging at her lips as she sat across from Agatha in her office the next afternoon. The sunlight streaming through the window highlighted Agatha’s features—her furrowed brow, her lips pursed in that way they always did when she was deep in thought. Except this time, the cause of her concern wasn’t a dense stack of essays but something far more personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, as you know, I talked to Lilia last night,” Rio began, her voice steady but teasing at the edges.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced up from the notes in front of her, already sensing where this was going. “And?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand. “She invited you to dinner. Next Sunday.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s pen froze mid-scribble, and she blinked, her usually composed demeanor momentarily faltering. “Dinner?” Her voice was almost incredulous, and Rio couldn’t help but revel in the sight of Agatha’s cool, controlled exterior slipping just a little.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, dinner.” Rio’s grin widened, clearly enjoying the rare crack in Agatha’s composure. “You know, food, conversation, the usual. Don’t tell me you’re afraid of Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled, leaning back in her chair. “It’s not fear, exactly. More…anticipation. Lilia strikes me as someone who knows exactly how to ask the right questions. And now that I—well, we—are involved, I’m certain those questions will take on a new dimension.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, finding Agatha’s rare display of vulnerability utterly endearing. “You’re not wrong. She’s definitely going to ask questions, even if she said she wouldn’t. But she also wants to meet you because she knows how important you are to me. That’s what matters to her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened at Rio’s words, though the tension in her shoulders didn’t entirely dissipate. “Still, it’s different now. Last time I saw her, I was just…dropping off her very drunk foster daughter. Now, I’m the one who—” She paused, searching for the right words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow, her grin widening. “The one who what?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair. “The one who’s in a relationship with said daughter.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The way Agatha said it—so serious, as though she was confessing a great crime—made Rio laugh outright. “You’re adorable when you panic, you know that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shot her a mock-glare, but the corners of her mouth twitched upward despite herself. “I’m glad you find this amusing. I, on the other hand, am contemplating how to survive Sunday without embarrassing myself or saying something regrettable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Reaching across the desk, Rio rested her hand on Agatha’s. “You’ll be fine. Just be yourself. Lilia’s not out to get you, I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked down at their joined hands, then back at Rio, her tension easing slightly. “If you say so. But if she starts grilling me, I’m blaming you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, giving Agatha’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “Deal. And for the record, I think she’ll love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a moment of quiet between them, the weight of the conversation lingering in the air. Agatha didn’t reply immediately, her gaze drifting down to where their hands were still intertwined. Rio watched as a faint blush crept up the side of Agatha’s neck, a subtle but telling sign that she was feeling something more than the calm façade she usually wore. Rio’s heart skipped a beat as she realized how much this meant to Agatha, how much she cared about what Lilia thought of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand a little tighter, her pulse quickening as the emotions swirling between them felt almost tangible. She had seen Agatha in so many different lights—strong, confident, sometimes distant—but there was something about this moment, this glimpse of vulnerability, that made Rio feel even more deeply for her. The way Agatha was grappling with her emotions, trying to balance her calm demeanor with the nervousness she so rarely showed, made Rio fall just a little bit harder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The nervous anticipation lingered between them, but beneath it was a shared warmth, a connection that only grew stronger with each stolen moment and each shared secret.</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the week went on, Agatha found herself caught in an ebb and flow of nerves. She could face an auditorium filled with brilliant minds, defend her research under the scrutiny of her peers, and dismantle an ill-formed argument with ease. But somehow, the idea of sitting across the dinner table from Lilia felt like standing before a firing squad.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It started small—little bursts of self-consciousness that flickered into existence and were swiftly extinguished by Rio’s calm reassurances.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On Thursday evening, as they sat curled up on Rio’s couch with mugs of tea while Nicky was over at a friend’s house again – for his greater pleasure-, Agatha sighed audibly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What?” Rio asked, not even glancing up from her book.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m just imagining all the ways this could go horribly wrong.” Agatha’s tone was half-serious, but her fingers toyed anxiously with the edge of her sleeve.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, finally setting her book aside. “You know, you could try imagining all the ways it could go right instead. Revolutionary idea, I know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shot her a look, but there was no real bite in it. “I mean it. What if I say the wrong thing? What if she doesn’t like me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, shifting to sit closer. “Agatha, Lilia is the coolest person I know. And she’s already halfway sold on you just because I am. You’d have to work really hard to make her not like you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s not exactly comforting,” Agatha muttered, though a faint smile tugged at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in, her hand slipping into Agatha’s. “You don’t have to be perfect, you know. Just be you. That’s all Lilia needs to see. Besides, if she really wanted to intimidate you, she’d have invited us over for a full dinner party with her book club.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, horrified. “Does she have a book club?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned mischievously. “She used to. Don’t worry, it’s defunct now. Or maybe she’s just waiting to ambush you with it later.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha groaned, but the sound melted into laughter as Rio kissed her cheek. “You’re insufferable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And you love it,” Rio teased.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Each time Agatha’s self-doubt surfaced that week, Rio met it with the same unwavering confidence, reminding her of what truly mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night before the dinner, Agatha was pacing in her living room while Rio lounged on the sofa, after dropping Nicky off after dance class, watching her with amused eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What are you even worried about now?” Rio asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stopped mid-step, gesturing vaguely. “I don’t know. Everything? What if I’m overdressed? Or underdressed? What if she thinks I am too old for you? What if I—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio cut her off with a laugh, standing to grab Agatha’s hands. “Okay, stop. First of all, it’s just dinner. Second of all, you’re overthinking it.” She rose on her toes to press a quick kiss to Agatha’s forehead. “You’re going to be fine. Trust me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed but allowed herself to relax into Rio’s embrace. “You’re very sure of that, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I am.” Rio’s voice was warm, steady. “Because I know you, and I know Lilia. And I promise, there’s nothing to worry about.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Despite herself, Agatha smiled, resting her forehead against Rio’s. “You’re annoyingly good at this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s a gift,” Rio said with a wink.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as Agatha held onto that quiet moment, she found herself believing, if only a little, that Rio might be right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha arrived at Lilia’s house for dinner, she felt composed outwardly, but internally, her nerves were coiled tight. It wasn’t just that this was the first time she was meeting someone so important to Rio; it was also that she already <em>knew</em>Lilia in a way Rio didn’t fully realize. The memory of that night—Rio drunk and leaning on her shoulder, Lilia’s firm but kind demeanor as she welcomed Rio home—was vivid in Agatha’s mind. But the circumstances now were entirely different. Tonight, Agatha wasn’t just an observer; she was Rio’s… well, <em>something.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She adjusted the strap of her bag as she walked up the porch steps, pausing briefly to take a deep breath. The house had a charm to it, with a modest garden out front and a warm glow spilling out from the windows. It felt like a place that was lived in, loved. When the door opened, Rio greeted her with a smile that instantly made some of Agatha’s tension fade.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You made it,” Rio said, her voice soft but warm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Agatha replied, returning the smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped aside to let her in, closing the door behind them. As Agatha removed her coat, she took in the space. The living room was cozy, with bookshelves lining the walls, an eclectic mix of artwork, and a couch that looked well-used but inviting. There was a faint scent of lavender in the air, likely from the small diffuser humming quietly on a side table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia’s just finishing up in the kitchen,” Rio said, her voice carrying a mixture of affection and nervousness. “She’ll be out in a second.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, setting her coat aside and taking the glass of wine Rio handed her. She could hear faint clattering from the kitchen and the rhythmic sound of a knife on a cutting board.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s cool,” Rio added, almost as if to reassure herself as much as Agatha. “You’ll like her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sure I will,” Agatha said, though she wasn’t entirely sure her own nerves would let her relax enough to enjoy the evening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A moment later, Lilia appeared in the doorway, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. Her presence filled the room immediately, not in an overwhelming way, but with a quiet confidence that demanded attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Lilia said, her tone warm but measured. “It’s nice to see you again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words carried a slight edge, a hint of acknowledgment that this wasn’t their first meeting, though Lilia didn’t elaborate. Agatha inclined her head politely, keeping her voice steady.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And you,” she replied. “Thank you for having me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, her sharp eyes taking her in for a moment before softening slightly as she turned to Rio. “Dinner’s just about ready. Why don’t you help me bring it out?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio agreed easily, leaving Agatha with a glass of wine and a moment to herself. She sat on the couch, her back straight and her hands carefully steady on the glass, but her mind raced.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Lilia returned - minus Rio-, her demeanor shifted slightly. She took the chair opposite Agatha, her body language relaxed but her gaze sharp and unwavering. The weight of her attention was palpable, but not hostile. Agatha felt like she was being assessed, and she had no intention of failing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Lilia began, her voice measured, “I want you to know I’m glad Rio has someone who makes her happy. She deserves that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her hands carefully steady around the stem of her glass. “I care about Rio a great deal,” she replied sincerely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can see that,” Lilia said, leaning forward slightly. “But I also need you to understand something. Rio is the most important person in my life. She’s been through more than most people ever will, and she’s stronger than anyone I’ve ever met. But that doesn’t mean she hasn’t been hurt before.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The directness of Lilia’s words was sharp, though not unkind. Agatha met her gaze steadily, feeling the weight of what was being asked of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I would never hurt Rio,” Agatha said softly but firmly. “She means… more to me than I think I can put into words.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia studied her for a moment longer, her eyes narrowing slightly as if to gauge the authenticity behind the statement. Then she sat back, nodding slowly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good,” she said, her tone softening just slightly. “Because if you do, I won’t hesitate to step in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha managed a small smile, understanding and even respecting the protective nature of Lilia’s words. “I wouldn’t expect anything less.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled at that, though it was faint. “You’re a smart woman, Agatha. And you seem to care about Rio deeply. I just needed to hear it directly from you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You have my word,” Agatha said earnestly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tension in the room seemed to ease slightly, though Lilia’s sharp watchfulness didn’t disappear entirely. She rose, gesturing toward the dining room. “Well then, let’s eat. You can help me keep Rio from making a mess of the salad.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled lightly, rising to follow. As they entered the dining room, Rio glanced between them, her brows furrowing slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Everything okay?” she asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia placed a reassuring hand on Rio’s shoulder. “Everything’s fine. Just a little conversation, that’s all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot Agatha a questioning look, but Agatha simply smiled, letting the warmth of Rio’s presence dissolve the lingering tension from the earlier talk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a warning wrapped in love, and Agatha took it to heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dinner was an inviting spread of roasted vegetables, a hearty stew, and freshly baked bread that Lilia had pulled out of the oven moments before they sat down. The table was set simply but thoughtfully, with mismatched plates and a pitcher of water alongside the bottle of wine Rio had brought. Agatha took her seat across from Lilia, with Rio to her right, and felt a surprising sense of comfort settle over her despite the underlying formality of the occasion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, Agatha,” Lilia began as she ladled stew into everyone’s bowls. Her tone was conversational, but Agatha didn’t miss the subtle probing quality. “Rio tells me you’re a professor. What do you teach?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“English literature,” Agatha replied, her voice steady as she accepted her bowl with a nod of thanks. “Mostly modernist poetry and fiction, though I’ve dabbled in other periods. And I also supervise graduate students.” She glanced at Rio briefly, who gave her an encouraging smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia snorted at her last sentence. “Yeah, that I know.” She said, clearly amused by the situation. She took a sip of her wine. “Sounds like a busy life. How do you balance it all?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, not because she didn’t have an answer, but because the question reminded her of the delicate balancing act her life had become since she’d started seeing Rio. “It can be challenging,” she admitted. “But I’ve found that carving out time for what matters most is… rewarding.” Her gaze flicked to Rio again, just for a moment, but the look wasn’t lost on Lilia, who arched an eyebrow ever so slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And your son,” Lilia continued, her tone softening as she shifted gears. “Rio mentioned you have a little boy, Nicky, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, Nicky,” Agatha said, smiling at the thought of him. “He’s six. A bundle of energy and curiosity. He keeps me on my toes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled. “Sounds like a handful. But it’s nice to hear you speak about him with such warmth.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, feeling a swell of affection as she thought about her son. “He’s the best part of my life,” she said simply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The conversation flowed easily from there, touching on Nicky’s interests—how he loved dance and had been enjoying the classes Rio taught—to Agatha’s work on a recent paper that she was to present at a conference soon. Lilia listened intently, occasionally offering her own insights or questions that showed she was genuinely engaged.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eventually, the topic shifted to Agatha and Rio’s relationship. Lilia approached it gently but directly, her eyes warm but searching.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So,” Lilia began, setting her fork down and folding her hands on the table. “How did this start between you two? And more importantly, how’s it going?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stiffened slightly, but Agatha reached for her hand under the table, squeezing it gently before responding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It started… slowly,” Agatha said, choosing her words carefully. “We’ve always had a professional connection, of course, but it grew into something more over time. It wasn’t planned, but it feels… right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s gaze lingered on them both for a moment before she smiled faintly. “That’s good to hear. I’m glad you’re both happy. That’s the most important thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio relaxed visibly at that, and Agatha felt some of her own tension dissolve as well.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, enough,” Rio said, laughing nervously. “This is starting to feel like an interrogation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled, raising her glass. “Fair enough. Let’s toast to new beginnings, then.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They clinked glasses and took a sip, reveling in the now quiet atmosphere of the night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the dinner wound down and plates were cleared, Lilia leaned back in her chair, her gaze warm but serious as she looked between Rio and Agatha. “Alright,” she said, folding her hands on the table, “I’ve said my piece. You’re both adults, and what you choose to do is your business. As long as Rio is happy, feels safe, and knows she’s loved, that’s what matters most to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding, her shoulders relaxing visibly. “Thanks, Lilia,” she said softly, her voice tinged with gratitude.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her voice steady. “I appreciate that. And I assure you, Rio’s happiness and well-being are always my priority.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia studied her for a moment, then nodded. “Good. I can see that you care about her. Just… keep it that way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tension in the room dissolved almost entirely after that, replaced by a comfortable ease as they shared dessert and talked about lighter topics. Agatha told a funny story about Nicky’s latest antics in school, and Lilia recounted some on teenage Rio’s antics that had Agatha laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes and Rio blush three shades darker.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they were saying their goodbyes at the door, Lilia pulled Rio into a tight hug. “You know I just want what’s best for you, right?” she murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Rio said, hugging her back. “And I am happy, Lilia. Really.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia let her go, turning to Agatha with a look that was almost maternal. “Take care of her,” she said simply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will,” Agatha replied, her voice filled with quiet determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they stepped outside into the cool evening air, Rio slipped her hand into Agatha’s, glancing up at her with a soft smile. “Well, that went better than I expected.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, squeezing her hand. “Your Lilia is something else.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She is,” Rio agreed, leaning into her as they walked. “And now she’s on our side.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a sense of relief and gratitude wash over her. Whatever challenges they might face, they were stepping forward together, and that, she thought, was more than enough.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <em>The chill ascends from feet to knees,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The fever sings in mental wires.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If to be warmed, then I must freeze</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And quake in frigid purgatorial fires</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Of which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>      (T. S. Eliot. "East Coker". <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">A week after dinner at Lilia’s Rio woke up with a headache pounding at her temples, her throat scratchy and dry. She groggily rolled over in bed, feeling the heat radiating off her skin, a sure sign that she was coming down with something. She groaned, pushing herself up, the dizziness almost making her fall back onto the bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her body ached in places she hadn’t noticed before, and her stomach twisted uncomfortably. But despite it all, she didn’t want to admit it. She could barely recall the last time she’d taken a sick day, and with the research she had to catch up on and the thesis looming over her, she wasn’t about to let a cold get in her way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Just get through today,” she muttered to herself as she dragged herself into the bathroom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The hot water from the shower helped a little, but it wasn’t enough to shake the exhaustion weighing down on her limbs. As she dressed in the quickest outfit she could find—jeans, a cozy sweater, and sneakers—her head swirled, but she pressed on, determined to go to class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The thought of Agatha’s gaze, the way she always seemed to notice when Rio was even the slightest bit off, was enough to push her forward and try to make herself presentable. She didn’t want to look weak. She didn’t want to disappoint anyone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She forced herself to eat something, though the food tasted bland and unappealing, and she made her way to campus, trying not to let the nausea or the dizziness show.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she entered the lecture hall, she immediately spotted Agatha. She already standing at the front of the class, flipping through her notes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes flickered over Rio as she entered, a slight frown pulling at her lips. Rio caught it, her heart sinking. She must look awful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal, are you alright?” Agatha’s voice, laced with concern, reached her ears, and Rio forced a smile, hoping it would come across as convincing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, I’m fine,” Rio lied. “Just didn’t sleep well last night.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t look convinced, but she didn’t push, and Rio was grateful for it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a seat in the back, trying to focus on the lecture, but her thoughts kept drifting, her head growing heavier as the minutes passed. She could barely keep her eyes open. But she couldn’t leave now—not with the work she had to do, not when Agatha was watching.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She leaned forward, arms crossed on the desk, trying to fight the wave of dizziness, the pounding headache that seemed to worsen with each passing second.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the class continued, Agatha’s gaze kept drifting toward Rio, who seemed to be struggling. Rio had her arms folded over the desk, her head resting against them, and her eyes were half-lidded. Agatha could see the signs—she was pale, flushed with fever, and her movements were slower than usual. A pang of concern shot through her chest. She knew Rio well enough by now to tell when something was off, and today it was glaringly obvious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Agatha kept her focus on the lecture, fighting the urge to rush to her. She couldn’t—if she did, it would raise questions. Questions they weren’t ready to answer. It was a tightrope walk, balancing the need to care for Rio with the very real need to keep their relationship a secret. It was complicated, and in moments like this, it felt almost suffocating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tried to continue with the lesson, but her thoughts kept wandering back to Rio, watching her in the back of the room, hunched over, eyes barely open. Agatha clenched her jaw. <em>She’s so stubborn,</em> she thought, irritated with both Rio and herself. But at the same time, she understood. Rio was always pushing herself, always giving more than she had, even when she shouldn’t.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the lecture ended, Agatha waited for all the students to exit the classroom to close the door, before making her way to Rio, still resting her head on her hand, half-asleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha reached her, she gently touched her arm, feeling the warmth of her skin. Rio didn’t look up at first, too caught up in trying to keep herself together, but Agatha’s voice was soft, tender.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, darling,” Agatha’s voice was soft but firm, and it immediately caught Rio’s attention. The moment their eyes met, Agatha could see the exhaustion in Rio’s gaze. She was barely holding it together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re not okay,” Agatha said, her voice dropping a notch in intensity. “You look like you’re going to pass out. I’m telling you—go home. Now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio managed to straighten up, though it was clear she wasn’t feeling well. She gave Agatha a weak smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine, really,” Rio said, but her voice was thin, and the words didn’t sound convincing even to her own ears. “It’s just a cold, Agatha. I’ll be fine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t buy it. She could see Rio was barely standing, and the last thing she needed was for Rio to push herself more than she already had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let me,” Agatha murmured. She carefully brushed a strand of hair away from Rio’s face and, without thinking, leaned forward to place a kiss on Rio’s forehead. The warmth of Rio’s skin hit Agatha immediately, and her concern sharpened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She lingered for a moment, just a brief second, to check her temperature. Rio’s skin was warm, definitely not a normal warmth—it had a feverish edge to it. Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she pulled back slightly, her hand resting on Rio’s arm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, you’re burning up,” Agatha said, her voice tinged with concern. She could feel her own pulse quicken. “You need to go home and rest. No arguments.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked up at her then, eyes soft but still trying to hide her discomfort. She gave a small smile, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I told you, it’s nothing,” Rio whispered, but the words were weak, fragile. She was clearly too exhausted to argue anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, Rio,” Agatha said, her tone unwavering. “I’m not asking. You’re going home. You’re not going to help anyone by staying here and making yourself worse. Please.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened her mouth to argue again, but Agatha wasn’t having it. She reached out gently to take Rio’s arm, just enough to convey how serious she was. The contact was warm, a small, comforting touch, but it was also firm, meant to reassure Rio that she was not alone in this moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s expression softened, and for a moment, she let herself relax into the touch. “I’ll rest. I’ll be fine,” she whispered, looking down, clearly not entirely convinced of her own words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at her, and for a moment, all the professional distance they had carefully maintained over the weeks felt irrelevant. She reached out once more, gently brushing her fingers across Rio’s cheek.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave her a small, understanding nod. “I’ll come by later. Just—take care of yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio met her gaze, the exhaustion in her eyes mixing with something softer, something unspoken. For a moment, neither of them said anything. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Rio nodded, taking a deep breath, the weight of her illness still lingering in the air between them. She picked up her bag slowly, but before she could leave, Agatha gave her one last, lingering look—a mixture of worry and tenderness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t push yourself,” Agatha added quietly. “I mean it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, Rio finally left the classroom, walking down the hall with her usual grace, though her steps were slower than usual. Agatha watched her go, feeling that familiar tightness in her chest, knowing she’d see her later, but still wanting to do more for her now. She wanted to take care of Rio. To keep her safe. To make sure she was okay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But for now, all she could do was trust that Rio would get the rest she needed, and wait for the moment she could be with her again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a long day of class and work, and before heading over to Rio’s, Agatha’s mind was racing with concern. She couldn’t stand the idea of Rio being sick and alone, especially when she was clearly pushing herself far too much. But there was no way she was just going to show up empty-handed. Rio deserved more than that. She deserved comfort, care—everything Agatha could give her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took out her phone and dialed the number of the babysitter. Nicky was at his usual afternoon activity, but Agatha didn’t want to leave him without someone to watch over him in case things went sideways later.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The phone rang a few times before it was picked up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi, it’s Agatha. I know it’s short notice, but could you stay a bit longer tonight with Nicky?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The babysitter, a kind woman who had been with the family for years, replied without hesitation. “Of course! Don’t worry about a thing, Agatha. We’re all good here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Relieved, Agatha ended the call quickly and then turned her attention to Rio. She had a feeling that Rio would need more than just a couple of blankets and soup to make her feel better. She wanted to bring something that would show Rio how much she cared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her first stop was a pharmacy. She picked up some fever-reducing medication, tissues, and a bottle of ginger tea—she knew that would help soothe Rio’s sore throat. After a moment’s hesitation, Agatha also grabbed a small scented candle; Rio loved candles, and Agatha knew that even a simple gesture like that would bring comfort to her. She could almost imagine Rio’s soft smile as she lit it, the flickering flame dancing in the quiet room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha then made her way to the grocery store. She didn’t need anything extravagant—just a few essentials. She picked up some fresh soup, crackers, and fruit—things that were easy to eat when someone wasn’t feeling well.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she stood in the aisle, Agatha found herself glancing at the packages of cinnamon cookies, the ones she knew Rio liked. It was a small thing, but Agatha added them to the cart anyway, certain it would make Rio smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With everything in hand, Agatha finally headed over to Rio’s apartment. Her heart raced, not just from the anticipation of being with Rio, but from the desire to make things right—make Rio feel cared for, special, and loved. She hadn’t told her how she felt just yet, but she wanted to show it in every way she could, starting with this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she finally reached Rio’s door, she took a deep breath. This was more than just bringing supplies. It was about showing Rio that she wasn’t alone, that Agatha would be there for her, no matter what, showing her that she <em>mattered</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gently unlocked the door with the spare key Rio had given her after that dinner at Lilia’s, feeling the weight of it in her hand. She still remembered the warmth of that evening, the quiet but strong sense of connection that had only deepened since then. She entered as quietly as she could, not wanting to disturb Rio, but knowing she needed to be there now more than ever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The apartment was just as she remembered—cozy, filled with plants that seemed to breathe life into the space, and the soft glow of ambient lighting that gave it a sense of peace. But it was too quiet. Agatha’s eyes swept the room, and it didn’t take long for her to spot Rio on the couch, curled up under a blanket, her breathing slow and steady.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She was fast asleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached at the sight—Rio looked so small in that moment, so fragile, but still so beautiful. She couldn’t help but approach cautiously, her heart filled with both tenderness and concern. She set the bags of supplies down on the nearby table and knelt beside Rio, brushing a strand of hair from her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t stir. Her skin was warm, too warm—feverish. Agatha sighed softly as she carefully reached for her forehead, feeling the heat radiating off of her. It only confirmed her worries. Rio had pushed herself too hard, and now she was paying the price.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat beside her, watching Rio sleep for a moment longer, noticing the subtle rise and fall of her chest, the way her face was relaxed in sleep, but her brow furrowed with discomfort. It was almost as if Rio was trying to escape the weight of whatever she was feeling, but Agatha knew it was impossible to outrun the body’s limits.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a slow, steady breath. Rio needed her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Carefully, Agatha helped her sit up just a bit, placing a pillow behind her back to support her and prevent her from waking too suddenly. She hadn’t meant to intrude on Rio’s peaceful rest, but it was clear Rio needed someone to look after her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She grabbed the ginger tea she had brought with her, heated it up, and settled down beside Rio once more. The warmth of the cup seemed to mirror the warmth in Agatha’s heart as she gently placed it on the table beside them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m here,” Agatha whispered softly, her voice a quiet promise. She didn’t expect Rio to hear, but she needed to say it anyway.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stayed like that for a while, watching over Rio, making sure she was comfortable. Agatha’s mind raced, and her thoughts kept returning to the same question—why had she waited so long to tell Rio how she felt? But for now, she could only do what she could, which was be there, in this moment, to make sure Rio wasn’t alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the hours passed, Agatha eventually felt herself drifting off as well. She didn’t want to sleep, didn’t want to miss a single moment with Rio, but as the evening stretched on, exhaustion began to tug at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, she stayed awake, her hand resting lightly on Rio’s, feeling the steady warmth of her skin. The quiet of the room was soothing, and Agatha felt a deep peace settle over her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wasn’t sure what the future would hold, or how they could possibly navigate the complex layers of their relationship—between their professional roles, their personal lives, and everything else that stood in the way. But at that moment, none of it seemed to matter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">What mattered was this: Rio was here. Rio was safe. And Agatha was going to make sure it stayed that way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio slowly stirred, the sensation of warmth and gentle care surrounding her. Her head felt heavy, and her throat was scratchy, but as she blinked her eyes open, she was greeted with the soft glow of dim light and the faint smell of ginger tea. She groaned softly, her mind still foggy with the remnants of fever and sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tried to sit up, but the effort only made her head spin, causing her to wince. She closed her eyes again, letting the world around her settle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Easy,” a familiar voice said softly, and Rio opened her eyes to find Agatha leaning over her, her expression a mix of concern and gentle affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You came,” Rio whispered, a small smile gracing her tired features.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course I came,” Agatha smiled, brushing a lock of hair from Rio’s face. “You’ve been asleep for a while. I didn’t want to wake you, but you’re not exactly getting better just resting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tried to focus, but her vision swayed, her body feeling heavier than usual. “I didn’t… mean to make you worry,” she mumbled, her voice thick from the fever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t need to worry about that.” Agatha’s voice was soothing, calm. “I’m here to take care of you. Just relax.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded weakly, leaning into Agatha’s touch as the older woman gently helped her adjust back against the cushions, propping her up with a pillow. Agatha moved with practiced ease, making sure she was comfortable, always mindful of how fragile Rio seemed at that moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re burning up, Rio,” Agatha said softly, her hand brushing over Rio’s forehead once more. “I brought you some tea, but I’m not sure that’s going to do much right now. So I also got you some medicine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, but the effort made her dizzy again. She sighed, feeling a deep ache in her body that was impossible to ignore. “I’m sorry,” she repeated. “I didn’t want to worry you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You didn’t,” Agatha assured her, a little too quickly, her voice soft but firm. “But you need to take care of yourself. I’ve got everything here, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio managed a weak smile, her eyes heavy with exhaustion. She didn’t have the strength to argue, and she didn’t want to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha helped her swallow the medicine and sip the tea, guiding the cup to her lips and holding it steady, offering small sips between words of encouragement. “There, that’s it. You’re doing great.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Rio felt far from great. She felt dizzy, her body aching in ways she couldn’t explain. Every movement felt too much, too overwhelming. Despite the warmth of Agatha’s presence, Rio couldn’t help but feel like she was slipping into some other place, some other version of herself she couldn’t quite control.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening wore on, Agatha never left her side. She moved around the apartment with quiet care, bringing Rio some soup, adjusting the blankets, and always checking her temperature. The fever wasn’t breaking, and Agatha refused to leave her, sitting by her side as Rio dozed fitfully, offering her soft words of reassurance when she woke up between moments of sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Just rest,” Agatha said gently, brushing her thumb over Rio’s hand. “You don’t have to do anything right now. You’re safe. Just rest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s thoughts were a jumble of fog and warmth. Her body ached, but there was something comforting about Agatha’s presence, the steady rhythm of her voice, and the tenderness in the way she cared for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eventually, Rio’s breathing slowed, and she felt herself drifting in and out of sleep, lulled by Agatha’s constant presence. Each time she stirred, Agatha was there—helping her back into a more comfortable position, bringing her a glass of water, or just holding her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the night wore on, the fever still clung to Rio, but she could feel a certain sense of calm washing over her. Agatha was here, and she would be okay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Rio whispered, her voice weak but filled with quiet gratitude. “Thank you… for being here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, her heart heavy with emotion. She brushed a strand of hair from Rio’s face and kissed her forehead softly, her lips lingering there for a moment longer than necessary. “You don’t have to thank me,” she replied quietly. “I’m here because I want to be. You’re important to me, Rio. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio closed her eyes, the warmth of Agatha’s words and touch more comforting than anything she could have imagined. She let herself drift off into sleep again, this time with a peacefulness that hadn’t been there before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Agatha, ever watchful, stayed by her side, the night stretching on as she kept vigil over Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sat by Rio’s side, her heart tight with worry as she watched the younger woman drift in and out of consciousness. Rio’s fever had been high when she arrived, and though Agatha had done her best to keep her comfortable, the fever wasn’t going down yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio slept, her breathing shallow and quick, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of protectiveness toward her. She had always been there for Nicky, of course, but with Rio, this was different, A different kind of love, even if none of them had put the word on it before. There was a tenderness, a deep emotional pull that Agatha couldn’t deny, even if she tried to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sat with her, watching over her as the fever made Rio restless. Agatha adjusted the blanket around her shoulders, brushing the damp hair from Rio’s forehead. She had to admit, she wasn’t entirely sure what was going on in Rio’s head, but she could feel the weight of her dreams  lingering behind those exhausted eyes. There were things Rio didn’t talk about, things Agatha suspected, but she didn’t want to push her. Rio had only recently begun to open up to her, and Agatha respected that, even though it hurt to see how guarded Rio was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moments between them—those quiet, stolen moments when they were together, when the world outside seemed to vanish—felt like a lifeline to Agatha. But this… this was different. Rio needed comfort, more than just physical care, and Agatha could feel that there was something deeper buried within her, something that this feverish state had brought to the surface.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned forward slightly, feeling the warmth radiating from Rio’s skin as her hand brushed against her forehead. Rio’s temperature was still high, but the heat beneath her skin was a stark contrast to the coolness in Agatha’s chest, a place where worry had settled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio drifted deeper into sleep, Agatha noticed a subtle shift in the way her body tensed, as if she was fighting something, or someone. Her breath hitched, and Agatha could see the flickers of unease in her face, the strain of whatever was happening inside her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, Rio’s breathing changed. Her body stiffened, and a whimper escaped her lips. Agatha sat back, concern tightening in her chest as she listened to the shift in the rhythm of Rio’s breaths, the way she seemed to be caught between worlds—trapped in the nightmare her fever had pulled her into.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached out instinctively, her hand brushing against Rio’s arm. But Rio didn’t respond, lost in whatever darkness had overtaken her mind. Agatha could see it in Rio’s face—the way her eyes were fluttering behind closed lids, her body trembling ever so slightly as she seemed to relive something painful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha whispered softly, but it was clear the younger woman wasn’t hearing her. She was lost in her own world, her fevered state playing tricks on her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s shaking form finally relaxed in Agatha’s arms. She could feel the tension slipping away, if only for a moment, as Agatha whispered reassurances that only they could hear. And though the nightmare hadn’t completely gone away, Agatha knew that, for this moment, Rio had found some semblance of peace. Agatha’s hand stayed gently on her back, rubbing soothing circles as Rio’s breathing deepened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio finally stirred awake, the hazy remnants of the dream still clinging to her mind, Agatha was there—real, solid, warm. Rio’s eyes fluttered open, and she blinked up at Agatha, confusion clouding her gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey,” Agatha said softly, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s forehead. “You’re okay. You’re with me. You’re safe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hand reached out instinctively, finding Agatha’s, and Agatha squeezed it gently. She knew there was more to Rio’s story—so much more—but for now, all she could do was be there, a steady presence in a world that had been anything but for Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening wore on, Agatha stayed close by, keeping an eye on Rio, watching as the fever slowly took its toll on her. She was calm, reassuring Rio with every small gesture, even though she couldn’t stop the worry from lingering in her chest. Rio had been through so much already, and now this—whatever it was, it felt like a silent reminder that Rio needed care, needed safety, needed someone to lean on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, after what seemed like hours of gently coaxing her to drink water, and keeping a cool cloth on her forehead, Agatha finally saw a change. Rio’s skin, which had been flushed and burning, began to cool. Her breathing steadied, the shallow, fevered breaths easing into something calmer. Agatha could feel the tension in Rio’s body start to melt away as the medicine finally began to take effect.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio?” Agatha murmured, her hand still resting on Rio’s. “How are you feeling?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyelids fluttered, and for a moment, Agatha thought she might have drifted back to sleep. But then Rio stirred slightly, her hand moving to rest against her forehead, her face furrowing for a brief second before she let out a soft sigh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I… I feel a little better,” Rio mumbled, her voice scratchy but more lucid than before. “The fever… it’s not as bad.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, relief washing over her. She gently stroked Rio’s hair, brushing it away from her damp forehead. “Good,” she said. “Just try to relax for now. The worst of it is over.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze fluttered up to meet Agatha’s, her tired eyes still holding a flicker of that vulnerability that Agatha had seen in the dream—a reminder of the walls Rio had built around herself. But in that moment, with the fever finally breaking, Rio’s defenses seemed to soften just a little, like the fog that had clouded her mind was starting to clear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you for being here,” Rio whispered, her voice still shaky but full of gratitude. “You didn’t have to… you don’t have to do all of this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled as she looked down at Rio, her hand gently brushing over her cheek. “I want to. You don’t have to thank me for taking care of you. You mean more to me than that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, a moment of vulnerability flashing across her face before she gave a small, tired smile. “You make it seem easy,” she said softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, brushing her lips against Rio’s forehead, her touch lingering just a little longer than usual. “Because it is easy. You deserve this, Rio. You deserve to be cared for. And I’m happy to be the one to do it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes softened as she closed them, leaning into Agatha’s touch. The fever had finally broken, but the exhaustion from the past few days remained, leaving Rio with a quiet stillness that Agatha didn’t want to disturb.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They sat in silence for a while, the only sound the soft rhythm of Rio’s breathing, and Agatha couldn’t help but feel a sense of peace settle over her. Rio, though still fragile, seemed a little more grounded, a little more herself. The storm of the fever had passed, but the emotional weight that had lingered within Rio for so long remained.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stayed by her side, allowing her to rest, but knowing this was only a small part of the journey Rio still had to make. She had witnessed the ghosts of Rio’s past in that fevered dream—those moments of fear, of abandonment—and Agatha knew that they would have to be confronted, but not today. Today, she would let Rio heal, one step at a time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening passed quietly, and as the hours wore on, Rio’s fever continued to subside. Her breathing became more even, her temperature gradually returning to normal, and Agatha felt the relief in every soft exhale. She’d been scared for a moment, but now, with Rio’s fever broken and the worst of it behind them, Agatha allowed herself to relax just a little.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stayed with Rio until she was sure the fever was fully gone, offering her soft words of comfort and reassurance. And as Rio drifted off into a peaceful, fever-free sleep, Agatha remained at her side, a steady presence in the quiet of the night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few hours of staying by Rio’s side, watching over her as she slept peacefully, she felt a deep sense of relief wash over her. The fever had broken, and Rio was no longer burning with the same feverish intensity. Her breathing had steadied, and though she remained asleep, her face had softened in the tranquility of rest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a slow breath, feeling the weight of the evening lifting from her shoulders. She knew Rio was out of danger now, that the worst of it had passed. The moment she was sure Rio would be okay, Agatha made the decision to leave. She couldn’t stay forever—not when Nicky was waiting for her at home. She wanted to make sure she was there for him, too, as he might need her just as much, even though tonight was one of those rare times when everything had to be put on hold for Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced at Rio once more, gently brushing a stray lock of hair from her face. She stood slowly, smoothing down her clothes and checking to make sure everything was in place. She walked to the door quietly, turning to look back at Rio one last time before she left. There was a sense of peace that came over her—knowing Rio would be okay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she closed the door behind her, she made her way to her car, her thoughts drifting to Nicky. He would be asleep by now, but the thought of returning to him, of seeing him safe and sound, made her heart ache. He was her priority, and though her relationship with Rio was something she treasured deeply, it didn’t erase her responsibility as a mother.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Agatha arrived home, the quietness of the house greeted her like an old friend. She let the babysitter go, apologizing for the late hour and made her way upstairs. Nicky was asleep in his bed, his small body curled up under the covers, and Agatha stood in the doorway for a moment, watching him with a soft smile. He was her world, her constant, and in this quiet moment, she was reminded of the delicate balance she had to strike between her two worlds.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She went to his side, tucking the covers around him and leaning down to kiss his forehead. He stirred just slightly, mumbling something in his sleep, but he stayed peacefully asleep as Agatha stood there, watching him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she slipped into bed, she could finally relax, knowing both of the people she cared for most in the world were safe. The night was peaceful, and though her mind wandered to Rio once more, wondering how she was doing, Agatha allowed herself to sink into the comfort of her home, her heart full of gratitude.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For now, she had both Rio and Nicky to care for, each in their own way. And as she lay in her bed, the quiet of the night surrounding her, Agatha knew that whatever came next, she was ready to face it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">                  (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Three days later, Rio was finally feeling like herself again. The fever had long since broken, leaving behind only a faint fatigue that she was determined to shake off. She stood in front of her closet, pulling on a well-worn band t-shirt and her favorite pair of ripped jeans. It felt good to dress like herself again after days of pajamas and blankets.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She grabbed her drumsticks and slung her bag over her shoulder, excitement buzzing in her chest. Band practice was just what she needed to feel fully alive again, to lose herself in the rhythm and the camaraderie of her friends.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she arrived at the studio, the familiar chaos greeted her. Alice was fiddling with her mic stand, muttering under her breath about its refusal to cooperate. Jen was tuning her guitar, her face scrunched up in concentration, while Kyle was at the keyboard, playing a random melody that had no connection to the song they were working on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Look who decided to rejoin the land of the living!” Alice exclaimed, spotting Rio as she walked in. She set the mic stand aside and threw her arms around Rio in a warm hug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Careful,” Rio joked, laughing as Alice squeezed her. “I’m still fragile.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You look way better than you did last time I saw you,” Jen said, setting her guitar down and giving Rio a playful nudge. “Not that that’s saying much. You were like a walking zombie.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Rio replied dryly, but there was a smile on her face. It felt good to be teased again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they settled into practice, Rio felt a spark reignite. The steady rhythm of the drums, the vibrations of the bass, and the raw energy of their music filled the room. She felt the last traces of her sickness fade as she became lost in the beat. Her friends’ laughter and banter filled the spaces between songs, and for the first time in days, Rio felt completely at ease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Glad to have you back,” Alice said during a break, plopping down next to her with two bottles of water. She handed one to Rio. “It’s not the same without our drummer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Rio said, unscrewing the cap. “I missed this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice studied her for a moment, her expression softening. “You’re really okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, taking a sip of water. “I am now. Just needed to get through it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice didn’t press further, and Rio was grateful. They moved on to discussing their upcoming gig, the setlist, and ideas for new songs. The studio buzzed with creativity and laughter, and Rio soaked it all in. This was her safe place, the rhythm of the drums grounding her, the support of her friends lifting her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the end of practice, Rio was tired, but it was the good kind of tired. The kind that came from doing something she loved. She packed up her drumsticks, slung her bag over her shoulder, and smiled to herself as she left the studio. She was back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they packed up after practice, Alice threw her arm around Rio’s shoulders, steering her toward the studio door. The cool night air greeted them, and they began the familiar walk back toward their respective apartments, chatting idly about song ideas and the latest band gossip.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a comfortable silence, Alice shot Rio a sideways glance. “Hey, I was thinking, you haven’t mentioned Dr. Harkness in a while.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze for half a second before recovering, keeping her expression neutral. “Haven’t I? Nothing much to say, I guess. Classes and meetings, the usual.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised an eyebrow, her smirk tugging at one corner of her mouth. “Really? You used to bring her up all the time. What happened? Did the honeymoon phase of academic admiration end?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, hoping it sounded casual. “Something like that. I’ve just been… busy. You know, with the band and everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mhm,” Alice said, her tone rich with skepticism. She nudged Rio lightly with her elbow. “Come on, something’s up. Spill.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There’s nothing to spill, Alice,” Rio said quickly, a little too quickly. She glanced at her friend and offered a teasing grin to deflect. “Why? Miss hearing me nerd out about poetry?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice squinted at her, clearly unconvinced. “Not buying it, Vidal. You’ve gone suspiciously quiet about the professor who was practically your muse not long ago. I’m starting to think there’s a story here you’re not telling me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, half in amusement, half in frustration. “Not everything is a big story, you know. Things are fine. She’s… fine. We’re just keeping things professional. That’s all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s smirk deepened, and her eyes twinkled with mischief. “Keeping things professional, huh? That’s an interesting choice of words.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her cheeks heat up. “Alice—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Relax, I’m kidding. Sort of.” Alice studied her friend for a moment longer, her smile softening. “Alright, fine. Keep your secrets. For now. Just know I’m always here if you need to… unburden yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Noted,” Rio said, rolling her eyes but unable to stop a small smile from tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they reached the street corner where they usually parted ways, Alice gave her a lingering look. “Just one last thing. You’re happy, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, caught off guard by the earnestness in Alice’s voice. She thought of Agatha—their stolen moments, the quiet warmth of her presence, the way her touch made Rio feel both grounded and weightless. “Yeah,” she said softly. “I am.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice nodded, satisfied, but as she walked away, Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that her friend was more perceptive than she let on. Alice might not have all the details, but it was clear she had her suspicions. For now, though, Rio was content to let the matter rest. Some things were better kept between just the two of them—at least for now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The late afternoon light filtered through the tall windows of Agatha’s office, casting a warm glow on the stacked books and carefully arranged papers. Rio sat across from Agatha, her notebook open to a page covered in her neat, sprawling handwriting. They were deep in discussion about the latest chapter of her thesis, Agatha pointing out areas for refinement while Rio countered with explanations and ideas that made her words come alive.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s an interesting interpretation,” Agatha said, her pen poised above the paper. She glanced up, meeting Rio’s eyes with a spark of curiosity. “But how do you reconcile it with the temporal shifts in <em>Spring and All</em>? Williams' treatment of time doesn’t just bend—it fractures. Have you thought about addressing that tension more directly?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded eagerly. “That’s exactly what I was trying to get at in the second half. I think I can rework that section to make the connection clearer. It’s like… death itself isn’t fixed for Williams—it’s both the end and the passage.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a small smile. “That’s the kind of depth I was hoping to see. Your work is evolving beautifully, Rio. Keep leaning into those instincts.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio flushed slightly, a mix of pride and warmth blooming in her chest. The praise coming from Agatha always hit differently—it wasn’t just professional validation but something far more personal. “Thanks. I’ll refine that and send you the update by Friday.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They worked for a few more minutes, the conversation flowing easily. Agatha’s sharp observations and Rio’s creativity sparked a synergy that felt as natural as breathing. But as the discussion wound down, the air between them shifted, softened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha set her pen down and leaned back in her chair, studying Rio in a way that was both professional and intimate. “You’ve really grown into this work,” she said softly. “I hope you know how talented you are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her heart skipping a beat. “I have a pretty amazing supervisor,” she replied, her voice teasing but sincere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “Careful, Ms. Vidal, I might get used to such compliments.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a brief, charged silence before Agatha rose from her chair, moving around the desk to stand closer to Rio. She perched against the edge of the desk, her arms crossed loosely in front of her. “How’s everything else? Are you balancing it all okay—research, the band, dance?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, pretending to think. “I don’t know. My life coach-slash-professor might say I’m overachieving.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow. “And what would your <em>girlfriend</em> say?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back in her chair, a playful glint in her eyes. “She might suggest I take more breaks. Relax more. Kiss her more.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed softly, a sound Rio always found addictive. She reached out and brushed a strand of hair from Rio’s face, her touch lingering just long enough to blur the lines between professional and personal. “Sounds like a wise woman,” Agatha murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment hovered, a delicious pause filled with unspoken words. But then, ever conscious of the boundaries they walked in such a public place, Agatha stepped back. “We should wrap this up,” she said, her tone lighter but still warm. “You have enough notes to keep you busy for the week.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood, gathering her notebook and papers, her fingers brushing Agatha’s briefly as she handed over one last draft. “Thanks again for the feedback,” Rio said, her voice soft. “And… everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze lingered on her as she moved toward the door. “Anytime.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for a moment, then stood up in front of the still closed door. She didn’t need to say anything more; her body language said everything. As she stood in front of Rio, she gently cupped Rio’s face in her hands, the touch warm, the connection immediate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you,” Agatha whispered, her voice full of sincerity, a slight tremor in her words, as though this had been waiting to be said for a long time. It was simple, yet it felt like everything. It wasn’t rushed, wasn’t uncertain—it was the truth, plain and clear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat. She hadn’t expected the words to come out so effortlessly, but hearing them made her chest tighten in a way she couldn’t quite explain. Her breath caught, and she smiled, a genuine smile that reached her eyes, soft and full of emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you too,” Rio replied, her voice almost a whisper, as if speaking the words out loud made them even more real. It was a feeling she’d known for a while, but now that it was out in the open, there was something new about it. Something freeing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile deepened, and she leaned in to kiss Rio gently, her lips warm against Rio’s. It was a kiss that spoke of comfort and closeness, of the deep bond they shared. There was nothing rushed about it. Just the quiet, tender acknowledgment of everything they meant to each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they pulled away, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, her hands still gently holding her face, as if to keep her there forever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ve been dancing around this for so long,” Agatha said, her voice soft and almost amused. “I think I’ve been waiting for this moment longer than I realized.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled lightly, the sound of it almost relieved. “I think I have too. But… it feels right now. With you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The world outside seemed to fade away, the busy campus life, the papers and the meetings—everything but this moment, this quiet space, felt unimportant. All that mattered was this. What they had. What they were.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m glad,” Agatha murmured, her smile growing, the warmth between them undeniable. “Because I don’t think I could love you any more than I already do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed a few minutes longer, soaking in the moment, before a noise down the hall brought them back to reality. Rio secured her bag on her shoulder and Agatha eventually opened the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just before slipping out, Rio glanced back, a knowing smile on her lips. “See you later, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled back, her expression private and fond. “See you later, Ms. Vidal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just before she left, Rio turned around and mouthed, “Lunch tomorrow? My place?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed softly and nodded.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the door closed behind Rio, Agatha leaned against her desk, exhaling slowly. Mixing business and pleasure with Rio was a balancing act—one they were pulling off with care and discretion. And yet, every stolen moment, every shared look, made the risk feel undeniably worth it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify">The sunlight streaming through the windows of Rio’s apartment bathed the room in a warm, golden glow, illuminating the array of vibrant green plants perched on the windowsill. Their leaves reached toward the light, adding a sense of life and tranquility to the cozy space. The faint scent of herbs and spices lingered in the air, mingling with the inviting aroma of freshly cooked pasta.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the small dining table, Agatha sat nursing a cup of tea, the ceramic warm against her palms. She leaned back slightly, her gaze following Rio as she moved around the kitchen with practiced ease. The younger woman’s hair was gathered in a loose, slightly messy bun, wisps escaping to frame her face. It wasn’t perfect, and somehow, that made it all the more endearing. She was wearing an oversized shirt with the sleeves rolled up and tucked into a pair of faded jeans that hugged her in all the right places. There was something so effortlessly captivating about the way Rio moved, her focus entirely on plating the meal she had prepared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a smirk as she tilted her head, watching the way the sunlight caught on Rio’s skin, making it almost glow. “Do you always cook this well, or am I just special?” she teased, her voice laced with playful curiosity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned to face her, a wooden spoon in one hand as she raised an eyebrow, the corners of her mouth quirking up into a smile. “You’re definitely special,” she quipped, her tone light but her eyes holding a warmth that made Agatha’s chest ache in the best way. She set the plates down on the table, the pasta glistening with a creamy, rich sauce, flanked by perfectly roasted vegetables. “But don’t get too used to it,” Rio added with a sly grin. “I’m not a professional chef or anything. Lilia just taught me the basics, and I wing it from there. Most of the times, it ends up burnt or undercooked, but I made a special effort for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Remind me to thank her,” Agatha said, her smirk deepening as she reached out to gently tug on Rio’s wrist, pulling her closer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Rio protested, though her laughter betrayed her as Agatha pulled her down into her lap. Rio swatted at her half-heartedly, a bright smile lighting up her face as she relented. “You are so—” She didn’t finish the sentence, cutting herself off with a quick, soft kiss to Agatha’s lips. “Eat your food, woman,” she added with mock sternness, her voice tinged with affection as she tried to wriggle free.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not until you promise to stay right here,” Agatha countered, her arms wrapping loosely around Rio’s waist, holding her in place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed dramatically but couldn’t hide the way her smile softened, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s. “Fine,” she murmured, reaching for her fork and twisting it through the pasta on her plate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They ate like that, Rio perched on Agatha’s lap, the plates balanced between them on the small table. The meal was simple but delicious, and the conversation flowed as naturally as it always did between them. Agatha found herself marveling at how easily Rio fit into her life, how seamlessly their days intertwined despite the risks and secrecy that shadowed their relationship.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio twirled another forkful of pasta, she glanced toward the door, her brows knitting together in a flicker of uncertainty. “Did I lock that?” she murmured absently, more to herself than to Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked up from her plate, her expression calm but curious. “I didn’t hear the lock turn,” she said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could respond, the door swung open with an abruptness that made her jump, and Alice strode in like a whirlwind, a tote bag slung over her shoulder and her face lit with the urgency of a fresh piece of gossip. “Rio, you won’t <em>believe</em> what Jen—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice froze mid-sentence, her eyes widening as they landed on Agatha. And then on Rio, who was still perched in Agatha’s lap, their faces far too close to be explained away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s mouth fell open in a comical expression of shock, quickly morphing into giddy delight. She pointed an accusatory finger at them, her voice breaking the tense silence. “Oh. My. <em>God.</em> What is this?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Panic flared in Rio’s chest as she scrambled off Agatha’s lap so quickly she nearly knocked over the plates. Her face turned a deep, telltale crimson, and she held up her hands as if trying to ward off Alice’s relentless stare. “Alice! Do you <em>ever</em> knock?” she blurted, her voice sharp but laced with the kind of mortification that only Alice could inspire.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, unfazed and utterly delighted, dropped her bag onto the floor with a dramatic thud. She pointed between them, her grin widening by the second. “You’re together. <em>You and Dr. Harkness!</em>” Her voice was an octave too loud, filled with uncontainable glee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, ever composed and unshaken, rose gracefully from her chair, brushing off her slacks as if nothing at all were amiss. She met Alice’s wide-eyed stare with her usual calm demeanor, her lips curving into a polite smile. “Alice,” she said, her tone smooth and controlled. “Lovely to see you again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s grin turned downright mischievous. She folded her arms, leaning against the doorframe as if settling in for a long interrogation. “Oh, don’t you ‘lovely to see you’ me,” she shot back, her eyes dancing with amusement. “How long has this been going on? And more importantly, <em>why didn’t I know about it?</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. “Alice, I swear—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, no, don’t you swear at me, young lady,” Alice interrupted, clearly reveling in the moment. “Do you <em>know</em> how long I’ve been trying to figure out if you were seeing anyone? And now I find out it’s <em>her?</em>” She gestured toward Agatha with exaggerated incredulity, though her tone carried no real judgment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out an exasperated sigh, dropping her hands and glaring at Alice, though the effect was somewhat ruined by the pink flush still dusting her cheeks. “Fine. Yes. We’re together,” she admitted, her words coming out in a rush. “It’s… new, and we were keeping it quiet. But now, I guess you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice practically <em>vibrated</em> with excitement, clapping her hands together as though she had just uncovered the greatest secret of the century. “This is <em>amazing.</em> I mean, kind of scandalous, sure, but <em>mostly</em> amazing.” She paused for dramatic effect, her eyes sparkling as she looked between Rio and Agatha. “Rio, I’ve been <em>dying</em> to know what’s been going on with you. And this? <em>This</em> explains everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She threw her bag onto the couch with a triumphant flourish and pointed at them, her grin so wide it looked as though it might permanently stretch her face. “I <em>knew</em> it! I <em>knew</em> this was happening!” she practically squealed, bouncing on the balls of her feet like an overexcited puppy. “Oh my <em>God,</em> I can’t believe you thought you could keep this from me. <em>Me!</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, her face now a deep crimson as she buried it in her hands. “Alice, <em>please.</em> Can you not make this more humiliating than it already is?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Humiliating?” Alice gasped as if Rio had personally insulted her. “Humiliating? Are you kidding me, Rio? This is a <em>moment.</em> This is iconic. This is—this is everything I’ve been saying for <em>months.</em>” She threw her hands up, gesturing wildly between Rio and Agatha like an overzealous referee at a particularly dramatic sporting event. “I <em>called</em> this the day you walked into her class. Don’t even try to tell me I’m wrong, because—hello—this right here?” She pointed emphatically at the space between them. “This is all the proof I need.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, as axlays the picture of composure despite the circus unfolding before her, raised a perfectly arched eyebrow and crossed her arms. Her gaze flicked between Alice and Rio, her tone calm but tinged with amusement. “You’ve been speculating about us?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Speculating?” Alice snorted, folding her arms as though the mere suggestion was beneath her. “Try <em>betting</em> on it.” She tilted her chin up, feigning offense. “Jen owes me twenty bucks.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a long, suffering groan, dragging her hands down her face as though trying to erase herself from existence. “I’m going to <em>kill</em> her,” she muttered, her voice muffled but dripping with exasperation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, don’t be mad!” Alice flopped onto the couch with a dramatic sigh, throwing one arm over her forehead like a tragic heroine in a melodrama. “You two were so <em>obvious.</em> Like, painfully obvious. The stolen glances? The way you magically loved going to class all of a sudden?” She sat up abruptly, pointing a finger at Rio with mock seriousness. “And let’s not forget the <em>dead giveaway</em>: the moment you stopped talking about her completely a few weeks ago. Textbook denial behavior. Classic move.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned again, this time leaning against the edge of the couch as if her knees could no longer support her. “I cannot believe I’m listening to this right now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned casually against the table, her arms crossed and a small, amused smile playing on her lips. “I suppose Rio underestimated you,” she said, her tone light but with just enough edge to make Alice’s chest puff out proudly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice pointed an accusatory finger at her, her grin feral. “Damn right she did. But now that you’ve <em>officially</em> confirmed it—because, oh my god, finally—I need <em>details.</em> When did it happen? Who made the first move? Was it super romantic, or was it one of those tension-filled moments where you just couldn’t resist anymore?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t fight the smile creeping onto her face. “Alice, I swear, if you don’t calm down—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Calm down?” Alice interrupted, leaning forward on the couch as if she were at the edge of her seat in a thriller. “Rio, this is <em>huge.</em> You’re dating <em>Dr. Harkness.</em> The Agatha Harkness! I’m your best friend. You’re supposed to tell me <em>everything.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed heavily, shooting Agatha a desperate, pleading look. “This,” she said, gesturing toward Alice without looking at her, “is what I deal with <em>every single day.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her composure unshaken as she reached out and rested a calming hand on Rio’s shoulder. Her thumb moved in small, soothing circles, a subtle gesture of reassurance. “I think she’s happy for us,” she said, her tone teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice scoffed dramatically, clutching her chest as though Agatha had insulted her honor. “Happy? I’m <em>ecstatic.</em> My girl’s with the hottest, smartest professor on campus. You two are like… like a power couple in the making! Academic royalty! Everyone else can just <em>go home!</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“<em>Please</em> stop,” Rio begged, her voice half-laughing, half-dying from secondhand embarrassment. Her cheeks were burning a brilliant shade of crimson, but despite the dramatics, there was a soft smile tugging at her lips. She couldn’t help it—Alice’s enthusiasm was annoyingly infectious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, seeing that she’d successfully chipped away at Rio’s defenses, softened for a moment, leaning forward with an almost maternal air. “Hey, in all seriousness,” she said, her voice losing its playful edge, “I’m really glad. Okay? If she makes you happy—and it’s <em>very</em> clear she does—then I’m all in.” She hesitated for a beat, then grinned wickedly, her mischievous energy flooding back. “But you still owe me every juicy detail. Later, of course.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a groan of mock defeat, covering her face with her hands. “She’s going to be <em>unbearable.</em> We’ve created a monster.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips quirked into a smirk as she glanced at Alice, then back at Rio. “I think the monster was already there, dear,” she said, her voice laced with dry humor. “But I have to admit, she’s a good friend.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice threw her arms out dramatically, as though expecting applause. “Damn right I am. The <em>best</em> friend, actually. And don’t you worry, I’ll take this secret to the grave.” She paused, tapping her chin thoughtfully. “Well, for now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned again, this time burying her face in Agatha’s shoulder. “I don’t know why I put up with you,” she muttered, though the fondness in her voice betrayed her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Because you love me,” Alice shot back without missing a beat, leaning back against the couch with a triumphant grin. “And because deep down, you <em>know</em> I’m your number-one hype woman.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, her hand moving to gently stroke Rio’s back. “She does have a point,” she murmured, her voice warm and amused.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled back just enough to glare half-heartedly at both of them, her lips twitching upward despite herself. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but you two together might actually kill me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice grinned, leaning forward and clasping her hands together as if preparing for a toast. “Oh, don’t worry. I’ll behave.” She paused for dramatic effect. “Eventually.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As much as Alice’s excitement was boundless, the moment she realized she was sitting across from an actual professor—Rio’s professor—her energy shifted slightly. She straightened up, suddenly aware of her casual sprawl on Rio’s couch, and brushed her hands down her jeans as if smoothing out invisible wrinkles. Her eyes darted to Agatha, wide and curious but edged with an uncharacteristic self-consciousness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So…” Alice began, her voice carefully measured, as though she were addressing a head of state. Her gaze flicked between Rio and Agatha, her hands fidgeting with the hem of her shirt. “Dr. Harkness. Or, uh—should I call you Agatha? I mean, you’re, like, not <em>my</em> professor, but still… you’re a professor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips quirked into a small, amused smile, her poise utterly unshaken. “Agatha is fine,” she said smoothly. “Outside of the classroom, I assure you, I’m just another person.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right. Totally. That makes sense,” Alice said with a quick nod, though her hands continued their nervous dance in her lap. “Agatha. Cool. Nice to, um, officially meet you. I mean, you know, as Agatha—not just ‘the mysterious Dr. Harkness Rio <em>never</em> shut up about.’”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned audibly, dragging her hands down her face in a fruitless attempt to hide her embarrassment. “Alice,” she muttered, her voice dripping with warning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What?” Alice said innocently, throwing up her hands. “It’s true! Like, <em>ridiculously</em> true.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head slightly, her gaze sliding to Rio with a playful arch of her brow. “Never shut up, you say?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s blush deepened to the point where it seemed her entire face might catch fire. “Don’t encourage her,” she muttered, her voice muffled as she buried her face in her hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s initial awkwardness dissolved into a grin that was all mischief, her energy returning tenfold. “Oh, you have <em>no </em>idea. There was this one time—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alice,” Rio interjected sharply, her tone low and laced with thinly veiled menace, though the corners of her mouth twitched as if fighting a reluctant smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smirked, leaning back against the couch like a cat that had cornered its prey. “Fine, fine. I’ll stop,” she said with exaggerated surrender, holding her hands up as though absolving herself of any guilt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air between them crackled with unspoken amusement, and Agatha leaned forward sligthtly, resting her hands on her knees. “You two have a… lively dynamic,” she remarked, her voice carrying a warm undercurrent that softened the teasing note.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s one way to put it,” Rio muttered, shooting Alice a look that managed to be both exasperated and affectionate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, unfazed, turned her attention back to Agatha. “So, Agatha, tell me—what’s it like being <em>the</em> Dr. Harkness? Do you just go around dazzling people with your intellect and stealing their hearts? Or is that a Rio-only special?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, clearly surprised by the boldness of the question, though her amusement didn’t waver. “I’m fairly certain it’s just Rio,” she replied with a small, knowing smile, her gaze flicking to the woman in question.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned again, this time leaning back into the cushions as though wishing they would swallow her whole. “I regret introducing you two.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice gasped in mock horror, pressing a hand to her chest. “You regret introducing me to the <em>love of your life?</em>  Wow. Harsh.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened, and she reached over to place a gentle hand on Rio’s knee. “I think she’s just overwhelmed by your enthusiasm,” she said, her tone a perfect balance of humor and reassurance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice grinned, clearly pleased with herself. “Oh, trust me, she’s used to it. I’ve been like this since day one. Right, Rio?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened one eye, glaring half-heartedly at Alice. “Unfortunately, yes. Day <em>one.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her fingers giving Rio’s knee a light squeeze. “Well, I have to admit, I’m starting to see the appeal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice beamed, leaning forward with her hands clasped together. “I like her, Rio. She’s a keeper.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, clearly entertained by their dynamic. “I think I like her too,” she said to Rio, whose exasperated eye-roll did little to hide the small, reluctant smile tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice beamed, her chest puffing up slightly at the indirect compliment, though her lingering awkwardness was still evident in the way she fidgeted with her hands. “Thanks. I think you’re… cool, too,” she blurted, before immediately wincing. Her voice dropped to a mortified mumble. “God, why did I say that? She’s literally a professor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, as composed as ever, didn’t so much as bat an eyelash at Alice’s outburst. “I appreciate the vote of confidence,” she replied smoothly, her smile kind and warm. “And for the record, I’m glad Rio has someone like you in her life. It’s clear how much she values your friendship.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice blinked, visibly taken aback by the sincerity of the statement. Her bravado faltered for just a moment, and she shifted in her seat. “Oh. Uh, thanks. That means a lot, actually.” She scratched the back of her neck, her usual confidence replaced by a faint blush.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced between the two women, her fondness for both of them unmistakable. “Okay, this is sweet and all, but Alice, if you keep being this awkward, I swear I’m kicking you out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I am <em>not</em> awkward!” Alice shot back indignantly, though the flush creeping up her neck betrayed her. “I just—I don’t usually hang out with professors, okay? It’s weird. No offense.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“None taken,” Agatha said lightly, her tone teasing but gentle. “I promise, I’m not nearly as intimidating as I seem. I don’t bite.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s good to know,” Alice replied, managing a nervous laugh. Her expression shifted almost immediately, her grin turning impish as she swiveled toward Rio with a glint of mischief in her eyes. “Except if—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised a finger, blushing ten shades darker. “Don’t even think about finishing that sentence,” she warned in a half-threatening tone, laced with an edge of mortified panic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed at that, the sound warm and genuine, and Alice seemed to relax a bit more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know, Dr. Harkness,” Alice said, her grin softening into something more genuine, “you’re a lot cooler than I expected. No offense again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Still none taken,” Agatha replied, her smile unwavering. “And you’re a lot more entertaining than I expected. No offense.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Touché,” Alice said, raising an imaginary glass in a mock toast.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the end of the visit, while the occasional bout of awkwardness lingered like a shadow, the tension between Alice and Agatha had dissolved into something easier, warmer. Alice cracked jokes with her usual flair, but with a newfound respect for Agatha. Agatha, for her part, offered her own wry observations, matching Alice’s wit with quiet precision.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, caught in the crossfire of their budding camaraderie, watched the two women with an expression torn between fondness and exhaustion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Alice finally stood to leave, she paused at the door, glancing between Rio and Agatha with a sly smile. “You know, I could get used to this. You two are kind of disgustingly cute together. It’s almost tolerable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Almost,” Rio echoed dryly, but the warmth in her voice betrayed her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the door closed behind her, the room fell quiet again. Rio leaned into Agatha’s side, letting out a long sigh. “She’s going to be insufferable, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s temple. “She’s a good friend. And I think she’s already quite fond of me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, but her smile lingered as she leaned into Agatha’s touch. “Yeah, yeah. Just don’t let her corrupt you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s laughter filled the space again, warm and comforting, and for the first time in a while, Rio felt a strange sense of peace in the chaos.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>            (T. S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Saturday mornings at the dance center were always a whirlwind of activity. Little feet pattered across the polished wooden floors, excited voices filled the air, and parents lingered near the studio entrance, sipping coffee or chatting while waiting for the class to begin. Nicky, as usual, arrived with his boundless energy, holding tightly to his mother’s hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha knelt beside him, adjusting his little dance shoes. “Remember to listen to Miss Rio, okay? And try to keep your arms straight during the jetés this time, like she told you last time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know, Mama!” Nicky said confidently, grinning. “Miss Rio said I’m getting better!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly. “I’m sure she’s right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The two entered the studio, and there she was—Rio, standing in the center of the room with a clipboard in hand, already guiding a few early arrivals through their warm-ups. She looked bright and full of life, her enthusiasm for teaching infectious even to the adults peering through the observation window.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as Nicky spotted her, he waved wildly. “Miss Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned at the sound, her face lighting up when she saw him. “Hey, Nicky!” She crouched down as he ran over, meeting him with an enthusiastic high-five. “Ready to dance today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah!” he replied, bouncing on his toes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha observed the exchange from the doorway, her heart swelling at how effortlessly Rio connected with her son. When Rio glanced up and caught her gaze, her expression softened. There was a flicker of something unspoken between them, a quiet acknowledgment of their bond. Agatha’s lips quirked into a small smile, and Rio returned it with a wink before refocusing on the class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The session began in earnest, with Rio leading the children through stretches and basic positions. Agatha took her usual spot near the back of the observation area, watching discreetly. She couldn’t help but marvel at how Rio handled the group—gentle but firm, playful yet professional. It was as if she was made for this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the kids practiced their routines, Nicky tried extra hard to get everything right, occasionally glancing at his mom for approval. Agatha gave him an encouraging thumbs-up every time, which only fueled his determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At one point, Rio crouched beside Nicky to adjust his stance, her voice soft but confident. “That’s it! See how strong you look when you hold your arms like this? Perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, standing even taller.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a pang of pride for her son and a rush of affection for the woman guiding him. Watching them like this—a scene so simple yet meaningful—made her feel a sense of peace she hadn’t realized she’d been missing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After class, as the children gathered their things, Nicky ran up to Rio with a wide grin. “Miss Rio! Did I do good today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You were awesome,” Rio said, ruffling his hair. “I’m proud of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He looked thrilled, but then his gaze shifted to his mother, who had approached to collect him. “Mama, did you see me? Miss Rio said I was awesome!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I did see,” Agatha replied, crouching to his level. “And I think Miss Rio was absolutely right. You did great.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky turned back to Rio with a triumphant expression. “See? Mama thinks so too!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, her eyes sparkling. “I guess that makes it official.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha helped Nicky gather his things, Rio lingered for a moment, catching Agatha’s eye. There was a subtle, private warmth in her gaze—a message meant just for her. Agatha smiled back, her heart lighter than it had been all morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tugged on her hand, breaking the moment. “Can we make pancakes tomorrow morning, Mama?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Pancakes sound perfect,” Agatha said, standing. She glanced back at Rio, her voice quieter but no less sincere. “Thank you, as always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded. “Anytime.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the flurry of children and parents began to disperse after class, Rio stayed behind in the studio, tidying up stray ballet slippers and rearranging the little chairs by the side of the room. She hummed softly to herself, a habit she’d developed over years of teaching, as it helped keep her grounded amidst the chaos of the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she was about to leave, she heard the familiar sound of Nicky’s voice echoing down the hallway. He appeared moments later, bounding into the studio with his usual exuberance, his little bag bouncing against his side. Behind him, Agatha followed at a more measured pace, her sharp, poised demeanor a stark contrast to her son’s untamed energy. They both were still here, and it filled Rio with warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio!” Nicky called out, skidding to a halt in front of her. “Guess what? Mama said we can have pancakes tomorrow morning because I did so good today!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio crouched down to his level, giving him a high-five. “Pancakes? That sounds like a reward fit for a dancing superstar. You deserve it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned from ear to ear, puffing his chest out with pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for a moment, glancing around the now-empty studio before clearing her throat. “I was wondering…” she began, her voice quieter now. “If you’re free this afternoon, would you like to join us for lunch? Nothing fancy—just something at home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, caught off guard but undeniably pleased. “Lunch?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Agatha confirmed, smoothing her hands over her coat. “I thought it might be nice. Nicky’s been talking about pancakes, but I was thinking something a bit more balanced today. Maybe sandwiches?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the mention of food, Nicky perked up. “You should come, Miss Rio! Mama makes the best sandwiches!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, glancing between the two. “How could I say no to an offer like that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened, relief flickering across her face. “Great. Then it’s settled.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do I get to help make the sandwiches?” Nicky asked eagerly, tugging at his mother’s hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Agatha said, turning to Rio with a teasing look. “Though I should warn you, his idea of helping usually involves eating half the ingredients.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed. “Sounds perfect to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the three of them exited the studio together, Rio couldn’t help but feel a quiet thrill. Sharing lunch with Agatha and Nicky felt like a step forward—a small, significant moment in their delicate balance of secrecy and connection. She didn’t know exactly what to expect, considering Nicky still didn’t know about them, but for now, she was simply happy to be invited into their little world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The kitchen was filled with the cozy clatter of plates and the soft hum of conversation. Nicky sat at the table, his legs swinging beneath him as he devoured his sandwich, an impressive tower of bread, turkey, and cheese. Rio and Agatha sat across from him, sharing easy smiles as they assembled their plates.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Mid-bite, Nicky looked up at Rio, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. “Miss Rio,” he began, “at school, we learned about big rivers. Like the Rio Grande! Just like your name. Did your parents name you after this river like that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hand stilled for a moment as she set down her glass, Nicky’s innocent question hanging in the air. Across the table, Agatha tensed slightly, her fork halfway to her mouth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced at Agatha, whose soft gaze seemed to silently offer support. Turning back to Nicky, she smiled, her voice steady but kind. “That’s a good question, Nicky,” she began gently. “But I don’t actually have parents—I never knew them. So I don’t really know why they named me Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s smile faltered as he digested Rio’s words. His brow furrowed, his gaze shifting toward the ground as he asked softly, “But… don’t you wish you had parents? Like mama for me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart tightened at the concern in his voice. She leaned forward, her eyes warm as she met his gaze. “It’s okay to wonder about things like that,” she said gently. “But I want you to know that even though I didn’t have parents, I have someone who means just as much to me. Her name is Lilia, and she’s the closest thing I have to family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked up at her, still a little confused but listening intently. “So… she takes care of you like a mom does?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled softly, her heart swelling at his innocence. “Yes, exactly. Lilia has been there for me for a long time. She didn’t give me my name, nor her last name, but that doesn’t change anything. She’s always treated me like her own. She's my mom and I'm her daughter.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched them, her heart full as she saw Rio speak with such tenderness. She had never seen Rio let her guard down so completely with anyone, but with Nicky, there was an ease that Agatha couldn’t help but admire.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Does she come over to visit a lot?” Nicky asked, still processing the idea of Rio’s ‘Lilia’.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Very often, yeah, and I eat dinner at her house every Sunday,” Rio replied, her voice warm with affection. “She’s just like family, even if we’re not related by blood. Family doesn’t always have to be the people who gave you life. Sometimes, it’s the people who choose to be there for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky seemed to consider this for a moment, before his lips curved into a small smile. “That’s cool. I think I’d like Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled back, her eyes soft with gratitude. “I think she’d like you too, Nicky. She’s really special.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been quietly observing them, reached over to squeeze Rio’s hand under the table, a small gesture of support that Rio returned with a faint smile. Agatha knew Rio had never really spoken about her past like this, and she appreciated the openness. It wasn’t easy, but Rio had managed to share something so important, not just with her but with Nicky as well.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry, Miss Rio. But I’m glad you have a Lilia,” Nicky added, smiling widely at his teacher, as if to reassure her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, her smile never wavering. “You don’t need to be sorry. It’s just the way things are,” she said softly. “But I do know that my name, Rio, means ‘river’ in Spanish.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky perked up at that. “Like the Rio Grande!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Rio said, her tone lightening. “And my last name, Vidal, means ‘life.’ So my full name basically means ‘river of life.’”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up, his enthusiasm bubbling over. “Whoa, that’s so cool! Rivers are so important. They carry water and fish and stuff—and life!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha started to open her mouth, perhaps to steer the conversation elsewhere, but Rio held up a hand, silently reassuring her. She took a slow breath and leaned toward Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Honestly, Nicky, I don’t really know why my first parents chose it. But I like to think it’s because rivers are strong, and they keep moving no matter what’s in their way.” She paused, her voice softening. “It’s a good name to remind me to keep going, even when things are hard.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a quiet smile as she listened, her heart swelling at how Rio managed to answer the question with grace and honesty. She tilted her head slightly, regarding Rio with an affectionate gleam in her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think that’s a beautiful name,” Agatha said softly, her voice laced with admiration. “And it suits you perfectly.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced at her, their eyes meeting in a moment of unspoken understanding. A hint of warmth crept into her cheeks, and she gave a small, appreciative nod before turning her attention back to Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve got a pretty cool name too, you know. Nicholas Harkness has a nice ring to it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, puffing out his chest with pride as he reached for another bite of his sandwich.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the conversation shifted to lighter topics, Agatha couldn’t help but marvel at Rio’s resilience. <em>River of Life,</em> she thought, the words echoing in her mind. Yes, it was fitting—so fitting. Rio carried strength and vitality with her, moving forward despite the obstacles in her path, just like a river.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Watching her laugh with Nicky, Agatha felt her chest tighten with an overwhelming mix of admiration, adoration and tenderness. The connection they shared at this table was something she hadn’t realized she’d been longing for until now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We can be your family too, Mama and me” Nicky said after a beat, his bright eyes looking at Rio with such earnestness that it took her breath away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked rapidly, trying to hold back the tears that suddenly welled up. She hadn’t expected those words to affect her so deeply, but they did. The warmth in Nicky’s offer made her heart ache with a mixture of joy and sorrow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her voice came out a little shaky when she spoke, “You don’t know how much that means to me, Nicky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched silently, her heart swelling with love for both of them, as Rio struggled to compose herself. She knew how hard it had been for Rio to open up, how much it took to allow herself to be vulnerable. And now, here was Nicky, offering her something she’d never had before Lilia — a sense of belonging, a place to call home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio wiped her eyes quickly, trying to smile through the emotion. “I think… I think I might need some time to get used to that,” she said, her voice still thick. “But that’s the nicest thing anyone has said to me in a long time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, oblivious to the weight of the moment, smiled brightly. “I mean it. You’re already like family. You’re always here with us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, her hand still resting on Rio’s, leaned in and kissed the top of Rio’s head gently, a silent gesture of support. She could see how hard this was for Rio, but also how much it meant to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Nicky,” Rio said, her voice steadier now. “I’m lucky to have both of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky beamed, clearly pleased with himself, Rio felt a sense of peace settle over her. She had never had the privilege of growing up in a home where she was cherished, where people would offer her love without question. But in this moment, with Agatha and Nicky, she realized that maybe she could have that now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tears she’d been fighting finally fell, but they were tears of gratitude. She had found a family, and it was right here with her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After the emotional moment with Nicky, there was a brief silence that settled in the room, as Agatha and Rio busied themselves in the kitchen, tidying up everything while Nicky played in the living room. Rio, still feeling a mixture of emotions, looked at Agatha with a kind of quiet understanding in her eyes. Agatha met her gaze, her hand still resting gently on Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nicky’s right,” Agatha said softly. “We’re already like family. Maybe it’s time we stop keeping this a secret, at least at home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment, her mind racing. She had never let anyone this close before, never let herself be vulnerable enough to share her heart, but with Agatha, everything felt different. The way she looked at her, the way she had supported her—it all felt like a promise, one Rio wasn’t ready to break.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You think so?” Rio asked, her voice low.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her gaze steady. “Yes. We don’t have to hide anymore. And Nicky—he’s to most important person in the world to me. I think it’s only fair we let him know the truth.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a deep breath. She knew it wouldn’t be easy, but she trusted Agatha, and more importantly, she trusted Nicky. If they were really going to make this work—if they were really going to be a family—there couldn’t be any more secrets.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Rio said softly, giving Agatha a small, reassuring smile. “Let’s do it. But we have to make sure it’s the right time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha squeezed her hand, her eyes full of warmth and affection. “I think now’s perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a sense of peace settle over her. This was the right moment. There would never be a perfect time, but this felt right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha moved, smoothing out her shirt, and turned to Nicky with a smile. “Hey, buddy,” she said, her voice soft but filled with warmth. “There’s something we need to tell you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky stopped, looking up at Agatha with curiosity, his wide eyes attentive.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio followed Agatha’s lead, standing up beside her. She could feel her heart beat a little faster, but she remained calm, looking at Nicky with the same tenderness. Agatha started, “You know how we’ve been spending a lot of time together?” she asked him gently.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded eagerly. “Yeah! You and Miss Rio are always together now. It’s cool.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exchanged a quick glance with Agatha, their silent understanding clear. It was time. Agatha gave her nod, encouraging her to say what came naturally.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Rio began, her voice warm but a little unsure, “Your Mama and I… we’ve been seeing each other for a while now. We’re not just friends. We’re, uh… together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face scrunched in confusion, and he tilted his head, clearly trying to process what Rio and Agatha had just told him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know you’re together, you’re standing side by side. I know what ‘together’ means silly. I am six, you know!” he said, his voice filled with innocence and confusion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled at his confusion and exchanged a glance with Rio, and Rio felt her heart race slightly. She smiled at Nicky, realizing this wasn’t just a casual conversation anymore—this was a new chapter for all of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Rio started, taking a seat next to Nicky, her voice gentle, “not exactly. It means that your Mama and I are… more than friends. We care about each other a lot. Like, a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, sitting down beside them. “We’re a couple, Nicky. That means we’re together in a special way. We love each other.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky blinked a few times, still unsure of the concept. “You… love each other?” he asked slowly, trying to wrap his mind around it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled warmly at him. “Yes, Nicky. We love each other. Like how you love your mama or your friends. But it’s a different kind of love. It’s the kind of love that makes us want to be with each other all the time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha added softly, “When two people love each other, they want to spend time together and help each other. It’s a bond that’s really special.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky thought for a moment, his brows furrowing as he processed the new information. Then his face lit up, and he clapped his hands together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s awesome!” he exclaimed, jumping up in his seat. “You guys are like, two princesses that kiss at the end? It’s so cool!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh at how Nicky had put simple words almost immediately even though they had been trying to explain in over complicated ways, and she felt a weight lift off her chest. “Yeah, I guess we are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned down to kiss the top of Nicky’s head, her heart full. “We just wanted you to know, because you’re so important to us. You’re part of this too, Nicky. You’re my little prince.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed at both of them, and Rio felt her heart swell with affection. “I’m happy you guys are happy. You make each other smile all the time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed softly, her eyes sparkling. “You’re right, kiddo. We do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, a sense of relief washing over her. It had been a big step, but with Nicky’s approval, it felt like a burden had been lifted. No more hiding. Not here, at least.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at Nicky, her tone softening as she leaned in slightly. “Nicky, there’s one more thing we need to talk about,” she said, her voice gentle but serious. “This… this thing between Rio and me, it’s something that has to stay a secret for now. We can’t tell anyone else yet, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes widened, clearly puzzled by this new instruction. “Why?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was quick to explain, not really wanting to explain the power dynamics at play here. “Well, Nicky, sometimes adults have to keep certain things private, even if they’re really happy about them. It’s just a little secret for now. But we promise you, it’s not because we don’t trust you. It’s just the way things need to be for now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her expression serious but warm. “We’re still figuring some things out. But when the time is right, we’ll tell people, including your friends, okay? But for now, it’s just between us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded slowly, processing it all. He looked at them both, clearly not fully understanding why it had to be a secret but trusting them. “Okay, I can keep it secret. I won’t tell anyone. But you have to promise me that if I ever have questions, I can ask you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her heart swelling with love and pride. “Of course, Nicky. You can always come to us with questions. And when the time is right, you’ll know all the answers. We just need a little bit of time. Can we count on you to keep our secret for now?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up with a grin, a mix of excitement and pride at being trusted. “I promise! I can keep a secret!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached out and gave him a hug. “You’re the best, buddy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky squeezed her back and then looked up at Agatha. “I’m glad you and Rio are happy together, Mama. I think you’re a good team!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled warmly, feeling her heart fill with affection for Nicky. “Thanks, my love. That means more than you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, the conversation settled into a comfortable, unspoken understanding. The secret was safe with Nicky, and the love they shared, though hidden for now, was strong and real. It felt like a small but significant step in the right direction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*<br /><br /></p>

  <em>At nightfall, in the rigging and the aerial,</em>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">            (T. S. Eliot. “The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The quiet hum of the library surrounded Rio and Alice as they sat side by side at a small table near the back, each absorbed in their work. The only sounds were the soft scratch of pens on paper and the occasional turning of pages. Rio’s mind was focused, her eyes scanning over the pages of her thesis once again, the words and concepts starting to blur together in a familiar, comfortable rhythm. She had been working on the same section for hours, the ideas of death and timelessness in modernist poetry coming together more clearly with each revision.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, meanwhile, was deep into her own musicology thesis, scribbling notes as she worked through an article on early 20th-century composers. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, but she still managed to throw an occasional glance toward Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, however, wasn’t feeling as tense as she had been in the past. Despite the secretive nature of her relationship with Agatha, there wasn’t much to worry about. Things were good. She was happy—so much so that she had almost forgotten how stressed she’d been at the start of the semester. If anything, the secrecy only added to the thrill, and she trusted Agatha completely. It was almost like a game, one where they were in control, and Rio was enjoying every moment of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s voice broke through her thoughts. “You’ve been awfully quiet. What’s going on in that head of yours?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced up, surprised by the sudden question. “Oh, nothing much,” she said, a smile tugging at her lips. “Just thinking about… stuff.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised an eyebrow, clearly not buying it. “Come on, spill. I’ve known you for years. What’s on your mind?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for only a moment before leaning back in her chair. “It’s Agatha,” she admitted, feeling a familiar warmth spread through her chest. “Things are good. Really good, actually. But I’m not stressed about it, if that’s what you’re thinking.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s expression softened. “You’ve been glowing lately,” she said with a grin. “Something good’s clearly going on. And by the way, I’m not exactly blind to the vibes you two give off when you’re around each other.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, her fingers tapping lightly on the table. “Yeah, well, it’s just… it’s nice. I think we’re good at keeping things low-key, you know? We’ve got everything under control.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice nodded knowingly. “Good. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t getting too caught up in the secrecy. It’s easy to let that consume you. But you’ve always been good at keeping things balanced.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, reassured by Alice’s words. “I don’t really feel like I’m struggling with anything right now. Honestly, everything’s kind of… perfect. But we’re still keeping it under wraps, just to be safe. You know, with her being my supervisor and all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised her hands in mock surrender. “Fair enough. No judgment here. I just hope you know what you’re doing. But you’re not exactly someone who rushes into things, so I trust you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “I’m not rushing. But I’m not worried, either.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned back in her chair, clearly satisfied with Rio’s response. “Good. Because, honestly, I’m just waiting for you to tell me about the epic love story that’s unfolding. I can already see the movie in my head. It’s so clear how much she cares about you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Well, don’t get too excited. It’s not like we’re making a grand statement here. But, yeah, she does.” She looked down at her notes, absently tapping her pen against the paper again. “It’s just… I don’t want to mess things up, you know? I don’t want to risk everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice sighed, shaking her head in disbelief. “Rio, I don’t think you’re going to mess anything up. You’re smart, and Agatha’s smart, and you two are clearly meant to be in each other’s lives. It’s not always going to be easy, but I think it’s worth it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded. “We’re just… happy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smirked, clearly not convinced, but didn’t press further. “I’ll take your word for it. Now, let’s get back to work. I still need to finish my analysis of Stravinsky’s <em>Rite of Spring,</em> and I’m pretty sure I’m going to lose my mind if I don’t make some progress. And as much as I’d love to keep discussing your love life, I think we’re both here to get some thesis work done. And I want to see you graduate, so… focus!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, turning back to her own work. “Agreed. Let’s make some progress before we both go crazy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They both returned to their respective theses, the comforting sound of pencils and pens scratching on paper filling the space between them. For the first time in a while, Rio felt completely at ease, her focus sharp, her thoughts clear. Everything felt right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha stood at the front of the classroom, lecturing on the complexities of post-war poetry, her mind wandered just a little. She had been feeling a subtle shift in the air around her and Rio lately. It was only natural — things between them had become more intense, more real. And despite their efforts to keep their relationship under wraps on campus, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a growing sense of pride whenever she saw Rio in class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced toward Rio, who was sitting in the front row, absorbed in the lecture. Her thoughtful gaze was fixed on Agatha, but for a moment, Agatha noticed a subtle interaction at the edge of her attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A student—one of the quieter ones, who had a tendency to hang around after class asking questions—was leaning a little too close to Rio. Agatha had seen him around before, but today, he seemed to be lingering a bit longer than usual. His smile was easy, almost charming, and he was talking to Rio with an intensity that Agatha could feel even from a distance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, in contrast, was her usual self. Polite, smiling, but distant enough that Agatha could tell she wasn’t engaging in any deeper conversation. And yet, Agatha could see the way the student’s hand brushed the edge of Rio’s desk, the way he leaned closer than was strictly necessary. Agatha couldn’t hear their words, but she could see the look in the student’s eyes, the unspoken intention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small knot of irritation tightened in Agatha’s chest, something she hadn’t expected to feel. It wasn’t just jealousy—it was a protective instinct, one that took her by surprise. Her mind raced briefly: <em>Why did he feel the need to flirt with her? Doesn’t he know she’s taken? And even if she wasn’t she wouldn’t even be interested anyway.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha continued teaching, she found it difficult to focus. Her gaze kept drifting back to Rio, watching for any signs that she was uncomfortable. And though Rio didn’t appear to be upset, Agatha noticed her posture shift slightly, a subtle defensiveness in the way she crossed her arms, and the slight narrowing of her eyes when the student got too close.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was enough for Agatha to take note, to file away in her mind. After class, she would make sure to check in with Rio, see how she was doing, and maybe even offer some space if she needed it. But she wasn’t going to let this pass by without saying something. Not when she knew the effect it had on her, not when she knew how she felt about Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The class ended, but Agatha’s mind kept turning over what had just happened. She felt a slight sense of relief when Rio stood up, but her heart didn’t quite settle until Rio walked toward her after class once all the other students had left, her eyes meeting Agatha’s with that quiet understanding they shared. Agatha closed the door, under the pretense of discussing Rio’s thesis. Agatha’s hand instinctively reached out, grabbing her wrist gently to pull her toward her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. “Everything okay?” she asked, keeping her voice neutral but gentle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked at her with that soft smile of hers, the one that never failed to calm Agatha’s nerves and started very quietly, out of ear of everyone else. “Yeah, just a student asking about the material. I don’t think he was flirting, if that’s what you’re worried about.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, clearly disagreeing, but didn’t miss the way Rio’s lips curled into a small, teasing grin. The tension in her chest slowly loosened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I guess I was just being a little overprotective,” Agatha admitted with a quiet chuckle, feeling the warmth spread across her cheeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged, giving her a knowing look. “I can handle myself,” she said softly. “But I appreciate the concern.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stood there for a moment, the weight of the unspoken between them hanging in the air. It was a mix of relief and the odd, lingering sense of protectiveness that Agatha couldn’t shake. In that moment, though, it felt good to know that Rio was aware of it, that they could talk about it, that it wasn’t something that needed to remain unspoken for long.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled at her, that protective feeling now tempered by affection. “I know. But I still like to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile grew a little wider, and for a moment, it felt like the world outside the classroom didn’t matter. It was just the two of them, as it always should be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine,” Rio assured her, the warmth in her gaze reassuring Agatha that she wasn’t uncomfortable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked at her, a slight question in her eyes, but there was warmth in her gaze. “What’s going on, Agatha?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a deep breath, trying to steady the rush of emotions that had been swirling inside her all class long. “You’re mine, Rio. And I’m not going to let anyone else try anything with you,” she said, her voice low but steady, laced with that same intensity she hadn’t been able to hide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes softened, and she tilted her head slightly, a small, teasing smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “Jealous, huh?” she asked, her voice gentle but amused, as if she could read the emotions coursing through Agatha without needing to hear every word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt the heat rise to her face, the admission tugging at her chest. She hadn’t realized how much it had affected her, how fiercely she felt about Rio—about keeping her close, keeping her safe, and keeping her to herself. “Maybe,” Agatha murmured, “a little.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile widened as she stepped closer, her presence wrapping around Agatha like a warm embrace. “I like it,” she said softly. “I like that you care. It’s kind of… endearing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart fluttered at the softness in Rio’s voice. It was strange to hear her say it like that, to realize that Rio found her jealousy endearing instead of off-putting. It made the whole emotion feel more natural, less of a burden.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I just…” Agatha’s words faltered for a moment, unsure if she should voice the thoughts in her head. But she didn’t need to say much more. The way Rio was looking at her, with that soft, loving gaze, told her everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached up, brushing a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “You don’t have to worry, Agatha,” she said quietly. “I’m here. And I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but smile at that—at the quiet reassurance Rio always seemed to give her, even when she was being protective, even when she felt insecure. Rio knew exactly what to say to calm her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re mine,” Agatha repeated, her voice a little more confident now, as if she was reminding herself as much as she was reaffirming it to Rio. “And no one else gets to have you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile grew, her eyes sparkling with something a little mischievous. “Well, that’s a relief,” she teased, “because I’m pretty sure I’m already taken.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a small laugh, the tension in her chest finally easing as Rio’s words wrapped around her like a warm, comforting blanket. “You’re absolutely right,” she replied, her hand sliding to Rio’s waist. “And I’m not letting go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in, brushing her lips against Agatha’s in a soft, lingering kiss. “Good,” she whispered, pulling back just enough to look Agatha in the eye. “Because I’m not letting go either.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And in that moment, Agatha felt a sense of peace settle over her. It didn’t matter who else might try or what anyone else might think—Rio was hers, and that was all that mattered. And, for the first time in a long time, she felt like she could finally relax into that certainty.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that afternoon, as Rio walked down the hallway between classes, she felt a presence behind her. She turned to see Maya – again -  standing there with an almost casual smile on her face, as though time hadn’t passed and as if things hadn’t ended badly between them years ago, as though she hadn’t been clear enough a few weeks ago when she had asked to stop bothering her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stiffened for a moment, a flicker of discomfort passing through her. It wasn’t the first time Maya had tried to get in touch since their breakup, but it was the first time they’d crossed paths in person since that discussion. Rio had tried to move past the wounds Maya had left, but the way Maya was looking at her now, with that same flirtatious glint in her eye, made her heart twist with a combination of irritation and old scars. Rio’s heart fluttered in an uncomfortable way. Maya had always known how to get under her skin, how to use just the right words to make her second-guess herself. But not anymore. Rio had moved past that version of herself—the one that had fallen for Maya’s charm despite the hurt she’d caused.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya stepped closer, her voice soft but dripping with an all-too-familiar charm. “Hey, Rio,” she said, “It’s been a while. How’ve you been?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s first instinct was to walk away. But the conversation, the memories, they had to be addressed, because apparently, Maya had trouble understanding simple requests. She wasn’t going to let Maya make her feel small or like there was something between them again. She took a deep breath, trying to keep her voice steady, trying not to show the mix of emotions that were threatening to surface.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve been good,” Rio replied coolly, her eyes narrowing slightly. “You should go. I’m not interested in talking. I already told you that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Maya wasn’t deterred. She leaned against the wall, smirking a little as she gave Rio a sideways glance. “Come on, Rio,” she said, her voice suddenly teasing. “You don’t have to be so cold. I know we ended things badly, but we could have some fun again, don’t you think?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s stomach twisted with anger and disbelief. The audacity. She clenched her fists at her sides, her expression hardening. “I’m taken,” she said, her voice sharp, her gaze unwavering. “And I’m very not available for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s eyebrows lifted, a glint of surprise in her eyes. “Oh? You’ve moved on that quickly?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded. “Yes, I have.” She took a breath, trying to push the nerves away. “And I’m not interested in anything you have to say to me, Maya.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya studied her for a moment, her expression unreadable. “So, you’re telling me there’s someone else? That’s… interesting.” She glanced around, almost as if looking for clues, but Rio kept her face neutral, unwilling to give anything more away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t need to explain myself,” Rio said sharply. “I’m happy with where and who I am, and I’m not looking back. Leave me alone, now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Maya didn’t say anything. She looked as though she was processing Rio’s words, but it was hard to tell what she was really thinking. Finally, she let out a short laugh, shaking her head. “Okay, Rio. I get it. I just thought we might have had something left. But I guess not.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded once, firmly, not giving in to the old doubts creeping in. “No. There’s nothing left between us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a frustrated sigh, Maya turned and began to walk away, but not without one last comment. “Well, good luck with your… new thing, Rio. Don’t come crawling back when it doesn’t work out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t reply. She just watched as Maya disappeared down the hallway, feeling a weight lift off her chest as the conversation ended. She felt stronger now, knowing that she had stood her ground.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio turned to leave, she spotted Agatha standing just a few steps down the hallway, standing nearby, her arms crossed and her expression unreadable. Her heart skipped a beat. The fact that Agatha hadn’t intervened made Rio’s stomach tighten with guilt, but at the same time, Agatha’s presence—silent and strong—was a reminder that she didn’t need to prove herself to anyone, especially not to Maya. Agatha knew the truth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry you had to hear that,” Rio said quietly, walking toward her, her voice a little shaky but trying to sound steady. “I didn’t think she would show up again. She just doesn’t know when to quit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave her a small, almost imperceptible smile. “You don’t need to say anything, Rio,” she said softly. “You made it clear. I know who you are, and I know what we have.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed in relief, her body relaxing a little. “I’m just… glad you’re here. I didn’t want her to make it seem like I was still interested. I’m not.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, her hand gently resting on Rio’s arm. “You don’t have to explain yourself,” she said, her tone warm but firm. “You don’t owe her – or me -  anything. And you don’t have to fight for me, either. I already know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled softly at that, feeling the tension ease away. In that moment, Maya’s attempt to intrude on their world seemed small, insignificant. Agatha’s steady presence made everything feel right again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Rio whispered, her voice filled with gratitude. “I’m really glad I have you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha squeezed her arm gently, her gaze filled with warmth and affection. “I’m not going anywhere,” she said, her words soft but full of certainty. Rio’s heart fluttered at the sincerity in Agatha’s voice. She didn’t need to explain anything more to Maya. Agatha already understood her completely. She didn’t need to look back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And with that, Rio knew that no matter who tried to come back into her life—no matter what Maya said—Agatha was the one she was staying with. The only one who mattered. Agatha was her future, and that was exactly what she wanted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of the day felt lighter for Rio. After her encounter with Maya and the quiet reassurance from Agatha, she spent her time focusing on her theses and preparing for the week ahead. But her thoughts often drifted back to Agatha’s touch, her calm presence, and the way she made everything seem manageable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that evening, as Rio settled into her apartment, she found herself staring at her phone, smiling softly at the last message she’d received from Agatha: “Proud of you. Rest tonight, okay? I’ll call you later. Love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words warmed her. She texted back quickly: “Thank you, love you too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as she put her phone down, a knock sounded at her door. Frowning, she padded over and peeked through the peephole. To her surprise, it was Alice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened the door, leaning against the frame. “Hey, Al. Didn’t expect to see you tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice strolled in without waiting for an invitation, as was her habit. She dropped her bag on the nearest chair and flopped onto Rio’s couch. “I figured you’d need some company after what I saw earlier.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow as she closed the door. “What do you mean?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice turned, sitting up straight. “I saw Maya in the hallway. She looked pissed, which can only mean one thing—you told her off.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked. “You’re not wrong. She tried to flirt, but I shut her down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good.” Alice grinned, crossing her arms. “I hope you told her how very unavailable you are now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, I did.” Rio sat down next to her, shrugging lightly. “She’s not my problem anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice studied her for a moment, her grin softening. “You’ve changed, you know. You’re so much more… sure of yourself these days. Is it because of her?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t need to ask who “her” was. She nodded, her lips curving into a smile. “She helps. A lot. But I think I’ve been learning to stand up for myself for a while now. Agatha just… makes me feel safe being me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice reached over, squeezing Rio’s hand. “Good. You deserve that. And honestly, you two are disgustingly cute together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, nudging Alice playfully. “Shut up. You don’t even know half of it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t need to,” Alice replied smugly. “It’s written all over your face every time you talk about her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could respond, her phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her heart skipping a beat when she saw Agatha’s name.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Speak of the devil,” Alice teased, leaning over to peek at the screen. “I’ll leave you two lovebirds to it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but didn’t stop smiling as she answered the call. Alice waved dramatically on her way out, muttering something about how cute they were.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey,” Rio said softly, sinking back into the couch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi,” Agatha’s voice came through warm and familiar. “How are you feeling? I’ve been thinking about you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m good,” Rio replied. “Better, actually. Today turned out alright.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m glad to hear that,” Agatha said, her tone softening. “I wanted to check in. And to tell you how proud I am of you for standing your ground with Maya.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled. “Thank you. It means a lot, hearing that from you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They talked for a while longer, their conversation drifting from serious to light and back again. Agatha had a way of making even the most mundane things feel significant, and Rio found herself holding onto every word. Agatha told her everything about Nicky’s project in science class, and Rio promised she would come over soon to help him and explain what photosynthesis was and how it made the plants better.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally said goodnight, Rio felt lighter than she had in days. Agatha made everything seem simpler, clearer. And no matter what challenges lay ahead—Maya, their secret, or anything else—Rio knew she wasn’t facing them alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The following day brought a new sense of clarity for Rio. She started her morning early, determined to dive into her work with renewed focus. Between her thesis, her dance classes, and her time with Agatha, she felt like she was juggling a lot—but with Agatha’s steady presence in her life, everything felt manageable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she arrived on campus, Rio found herself glancing around for any sign of Maya. Though she didn’t regret standing her ground, the encounter had left her a little wary. Maya was unpredictable, and the last thing Rio wanted was for her to stir up any unnecessary drama, especially with Agatha so close to everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The thought brought a faint smile to Rio’s lips. Agatha<strong>.</strong> Their relationship, though still a secret to most, had been a constant source of comfort and strength. She loved the quiet moments they shared, the stolen glances and fleeting touches that spoke volumes. It made everything worth it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that afternoon, Rio was wrapping up her notes in the library when she got a text from Agatha:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can you stop by my office before you head home? Nothing urgent, just want to see you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved into a smile as she quickly typed back: “On my way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She packed her things and made her way across campus, her heart beating a little faster with each step. When she reached Agatha’s office, the door was slightly ajar, and she could hear the faint rustle of papers inside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio knocked gently before stepping in. Agatha looked up from her desk, her glasses perched on the bridge of her nose. The sight made Rio’s heart flutter—it was such a small, simple detail, but it was so quintessentially Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey,” Rio said softly, closing the door behind her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression brightened, a smile spreading across her lips. “Hey yourself. How was your day?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged, setting her bag down in the corner. “Productive, I guess. And seeing you makes it better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, standing up and crossing the room to meet her. She wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist, pulling her close. “Flatterer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Only for you,” Rio teased, her tone light, though her eyes betrayed the depth of her affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed like that for a moment, wrapped in each other’s warmth. Then Agatha pulled back slightly, her expression turning more serious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How are you, really?” she asked, her eyes searching Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment before answering. “I’m okay. Better than I was. I think… things are starting to settle again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s face. “Good. I’ve been thinking about you a lot since… everything with Maya.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, resting her forehead against Agatha’s shoulder. “It’s fine. I’m fine. She doesn’t matter anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Agatha murmured, her hand rubbing soothing circles on Rio’s back. “But you matter to me. And I’ll always make sure you’re okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled back just enough to look up at her, a soft smile playing on her lips. “You’re too good to me, you know that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not possible,” Agatha replied, her tone warm but firm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed together a little longer, their conversation drifting to lighter topics. Agatha shared a funny story about Nicky’s antics the night before, and Rio laughed until her sides hurt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When it was time for Rio to leave, Agatha kissed her softly before opening the door. “Text me when you get home, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will,” Rio promised, her heart full as she stepped back into the hallway.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p> </p>

She hadn’t expected much—a reminder about library hours or a department circular, maybe—but as she unfolded the thick, cream-colored paper and read the header, her heart skipped a beat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Dear Ms. Vidal,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>We are delighted to invite you to present your research at the upcoming Regional Literature Scholars’ Conference, an event dedicated to celebrating and showcasing the groundbreaking work of the most promising doctoral candidates in the field of literary studies.

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her eyes skimmed over the rest, but the words barely registered. She was holding an official invitation to one of the most prestigious academic events for students like her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stared at the letter for a moment, her mind racing. She’d heard about the conference—only a handful of PhD students from each university were invited each year, chosen for the promise their research showed and the impact it could have on the field.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her first instinct was to text Agatha, but the thought of seeing her reaction in person was too enticing. She tucked the letter into her bag, grabbed her books, and made her way to Agatha’s office.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked up as Rio stepped through the door, a soft smile already forming. “To what do I owe this lovely surprise?” she asked, leaning back in her chair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip, trying and failing to hide her excitement. “I got something today,” she said, pulling the letter from her bag and handing it over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes flicked over the paper, her smile growing wider with each sentence she read. By the time she reached the end, she looked up, her expression brimming with pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” she said, her voice soft and full of warmth, “this is incredible.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s just an invitation,” Rio said, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “I haven’t even presented yet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Just an invitation?” Agatha repeated, shaking her head. She set the letter down carefully on her desk and stood, crossing the room to close the door before pulling Rio into a tight embrace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is a big deal,” Agatha said, her voice low as she kissed Rio’s temple. “Only a handful of students get invited each year. It’s an acknowledgment of how brilliant your work is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed under Agatha’s praise. “You helped a lot, you know,” she murmured. “I wouldn’t have gotten here without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled back just enough to look into Rio’s eyes. “Don’t you dare downplay your own hard work. This is <em>your</em>achievement, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They spent the rest of the afternoon discussing the conference. Agatha helped Rio brainstorm how to structure her presentation, offering suggestions while giving her space to make the final decisions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you think you’ll attend?” Rio asked as they worked, glancing up at Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for a moment before nodding. “I am invited every year to be with the faculty. But I can just opt out this year. If you want me there, I’ll be there. But I don’t want to put any extra pressure on you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled. “I think I’d like it if you were there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Then it’s settled,” Agatha said with a grin and a kiss on Rio’s nose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio left Agatha’s office that day, she felt a renewed sense of confidence. The conference wasn’t just an opportunity to share her research—it was a chance to prove to herself that she belonged in the world of academia. And knowing Agatha would be there, quietly cheering her on, made it all the more special.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The days leading up to the conference felt like an eternity for Rio. The weight of presenting her work, of standing before a room full of scholars and peers, pressed heavily on her chest. Every time she thought about it—what to say, how to say it, the inevitable questions—her stomach twisted into a knot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By Monday, she’d taken over her small apartment with a flurry of notes, drafts, and annotated texts. The sound of her pacing echoed through the space as she rehearsed her presentation out loud, pausing frequently to rewrite entire sections.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha called that evening, Rio barely had the energy to answer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How’s my favorite future academic star doing?” Agatha asked, her tone light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned in response. “A mess. This is going to be a disaster. What if I stumble over my words? What if someone asks a question I can’t answer? What if—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha interrupted gently, her voice steady. “Take a breath. This is <em>not</em> going to be a disaster.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t know that,” Rio muttered, collapsing onto her couch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do,” Agatha replied firmly. “You’re brilliant, and you’ve put so much work into this. You have nothing to prove to anyone but yourself. This isn’t about being perfect—it’s about sharing your perspective. That’s what conferences are for.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a small, shaky laugh. “You make it sound so easy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s not easy,” Agatha said. “But you’re not alone. I’ll be there, remember? And you’ll do beautifully.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On Wednesday, Agatha stopped by Rio’s apartment after class with a bag of groceries and a determined glint in her eye.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re eating properly, right?” she asked as she set the bag down on the counter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow. “Define ‘properly.’”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes affectionately. “Sit. I’ll make us dinner. You need a break.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio obeyed, slumping into a chair as Agatha moved around the kitchen with practiced ease. The smell of pasta and fresh garlic soon filled the air, and Rio felt some of the tension ease from her shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they ate, Agatha reached across the table to take Rio’s hand. “I’ve been in your shoes,” she said softly. “And I know how scary it feels. But I also know that you’re ready for this. Trust yourself, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio squeezed her hand, a flicker of gratitude warming her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By Friday night, Rio was a bundle of nerves again. She’d gone over her presentation so many times that the words had started to lose meaning, and yet she still felt unprepared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha came over late that evening, armed with her usual calm and a bottle of tea Rio liked. They sat on the couch, Rio curled into Agatha’s side as she vented her worries.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What if I freeze up?” she whispered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Then take a breath and start again,” Agatha said. “You’re allowed to be human.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What if they think my research is shallow?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They won’t,” Agatha said with certainty. “Your work is nuanced and thoughtful. Anyone who hears you speak will see that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a long sigh, leaning further into Agatha’s warmth. “I don’t know what I’d do without you,” she murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed a kiss to her temple. “You’d be just as brilliant,” she said softly. “But I’m glad I get to be here for you anyway.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On Saturday morning, Rio stood in front of her open closet, staring blankly at the array of clothes. Nothing felt right. Her usual style—casual and slightly eclectic—didn’t exactly scream “serious academic.” But the idea of dressing too formally made her feel like she was wearing someone else’s skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Why is this so hard?” she muttered to herself, pulling out a navy blazer and holding it up to the light. “Do I look like a professor? Or like I’m playing dress-up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tossed it onto the bed with a sigh, then pulled out a flowy forest green blouse. It was one of her favorites—soft, comfortable, and a little bold. “This says ‘confident,’ right?” she mused, eyeing it critically.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, and she glanced at the screen: <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Still staring at your closet?” Agatha’s amused voice greeted her when she picked up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How did you know?” Rio asked, flopping onto the bed next to her growing pile of discarded options.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Because you’re overthinking,” Agatha said warmly. “And because you told me you were going to pick out your outfit this morning, which means you’ve probably been at it for hours.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned. “Nothing feels right. I want to look professional, but not boring. Smart, but not like I’m trying too hard. And also, I need to feel like <em>me</em>. Is that too much to ask?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly. “Not at all. What are you considering?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced at the mess of clothing. “Uh, everything I own, apparently. Right now, I’ve got a blazer, a green blouse, and some black pants. But I’m not sure if it’s too…safe?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That sounds perfect,” Agatha said. “Professional but with a bit of personality. And you’ll feel more confident if you’re comfortable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated. “You think so?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know so,” Agatha assured her. “Besides, the real showstopper isn’t the outfit—it’s you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a smile tug at her lips. “You’re biased.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Absolutely,” Agatha said without missing a beat. “But I’m also right. Wear the green blouse—it’s one of my favorites on you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blushed, grateful Agatha couldn’t see her reaction through the phone. “Okay, green blouse it is. Thanks, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Anytime,” Agatha said warmly. “Now finish getting ready so you can focus on being brilliant.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hanging up, Rio stood and held the blouse up again, seeing it in a new light. She paired it with the black blazer and black pants, slipping on her boots for a final touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Looking in the mirror, she adjusted the collar of the blouse and smoothed down the blazer. It was simple but sharp, and it felt like her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For the first time that day, she smiled. “Okay, can do it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Saturday afternoon arrived, Rio still felt nervous, but Agatha’s steady presence had given her the confidence to face the day. As she stood in front of the mirror, adjusting her blazer, she caught a glimpse of herself—poised and ready.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha appeared behind her, circling her arms around her waist and placing her chin on her shoulder. “You’ve got this,” she said simply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And for the first time that week, Rio believed her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The conference room buzzed with a low hum of conversations, the air heavy with academic anticipation. Rio adjusted the lanyard around her neck for the hundredth time, her fingers fidgeting with the plastic badge that displayed her name and the title of her thesis. She was nervous, but she reminded herself that she’d prepared for this. She <em>belonged</em> here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her gaze swept over the growing audience as she stood near the side of the stage, half-hidden by a thick curtain. The conference room was filling quickly, and familiar faces were scattered among the crowd.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her heart skipped when she spotted Lilia sitting toward the middle, her warm, encouraging smile visible even from this distance. Next to her, Alice and Jen waved enthusiastically, clearly more excited than nervous on her behalf. Rio chuckled softly, grateful for their presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then her eyes drifted toward the back of the room, where the professors stood in a tight-knit group, chatting amongst themselves. Agatha was there, poised and elegant in a tailored suit, her sharp intellect evident even in her posture. For a moment, Rio felt her nerves spike again. It wasn’t just presenting her work that made her anxious—it was presenting it <em>in front of Agatha</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As if sensing her gaze, Agatha looked up and their eyes met. A soft, reassuring smile curved Agatha’s lips, and Rio felt a wave of warmth replace her nerves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before she could fully process it, Agatha excused herself from the group and began weaving her way toward Rio. Her heart thudded in her chest as she realized Agatha wasn’t stopping at the edge of the stage. Instead, she slipped behind the curtain, finding Rio in the quiet, secluded corner where she stood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re going to be brilliant,” Agatha said softly, her voice filled with conviction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched. “I—thank you. I just—seeing you here, with all of them…it’s intimidating.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, her hands finding Rio’s. “You’ve worked so hard for this. No one in that room knows this material better than you. Trust yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes darted to the curtain, nerves flaring at the thought of being seen. “We shouldn’t—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No one can see us,” Agatha murmured, her thumbs gently brushing over Rio’s knuckles. “And I couldn’t let you go up there without telling you how proud I am of you. Not as your professor, but as…me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled. “Agatha…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, her lips brushing Rio’s in a brief but tender kiss. “You’ve got this. And no matter what, I love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s throat tightened with emotion, and she gave a small nod. “I love you, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her hands lingering for a moment before she stepped back. “Now go out there and show them why you’re one of the most promising minds in the field.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio straightened, her nerves momentarily forgotten in the warmth of Agatha’s words. With one last look, Agatha slipped back out toward the professors’ group, leaving Rio alone to take a deep, steadying breath.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The conference hall hummed with focused energy as Rio took her place at the podium, her notes laid out neatly before her. She gripped the edges of the lectern briefly, grounding herself. The spotlight illuminated her face, and for a moment, she couldn’t see past the bright light and the expectant silence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then she remembered Agatha’s words—<em>You’ve got this.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her heart steadied. Her voice, though quiet at first, found its rhythm as she began presenting her thesis work on death, mortality, and timelessness in Modernist poetry. Rio’s passion for her topic radiated as she deftly navigated complex theories, weaving in analyses of texts and poignant quotes that painted a vivid picture of her research.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From her vantage point among the professors, Agatha watched with a growing sense of pride. Rio had completely captivated the audience. Her confidence built with every word, her explanations clear, thoughtful, and brimming with insight. She moved seamlessly through her presentation, fielding questions from the panel of professors with poise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At one point, a particularly challenging question was posed by a senior professor—an intimidating figure known for cutting remarks. Agatha tensed, but Rio didn’t falter. With a small smile, Rio responded with a nuanced answer that not only addressed the question but reframed it entirely, earning an approving nod from the professor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest swelled with pride. She couldn’t help the small smile tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Toward the end of the presentation, Rio spoke about how literature reflects humanity’s attempts to reconcile with mortality, her words tinged with both academic rigor and personal resonance. She glanced briefly toward the audience, catching sight of Lilia, Alice, and Jen sitting rapt. Lilia smiled warmly, and Alice gave an encouraging thumbs-up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, as Rio’s gaze drifted to the professors’ section, her eyes briefly met Agatha’s. Though it was a fleeting moment, it grounded her even further. The corners of Rio’s mouth lifted slightly before she turned back to her closing remarks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she finished, the room erupted in applause. Rio stepped away from the podium, a faint blush creeping up her neck as she returned to her seat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t clap with the same enthusiasm as Lilia or Alice—it wouldn’t have been professional—but her subtle smile and the pride gleaming in her eyes spoke volumes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After the conference concluded, Agatha lingered with the other professors as Rio found herself surrounded by her small but dedicated cheering section. Alice practically threw herself at Rio in a hug, squeezing her tightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You were <em>brilliant</em>!” Alice exclaimed, pulling back with a huge grin. “I mean, I always knew you were smart, but that? That was a whole other level!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, her cheeks flushed from both the praise and lingering adrenaline. “Thanks, Al.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia stepped closer, her expression soft and proud. She didn’t rush in for a hug but placed a gentle hand on Rio’s arm. “You’ve come so far, my girl. You’ve done something incredible today,” she said. “You held that room in the palm of your hand. I couldn’t be prouder of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a lump rise in her throat, overwhelmed by the warmth in Lilia’s words. “It means so much to have you here. All of you,” she said, glancing between Lilia, Alice, and Jen, who was giving her a quieter but equally supportive smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed. “Thank you. I—thank you all for coming. It means the world to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Honestly, I don’t know how you didn’t combust,” Alice said, her voice low but teasing. “Having Agatha—sorry, <em>Dr. Harkness</em>—watching you like that? She’s intense. I’d have melted.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip to suppress a laugh, especially when she caught the pointed look Alice gave her. She knew exactly what Alice was doing, but thankfully, Lilia stepped in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s proud of you too,” Lilia said gently. “She couldn’t stop smiling.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, catching onto the subtle undercurrent, raised an eyebrow but didn’t comment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As if summoned by their conversation, Agatha appeared, walking toward the group with her characteristic grace and authority. Alice straightened immediately, smoothing her shirt like she was trying to make herself more presentable. When Agatha reached them, she placed a hand on Rio’s arm—subtle but grounding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness!” Alice said, a little too loudly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ms. Vidal,” Agatha said, her gaze sweeping over Rio warmly. “You were exceptional today. I couldn’t be prouder of how you carried yourself, and to be your supervisor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The gentle emphasis she placed on <em>prouder</em> made Rio’s heart skip a beat. Her smile widened, soft and private, meant just for Agatha even in the presence of others.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio replied, her voice soft and full of meaning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, standing close enough to catch the subtle exchange, hid her smirk. Alice, meanwhile, looked between them with barely concealed curiosity, her lips twitching as if she were holding back a comment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You should celebrate,” Agatha continued, her tone professional but kind. “This is an important milestone. I’ll leave you to it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, she gave the group a polite nod and stepped away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice waited a beat before whispering loudly, “I mean, <em>we</em> know what that look was, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia gave her a sharp look. “Alice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What?” Alice grinned, turning back to Rio. “Look, I’m just saying—it’s really nice to see <em>someone</em> appreciate you as much as you deserve.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t stop the smile tugging at her lips. “You promised not to say anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I didn’t say anything,” Alice replied, holding up her hands. “Just… implied. Heavily.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed softly, pulling Rio into a brief hug. “Ignore her. You were more than great today, and that’s what matters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Lilia,” Rio said, her voice quieter now, touched by the support.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they began to make plans for an early celebratory dinner, Rio glanced over to where Agatha stood speaking with some of her colleagues. Though she was keeping her distance, Rio could see the faintest hint of pride still lingering on Agatha’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After the conference wrapped up, Lilia and Alice insisted on taking Rio out to celebrate. Jen had to leave for a lab commitment, but she’d made Rio promise to meet up later in the week for another toast. Lilia had immediately suggested a cozy little bar nearby that she frequented with some of her fellow book-clubbers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The place had an inviting, laid-back atmosphere—low lighting, dark wood furniture, and the faint hum of jazz in the background. The three of them settled into a corner booth, Alice sliding in first with an exaggerated flourish.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“To our resident genius,” Alice declared, lifting her glass of cider after their drinks arrived. “You absolutely crushed it today, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blushed, fiddling with the rim of her glass. “Thanks, Al. But it wasn’t that big of a deal—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It <em>was</em> a big deal,” Lilia interjected, her tone firm but warm. “You presented months—no, <em>years</em>—of work to a room full of academics, held your ground during the questions, and left them all impressed. You deserve to celebrate this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio ducked her head, the familiar warmth of Lilia’s unwavering support filling her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, fine,” she said, lifting her drink with a small grin. “To celebrating.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And to you being brilliant,” Alice added, tapping her glass against theirs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They sipped their drinks, the atmosphere light and easy. Alice kept the mood lively, recounting a story from one of her band’s recent gigs that had gone hilariously wrong.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So then, Jen’s amp just dies in the middle of the set,” Alice said, gesturing animatedly. “She’s standing there like, ‘This is fine,’ while I’m trying not to laugh my ass off because she’s <em>glaring</em> at me like it’s my fault. Meanwhile, Rio’s over there in the corner, completely unfazed, just keeping the rhythm going like a champ. I swear, she’s the only reason we didn’t lose the entire song.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Someone has to hold it together,” Rio said with a shrug, her lips twitching in amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s because you’re secretly the most responsible of all of us,” Alice teased.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled, taking a sip of her drink. “I’ve known that for years.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening wore on, Alice eventually turned the conversation back to the conference.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, but real talk—how did it feel?” she asked, leaning forward on her elbows.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Terrifying at first,” Rio admitted. “But then, once I started talking, it kind of… clicked. Like, I was so focused on explaining everything that I forgot to be nervous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You looked completely in control,” Lilia said. “Confident. The room was hanging on your every word.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smirked. “I bet <em>someone</em> was hanging a little harder than the rest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a look, but the comment made her heart flutter anyway. Agatha’s pride and quiet support had meant the world to her today.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia stepped in to redirect the conversation. “So, what’s next for you, Rio? What’s the next step after today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio considered the question, her fingers tracing the condensation on her glass. “More writing, mostly. I got some good feedback during the Q&amp;A that I can work into my next chapter. And now that I’ve presented, I feel like I have a better grasp on how to structure the rest of the dissertation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, her gaze steady and encouraging. “You’re on the right track. Just don’t forget to take breaks when you need them. You’ve earned it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice grinned, finishing her drink. “And when you’re done being academic, come jam with us. You know you miss it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, the tension she’d been carrying all week finally melting away. Sitting there with Alice’s playful energy and Lilia’s steady presence, she felt deeply grateful for the people in her life.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From where she was sitting on the right, Alice slung an arm around Rio’s shoulders. “For real, though, I’m so proud of you. I knew you’d kill it today.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Al,” Rio said softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, her expression gentle. “I’m proud of you too, my sweet and smart girl.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening went on, Rio glanced at the time and realized she’d need to head out soon. She’d promised Agatha they’d celebrate privately, and she was looking forward to winding down the day with her. She set down her glass and cleared her throat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I should probably get going,” she said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice immediately perked up, her curiosity piqued. “Oh? And where’s the genius rushing off to?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, but she knew there was no point in pretending. Alice already knew, and Lilia wasn’t likely to judge. “I have plans with Agatha,” she admitted, a little sheepishly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s grin spread wide across her face. “Plans, huh?” she said, with the kind of exaggerated insinuation that made Rio immediately regret saying anything. “Very mysterious. Very adult.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alice, don’t start—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Alice was already on a roll, waggling her eyebrows as she continued. “You gonna bring out the wine and candles? Dim the lights? Ooh, maybe some poetry readings for the occasion?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alice,” Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands as her cheeks burned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, who had been quietly amused up to this point, decided it was time to step in. She set her drink down and leveled Alice with a faux-stern look. “Alice, that’s enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice threw up her hands in mock surrender but was still grinning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then Lilia turned to Rio, her expression softening into something more affectionate but no less mischievous. “Rio, my dear, I’m very happy that you’re happy,” she said warmly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio started to smile, but then Lilia continued, her tone pointedly maternal, “But I absolutely do not need to hear about your ‘special plans’ with your girlfriend.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia!” Rio exclaimed, her embarrassment reaching its peak. She felt like her face was on fire.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice was cackling now, practically falling off her chair. “Oh my god, <em>this</em> is the best thing I’ve heard all week.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t encourage her!” Rio pleaded, throwing a napkin at Alice in a half-hearted attempt at retaliation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia simply gave Rio a knowing smile, patted her hand, and then stood up to fetch her coat. “You’d better get going,” she said, her tone teasing but kind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, yeah,” Rio muttered, trying to gather what was left of her dignity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they all walked out of the bar together, Alice nudged Rio with her elbow. “Seriously, though, have fun tonight, Miss Genius. You deserve it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the small, grateful smile that crept onto her face. She had to admit, even with the teasing, it felt good to have people who cared about her so much.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And when she finally made it to Agatha’s house, where her lover was probably waiting with a bottle of wine and that look in her eyes that made Rio’s heart skip a beat, she knew the teasing had been worth it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled up to Agatha’s house, her heart already racing at the thought of seeing her. She stepped out of the car, clutching a small bottle of champagne she’d grabbed on her way over, and walked up to the door. Before she could knock, it swung open, and there was Agatha, leaning casually against the doorframe, her lips already curling into a knowing smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right on time,” Agatha teased, stepping aside to let Rio in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but grin back. “You know I wouldn’t miss this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed the door behind her and, without a word, pulled Rio in for a kiss. It was slow and languid, the kind of kiss that made Rio forget everything else—her nerves about the conference, the teasing from Alice, all of it melted away as Agatha’s hands slid around her waist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Congratulations, my love,” Agatha murmured against her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio whispered, her voice catching slightly. The warmth in Agatha’s tone always made her feel like the most important person in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They moved to the living room, where Agatha poured them each a glass of champagne in her fancy flutes. They sat close, their knees touching, talking in low, hushed tones about the conference. Agatha listened intently as Rio recounted the highlights, her eyes never leaving Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You were brilliant. Just like I knew you would be,” Agatha said, taking a sip of her wine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, leaning into her. “I still can’t believe it went so well. It’s like… surreal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Believe it,” Agatha said, reaching out to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Rio’s ear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a while, Rio noticed a record player in the corner of the room. “You have a record player?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course. Who do you take me for?” Agatha said with a smirk, already moving to select a record.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The soft hum of a jazz tune filled the room, warm and inviting. Agatha turned back to Rio and extended a hand. “Dance with me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked in surprise but smiled, placing her hand in Agatha’s. “Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled her to her feet and into her arms. They swayed together, their movements unhurried, as though time had slowed just for them. The music curled around them like a blanket, and Rio let her head rest against Agatha’s shoulder, her eyes fluttering shut.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a moment, Agatha stepped back slightly and spun Rio, making her laugh. When Rio returned to her arms, their foreheads touched, and they both stilled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You make me so happy,” Rio whispered, her voice soft but certain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her thumb brushing lightly over Rio’s cheek. “I didn’t know I could feel like this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stood there, swaying gently, foreheads still pressed together, the music playing in the background. The world outside didn’t matter—nothing did except the way they fit together so perfectly in that moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s voice was barely above a whisper when she said, “I can’t believe this is real.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, her lips brushing Rio’s. “It is, my love,” she murmured. “It’s as real as it gets.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as they danced and kissed and held each other close, the only thing they could both feel was the overwhelming, beautiful certainty of being exactly where they were meant to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the song shifted to a slower, softer melody, the room seemed to envelop them in its warmth. Rio rested her head against Agatha’s shoulder again, her body swaying in sync with Agatha’s. For a brief moment, the world felt like it had narrowed down to just the two of them—until a small voice broke the peaceful bubble.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Both Rio and Agatha froze, pulling apart slightly, and turned toward the doorway. Nicky stood there, his little face sleepily peering around the corner, rubbing his eyes. The sight of him, so unguarded and innocent, tugged at their hearts in the softest way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, buddy,” Agatha said, her voice filled with affection as she stepped toward him. “Did we wake you up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded, but a small, sleepy smile tugged at his lips. “I couldn’t sleep.” His eyes wandered between them, still groggy, but there was curiosity and something deeper in his gaze. “Can I dance too?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio and Agatha exchanged a look, both of them smiling at the idea. Agatha extended her hand to Nicky, her voice warm and inviting. “Of course you can, sweetheart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shuffled forward, his small hand slipping into Agatha’s. Rio bent down to lift him into her arms, his small frame resting against her chest as she joined Agatha. Together, the three of them moved in perfect harmony, Agatha guiding Rio and Nicky as they danced, Rio holding the boy close as they twirled slowly in the soft glow of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, the sound light and carefree, and Rio smiled at how right it felt. There they were, the three of them, dancing together like a little family—together in a way that felt unspoken but undeniably true.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re both the best,” Nicky mumbled, his head resting against Rio’s shoulder, eyes fluttering as if he might fall asleep again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her arm wrapped around both of them. “And you’re our favorite little dancer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The music swirled around them, gentle and comforting, as they moved in a quiet rhythm, the bond between them growing stronger in that small, precious moment. In the quiet of Agatha’s living room, there was no need for words. </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later, after they tucked Nicky back into bed, Rio and Agatha lingered in the hallway for a moment. The soft glow of the lamps in the living room illuminated the space around them, casting long shadows across the walls. They stood there, neither of them quite ready to break the fragile stillness of the evening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached for Rio’s hand, intertwining their fingers gently. “You were amazing today, love,” she said, her voice low, filled with the warmth of pride and affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled softly, her heart swelling at Agatha’s words. “I couldn’t have done it without your support. You’re always there for me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, brushing a strand of hair away from Rio’s face, her touch tender. “And I always will be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They shared a quiet, lingering kiss that quickly deepened, slow and intoxicating, a promise of everything they had both been holding back. By the time they finally broke apart, Rio’s lips were flushed, her breath uneven, her body already attuned to Agatha’s in a way that left her aching.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took her hand, lacing their fingers together as she led Rio toward the bedroom. The air between them crackled with unspoken words, anticipation humming between their bodies like an electric current. When Agatha shut the door behind them, the sound was soft, but final—sealing them away from the outside world, from hesitation, from anything that could pull them apart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart pounded. This was it. The moment she had imagined too many times to count, but none of those thoughts, none of those fantasies, compared to the way Agatha was looking at her now—dark, full of heat and tenderness all at once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I want this,” Rio whispered, her voice steady despite the tremor in her body, the vulnerability that came with laying herself bare like this. “I want you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, slow and deliberate, until there was nothing between them but heat and expectation. “Are you sure?” she murmured, one hand lifting to brush her fingers along Rio’s jaw, tilting her face up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, holding Agatha’s gaze. “I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A slow smile curved Agatha’s lips, something wicked and reverent all at once. Then she kissed Rio again, deeper this time, hungrier. A kiss that spoke of restraint finally slipping, of a need that had been simmering for far too long. Rio felt herself melt into it, hands threading into Agatha’s long, dark hair, pulling her impossibly closer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their bodies pressed flush against each other, warmth spilling between them, and Rio sighed into Agatha’s mouth when deft fingers found the hem of her shirt, pushing it up, up, until Agatha’s hands could splay against bare skin, exploring with deliberate slowness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They undressed each other piece by piece, taking their time, every movement a quiet act of worship. There was no rush—only the burning need to feel, to savor, to take in every inch of each other. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled Rio down on the bed with her, the younger woman falling on top of Agatha, her hands tangled in long brown tresses, before her mouth left Agatha’s mouth to move down her neck. Agatha quickly flipped them over, taking Rio in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips traced a path down Rio’s neck, slow and teasing, tasting, learning, branding every inch of her skin. Rio’s nails pressed into Agatha’s back as her breath hitched, her body arching instinctively into every touch, every kiss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“God, Agatha,” she breathed, her voice wrecked with longing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked against her throat, her voice a seductive whisper against Rio’s skin. “Patience, love. I want to take my time with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And she did. She unraveled Rio with slow, reverent touches, with kisses that lingered too long and not long enough all at once. She traced every inch of her, learning what made her gasp, what made her tremble, what made her whisper Agatha’s name like a prayer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands were gentle as they explored each other, but there was a sense of purpose in every touch. Rio responded in kind, her fingers tracing the lines of Agatha’s skin, memorizing every inch, every detail.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They moved together in sync, bodies pressing, hands gripping, mouths searching. It was overwhelming in the best way—every sigh, every gasp, every whispered name a testament to the depth of what lay between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally came together, it was as though the world outside had ceased to exist. In the quiet of Agatha’s bedroom, there was only them—two souls finally intertwining, fully and completely. It was soft, intimate, and full of love. The feeling of Agatha’s body against hers, the way their breaths mingled in the space between them, was something Rio had longed for, something she had never thought would be possible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just about the physical connection, though. It was about trust, about love, about finally being able to be completely vulnerable with someone who cherished and accepted her, flaws and all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha held her close through it all, guiding her through wave after wave of sensation, until Rio was clinging to her, her body shuddering with release, her breath stolen. Agatha kissed her through it, swallowed every sound, every plea, every whispered devotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They collapsed against each other afterward, limbs tangled, bodies damp with sweat and still thrumming from the aftermath. Rio rested her head against Agatha’s chest, listening to the steady rhythm of her heartbeat, grounding herself in the warmth of her lover’s arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed a slow, lingering kiss to the top of Rio’s head. “You are incredible,” she murmured, voice thick with emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled against her skin, her fingers tracing lazy circles on Agatha’s side. “I love you,” she whispered, letting the words fall freely, because they felt too big to keep inside any longer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tightened her hold, pressing their bodies closer together, as if she never wanted to let go. “I love you too. More than you can imagine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed wrapped up in each other, their bodies a tangle of limbs and heat, the room still heavy with the scent of them, the memory of what they had just shared. There was no need for words now—just quiet touches, lazy kisses, the certainty that this was only the beginning of something neither of them would ever walk away from.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time sleep claimed them, Rio was still pressed against Agatha, her body utterly spent, her heart impossibly full. And when the morning came, they were still tangled together, as if even sleep hadn’t been strong enough to pull them apart.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p>

  <em>Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children, </em>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">                  (T.S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning light filtered softly through the curtains, casting a warm glow over the room. Agatha woke slowly, her body still tangled with Rio’s. For a moment, she stayed there, just breathing in the familiar scent of Rio’s hair, savoring the feeling of having her so close. The weight of her in her arms, the soft rise and fall of her chest, was a kind of peace Agatha had never fully understood until now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hair had fallen across her face, and Agatha gently brushed it away, careful not to disturb the delicate stillness of the moment. Rio’s face was relaxed, her features soft in sleep, the tension of the previous days seeming to melt away. Agatha couldn’t help but smile, her heart swelling with something she couldn’t quite define, but it felt like home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p class="p1">For a long, unbroken moment, Agatha simply held Rio close, her arms wrapped around her like she was something precious, something irreplaceable. Her fingers moved with deliberate tenderness, tracing the soft contours of Rio’s shoulder and the curve of her bare back. It was as though she was committing every inch of her to memory—the warmth of her skin, the way her muscles shifted beneath her touch, the faint rise and fall of her breathing. There was a stillness between them, the kind that only came from being completely in sync, completely safe.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha’s hand paused at the small of Rio’s back, her palm resting there as if to anchor her. She pressed a soft kiss to the top of Rio’s head, breathing in the faint trace of her shampoo, mingled with the subtle warmth of her own unique scent. It was intoxicating, grounding, and comforting all at once—a reminder that this moment was real, that Rio was here, with her, now.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio nestled closer, her head resting against Agatha’s collarbone, her breath a gentle rhythm that Agatha matched without even realizing it. The connection between them felt almost tangible, like a thread weaving their souls together in the quiet of the room. Neither spoke, neither moved to break the spell. Instead, they remained like that, wrapped in a stillness that carried more weight and meaning than any words ever could.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eventually, Rio stirred, a soft sigh escaping her lips. Her eyes fluttered open slowly, the world taking a few moments to come into focus. When her gaze landed on Agatha, a sleepy smile tugged at her lips, and she nuzzled closer, pressing her forehead against Agatha’s chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning,” Rio mumbled, her voice husky from sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning,” Agatha replied softly, her fingers gently grazing Rio’s arm. “How are you feeling?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good,” Rio answered with a contented sigh. “This is… this is nice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, brushing a light kiss to the top of Rio’s head. “It is, isn’t it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed like that for a while, not saying much, just enjoying the quiet, the warmth, the connection. Agatha knew it wouldn’t last forever—there were always other things waiting outside this little bubble they’d created—but for now, she wanted nothing more than to stay right where she was, with Rio in her arms, her heart filled with a peace she hadn’t known she was missing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a while, Rio stretched, her body arching slightly as she woke up fully. Agatha smiled at the sight, a quiet affection in her gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I should get up,” Rio said, yawning as she sat up, her body still a little sleepy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Only if you want to,” Agatha teased, reaching out to tug her back down. “I’m happy right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ok, I’ll stay a bit longer,” Rio replied, snuggling closer into Agatha’s chest, before looking at her with a knowing smile. “I’m not going anywhere, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And for a moment, as they lay together in bed, the weight of those words settled between them. For the first time in what seemed like forever in her life, Agatha believed it completely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The warmth of the bed still clung to their bare skin, the lingering heat of the night before wrapping around them like a second set of sheets. Rio was still sprawled against the pillows, her body deliciously tangled with Agatha’s, her breath slow and steady against Agatha’s neck. Agatha let herself indulge for just a moment longer, running her fingers lazily down Rio’s spine, feeling the way she shivered beneath her touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But then—</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A sound.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Soft, familiar, but unmistakable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A sleepy murmur, the shifting of small feet against the floor in the next room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha froze, her instincts kicking in immediately. She knew Nicky’s routine well; every morning, without fail, he would wander into her room, looking for her in that sleepy, half-awake way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We should probably get dressed,” Agatha murmured, her voice low as she shifted her gaze to the door. Her words carried a mix of urgency and amusement, knowing it was only a matter of moment before Nicky appeared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A slow, teasing grin spread across Rio’s face as she glanced down at their very, very naked bodies.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I suppose we should,” she admitted, though there was nothing in her voice that suggested urgency. If anything, she was enjoying this just a little too much. “Not sure how we’d explain this to him just yet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, the sound warm and soft, as she reached up to brush a strand of Rio’s dark hair away from her face. “Not today,” she said with a grin. “And hopefully not for at least ten years.” Her tone was joking, but the hint of maternal panic lurking beneath made Rio laugh again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, brushing her lips against Agatha’s jaw, her voice dropping into a sultry murmur. “Ten years? You’re optimistic.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a breathy chuckle, but another noise from Nicky’s room had her snapping back into full Mama mode. She sat up quickly, her movements brisk, reaching for the robe draped over the chair beside the bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned dramatically as Agatha pulled away, flopping back against the pillows. “This is tragic,” she sighed, stretching in a way that was entirely intentional, the sheet slipping just enough to expose the curve of her waist, the swell of her chest. “I had such big plans for this morning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shot her a dry look as she tied her robe around her waist. “If those plans involved traumatizing my child, I’m going to have to veto them.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio only smirked. “You’re no fun.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re impossible.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, Agatha couldn’t resist. She leaned down, capturing Rio’s lips in one last, slow, lingering kiss, savoring the way Rio melted against her, the way she sighed into the kiss as if she wasn’t about to let her go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha finally pulled back, Rio gave her a wicked little smile. “I’ll be right behind you,” she promised, though the glint in her eye suggested she wasn’t in a hurry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha huffed, shaking her head fondly as she turned toward the dresser, grabbing the first shirt and pair of shorts she could find and tossing them unceremoniously onto the bed. There were some things a six-year-old didn't need to see first thing in the morning. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Clothes. Now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, but didn’t argue.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha made her way toward the door, she glanced back one last time—just in time to see Rio stretching again, her hair a wild mess around her face, her skin still flushed from the night before. Even in the hazy morning light, she was effortlessly beautiful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart gave a traitorous little flutter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t have time for this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as she was about to open the door, she heard Nicky’s soft footsteps getting closer, the unmistakable shuffle of a child who hadn’t fully woken up yet. A second later, she heard the quiet tap on her door. “Mama?” Nicky’s voice was small, muffled from behind the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, sweetie?” Agatha called back, her tone steady, but her heart raced a little.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door creaked open, and Nicky poked his head inside, rubbing his eyes with one hand and holding his stuffed dragon in the other. When his eyes landed on Agatha, he smiled sleepily. “Morning, Mama.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning, sweet boy,” Agatha replied with a smile, moving to kneel in front of him. “How’d you sleep?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shrugged, still half-asleep. “Okay. I just woke up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, it’s a good thing you’re awake now, because I think we’ve got a busy day ahead of us,” Agatha said with a playful wink, standing up and pulling him into a quick hug. “How about some breakfast?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He nodded eagerly, his sleepiness fading at the mention of food. “I want pancakes!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Pancakes it is,” Agatha said, ruffling his hair. “Why don’t you go wash up while I get started?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky bounded off, still clutching his stuffed dragon, and Agatha let out a quiet sigh of relief. She turned back toward Rio, who had now pulled herself into a sitting position on the bed, the sheet drawn up to cover her chest, watching the interaction with a soft smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Your turn,” Agatha said with a grin, moving toward the door as she went to join Nicky in the kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled at her, her eyes filled with a tenderness that made Agatha’s heart swell. “I’m coming.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio stood up to get dressed, Agatha lingered for a moment, just watching her. They had a moment of peace that she knew wouldn’t last forever, but for now, it felt like they were living in a quiet kind of happiness—small, private moments tucked away from the world, just the two of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped into the café, the bell above the door chiming softly as she entered. She spotted Alice immediately, sitting at a corner table with a steaming mug of coffee in front of her. Alice was grinning from ear to ear, and Rio could already tell this was going to be one of those mornings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, well, well,” Alice said, her voice laced with mischief as Rio took a seat across from her. “Look who decided to grace me with her presence. I thought you’d be too busy, you know, <em>celebrating</em>.” She wiggled her eyebrows, teasing Rio mercilessly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the flush that crept up her neck. “Alice, I just spent the night. That’s all,” she said, trying to keep her voice casual as she reached for her own coffee. “It wasn’t a big deal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smirked, clearly not buying it. “Right, because ‘the night’ at Agatha’s house is totally just a normal thing, right? Are you sure it wasn’t more of a… <em>celebratory</em> night?” She leaned in closer, her tone dropping into a conspiratorial whisper. “You know, I’m just wondering what exactly happened after little Nicky went to bed." She lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, her gaze locking on Rio’s face. “Tell me, how many times did you—”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">“Alice!” Rio hissed, nearly choking on her coffee, her eyes darting around the café to make sure no one had overheard. Her cheeks flamed as Alice erupted into laughter, clearly enjoying herself far too much.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“I’m just saying,” Alice continued, feigning innocence as she stirred her tea, “it’s not every day you get invited to spend the night at <em>Agatha Harkness’s</em> house. And come on, Rio, you look…” She leaned back, studying her with a knowing grin. “Positively radiant this morning. You’re practically glowing. Let me guess—you celebrated with a bang?”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands as Alice’s laughter grew louder. “You’re impossible,” she muttered, her voice muffled. “Can’t we just have a normal conversation? Like, about the weather or something?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, come on,” Alice said, almost too eagerly. “Tell me everything. I know you’re <em>dying</em> to share.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat. Alice had been relentless ever since she found out about her and Agatha, but today, it seemed she was really going for it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a laugh, her cheeks burning brighter. “I swear, you’re impossible,” she said, shaking her head. “We didn’t—” she stopped, glancing around the café, making sure no one was paying attention, “—we didn’t do anything like that, Alice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned back in her chair, raising her eyebrows and crossing her arms, a playful grin never leaving her face. “Uh-huh. Sure, sure. I can’t imagine what else you two could possibly be doing when you’re alone in her bed. Probably doing origamis, or <em>eating candy, </em>maybe even<em> finger painting</em>…” She paused dramatically, her grin widening, her eyebrows wiggling while Rio’ cheeks and ears took on an alarming crimson color. “But hey, no judgment from me. You deserve it, you know. You’re glowing, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Alice, drop it."</p><p class="p1">Alice wasn’t letting her off the hook that easily. “Oh, no, no, no. You don’t get to waltz in here looking like you’ve just walked out of a romance novel and expect me not to pry.” She leaned in again, lowering her voice for dramatic effect. “So… how was it? Earth-shattering? Life-changing? Were you screaming her name—?”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio nearly knocked over her coffee cup in her haste to shush Alice. “God, Alice, <em>stop</em>,” she whispered, her mortification reaching new heights. “We didn’t—” She faltered, realizing there was no point in denying it when her flushed face was already giving her away. She sighed deeply, leaning back in defeat.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Alice’s smirk widened, her eyes dancing with delight. “Oh, you totally did.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio shot her a glare but couldn’t suppress the shy smile tugging at her lips. “Fine. Yes. Happy now? It happened.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Alice gasped theatrically, clutching her chest as though Rio had just confessed to some great scandal. “I <em>knew</em> it! Oh, my god, Rio! You and Agatha—” She broke into a fit of giggles, barely able to contain herself. “You sly thing! So? Details. I want everything. Was it the desk? The kitchen counter? Please tell me it was dramatic and at least a little illegal.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio groaned again, this time out of sheer exasperation. “Alice, we’re not talking about this in a café. And it was… it was just good, okay? Really good.” Her voice softened, her embarrassment giving way to genuine warmth. “Better than I ever expected.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Alice rested her chin on her hands again, her grin softening into something more affectionate. “You deserve that, Rio. And I’m glad she’s the one who’s giving it to you.” She wiggled her eyebrows one last time for good measure. “Even if I’m <em>dying</em> to know if it was the desk.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio buried her face in her hands, the blush deepening on her cheeks. “I can’t believe we’re talking about this,” she muttered, shaking her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, we’re talking about this alright,” Alice teased. “Come on, give me the full scoop! Did you two—” She leaned in closer, clearly relishing the moment. “—did you <em>celebrate</em> the big presentation in style?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, still trying to calm the embarrassment bubbling up inside her. “It wasn’t some big celebration, Alice. We’re just… really happy. Things are good, alright? I’m not… I wasn’t expecting it to happen, but it just did. And I’m glad it did.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice raised her mug, clearly impressed. “I’m happy for you, Rio,” she said, her teasing tone softening for a moment. “You deserve this, all of it. It’s good to see you so… <em>content</em>. Agatha is good for you. And it’s obvious she cares about you. I don’t know, proud of you. You’ve been through a lot, and seeing you this happy? It’s nice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio met Alice’s gaze, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips. “Thanks, Alice,” she said softly, feeling a swell of gratitude toward her friend. “It’s just… nice, you know? Having something that feels right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice nodded, her eyes softening as she gave Rio a knowing look. “Yeah, I can tell. But if you <em>ever</em> need help with… navigating these new levels of domestic bliss,” she said, her teasing tone returning, “I’m your girl.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, finally able to relax a little in Alice’s presence. “I’ll keep that in mind,” she said, but she knew deep down that this part of her life with Agatha, though complicated and secretive in some ways, was exactly what she needed. And despite the teasing, she was glad to have Alice by her side, supporting her, even if it came with a side of playful sarcasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice looked her over, eyes glinting with amusement. “Okay, good. But for now,” she leaned in, her grin returning with full force, “I want details. How was <em>dessert, </em>and<em> breakfast</em>?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave her a mock glare, but she couldn’t hide her smile. “Maybe I’ll tell you one day,” she said, sipping her coffee and feeling completely content in this moment of teasing and warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of their conversation drifted into lighter territory, but Rio knew that whatever happened, she had the people who cared about her in her corner. Even if that meant dealing with Alice’s teasing for a while.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Monday morning was unusually quiet in Agatha’s office as she prepared for the day ahead, but the memory of their first night together lingered in both of them. It was hard not to feel the weight of their shared moments, the closeness they had found in each other, the way their bodies and hearts had intertwined so seamlessly. Rio had never felt more seen, more understood, and in Agatha’s presence, it felt as if the rest of the world had faded away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But now, here they were, back in the reality of their professional roles—teacher and student—both struggling to keep the new depth of their connection hidden.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A few hours later, Agatha stood at the front of the lecture hall, her authoritative presence filling the space as she began her class. Rio, sitting in the second row as always, couldn’t help but steal glances at her. Every time their eyes met, a small smile would flicker between them, something only they understood. The bond was undeniable, and the air around them was charged with unspoken words and shared memories.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They hadn’t yet found the courage to tell anyone outside of their close circle, but the way their gazes lingered, the brush of a hand when Agatha passed a paper to Rio, was enough for both of them to feel the pull of something deeper, something more than just a professional relationship.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Throughout the lecture, Rio found herself distracted by the soft, reassuring presence of Agatha at the front. Her mind wandered back to that night—the way they had held each other in the quiet of Agatha’s bed, wrapped in warmth, a tenderness that had seemed so natural. Agatha’s hands on her skin, the way she whispered her name in the dark, telling her she was loved, it all felt so surreal but so real at the same time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But here, in the classroom, they were just two people caught in the delicate balance of their roles. They had to keep it together, keep the secret, even if it was harder than ever. When Agatha would pause to look at her, Rio’s heart would skip a beat, but they kept it contained, the quiet intimacy locked behind their eyes. No one could see it, not yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t just the relative newness of their relationship that made things difficult to hide—it was the strength of their feelings for each other. The passion that had ignited between them was undeniable, and every moment they shared seemed to burn brighter than the last. But for now, they could only hold it close, hidden in the small gestures, in the looks and touches no one else could see.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the lecture ended, Rio had to remind herself that they were still in public. The rest of the class trickled out of the room, and Agatha gave a quick nod in Rio’s direction, a silent acknowledgment of their connection. It was enough to keep Rio grounded, even as she fought the urge to rush forward and claim the affection she had been craving all morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once the classroom had cleared, Rio lingered for a moment, waiting for the last student to leave, her mind racing. Agatha stood by the door, gathering her things, and as Rio approached her, the weight of the room seemed to shift.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re quiet today,” Agatha observed, her voice soft, but with a knowing look that made Rio’s heart flutter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m just… thinking,” Rio murmured, feeling the magnetic pull between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled gently, leaning in just a little closer, her voice barely above a whisper. “Whatever you’re thinking about, love, it’s worth it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, feeling a mix of hope and longing. She wanted nothing more than to be able to shout their love from the rooftops, but they both knew it wasn’t the right time yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio said, her voice low but firm. “It really is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they exchanged one last look, Rio left the classroom, her steps a little lighter than before. Though their secret was becoming harder to keep, the love they shared was strong enough to endure whatever they had to face, together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of the week seemed to drag on as Rio and Agatha navigated the increasingly difficult task of keeping their relationship hidden. It was clear to both of them that their feelings were growing deeper, the bond between them more undeniable with each passing moment. But the stakes were high, and they couldn’t afford to slip up—not yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Friday afternoon, Rio found herself staring out the window of Agatha’s office, lost in thought. She hadn’t meant to be so distracted, but the pull of Agatha’s presence in the room was like a constant hum in the back of her mind. She could feel Agatha’s eyes on her, watching her as she worked, but Rio didn’t look up. She wasn’t sure if it was the lingering touches from earlier, the quiet moments they had shared in the hall after class, or the memory of their first night together, but Rio was finding it hard to focus on anything other than Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, ever perceptive, noticed the slight shift in Rio’s posture. She had been observing her for a while now—watching her become more restless, more distracted. The quiet connection between them was growing more intense by the day, and Agatha knew it was only a matter of time before they had to address it. But she didn’t want to rush Rio. She never wanted to make her feel pressured. Agatha valued the trust they had built over the past few months, and she wasn’t about to risk it by pushing too hard.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the clock struck five, Agatha decided to break the silence. She gathered her things, standing up from her desk and walking over to where Rio was sitting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha began softly, her voice carrying the weight of everything unsaid between them, “are you doing okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced up at her, a small, guilty smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just… a little distracted.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, studying Rio with a mixture of affection and concern. “Distracted by what?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment before responding, her voice barely above a whisper. “You.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart skipped a beat at the admission, but she kept her expression calm, a small smile curling on her lips. “Me?” she asked, her tone playful yet gentle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, unable to hide the warmth in her eyes. “Yeah. It’s hard to focus on anything else when you’re around.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile deepened, and she took a step closer, her hand brushing lightly against Rio’s. “I get it,” she said softly. “It’s hard for me, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked up at her, her heart pounding in her chest. For a moment, the room felt too small for the intensity between them. She could feel the heat radiating from Agatha’s body, the pull that was growing stronger with every passing second. But they both knew that they couldn’t give in, not yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can I ask you something?” Rio asked, her voice steady but full of curiosity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Anything,” Agatha replied, her gaze unwavering.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip nervously. “Do you ever think about… what comes next? After all of this?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brows furrowed slightly, but there was no hesitation in her response. “I think about it all the time, Rio. But we have to be patient. There’s a lot at stake, and we can’t rush it. But I can't wait for it, even if I love what we have now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. It was what she needed to hear. As much as she wanted to be open about their relationship, to shout it from the rooftops, she knew they had to be careful. It wasn’t just about them; it was about their futures, their careers, their lives.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Rio said quietly. “I just… sometimes it feels like we’re living in two different worlds. You’re a professor, and I’m just… a student.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, her hand brushing against Rio’s cheek. “You’re not just a student, Rio,” she said firmly. “You’re brilliant. And no matter what happens, I’ll always be proud of you, and I'll always be yours. You’re my equal in every way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her heart swell at the sincerity in Agatha’s words. She wanted nothing more than to be with her, to make their relationship public, but Agatha was right—they had to be patient.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio whispered, feeling the weight of her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her hand lingering on Rio’s cheek for a moment longer before pulling back. “We’ll get through this. Together. I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled back, feeling a sense of peace settle in her chest. They were in this together, and that was all that mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the weekend approached, the two of them found quiet moments to steal away from the world. Their love was a secret, but it was also something they both cherished deeply. And even though they couldn’t yet share it with everyone else, they had each other—and that was enough for now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

Eliot. “East Coker”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The soft click of a key turning in the lock barely registered to Rio, who was still wrapped in the warmth of her blanket and the haze of sleep. It wasn’t until the familiar sound of footsteps padded into her small flat that she stirred, groggily sitting up and squinting toward the source of the intrusion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia?” she croaked, her voice thick with sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Happy birthday, my sweet girl!” Lilia’s voice was warm and bright as she appeared in the doorway to Rio’s bedroom, holding a tray with a small plate of toast, a mug of steaming tea, and a single candle flickering cheerfully atop a cupcake.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. “You let yourself in?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Lilia said, setting the tray on Rio’s bedside table. “I wanted to be the first to wish you a happy birthday. And besides, you gave me a spare key for emergencies. Turning another year older is an emergency, no?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, the sound still laced with sleep. “I guess so.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she sat up further, Lilia perched on the edge of the bed, her dark eyes shimmering with emotion. “Do you know what I was doing this exact time all those years ago?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, smiling gently. “What?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia reached out, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s face. “I was sitting in the living room, wondering if I’d done the right thing by taking you in. You were so guarded, Rio. So quiet. But when I walked into your room to check on you, you were already awake, sitting on that bed I’d set up. You looked at me and said, ‘Good morning.’ Just like that. As if you’d been there forever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile faltered, her chest tightening at the memory. “I don’t remember that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, I do,” Lilia said, her voice soft but firm. “It was the moment I knew I’d made the right choice. You fit into my life so seamlessly, like you’d always been there. And now, look at you—” her voice broke slightly, and she wiped at her eyes with a quick laugh, “—a brilliant, beautiful young woman. You’ve made me so proud, my love. So, so proud. And I don’t think you will ever stop.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia,” Rio whispered, her own eyes brimming with tears. “You’re going to make me cry.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good,” Lilia teased, though her voice was thick with emotion. “You’ve made me cry plenty over the years, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They both laughed at that, and Lilia leaned forward to pull Rio into a tight hug. Rio melted into the embrace, feeling the unshakable warmth and security that Lilia had given her for so many years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio murmured against her shoulder. “For everything. For always being there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Always,” Lilia promised, pulling back to cup Rio’s face in her hands. “You deserve all the happiness in the world, Rio. Today and every day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, a tear slipping down her cheek as she nodded. “I love you, Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you too, darling girl,” Lilia said, leaning in to kiss her forehead. Then she straightened, brushing her hands against her jeans. “Now, eat your cupcake before I do. And don’t think I’m leaving until you tell me all about your plans for the day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, reaching for the tray. “Alright, alright. Let me wake up first.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Lilia watched her with a fond smile, Rio couldn’t help but think that birthdays like this—waking up to the unwavering love of the person who had given her a home—truly made her feel special.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the sun rose over their cozy home, Agatha was already in the kitchen, sipping her morning coffee while Nicky, still in his pajamas, sat at the table munching on a bowl of cereal. She glanced at the calendar pinned to the fridge and smiled. Today was a special day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nicky,” she said, setting her mug down and turning to him. “Did you know it’s Rio’s birthday today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes widened, and he looked up from his cereal with excitement. “It is? Is she coming over?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She is,” Agatha confirmed, her smile growing. “She’ll join us for lunch.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can we get her a present?” Nicky asked immediately, his spoon clattering into his bowl. “We have to get her something!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled at his enthusiasm. “Of course, we can. After breakfast, we’ll go to the store and pick something out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky practically inhaled the rest of his cereal, his little legs swinging excitedly under the table as Agatha finished her coffee. Soon, they were bundled up and headed to the local shop. The moment they walked in, Nicky began scanning the aisles with a determined expression, his small hand tucked firmly into Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they wandered through the store, Nicky stopped abruptly in front of the toy section. His eyes landed on a colorful box, and his face lit up. “This!” he exclaimed, pointing at a Lego flower set.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, inspecting the box. “Lego flowers, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah!” Nicky nodded eagerly. “Rio likes plants. You told me she had a bunch in her apartment. And we can build it together. She’ll like it, I know she will!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart warmed at his thoughtfulness, for having picked up on Rio’s likes and dislikes. “Alright, sweetheart, that’s a great idea. Let’s get it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They picked up the box, and as they headed toward the checkout, Agatha’s mind lingered on the present she already had found, a simple yet personal one. She had already wrapped it up, planning to give it to Rio later, when it was just the two of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Back at home, Nicky insisted on wrapping the Lego set himself. Agatha handed him some colorful paper and tape, watching with a mixture of amusement and pride as he meticulously folded and taped every corner, his tongue sticking out in concentration. When he was finished, he added a big, uneven bow on top and grinned triumphantly, the gift a little lopsided, but undoubtedly made with love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Perfect,” Agatha said, ruffling his hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The aroma of roasted vegetables and fresh bread filled Agatha’s home as she set the table for Rio’s birthday lunch. Nicky bounced on his heels beside her, holding his wrapped gift with an eagerness that threatened to burst out of him at any moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Remember,” Agatha said with a gentle smile, placing a hand on his shoulder to calm him, “we’ll give Rio her gift after we eat.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But what if she wants to see it right away?” Nicky asked, his wide eyes darting toward the front door, as if expecting Rio to magically appear any second.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’ll love it no matter when you give it to her,” Agatha reassured him, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “And patience, young man.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before he could argue, the doorbell rang. Nicky bolted to the door with an eager shout, leaving Agatha chuckling softly as she followed at a slower, more composed pace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood on the porch, her cheeks pink from the cool air outside, holding a small potted plant. “Happy birthday to me,” she teased, lifting the plant like a toast before stepping inside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Happy birthday to you, indeed,” Agatha murmured, the affection in her voice as warm as the hand she placed on Rio’s arm. She leaned in to press a soft kiss to Rio’s cheek but pulled back quickly as Nicky barreled into Rio’s legs, wrapping his arms around her waist with all the enthusiasm of a child who had been waiting all morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Happy birthday, Rio!” he shouted, hugging her tightly. “I made something for you. Well, I picked it out, but you can’t see it yet!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, ruffling his hair as she set the plant down on a side table. “Well, thank you, darling, I’m very intrigued. And hungry. Let’s eat so I can find out what this mystery is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha led them to the dining table, where a spread of Rio’s favorite dishes was waiting. They ate amidst lively chatter, with Nicky recounting stories from school and Rio sharing snippets of her work at the library and Alice’s latest joke. Agatha mostly listened, her gaze flitting between them as a quiet joy settled in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the plates were cleared after the cake and Rio had blown her candles under Agatha and Nicky’s cheers and applause, Nicky couldn’t wait any longer. He dashed to the corner where he’d stashed the present and returned, clutching it tightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Here,” he said, thrusting it toward Rio. “Open it! Open it now!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned as she carefully unwrapped the colorful paper. Her eyes widened as the Lego flower set came into view. “Oh, Nicky, this is perfect! I love it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I knew it!” Nicky exclaimed, practically bouncing in place. “And we can build it together. Right now!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed softly, watching the two of them with a mixture of amusement and affection. “Go on, you two. I’ll clean up in here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio followed Nicky to the living room, where they sprawled on the floor and emptied the box of Lego pieces. Nicky began sorting them into piles while explaining his grand vision for how they should build it. Rio nodded along, matching his excitement with her own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, we start with this one,” Nicky instructed, holding up a piece. His voice was full of authority, his little brow furrowed in concentration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Got it, boss,” Rio said, her grin widening as she clicked the pieces together. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, standing in the doorway, leaned against the frame and crossed her arms, a soft smile playing on her lips. The sight before her was almost too much—her son, so animated and joyful, and Rio, whose laughter was bright and unrestrained, fitting into their little world like she’d always been meant to. It made her heart soar - Rio’s laugh, so genuine and free, mingling with Nicky’s happy chatter as they worked together to sort the pieces.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their heads were close together, hands moving in tandem as they constructed the intricate flowers. Occasionally, Nicky would pause to explain a step to Rio, his voice filled with authority and pride. Rio played along, following his instructions to the letter and cheering each time they completed a section.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re really good at this,” Rio said, shooting Nicky a playful grin as she clicked another piece into place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Nicky replied, completely serious, earning a burst of laughter from Rio that filled the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha moved to sit on the couch behind them, her presence quiet and steady as she watched them. Her heart swelled with love—love for her son, who had such a kind and vibrant spirit, and love for Rio, who brought a light into their lives that Agatha hadn’t even realized they’d been missing. Her heart felt impossibly full, the love she carried for both of them brimming over. This was her family, her life—and she wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the final flower was placed into its stand, Nicky clapped his hands together in triumph. “We did it!” he declared, beaming up at Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We sure did,” Rio said, pulling him into a hug on top of her. “Thank you, Nicky. This was the best birthday gift ever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees as she joined their conversation. “You two make quite the team.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded vigorously from his position, sprawled on Rio’s chest on the floor. “We’re the best team. Right, Rio?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The absolute best,” Rio agreed, her smile softening as her gaze met Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, reaching over to brush a strand of hair from Rio’s face. “Happy birthday, my love,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In that moment, surrounded by warmth, laughter, and the quiet hum of happiness, Rio felt a peace she hadn’t known in years. She was home. She was loved. And she was finally, blissfully, where she belonged.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After lunch, the three of them were lounging in the living room, the finished Lego flowers proudly displayed on the coffee table. Nicky had been carefully rearranging the blossoms into different configurations when Rio glanced at Agatha, a smile tugging at her lips. She nudged her girlfriend lightly with her foot, drawing her attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think it’s time,” Rio said softly, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, setting her mug down on the table. “You’re right.” She turned her gaze toward Nicky, who was now holding one of the Lego flowers up to the light as if inspecting its craftsmanship. “Nicky, sweetheart, can you come here for a second? We have something to tell you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky immediately perked up, carefully setting the flower back on its stand before bounding over to the couch. He climbed up between them, looking from one to the other with wide, curious eyes. “What is it? Is it a secret?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not exactly a secret,” Rio said, laughing softly. “More like exciting news.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled warmly. “You know how Rio is in a band, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Uh-huh,” Nicky said, nodding enthusiastically. “She plays the drums! Like, really, really loud drums.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Rio said with a grin. “Well, we have a performance this afternoon. It’s part of a big event on campus, and guess what? It’s outside, so you can come this time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes widened with excitement. “Really? I can go?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really,” Agatha confirmed, brushing a hand gently through his hair. “It’s a special day, and we thought it would be the perfect chance for you to see Rio play.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do I get to sit in the front?” Nicky asked, bouncing on the couch in his enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed. “You bet. I’ll make sure you have the best seat in the house.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And can I tell my friends that my mom’s girlfriend is a rock star?” Nicky blurted out, his little face alight with pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Rio both froze for a moment before bursting into laughter. Agatha shook her head fondly. “I think that might give them the wrong idea, sweetheart. I promise soon, you can tell them anything you want about Rio. Just not now, remember ?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But you are kind of a rock star, right, Rio?” Nicky pressed, tilting his head with an earnest expression.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, leaning in conspiratorially. “Oh, definitely.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Satisfied with her answer, Nicky threw his arms around Rio’s neck when she leaned down, squeezing her tightly. “I can’t wait! This is gonna be the best time ever!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached over, running a hand soothingly down Nicky’s back. Her eyes met Rio’s over her son’s shoulder, and the two of them shared a soft smile, the warmth of the moment settling over them like a comforting blanket.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Then it’s a date,” Agatha said gently. “We’ll all go together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky pulled back just enough to look up at them, his grin wide and toothy. “This is the best birthday ever,” he declared, and for a moment, it was impossible to tell whether he was more excited for Rio or for himself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The late afternoon sun cast a golden glow over the park as Agatha, Rio, and Nicky strolled toward the makeshift stage set up for the event. A lively hum of activity surrounded them—vendors setting up stalls, families spreading picnic blankets, and students mingling in groups. Rio carried her drumsticks in her hand, tapping them lightly against her thigh in a rhythm only she could hear, and Agatha stood beside her at a respectable distance, holding her son’s hand whose eyes were darting around, clearly very excited by the bustling of everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they approached the stage, Alice and Jen appeared, waving enthusiastically. Alice, dressed in her usual vibrant style, bounded over first, throwing her arms around Rio in a tight hug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Happy birthday, rock star!” she declared, pulling back with a grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen followed, offering Rio a quick hug of her own. “Happy birthday, boss,” she teased, earning a raised eyebrow from her own girlfriend. “Now come on, we’ve got work to do. The stage won’t set itself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could respond, Alice looped her arm through Rio’s and started leading her away. “Come on, birthday girl. We need you backstage!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced over her shoulder at Agatha and Nicky with a sheepish smile. “See you in a bit!” she called, holding up her drumsticks as if to say, <em>I’m off to work.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha waved her on, her lips curling into a soft smile as she watched Rio disappear into the bustling crowd with her bandmates.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio’s friends are so fun,” Nicky said, his eyes wide as he took in the scene, while him mom took the blanket out of her bag to set on the grass.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They are,” Agatha agreed, resting a hand on his shoulder. She glanced around, and her gaze landed on a familiar figure approaching them—a figure she was secretly relieved to see.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hello there,” Lilia greeted warmly, her eyes flicking to Agatha before landing on Nicky. “And who is this young gentleman?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up as he scrambled to his feet, offering a shy wave. “I’m Nicky!” he announced proudly. “Are you Rio’s mom?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed softly, crouching slightly to meet his gaze. “I am,” she said. “I’m Lilia. I’ve known Rio for a very long time, though. I think she’d say I’m kind of like her mom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh!” Nicky said, tilting his head in thought and recognition. “You’re Rio’s ‘Lilia’, she told me about you. She also said that you would love me and that I would love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia blinked, startled for only a moment before her face softened. “She did, didn’t she? I suppose she was right, then!” she said, her tone carrying a hint of fond amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stifled a chuckle, her hand brushing over Nicky’s head. “I’m sorry about that, Nicky doesn’t waste time,” she murmured, her lips twitching into a smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, in that case,” Lilia said, straightening up and reaching into her bag, “I can’t meet this new lovable little young man empty-handed, can I?” She pulled out a small box of homemade cookies wrapped in a bright ribbon and handed them to Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His eyes widened as he accepted the gift. “Thank you!” he exclaimed, already trying to open the box.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re very welcome, sweetheart, they were supposed to be for Rio, but she had plenty already,” Lilia said, brushing a strand of his hair away from his face with an affectionate touch. “Now, tell me, what’s your favorite kind of cookie? I’ll have to make more next time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes sparkled. “I like chocolate chip! But I also like peanut butter. And the ones with sprinkles.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed. “Sounds like I’ve got my work cut out for me,” she said, winking at Agatha, who shook her head with a grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Over the next few minutes, Lilia and Nicky bonded effortlessly. She asked him about his favorite toys, his dance classes, and what he liked to do for fun. He answered eagerly, his usual shyness melting away under her gentle attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re such a sweet boy,” Lilia said, ruffling his hair. “Rio must absolutely adore you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, turning to Agatha. “Can Lilia come over for dinner sometime? She’s so nice!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow at Lilia, her smile growing. “I think that can be arranged,” she said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia settled on the blanket beside them, offering Nicky some of the snacks she’d brought. The way she fussed over him—making sure he had enough to drink, ensuring the sun wasn’t in his eyes—made Agatha’s heart ache in the best way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio stepped onto the stage with her band, the crowd gathered in the park cheered enthusiastically. Nicky clapped along with them, his eyes wide and sparkling with awe. He sat on the edge of a blanket, leaning forward as though he couldn’t get close enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Isn’t she so cool, Mama?” Nicky whispered, his voice hushed with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help the smile that tugged at her lips. She followed his gaze to the stage, where Rio was adjusting her seat slightly and sharing a laugh with Alice and Jen. The afternoon sun cast a soft glow on her, making her every movement seem effortless, confident, and alive.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s the coolest,” Agatha murmured, her voice low enough for only Nicky to hear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The band started their set, and the music filled the air, vibrant and dynamic. Nicky bounced to the rhythm, occasionally turning to Agatha with an expression of pure delight. Every so often, Rio’s eyes scanned the crowd, and when they landed on Agatha and Nicky, her smile brightened just a touch, a momentary sparkle that felt like it was meant only for them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s so good!” Nicky exclaimed as Rio expertly played her part in a high-energy song. “I wish I could play music like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly. “You can always learn,” she said, her heart swelling with pride as she watched Rio seamlessly blend into the music, her passion evident in every note.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded enthusiastically. “Do you think she’d teach me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sure she would,” Agatha replied, her gaze never leaving Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But while her son was focused on Rio’s musical prowess, Agatha found herself swept up in the sight of the woman she loved so completely. Every move Rio made, every note she played, was a reminder of the brilliant, multifaceted person she was. The fact that she couldn’t openly share this love yet, couldn’t reach out and take Rio’s hand in front of everyone, tugged at her heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, it was enough for now to be there, cheering her on with Nicky, sharing this moment as a little family in the making.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the final song of the set came to a triumphant close, the crowd erupted in applause, Nicky included. He jumped to his feet from his position on his mom's lap, clapping as hard as his small hands could manage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio’s the best!” he declared, his voice loud enough to carry over the cheers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I couldn't agree more," Lilia said, ruffling his hair before clapping loudly too.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a laugh, standing to join him. “She really is,” she said softly, her eyes locked on Rio as she waved to the crowd, her face glowing with joy and exhilaration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In that moment, despite the secrets they still had to keep, Agatha felt a deep, unshakable sense of contentment. Their love might be hidden for now, but it was no less real, no less powerful. And as Nicky leaned against her, his admiration for Rio clear in every word and gesture, Agatha knew they were building something truly beautiful together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After the excitement of the day, the lights of the city twinkling as they drove, Agatha and Rio finally made their way to Wanda’s house where Nicky would be spending the night with Billy and Tommy. Nicky had been bouncing in the backseat the whole ride there, still full of energy from the afternoon’s performance, his cheeks still flushed from the excitement of the day and from the anticipation of spending the night with his little friends.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be good, I promise!” Nicky said as he unbuckled his seatbelt, grabbing the small bag he had packed. “Happy birthday again, Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You better,” Agatha teased with a wink as she leaned over to kiss his forehead. “Have fun with Billy and Tommy. We’ll see you tomorrow morning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded, already running toward the door where Wanda was already standing, two little head peeking out from behind her legs, before Agatha and Rio could even fully park the car. He waved enthusiastically as he disappeared inside the house, and Rio and Agatha exchanged a smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With Nicky settled in for the night, they drove the short distance to Agatha’s house in comfortable silence. The air between them was light and warm, filled with the afterglow of the day’s celebrations. As they pulled into the driveway, Rio turned to Agatha with a soft smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you for today,” Rio said quietly, her voice thick with emotion. “It was perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached over, taking Rio’s hand in hers. “You deserve perfect, Rio. You deserve everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They made their way inside, Agatha locking the door behind them. The house felt so different when it was just the two of them. It was like the world had quieted down, and everything was simply theirs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I have something for you,” Agatha said, her voice steady but with a hint of excitement. She led Rio to the living room and gestured for her to sit on the couch, the warm glow of the lamps casting a soft light around them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow. “You didn’t have to get me anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, a little teasing. “Of course I did. It’s your birthday, after all.” She disappeared for a moment, returning with a small, wrapped box in her hands. She sat down next to Rio and handed it to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took the box, her fingers brushing over the soft, smooth wrapping paper. She glanced up at Agatha, her heart fluttering in her chest. “You’re really spoiling me today,” she said, already feeling a rush of affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Open it,” Agatha urged softly, her eyes never leaving Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio carefully tore the wrapping paper, revealing a small wooden box. She opened it, and inside was a delicate bracelet, silver with four tiny, intricate golden charms that seemed to tell a story all their own. It was simple, yet beautiful, just like the love she shared with Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s stunning,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “But… why this?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, and she placed a hand on Rio’s. “Each charm represents something about you. The heart is for your kindness, the flower for your strength and growth, and the star for the way you shine in my life. And the wave is my favorite, because it is graceful, strong like a river and with a quiet depth that pulls me in deeper every day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tears welled up in Rio’s eyes, and she took the necklace in her hands, holding it to her chest. “I love it, Agatha. I love it so much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m glad,” Agatha said softly. She kissed Rio’s temple, and they sat in quiet, tender silence for a moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a beat, Agatha spoke again, her voice low and full of love. “You deserve to be celebrated, Rio. Not just today, but every day. I don’t think you even realize just how extraordinary you are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned her head on Agatha’s shoulder, feeling her heart swell with love and contentment. “I’m just glad I get to spend this life with you. You make everything feel better, like everything is right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha kissed her forehead, lingering there for a moment before pulling back slightly to look at Rio with a soft, affectionate gaze. “I love you, Rio. So much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you too,” Rio replied quietly, her voice thick with sincerity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio held her present in her hands, her heart still racing from the emotion of the gift, Agatha gently cupped her face, brushing her thumb over Rio’s cheek. The quiet between them felt like a soft, sacred space, where nothing could intrude.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze shifted to Agatha’s lips, and she leaned in, her pulse quickening. Agatha met her halfway, their lips connecting in a soft, tender kiss. It wasn’t rushed, but it was filled with the depth of everything they’d shared. Agatha’s hand slid into Rio’s hair, pulling her just a little closer, as if to remind her this moment was real, that they were real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they pulled back, both of them breathless and a little flushed, Rio smiled shyly. “You’re full of surprises tonight, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, brushing a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “I just wanted to make sure you felt as special as you are.” Her eyes softened as she took in the sight of Rio in front of her, the love and admiration clear in every glance. “You deserve so much more, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t say anything at first, just leaned forward, letting her lips meet Agatha’s again. This time, the kiss deepened, slow and deliberate, as if they were savoring each second. Agatha’s hand moved to the back of Rio’s neck, holding her gently as their lips danced together in perfect rhythm. It felt like coming home, like every kiss was an echo of everything they’d built together, everything they were becoming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally pulled apart, their foreheads touched, both of them a little breathless. “I think you’ve officially spoiled me,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her eyes sparkling. “Good. I plan on spoiling you more.” She kissed Rio’s lips once more, soft and lingering. « Happy birthday, my love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air around them seemed to hum with something unspoken, something shared only between them. Agatha gently guided Rio to rest her head against her shoulder, both of them content to simply be in the moment. There was no rush, no need for words. Just the quiet comfort of being together, of knowing that, whatever came next, they had each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few moments, Rio pulled back slightly, her fingers tracing the collar of Agatha’s shirt, a playful smile tugging at her lips. “You really know how to make a girl feel loved, don’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her heart swelling at the sight of Rio, so beautiful and full of love. “I’m just getting started.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as they shared one more kiss, it was everything. All of the love, the passion, and the quiet comfort of knowing that they were exactly where they were meant to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening stretched on, their laughter faded into quiet whispers, and the weight of the world seemed to fall away as they held each other close. Rio leaned against Agatha, her hand tracing the lines of Agatha’s shirt as if committing every detail of the moment to memory. Agatha, too, felt the closeness, the undeniable warmth between them, a love that felt both timeless and new.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a while, they found themselves curled up on the couch, still in the quiet bubble of intimacy they had created. Agatha brushed a stray lock of hair from Rio’s face, her fingers lingering against her skin as she met Rio’s gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Agatha murmured, her voice soft, “this feels like the perfect way to end the day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, a playful glint in her eyes. “I think we both know the night’s just getting started.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart skipped a beat at the confidence in Rio’s voice, at the promise of more shared moments between them. “So it is,” Agatha replied, her lips curving into a slow smile. “But we’ve got all the time in the world.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, the air around them seemed to change. The kiss that followed was slow, deeper than any before, filled with a hunger neither of them could quite explain, but one they couldn’t ignore. Agatha’s hand pulled the claw clip free from Rio’s hair to throw it somewhere behind her – the younger woman’s hair tumbling down her back -  and moved her hand to the back of Rio’s neck, pulling her closer, while Rio responded with equal intensity, her hands wandering to the hem of Agatha’s shirt, tugging it up and out of her pants as their lips met again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They barely made it to Agatha’s bedroom before their bodies collided again, mouths seeking, hands desperate. The air between them was thick with want, the kind that had simmered for so long it was inevitable they would be consumed by it. Their kisses turned hungrier, teeth clashing, tongues tangling, their bodies pressing so close it was impossible to tell where one ended and the other began. The air between them crackled, thick with need, with devotion, with something deeper than just passion. Every whispered word, every stolen glance, every moment spent in quiet intimacy had led them here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands found their way under Rio’s shirt, palms sliding against bare skin, tracing the dips and curves she had memorized in stolen touches with the kind of reckless devotion that left them both trembling. She broke away just long enough to tug Rio’s shirt over her head before her lips found the column of her throat, pressing kisses down, slow, deliberate, savoring the way Rio shuddered beneath her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips ghosted over Rio’s jaw, down her throat, her breath hot and teasing against the sensitive skin. Rio let out a soft, shuddering sigh as her fingers traced the planes of Agatha’s back, slipping beneath her shirt, nails raking lightly against smooth skin. Agatha groaned at the sensation, tilting her head to claim Rio’s lips again, this time with even more urgency, more fire.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her knees go weak at the way Agatha looked at her—like she was something precious, something sacred, something to be cherished. And she was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You drive me mad,” Agatha murmured against Rio’s skin, her voice rough with need, her breath sending a delicious shiver down Rio’s spine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gasped, her fingers curling into Agatha’s long hair, anchoring herself as she felt the world tilt. “Then lose your mind for me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A growl vibrated against her throat before Agatha’s hands found her hips, gripping tight, guiding her backward until the backs of Rio’s knees hit the bed. She tumbled onto the mattress, pulling Agatha down with her, their laughter mingling with heated breaths before their mouths met again, desperate, open, insatiable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hovered over her, taking her in, fingers tracing delicate patterns along Rio’s ribs, her touch light but searing, leaving a trail of heat in its wake. “You’re beautiful,” she whispered, not just admiring but worshiping.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, her hands finding purchase in Agatha’s hair, tugging her down for another kiss—deep, slow, claiming. “Show me,” she murmured against Agatha’s lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Agatha did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She worshipped her with hands and lips, memorizing every inch, every sigh, every whispered plea. She took her time, never rushing, as though she wanted to etch every sensation into her soul. And Rio, beneath her, undone by every touch, every press of lips, every whispered confession, felt as if she were made of fire and Agatha was the only one who knew how to burn with her without turning to ash.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the last piece of clothing was gone, and they were bare in every sense of the word, Agatha took her time tracing the shape of Rio’s body with her hands, her lips, her tongue, memorizing every inch, every reaction. And Rio, beneath her, met every touch with her own, worship for worship, love for love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha moved with an almost unbearable tenderness, like every touch, every kiss, every whispered word was a vow. It wasn’t just passion; it was love—raw, aching, all-consuming. There was no rush, no frantic desperation—only a deliberate unraveling, a slow-burning fire that built and built until it consumed them both.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gasped as Agatha’s lips found the sensitive spot just beneath her ear, her body arching, pressing closer, needing more, needing everything. And Agatha gave it all to her—soft touches, whispered reassurances, devotion woven into every movement, every breath.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I adore you,” Rio whispered between kisses, her voice breathless, her heart pounding against her ribs. It wasn’t just a declaration—it was a confession, a raw, unfiltered truth laid bare between them. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled back slightly, looking into Rio’s eyes with a tenderness that made Rio’s heart race. “And you’re mine,” Agatha replied, her voice steady, but there was something in her eyes—something raw, something powerful—that made Rio’s chest ache in the best way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They moved together like a perfect melody—every touch, every sigh, every whispered name a note in the song they had been composing for as long as they had known each other. There was no rush, no urgency beyond the need to feel, to take, to give, to revel in the sacred intimacy that belonged to them alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They were there, together, two souls intertwined, sharing more than just a physical connection but something deeper, something that tied them together in a way nothing else could.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> “You make me feel so loved,” Rio whispered, eyes half-lidded, body trembling beneath Agatha’s touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled against her skin, pressing a kiss to the center of her chest before pulling her up into another searing kiss as her fingers slid into Rio’s hair, cradling her gently as she tilted her head back. “You are loved, Rio. So deeply. And I’ll show you every day,” she promised, voice low, reverent, absolute. “Every single day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And she did. Again and again, until there was nothing left between them but the warmth of their bodies, the soft hum of their breath, and the unshakable certainty that this—this love, this devotion—was the most real thing they had ever known.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night was theirs. There was no rushing, no time constraints—just the two of them, wrapped in each other’s arms, their bodies as close as they could get. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night passed in a haze of soft whispers, tender touches, quiet gasps that spoke of devotion and cried-out names. They held each other close after, bodies entwined in the comfort of knowing they were exactly where they were meant to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally settled into the bed, their bodies spent of their energy, chests heaving, the weight of the world seemed to lift, leaving behind only peace. The soft hum of their breath filled the room as they held each other, skin pressed to skin, fingers tracing idle patterns against damp skin, tangled in sheets and love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There, in the quiet, in the stillness of the night, they found their peace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, burrowing deeper into Agatha’s warmth, her head resting against her chest, listening to the steady rhythm of her heartbeat. Agatha pressed a kiss to her forehead, her fingers trailing lazily down Rio’s spine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their love was quiet in public, but so loud in private—loud in the way they clung to each other, in the way they whispered promises in the dark, in the way they let themselves be completely, utterly bare with one another.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They drifted to sleep wrapped in each other’s arms, the promise of tomorrow and every day after that waiting for them. And when the morning light began to seep through the window, they were still together, still holding on to the love they had found.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>              (T.S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">A week later, the early morning sunlight filtered through the curtains in Rio’s apartment, casting soft, golden light across the room, bathing her numerous plants in a luminous glow. Agatha stirred first, blinking against the warmth of the sun, her arms wrapped securely around Rio. The younger woman’s face was relaxed in sleep, her dark hair a wild mess across the pillow, and Agatha couldn’t help the soft smile that tugged at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For months, they’d been stealing these quiet moments together, hidden away from prying eyes and expectations. It had been thrilling in some ways, but there was also a weight that came with the secrecy—a weight Agatha felt pressing more heavily as time went on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio began to stir, her nose crinkling adorably before her eyes fluttered open. She looked up at Agatha with a sleepy smile. “Morning,” she murmured, her voice thick with sleep as she snuggled closer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning, darling,” Agatha replied, pressing a kiss to Rio’s forehead. For a while, they simply lay there, enjoying the comfort of each other’s presence. But as Agatha’s mind wandered, a thought she’d been avoiding began to take shape.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve been thinking,” Agatha started, her voice careful but firm, “about us. About how we’ve been handling things.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head up, her expression curious but open. “What kind of thinking?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled, stroking her fingers lightly along Rio’s arm. “I mean… the sneaking around. It’s worked so far, but if we’re serious about this—and I know I am—I wonder if it’s time to be a bit more… transparent.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, sitting up slightly to face Agatha more fully. “You’re talking about telling someone.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes.” Agatha nodded, meeting Rio’s gaze. “The dean, specifically. If we disclosed our relationship, it would make things clean. No whispers, no misunderstandings. Just honesty. It’s not like we’ve done anything wrong, but keeping it quiet does leave room for speculation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio considered this, her brow furrowing as she chewed on her bottom lip. “You’re right,” she said after a pause. “I mean, it’s not like we can keep it a secret forever, not if we’re serious. And I am too, by the way,” she added quickly, reaching to take Agatha’s hand. “Serious, I mean.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart softened at Rio’s earnestness. “I know you are,” she murmured, squeezing her hand gently.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, leaning her head against Agatha’s shoulder. “I guess it does make sense. The dean’s fair, and I don’t think he’d have an issue as long as we’re honest about it. And I’d rather tell him than have someone else find out and try to make it a thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly.” Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio, pulling her closer. “We’ll do it together. When you’re ready.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head to look at her with a small smile. “What happened to sneaky Professor Harkness who liked stealing kisses in her office and rushing home for secret rendezvous?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, playfully tapping her fingers on Rio’s back. “Oh, she’s still here. But I think it’s time for us to move past sneaking around. You deserve more than that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed contentedly, curling back against Agatha. “Okay. Let’s do it. I’m in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They lay there for a few more moments, basking in the quiet resolution they’d made together. It wasn’t just about telling the dean—it was about taking another step forward, about building something solid together, without fear or hesitation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The day had grown brighter through the window as Rio slid out of Agatha’s embrace, sitting up and stretching. Though they’d just resolved something important, a flicker of stress was still visible in her expression as she toyed with the edge of the blanket.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha noticed immediately, propping herself up on one elbow. “What’s wrong, darling?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced back at her, offering a small smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Nothing, really. Just… the idea of telling the dean is a lot. Even though I know it’s the right thing, it still feels like a big step.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached out, tucking a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “It <em>is</em> a big step,” she said softly. “But it’s one we’re taking together, and you’re not doing it alone. I promise you, it’s going to be okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, exhaling slowly. “You’re right. I just—maybe I need to take a minute to shake this off.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve got an idea,” Agatha murmured, her tone shifting to something softer, something coaxing. “Why don’t you take a nice, hot shower? It’ll help you relax.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned, a glint of mischief sparking in her dark eyes. “A shower, huh?” Her lips curled into a knowing smile as she leaned back on her elbows, stretching languidly, deliberately. “I’ll only do it if you join me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brow lifted, her gaze sweeping over Rio’s form with lazy appreciation. “Is that so?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mhm.” Rio rose to her feet, the blanket slipping off her shoulders and pooling at her feet. She didn’t bother picking it up, instead sauntering toward the bathroom door with an air of pure temptation, glancing back just before disappearing inside. “What do you say, Dr. Harkness? Care to help me unwind?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was already moving, the corner of her mouth twitching into a smirk as she followed. “Lead the way, Ms. Vidal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bathroom quickly filled with the hiss of rushing water and the slow curl of steam, the air turning thick with heat and anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they stepped beneath the cascading warmth, their bodies pressed close, every last ounce of space between them disappeared. Water streamed over Rio’s skin, tracing the delicate lines of her body, glistening like dewdrops against golden-hued flesh. Agatha’s hands found their way to Rio’s hips, fingers pressing in just enough to remind her she was there, solid, present, wanting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“See?” Rio murmured, her voice husky as she slid her hands up Agatha’s bare arms, nails dragging lightly in a way that sent a ripple of pleasure down Agatha’s spine. “Told you this was a good idea.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hummed, her lips ghosting over Rio’s throat, lingering there, teasing. “You’re trouble, you know that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s laugh was soft, breathy, her fingers threading through Agatha’s damp hair, tugging lightly until their mouths met. The kiss was slow at first, a languid exploration, but quickly deepened into something more desperate, more consuming. Water drummed against their skin as they lost themselves in each other, hands roaming, bodies molding together like they were made to fit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands roamed over Rio’s front and down her curves, trailing down the curve of Rio’s back, over the swell of her hips, before pulling her flush against her. Rio gasped into the kiss, her body arching instinctively, pressing into the heat of Agatha’s touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tension from their earlier conversation melted away entirely, replaced by the tender, electric connection they shared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Rio whispered, her voice raw with need.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That was all it took.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha moved with purpose, her touch reverent and sure, her fingers tracing every dip, every curve, as if committing Rio’s body to memory all over again. Rio melted under her, gasping, grasping, her nails biting into Agatha’s shoulders as she surrendered completely, letting the pleasure consume her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They moved together, finding their rhythm, their breaths mingling and their bodies perfectly in sync, the intimacy between them growing with every passing moment, their whispers and gasps drowned out by the sound of the water around them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they reached their peak, Rio clung to Agatha, one hand around her neck, her head resting on the older woman’s shoulder as a wave of euphoria washed over her. Agatha held her close, her arms around Rio’s waist, holding her up, her lips brushing over Rio’s temple, her voice a soft murmur of adoration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You are a goddess,” Agatha whispered against her skin, her voice filled with something deeper than desire—something raw, something devoted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio lifted her head, her dark eyes meeting Agatha’s, unguarded and blazing with emotion. “And you’re my queen.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stood like that for a while, bodies pressed together, chests rising and falling in unison, letting the water wash away the last remnants of tension, leaving only bliss in its wake. Eventually, they cleaned up, their movements slower now, more relaxed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they stepped out of the shower, wrapped in towels and grinning at each other, the stress of the morning was nothing more than a distant memory. They were ready to face whatever came next—together.</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The atmosphere in Dean Montgomery’s office was formal, the air heavy with the weight of the discussion ahead, quiet, save for the ticking of a clock on the wall. Agatha and Rio sat side by side, across from him, their hands clasped tightly under the desk where the dean couldn’t see. Though they’d prepared for this moment, it didn’t make the anticipation any easier.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dean adjusted his glasses, leaning forward slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“All right, Dr. Harkness, Ms. Vidal,” he said, his tone expectant. “You requested this meeting. What can I do for you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a breath, her voice steady and professional. “Dean Montgomery, thank you for meeting with us. We’ve come here to disclose something regarding our relationship.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dean’s brows furrowed slightly, curiosity sharpening his gaze. “Go on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced at Agatha, who gave her a subtle nod of encouragement. “Dr. Harkness and I… are in a personal relationship,” Rio said, her voice firm but respectful. “We felt it was important to be transparent about it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, the dean simply regarded them, his expression unreadable. Then he sat back, interlacing his fingers, his eyes sharp. “So, let me get this straight. You’re here to disclose that the two of you are in a romantic relationship?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Agatha said evenly, her voice calm and steady. She had perfected that tone, the one that exuded confidence and competence, but even so, Rio could feel a slight tension in her grip. “We wanted to ensure full transparency. We’re aware of the university’s policies and the ethical expectations in situations like this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“When did this start?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha answered immediately. “Several months ago, sir. We’ve kept our relationship entirely separate from our professional roles, ensuring there’s no overlap or conflict of interest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Montgomery nodded, his expression unreadable, his eyes flickering between the two of them, measuring his words. “I appreciate your honesty, but you’re aware that relationships between faculty and students—especially when one is directly supervising the other—can be problematic. There are recommendations in place for this very reason.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a breath and spoke, her voice unwavering. “We completely understand the concerns, Dean Montgomery. However, we’ve been very careful to keep our personal relationship separate from our professional one. Dr. Harkness has always been—and continues to be—an incredible mentor to me. Dr. Harkness has been nothing but professional. My progress and evaluations have been handled with complete fairness, and she holds me accountable for everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha added, “I’ve made certain to maintain professionalism in all matters regarding Rio’s PhD work. Our relationship has not, and will not, affect her progress or compromise the integrity of my supervision. Her outstanding presentation at the latest conference, where she was an invited speaker, serves as evidence of this. The numerous assessments of her work, all aligning with my earlier observations, speak for themselves. »</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dean let out a small sigh, tapping his fingers on the desk. “I don’t doubt the quality of Miss Vidal’s work. The concern isn’t just about fairness, though that’s certainly a part of it. It’s also about perception. Others might assume bias, even if there isn’t any.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded. “We’ve been discreet precisely because we understand the importance of avoiding even the appearance of impropriety. We’re not trying to flaunt our relationship—we simply want to be upfront about it now to avoid any misunderstandings later. We’ve kept our relationship private, and our priority has always been maintaining the integrity of my work and Dr. Harkness’s role as my supervisor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Montgomery sighed, his gaze softening slightly as he glanced between them. “You’re both aware this is highly unconventional, but…” He paused, then leaned forward. “It’s clear you’ve thought this through, and I trust Dr. Harkness’s judgment as both a faculty member and a supervisor. However, I’ll have to set some boundaries. Agatha, I expect you to ensure there’s no favoritism. Your role is to provide Miss Vidal with the best supervision possible, as you would for any student.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Agatha said firmly. “We’re bringing this to your attention now because we don’t want there to be any misunderstandings or surprises down the line. We value the trust the university places in us, and we’re committed to upholding it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dean Montgomery nodded, before continuing. “And Miss Vidal,” he said, turning to her, “I trust you’ll hold her accountable and not hesitate to speak up if anything feels amiss. If at any point you feel there’s an imbalance or issue, I expect you to bring it to my attention immediately.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will,” Rio promised.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dean gave a small nod, his tone softening further. “As long as you maintain professionalism and avoid public displays of your relationship while you’re both at the university, I don’t see a reason to interfere. But I’ll say this: tread carefully. You’re both taking a risk by being in this situation. But you’re both consenting adults, and as long as this doesn’t interfere with the academic or professional standards of the university, I won’t intervene. Just… be careful.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha offered a small, genuine smile. “Thank you, Dean Montgomery. We won’t let you down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio echoed the sentiment. “Thank you for your understanding.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they left the office, the door clicking shut behind them, Rio let out a deep breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. Agatha reached over, squeezing her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, that wasn’t a complete disaster.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, brushing a hand down the sleeve of Rio’s blazer. “That went better than expected,” she murmured, her lips quirking in a small, relieved smile. “He handled it better than I expected. I’m glad we did it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, her eyes twinkling. “Speak for yourself. My heart was about to leap out of my chest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her voice warm. “That’s why I did most of the talking.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her own smile spreading. “Yeah. Now we just have to keep doing what we’ve been doing, but more freely.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, her voice warm. “Piece of cake.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, the tension in her chest loosening. “At least now we don’t have to feel like we’re sneaking around completely in the dark.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave her a thoughtful look as they walked down the hallway. “We agreed it would stay private, but not a secret anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile widened. “I like the sound of that. I mean, we’re not broadcasting it to the world, but if people notice or ask… we don’t have to lie.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached out, briefly brushing Rio’s fingers with her own before pulling her hand back, ever mindful of where they were. “Exactly. It’s about being honest, not flaunting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, the sound lighter than before. “Well, I doubt Alice will be able to keep a straight face now. She’s been holding this in like a dam about to burst.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked. “Let’s just hope she doesn’t start telling stories about how she ‘knew it all along.’ I have to admit, I’ll miss the whole sneaking around thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, Dr. Harkness, who said that part was all over? I think I like being the naughty student stealing kisses from her illustrious professor.” Rio teased, her voice low, leaning closer to Agatha, who only responded with a slight pull of Rio’s ponytail, her eyes playful and a tad darker.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s laugh was a quiet, joyous thing, and for the first time in what felt like weeks, she felt truly at ease in this building. They walked side by side down the corridor, their steps in sync, knowing that while the weight of secrecy hadn’t entirely lifted, the burden felt infinitely lighter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment Agatha, Rio, and Nicky stepped into Lilia’s cozy home that night, the warm, inviting smell of roasted vegetables and herbs greeted them. Nicky eagerly kicked off his sneakers and bounded into the living room where Lilia was waiting with open arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There’s my favorite little guy!” Lilia said warmly, leaning down to hug Nicky. “A little birdie told me I made your favorite—mashed potatoes. And there’s dessert after.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dessert?” Nicky’s eyes lit up. “What kind?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia winked conspiratorially. “Chocolate cake with extra icing on top. But don’t tell the others I told you before dinner.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, shooting a gleeful glance back at Rio and Agatha as if he’d just been let in on the world’s greatest secret.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned toward Rio, whispering with a chuckle, “It’s like they’ve known each other for years.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She has that effect,” Rio said, smiling softly. “She’s magic.” Rio then raised her voice, sighing dramatically. “Look, she’s already forgotten all about me”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia turned to the two women with a teasing smile. “As if I could. Come here, girl, before you lose all your chocolate privileges in this house,” she said, holding her arms open invitingly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yep, wouldn’t risk it,” Rio laughed as she stepped into Lilia’s warm embrace, the older woman pressing a maternal kiss to her forehead. With a playful smile, Lilia freed one arm to gesture toward Agatha, who was watching the scene with fondness in her eyes. “You too, Agatha—this house has standards, you know!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled and joined in, a little tenser than Rio, but the smile on her face betrayed her true feelings about this new dynamic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">During dinner, Nicky sat close to Lilia, chattering away about school and the Lego flower set he’d built with Rio. Lilia listened intently, nodding and laughing in all the right places. She was patient with his every tangent and question, utterly charmed by his endless enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Halfway through the meal, Lilia dabbed her mouth with a napkin and leaned in conspiratorially. “Nicky, do you want to know something funny about your Rio when she was your age… well a bit older, but who cares?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned softly, already anticipating the stories. “Lilia—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, hush,” Lilia teased with a playful grin. “It’s nothing too embarrassing, I promise.” Turning back to Nicky, a mischievous glint sparkled in her eye. “When Rio was about twelve—she wasn’t living with me yet, but she’d visit sometimes when her foster family couldn’t keep her—she decided she was going to build a fort in the backyard using sticks and a tarp. She was so determined that she stayed out there in the rain until it was finished.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes widened. “Did it work?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sort of,” Lilia said with a laugh. “It stayed up long enough for her to sit inside for maybe five minutes before it collapsed completely. She was soaked through, muddy, and grinning ear to ear when she came inside.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky laughed so hard he nearly toppled his glass of water. “That’s so cool! Rio, you were like an adventurer!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, but a smile tugged at her lips as she reminisced about one of her fondest childhood memories—a rare treasure from a time when such moments were few and far between. “Yeah, an adventurer who caught a cold for two weeks afterward.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s what you get for being stubborn as a mule,” Lilia teased, nudging her affectionately.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The stories continued throughout the evening, each one more entertaining than the last. Lilia talked about Rio’s teenage years, her early love for music, and even a story about how Rio once tried to bake cookies and forgot the sugar entirely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the end of the night, Nicky was firmly attached to Lilia, declaring, “Lilia you’re the best in the world? Rio was right, you’re the coolest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, sweetheart,” Lilia said, patting his hand, “she was right about you too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at Rio, her heart swelling at the sight of the family they were creating—one bound not just by blood but by choice, love, and laughter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s amazing,” Agatha said softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s always been my home,” Rio replied, leaning her head briefly against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And now,” Agatha murmured, her voice tender, “she’s part of ours too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Throughout the evening, Lilia’s affection for Rio shone brighter than ever. She brushed a stray strand of hair from Rio’s face as they sat side by side on the couch after dinner, her gaze warm and maternal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve come so far, my girl,” Lilia said softly, her voice thick with emotion. “From that stubborn little adventurer building forts in the rain to this incredible woman everyone here is so proud of.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed, and she ducked her head slightly, but the small, vulnerable smile she gave in return said everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t be here without you,” Rio said, her voice quiet. “You’re the reason I know what love and home feel like.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, sweetheart,” Lilia murmured, pulling Rio into a hug. “You’ve always had that light in you. I just gave it a place to shine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, watching the exchange, felt her chest tighten with emotion. Seeing Rio so at ease, so cherished, was a rare and beautiful sight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the night wore on, Lilia’s warmth extended toward Agatha too. While Rio and Nicky were engrossed in building an impromptu card tower on the coffee table, Lilia leaned toward Agatha with a knowing look.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s happy,” Lilia said, her tone soft but pointed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha met her gaze, her voice steady. “I’ll do everything I can to keep it that way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I believe you,” Lilia replied, her hand reaching out to rest lightly on Agatha’s arm. “I wasn’t sure at first—not because of who you are, but because of what she’s been through. But seeing her like this, seeing the way she lights up when you’re around… I can see she’s safe with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha swallowed, feeling a swell of gratitude and responsibility. “She’s changed my life too. I don’t take her—or this—lightly.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, giving Agatha’s arm a small squeeze. “Good. Because if you ever hurt her, you’ll have to answer to me.” Her voice held a teasing lilt, but her eyes carried a protective gleam.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t expect anything less,” Agatha replied with a chuckle, though she meant every word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later, as they prepared to leave, Lilia hugged Rio tightly, whispering something in her ear that made Rio smile and nod. To Agatha’s surprise, Lilia then turned to her, pulling her into a hug as well.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re family now, too,” Lilia said, her voice warm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, momentarily speechless. She returned the hug, murmuring a soft, “Thank you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they prepared to leave, Nicky tugged gently on Lilia’s sleeve, his wide eyes peering up at her with earnestness. Lilia crouched to meet his gaze, her ever-present warmth radiating in her smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What is it, sweetheart?” she asked softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky glanced toward Rio and Agatha, as though to ensure they were within earshot but not entirely paying attention. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, you can.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well…” He hesitated, fidgeting with his hands. “I don’t have a grandma. But you’re kinda like Rio’s mom, right? And since Rio loves my mom, does that mean you could maybe… be my grandma?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room fell into a stunned but tender silence. Lilia blinked, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. Her hands cupped Nicky’s small, eager face as a beaming smile spread across her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, Nicky,” she murmured, her voice thick with emotion. “I would be honored to be your grandma. If that’s okay if your Mama, of course.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really?” Nicky asked, his face lighting up with joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really,” she assured him, pulling him into a warm embrace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky turned his small face toward Agatha, his expression still tinged with hesitation but brimming with so much hope that Agatha felt her heart nearly burst. “Of course, my love. Lilia can be whatever you want her to be,” she said, her voice catching slightly in her throat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For so long, it had just been the two of them, and Agatha had always felt a twinge of sadness that she couldn’t give Nicky the kind of big, loving family she had always dreamed of for him. But now, seeing him surrounded by people who cared for him as deeply as she did, she felt an overwhelming gratitude for the life she was building with the woman beside her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As her hand tightened in Rio’s, Agatha’s heart swelled with thankfulness for this unexpected, beautiful love that had brought so much more to her son’s world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, hugging her tightly. “Thank you, you’re the best! I’ll come up with the very best name for you, I promise!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Beside her, Rio felt her throat tighten, a lump forming as she watched the exchange unfold. Agatha’s hand slid higher up her arm, giving it a gentle squeeze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You okay?” Agatha asked softly, her voice full of quiet affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her voice trembling slightly when she finally answered. “Yeah. More than okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia turned toward them, her gaze warm and filled with pride. “That right there—that’s the best gift you could ever give me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Unable to hold back any longer, Rio surged forward, throwing her arms around Lilia’s neck. “I love you, Lilia. You have no idea how much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled, wrapping her arms around Rio in a firm embrace. “Oh, I know, sweetheart. Because I love you just as much. You’re my sweet, kind, brilliant girl, and I couldn’t be prouder of you—for everything you’ve built and everything you’ve become.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio finally pulled back, a single tear had escaped down her cheek, and Lilia brushed it away with her thumb. “Now, go back to your girl and your boy, my love. I’ll always be here for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her chest warm with emotion as she returned to Agatha, who greeted her back with a soft smile and wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her close. On her other side, a small hand slipped into hers, and Rio looked down to see Nicky leaning against her, his eyes shining with joy as he smiled up at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In that moment, Rio knew she truly had it all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they left with more containers of cookies and leftover than they could eat, Nicky waved enthusiastically at Lilia from the car, shouting, “Bye, Lilia! See you soon!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia stood on the porch, waving back with a hand pressed to her heart, her smile soft and full of love. “See you soon, sweetheart. Bye my loves.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For Rio, it was the perfect end to an already perfect evening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>              (T.S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a crisp, sunny afternoon, and the park thirty minutes away from campus buzzed with the laughter of children and the hum of life. Rio, Agatha, and Nicky stood in the middle of it all, a little island of happiness. Nicky chased after a kite he’d begged them to help him fly, his shrieks of joy filling the air as it danced in the wind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya had been passing by the park on her way to a nearby coffee shop when the scene caught her eye. She stopped short, her heart twisting at the sight. There was Rio, the Rio she once knew—vibrant, alive, and glowing. But it wasn’t for her anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood beside Agatha, leaning into her with a grin as they watched him. Agatha reached for Rio’s hand, their fingers intertwining effortlessly. She turned to press a soft kiss against Rio’s cheek, murmuring something that made Rio laugh, her face lighting up with the kind of unguarded joy Maya hadn’t seen in years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her gaze darkened as she watched Agatha’s hand linger on Rio’s waist, their bodies naturally leaning into each other. Nicky darted toward them, excitedly holding the kite’s spool, and Rio crouched down to meet him, ruffling his hair as he beamed at her. Agatha smiled at them, her expression so full of love it made Maya’s chest ache.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From a distance, Maya’s jaw tightened. How dare Rio move on so completely, so happily, while she was left with nothing but bitterness and regret?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her resentment simmered as she looked away from the idyllic scene. But an idea began to take shape in her mind, fueled by jealousy and an overwhelming need to regain some semblance of control.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“If Rio wants to flaunt her perfect little life,” Maya thought bitterly, “then I’ll make sure everyone sees the cracks in her perfect facade.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t know what she would do just yet, but she was certain of one thing: Rio Vidal’s downfall would be hers to orchestrate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she looked on a little longer, Maya’s eyes narrowed as the realization dawned. She recognized Agatha—not just as the elegant woman who now had Rio’s heart, but as <em>Dr. Agatha Harkness</em>, a prominent professor at the university.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mouth fell open slightly in disbelief. She wasn’t just watching Rio with some new lover; she was watching Rio with her professor. The woman who stood at the front of lecture halls, commanding respect and admiration. The woman whose name was spoken with reverence in academic circles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This wasn’t just a relationship—it was <em>scandalous</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s shock deepened as she took in the scene: Agatha casually brushing a lock of Rio’s hair out of her face, Nicky tugging on Rio’s hand to get her attention, the three of them radiating warmth and love like a little family.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her stomach churned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Unbelievable,” she muttered under her breath.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s mind raced. If this relationship was public knowledge, it would raise questions—serious ones. Rio was a PhD student, after all. Agatha was her supervisor. That kind of relationship was a minefield of ethical complications.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, here they were, openly affectionate, completely at ease, as though they hadn’t a care in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They think they’re so untouchable,” Maya thought bitterly, her resentment bubbling to the surface. She felt humiliated all over again—discarded by Rio, who had moved on not just to anyone, but to someone so <em>powerful</em>, someone completely out of Maya’s league.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her hands curled into fists at her sides as she turned away from the idyllic scene. “If Rio wants to play this game, I’ll make sure it doesn’t end well for her—or for her precious professor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bitterness swelled as Maya began to walk away, her mind already plotting. This wasn’t just jealousy—it was an opportunity. And Maya was determined to use it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya knocked sharply on Agatha’s office door the next morning, each rap echoing with her simmering anger and sense of righteous vindication. Her heart pounded in her chest as she prepared for the confrontation, rehearsing her words in her head like a mantra. The brisk, authoritative “Come in” that came from the other side of the door didn’t deter her—it only fueled her determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Squaring her shoulders, Maya pushed the door open and stepped inside. Agatha was seated at her desk, her long fingers gracefully holding a pen poised over a stack of papers. Her sharp blue eyes lifted from her work, locking onto Maya with a practiced calm that only seemed to intensify Maya’s frustration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ms. Reyes,” Agatha greeted evenly, her voice smooth as silk as she set her pen down and folded her hands on the desk. “What can I do for you?” There was no warmth in her tone, but also no hostility—just a measured neutrality that somehow managed to unnerve Maya.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door clicked shut behind her as Maya closed it with a bit more force than necessary. She folded her arms tightly across her chest, her stance confrontational. “We need to talk about Rio,” she began, her voice sharp with accusation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brow arched slightly, her expression unflinching as she leaned back in her chair with the composure of someone who had weathered countless storms. “Alright,” she replied, her tone calm but laced with a quiet steel that warned Maya she was treading on dangerous ground. “Go on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya took a step closer to the desk, her confidence building as her indignation bubbled to the surface. “It’s clear to anyone paying attention that she’s been getting special treatment,” she said, her words pointed, as though each one was meant to pierce Agatha’s calm exterior. “And we both know why. You’re her supervisor—and more. That’s unethical, Dr. Harkness. You’re taking advantage of her position as your student.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked slowly, her expression as calm and unreadable as a still lake, though the faintest flicker of surprise danced in her eyes. She didn’t flinch, didn’t fidget. Instead, she folded her hands neatly on the desk, her posture poised and unshaken. The power in her composure was palpable, and it only made Maya’s anger burn hotter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you implying,” Agatha began, her tone glacially cool, “that Miss Vidal’s success is due to anything other than her brilliance and relentless hard work?” Her voice carried a deliberate calm, but there was an unmistakable edge beneath the surface—a warning, sharp and quiet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s jaw tightened, her arms crossing defensively over her chest. “I’m saying it’s impossible to know if it’s all fair when you’re clearly involved with her,” she shot back, her voice sharp enough to cut glass.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips twitched ever so slightly, not quite forming a smile. It was the kind of expression that spoke of someone utterly unimpressed by the accusations being hurled at her. She leaned forward slightly, her steely gaze locked on Maya, who suddenly felt very small despite her attempt to project confidence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let me be perfectly clear, Ms. Reyes,” Agatha said, her voice dropping to a low, deliberate register that sent a chill down Maya’s spine. “Miss Vidal’s work stands entirely on its own merit. She is one of the most promising students I’ve had the pleasure to supervise, and if you believe otherwise, I would suggest taking that up with your own supervisor. If you’re not performing at the level you’d like, it might be worth examining your own efforts rather than deflecting onto someone else. Redirecting your frustrations onto others will not elevate your own performance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words were delivered with surgical precision, each one cutting deeper than the last. Maya’s face flushed crimson, a mix of embarrassment and rage bubbling just beneath the surface.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re crossing a line,” Maya snapped, her voice rising slightly. “You’re her professor! Her supervisor! How do I know you’re not—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not what?” Agatha interrupted, her tone sharp enough to slice through Maya’s indignation. She rose slowly from her chair, her commanding presence towering over the younger woman even as her movements remained measured and calm. Her dark blue eyes pinned Maya in place, unflinching and unyielding. “Do choose your next words carefully, Ms. Reyes. I’d hate for you to dig yourself into a hole you can’t climb out of.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya faltered, her mouth opening and closing as if searching for the right response. The confidence she’d brought into the room was quickly slipping through her fingers, evaporating under Agatha’s unrelenting gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m saying,” Maya finally managed, though her voice wavered slightly, “that it’s inappropriate for you to—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised a hand, commanding silence with the kind of presence that seemed to freeze the air itself. Her voice, low and sharp, sliced through Maya’s words like a blade. “Stop right there.” The authority in her tone left no room for interruption. “I understand your frustration, but I will not tolerate unfounded accusations. Let me make something abundantly clear—I am acutely aware of my professional responsibilities, and I have upheld them without fault.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She leaned forward slightly, her piercing blue eyes locking onto Maya with an intensity that could shatter stone. “If you feel the need to question my integrity, by all means, take your concerns to the ethics committee. But I strongly advise you to come prepared with more than vague accusations and baseless assumptions, because I assure you, there will be consequences for slander.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s mouth opened, as if to speak, but Agatha pressed on, her voice now carrying a steely edge. “For your information, Miss Vidal and I disclosed our relationship to the dean from the very beginning. The administration is fully aware, and they are entirely satisfied with our conduct. My professional conduct has been, and will continue to be, beyond reproach. I treat Rio no differently than any other student in the program, except for holding her to the highest academic standards—as I would anyone under my guidance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya faltered, the heat of her indignation cooling for a brief moment as doubt crept into her expression. “So you’re telling me there’s absolutely nothing inappropriate about this?” she asked, her tone laced with skepticism but notably quieter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head ever so slightly, her gaze unwavering. “That is precisely what I’m telling you,” she said, her voice even and deliberate, like the strike of a gavel. “And if you still harbor concerns, I encourage you to take them to the dean. However, let me offer you a piece of advice—baseless allegations designed to tarnish reputations often have a way of reflecting poorly on the accuser, not the accused.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s face flushed with anger and humiliation as Agatha’s sharp words cut through her indignation. She took a step forward, her posture stiff, and spat, “You think she’s so brilliant? So perfect? You don’t know her like I do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brow arched, her composure unshaken, though the faintest flicker of something dangerous danced in her icy blue eyes. “Enlighten me, then,” she said, her voice calm and clipped, daring Maya to continue.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya sneered, leaning forward to drive her point home. “Rio’s not as put together as you think. She’s impulsive, reckless. She’ll run herself into the ground chasing something she can’t ever reach. I’ve seen it happen. She’s needy, and when you stop giving her exactly what she wants, she’ll crumble – or worse, she’ll turn on you. Just wait.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s jaw tightened ever so slightly, but her expression remained a mask of calm. Her silence only seemed to infuriate Maya further.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You sound bitter, Ms. Reyes,” Agatha finally replied, her words measured and deliberate. “I wonder why that might be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya faltered, but she pushed on, her voice rising. “Bitter? I’m being honest. She’s exhausting, isn’t she? Always needing validation, always pushing too hard. I don’t know what you see in her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood slowly, the air in the room seeming to chill. Her full height towered over Maya, and her presence became a wall of silent authority.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What I see,” Agatha began, her voice soft but as cold and cutting as winter frost, “is someone extraordinary. Someone brilliant, passionate, and resilient. Someone who has faced and overcome more than you could ever begin to comprehend. Whatever bitterness you’re clinging to, Ms. Reyes, I suggest you address it elsewhere. It will find no audience here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s mouth opened, a retort clearly forming on her lips, but Agatha pressed on, her voice now carrying the weight of unshakable finality.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Your words,” she continued, “speak volumes—not about Rio, but about you. Your insecurities. Your failures. Your inability to see beyond your own grievances. It’s not Rio who needs validation, Ms. Reyes. It’s you. Perhaps you should take some time to reflect on why that is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The color drained from Maya’s face, her confidence visibly shaken. Yet, despite her wounded pride, she squared her shoulders, clinging stubbornly to the last shreds of her indignation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You can’t protect her forever,” Maya hissed, her voice trembling with frustration. “This isn’t over.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze never wavered, her expression as cold and impenetrable as stone. “On the contrary, Ms. Reyes,” she said, her tone steady and final. “This conversation is over. You may leave now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya hesitated, her pride warring with the weight of Agatha’s words. Finally, with no retort strong enough to match Agatha’s quiet authority, she turned sharply on her heel and stormed out, the door slamming shut behind her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha remained standing for a moment, her gaze fixed on the closed door, her expression unreadable. Slowly, she exhaled, her body relaxing ever so slightly. Her thoughts drifted to Rio, to the fire and brilliance that Maya had failed to see. A faint smile tugged at the corners of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">If Maya thought her words would plant even the smallest seed of doubt, she had clearly underestimated just how deeply Agatha believed in the woman she loved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She allowed herself a small sigh. But it wasn’t frustration—it was determination. She had no doubt Maya would try to stir trouble, but she trusted that she and Rio would handle it, together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled slowly, her fingers brushing against the edge of her desk as she composed herself. A small, wry smile tugged at the corner of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Needy and impulsive, of course,” she scoffed, thinking of Rio with nothing but fondness. “As if I’d want her any other way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words carried warmth, a private acknowledgment of the quirks and complexities that made Rio who she was. Agatha sat back down, her posture poised yet relaxed, her fingertips tapping a thoughtful rhythm against the armrest of her chair. Her gaze lingered on the closed door for a moment, the remnants of the confrontation replaying in her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had no intention of telling Rio about this. It wasn’t a matter of secrecy but of protection. Agatha knew Rio too well—knew how the words of someone like Maya would land. Rio would bristle with anger, frustration simmering just beneath the surface, but it wouldn’t end there. She’d internalize the venom, letting it gnaw at her confidence even as she outwardly dismissed it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She doesn’t need this,” Agatha said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. The protectiveness in her tone was unmistakable, a fierce determination hardening her expression. She would not let Maya’s bitterness seep into the vibrant light that was Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She gathered her thoughts, already formulating the plan for their next meeting. Instead of burdening Rio with this unnecessary stress, she would channel her energy into supporting her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After all, the best way to silence people like Maya was to ensure that Rio continued to thrive. Her brilliance was undeniable, her determination unmatched—and Agatha was determined to protect her from anything that might dim her light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that day, when Rio knocked on her office door, Agatha’s face immediately softened, the sharp professionalism she wore for the world melting into the warmth she reserved for Rio alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There’s my favorite PhD student,” Agatha greeted, her tone light but her eyes glowing with unmistakable fondness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped inside, her usual energy radiating like sunlight through the room. She arched a brow, a playful grin tugging at her lips. “Favorite? Aren’t you not supposed to have favorites? Sounds like favoritism to me,” she teased, though the faint blush dusting her cheeks betrayed how much the words meant to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, rising gracefully from her chair and leaning casually against the edge of her desk. “Ah, that’s something the professor never tells,” she countered with a teasing lilt. “And besides, rules are for those too timid to bend them.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, her voice rich and infectious, and Agatha couldn’t help but let her own smile linger a little longer. The sound seemed to wash away the lingering tension from the morning’s confrontation, replacing it with something lighter, brighter—a reminder of why she fought so fiercely to protect what they had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio settled into the chair across from her, pulling out notes and speaking animatedly about her latest research progress, Agatha found herself watching her with quiet admiration. Rio’s hands moved as she spoke, her passion and enthusiasm evident in every word. It was this fire, this unrelenting drive, that had captivated Agatha from the beginning—not just Rio’s brilliance, but the way she poured her entire being into everything she cared about.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha listened intently, offering her thoughts and suggestions where needed, but part of her mind was elsewhere, replaying the bitter accusations Maya had hurled earlier. None of it mattered, not really—not when the truth sat right here in front of her. Rio’s success wasn’t some product of favoritism; it was earned, every single ounce of it, through hard work, talent, and sheer determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, Agatha felt the weight of her own silent promise pressing on her heart. She would shield Rio from the ugliness that others tried to bring into her orbit. Maya’s bitterness, her baseless accusations, were nothing in the face of what Rio deserved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio wrapped up her explanation, looking to Agatha with that familiar mix of excitement and vulnerability, Agatha reached forward, placing a hand lightly over Rio’s. “You’re doing incredible work,” she said, her voice low but steady. “Don’t ever let anyone convince you otherwise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, momentarily startled by the gravity in Agatha’s tone, but then her expression softened, and she smiled—a quiet, genuine smile that made Agatha’s chest ache with pride. “Thank you,” Rio said softly, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s in a moment that felt too big for words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha straightened, reclaiming her professional air with ease, though the tenderness in her eyes remained. “Now,” she said, her tone lighter, “let’s fine-tune your argument here. It’s good, but you can push it further. And you’re more than capable of it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, pulling out her pen. “Always pushing me,” she teased. “One of these days, you’ll make me perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk returned. “Not perfect, love. Just extraordinary. But you’re already most of the way there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as they dove back into their work, the warmth in the room seemed to wrap around them both, a quiet refuge from the world outside. Agatha silently reaffirmed her vow: nothing would dim Rio’s light. Not while she had anything to say about it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The hallway was eerily quiet as Rio walked toward the library, her thoughts consumed with ideas for her latest thesis revision. Her mind hummed with possibilities, so she didn’t notice Maya standing just around the corner until the words sliced through the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The voice was sweet, almost too sweet—laced with a bite Rio couldn’t quite ignore. She froze, her spine stiffening at the sound of Maya’s deliberate tone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What do you want?” Rio’s voice was already thick with irritation, the weariness evident in her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya stepped forward, her smile tight and calculated. She tilted her head in mock curiosity, the innocence in her expression so exaggerated it could have been comical. “Oh, just thought we should talk. I had the <em>most</em> fascinating conversation with your <em>girlfriend</em>, Dr. Harkness.” She let the words hang in the air. “Wow, Rio. You’re really dating up, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s jaw clenched, the muscles in her neck tightening. She took a slow, steadying breath. “Did you, now?” she replied, her voice tinged with the sharp edge of restraint.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s smile grew, a mix of smugness and satisfaction. “Mm-hmm,” she hummed, the sound so self-satisfied it made Rio’s skin crawl. “She’s really… protective of you. You’d almost think she was your knight in shining armor, wouldn’t you? Always swooping in to save the day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s patience thinned by the second, but Maya wasn’t finished. She leaned in closer, her voice lowering, each word dripping with venom. “Or maybe it’s just a savior complex. You always did attract people who wanted to <em>fix</em> you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A flash of anger ignited in Rio, but she forced herself to stay calm, folding her arms across her chest. “If you’re done wasting my time—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Maya wasn’t finished. Of course she wasn’t. With an almost gleeful grin, Maya leaned in even closer, her breath cold against Rio’s ear. “You know, it’s funny. Moving from me to your professor?” She let the words roll off her tongue like a deliberate poison. “What’s that, some kind of Freudian thing? Mommy issues, maybe?” She paused, as if savoring the very suggestion, before adding, “What would Lilia think? You should probably look into therapy, Rio. God knows you need it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words stung, landing like a slap. Rio’s heart pounded in her chest, but she kept her posture rigid, determined not to let Maya see how deeply those insults cut. Maya’s taunts were meant to provoke, to make her question herself, but Rio knew better than to let them stick.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maya’s smirk grew. “And Dr. Harkness, really? Honestly, she looks like an old, crazy, frigid bitch. You’re kidding yourself if you think this little… fling is going to last. She’ll toss you aside as soon as she’s bored. Maybe that’s what you’re used to, though.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The venom in Maya’s words struck harder than Rio wanted to admit. Her face flushed with a rush of hurt and fury, the familiar sting of past insecurities gnawing at her. But she wouldn’t give Maya the satisfaction of seeing her flinch, of letting her see the cracks that Maya always seemed to find.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Taking a slow, steadying breath, Rio straightened her spine, her eyes narrowing. She met Maya’s gaze head-on, her voice cold and unwavering. “You don’t know a damn thing about me or Agatha. Whatever bitterness you’re holding onto from your own pathetic life, keep it to yourself. I’m done with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned to leave, but Maya still wasn’t done.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, Rio, you’re so predictable,” Maya sneered, taking a step forward. “Always running away. Just like you did with us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung in the air like a challenge, and Rio whipped around so fast it almost startled herself. Her voice dropped to a deadly whisper, but it was sharp and filled with every ounce of emotion she’d been holding back. “If I ran, it’s because you were toxic and horrible to me. And now you’re just proving it all over again. Stay the hell out of my life, Maya. You’re nothing but a footnote to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without another word, Rio turned on her heel, her footsteps quick and purposeful as she walked away, her heart pounding in her chest. Maya’s insults still lingered, but Rio refused to let them fester.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As her anger simmered, another thought began to creep in, its weight sinking deeper into her chest. Why hadn’t Agatha told her about the confrontation with Maya? It wasn’t like her to keep things from her—not with something so… personal. The idea of Agatha withholding something nagged at her, stoking a new fire of uncertainty.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Rio reached her apartment, the emotional storm had intensified. Hurt, betrayal, and lingering anger all tangled together, threatening to overwhelm her. She slammed her bag down on the table, the sound of it echoing through the room. Her phone was still clutched in her hand, and her fingers hovered over Agatha’s contact, unsure whether to call or wait.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No,” Rio muttered under her breath, the tightness in her chest making it hard to breathe. She needed to calm down, needed to give herself space before she spoke to Agatha. If she didn’t, she feared she might say something she would regret. Something too sharp, too raw to take back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But one thing was clear, as she stood there, the weight of the day pressing down on her: this wasn’t over. Not with Maya, and not with Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tension in Agatha’s living room was thick enough to cut with a knife. The soft hum of the clock on the wall seemed louder than usual, as if it too could feel the weight of the silence between them. Nicky had gone to bed hours ago, leaving Rio and Agatha alone, but instead of the quiet, loving evening Rio had imagined, her frustration had built to a boiling point.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stood by the window for a moment, her gaze unfocused, fighting the urge to shout, to throw words that were too sharp for the moment. But it didn’t help. The anger simmered, refusing to subside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You should have told me,” Rio’s voice cracked through the stillness, sharp and unyielding. She began to pace the room, her arms crossed tightly against her chest, as if trying to hold herself together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, sitting calmly on the couch, exhaled heavily, her posture still relaxed despite the tension. “I didn’t want to upset you unnecessarily,” she said softly, her voice carrying a tired note that didn’t quite mask the weight of her own frustration. “It wasn’t worth stressing you out, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes flashed as she stopped pacing abruptly, spinning on her heel to face her. “Not worth it? Agatha, someone—Maya, no less—walked into your office and accused you of being unethical, of taking advantage of me. Then she had the audacity to throw disgusting insults at you and me, and you didn’t think I deserved to know about any of that?” Her breath came fast, anger and hurt lacing each word as it spilled from her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha frowned, her fingers steepling in front of her. “It wasn’t your problem to deal with. I handled it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio scoffed, the hurt evident in her voice. “You <em>handled</em> it? Agatha, we’re in this together. When someone says something like that about you—or about us—it’s both of our business.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha rose from her spot on the couch, the sharp edge of her composure still intact despite the weight of the conversation. Her tone was measured, but there was a firmness to it that Rio had come to recognize all too well. “And what would you have done, Rio? March into my office and confronted her yourself? I didn’t want you dragged into her petty games.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s not the point!” Rio snapped, her voice growing higher, her hands gesturing wildly. “The point is, you kept me out. You made the decision for me, like I can’t handle it, like I’m some fragile little thing that needs protecting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened, but her voice remained steady. “You’re not fragile, Rio. Far from it. But you’re also juggling so much—your thesis, your band, your dance classes, us. I didn’t want to add unnecessary weight to your shoulders.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face twisted in disbelief, the words she needed to say tumbling out in a rush. “Do you even hear yourself? You’re coddling me, Agatha.” Her voice cracked as she stepped forward, her eyes filling with unshed tears, a mixture of hurt and frustration. “And it makes me feel… small, like you don’t trust me to handle things. That’s not what I need from you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s shoulders sagged, the weight of Rio’s words settling on her like a heavy burden. Each syllable felt like a stone dropped into her chest, and the guilt lingered, making her feel smaller than she ever wanted to be. She had been trying to protect Rio, to shield her from the chaos of it all, but in the process, she’d failed to see that Rio didn’t need protection—she needed honesty.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Stepping closer, Agatha reached out slowly, her hand brushing gently against Rio’s arm as though she were testing the waters. “I’m sorry,” she said softly, her voice raw with emotion. “That wasn’t my intention. I wasn’t trying to make you feel small. I just…” She faltered, the words caught in her throat. “I love you, Rio. And sometimes that love makes me overprotective. I see someone trying to hurt you, and my instinct is to shield you from it. I want to keep you safe from everything, even the things I can’t control.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s expression softened at Agatha’s confession, but the frustration still lingered. “I get that,” she said, the edge of her anger beginning to dull. “I really do. I know you love me, Agatha. And I know you want to protect me. But I’m not a child. I’m not someone who needs to be sheltered from the hard stuff. I’m your partner, and I need to be in this with you. Not just standing on the sidelines while you fight all the battles for me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha swallowed, her throat tight. She could feel the truth of Rio’s words digging into her like a splinter. She had always wanted to protect her—had always believed that keeping Rio out of harm’s way was the right thing to do. But Rio was right. She wasn’t fragile, and she wasn’t someone to be hidden away from the world’s cruelties. Rio needed to be seen, needed to stand beside her, not as someone to be shielded but as someone to face the world with.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her thumb brushing tenderly over Rio’s arm, a silent apology. “You’re right. You’re absolutely right,” she murmured, the weight of the admission settling in. “I should have told you. I should have trusted you with this, and I shouldn’t have made decisions for you. I promise I’ll do better, okay? No more keeping things like this from you. I want you to be a part of it all—good, bad, and everything in between.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a deep breath, her chest rising and falling as she exhaled slowly, the tension slowly leaving her body. She looked into Agatha’s eyes, searching for sincerity, and found it there—a raw, open truth. The anger she’d felt earlier was fading, replaced by something softer, something more understanding. “Okay,” she said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, pressing a gentle, lingering kiss to Rio’s forehead, as if trying to impart her apology through the soft touch. “I’m sorry,” she repeated softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha, pulling her into a tight hug. “Just… don’t keep me out again, okay? I want to be here for you, just like you’re here for me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded against her shoulder, the soft strands of dark hair tickling her cheek. “I won’t. We’re in this together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled back from the hug slightly, her hands resting lightly on Rio’s arms as she studied her face. She searched for any trace of the anger that had been there earlier, but all she found was a quiet sadness, a weariness in Rio’s eyes that hadn’t been there before. “Are we okay?” Agatha asked, her voice gentle but tinged with a quiet worry, as though afraid the answer might still break the fragile peace they had just begun to rebuild.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze softened as she met Agatha’s eyes, offering a small but reassuring smile that didn’t quite reach the depths of her heart but was enough to settle some of Agatha’s anxieties. “We’re fine,” she said, her voice steady but soft. “I’m not mad anymore. I just… need some time to process, you know?” </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. “Of course. Take all the time you need.” She hesitated, as if she wanted to say more, but instead leaned in to kiss Rio’s forehead again, the gesture tender and apologetic. “I’ll be in the bathroom if you need me,” she added softly, her voice low, offering a quiet space for Rio to retreat into if she needed it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, pulling away gently. “I think I’m going to work on my thesis for a bit, clear my head. I’ll just be in the living room.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, though there was a trace of concern and uncertainty in her eyes. “Alright. Are you still staying the night?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, don’t worry, I’m not going to run away.” Rio replied, rolling her eyes slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her eyes lingering on Rio, searching for any sign that she wasn’t okay, but finding only the calmness of a storm passed. She wanted to reach out, to hold Rio again, to reassure her that everything would be fine, but she knew Rio needed space. Still, her concern made it hard to let go. “Don’t stay up too late, okay?” she said, her voice soft but laced with an undeniable tenderness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I won’t,” Rio promised as she turned to head into the living room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once there, she set up her laptop on the coffee table, surrounded by her notes and books. The soft glow of the lamp cast a warm light over the room, but her mind was still swirling. She stared at the blank page of her document for a moment, tapping her pen against her notebook rhythmically.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wasn’t angry anymore—at least not in the way she had been earlier. That sharp, fiery anger had burned out, leaving only the embers of something deeper: hurt. It wasn’t that she doubted Agatha’s love; no, that was as solid and unshakeable as bedrock. What bothered her was the way this entire situation had unfolded, the way it had dredged up old wounds—wounds she had long tried to forget. People, in her past, had always made decisions for her, had always assumed what was best without consulting her. That was what had hurt the most, even now. Not the confrontation with Maya. Not even the way Agatha had handled it, despite her good intentions. It was the echo of something much older, the feeling of being unseen, unheard.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She pushed the thoughts aside, trying to refocus on her thesis, diving into the comforting structure of her work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the quiet, she could hear the water pouring as Agatha was apparently running a bath, and the thought brought a faint smile to her lips. They’d talk more tomorrow, she knew, when emotions weren’t running so high. For now, the rhythmic click of her keyboard and the familiar flow of her thoughts provided solace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Every so often, her gaze flickered toward the hallway leading to the bedroom, and she felt a pang of guilt. Agatha had only been trying to protect her, misguided as it was. She resolved to finish up her work soon—just a little more. Then she would go to Agatha. Because while Rio needed this moment, this time to clear her head, she didn’t want Agatha to feel like she was being shut out. The thought of Agatha alone, waiting for her to come back, made her heart ache. She would finish her work, yes, but she would make sure to be there. The distance between them was temporary—this wasn’t a fight that needed to linger.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sank into the warm water of the tub with a deep sigh, letting the lavender-scented steam rise around her. She rested her head against the edge, the tension in her shoulders gradually easing as the heat worked its magic. But her mind was far from quiet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The image of Rio’s frustrated expression lingered, a dull ache in Agatha’s chest. She knew she’d messed up, even if her intentions had been good. “I’m too old for these kinds of mistakes,” she muttered to herself, running a hand through the damp ends of her hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She was supposed to know better by now. She’d lived through enough, seen enough, to understand that love wasn’t about sheltering the person you cared about from everything that could hurt them—it was about standing beside them, sharing the weight of the world together, even when it wasn’t easy. The thought of Rio feeling betrayed, even in the smallest way, was a heavy burden. Agatha had always promised herself that she would never do that to her, but tonight, it felt like she had broken that vow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound of soft footsteps approaching the bathroom broke her train of thought. She glanced toward the door, half-expecting to hear Rio heading to bed, but instead, the door creaked open. Rio stood there, her arms crossed, a hesitant smile tugging at the corners of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Room for one more?” Rio’s voice was soft, warm, and tentative, as though she wasn’t sure of her own invitation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a small smile, her heart giving a hopeful flutter. “Always. I really hoped you would join me”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze softened at the sight of Agatha, the vulnerability in her expression melting away some of the walls Rio had unconsciously built between them. She stepped further into the room, the quiet rustling of her clothes the only sound as she began to undress. Each layer of clothing fell to the floor in a soft, fluid motion, revealing the lithe, toned silhouette of her body against the gentle glow of the bathroom light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t say anything, just stepped forward, one foot, then the other, into the tub. The water shifted and rising as she sank down, her knees brushing against Agatha’s thighs. She didn’t stop until she was lying fully against her girlfriend, settled between her legs, her cheek pressed to Agatha’s collarbone, her arms loosely draped around her waist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The water lapped gently at their skin as Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio, pulling her close. For a moment, neither of them spoke. The quiet, the warmth of the water, and the shared intimacy of the moment filled the space between them, making everything else feel far away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha signed again, the movement of her chest rippling against Rio’s head, silently thanking her past self for choosing a sizable bathtub. “You know, darling, this bath was supposed to be for one,” she teased, her voice low and affectionate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head slightly, her lips grazing the skin of Agatha’s chest as she replied, “And now it’s better because it’s for two.” Her voice was muffled but carried a touch of playfulness that melted Agatha’s heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The water rippled softly around them as they adjusted, Agatha leaning back further to cradle Rio against her. Rio fit perfectly against her, as if she belonged there, her body warm and light in the water. Agatha’s fingers moved to trace lazy patterns along Rio’s back, the gesture as much for her own comfort as for Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wasn’t really mad,” Rio admitted after a moment, her fingers trailing absentmindedly along Agatha’s knee. “Not at you. I just… I don’t like feeling like I need protecting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed a kiss to the top of Rio’s head. “I know. And I should’ve told you. I just… I wanted to spare you the stress.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head back slightly to look at her. “We’re a team, remember? If you’re dealing with something, I want to know. I’m stronger than you think, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her thumb brushing gently against Rio’s shoulder. “I don’t doubt that for a second. You amaze me every day, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed a little, but she smiled and adjusted herself so her front was flush against Agatha’s and her hands reached up to cup Agatha’s cheeks. “Good. Because you’re stuck with me now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, leaning down to kiss her, the water sloshing gently around them. The kiss was slow and deep, an unspoken apology and a reaffirmation of their love all in one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally pulled apart, Rio rested her head back against Agatha’s chest, closing her eyes. “This is nice,” she murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It is,” Agatha agreed, her voice low and content. “And I promise, no more secrets. We’ll face things together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her fingers playing with Agatha’s hand under the water. “Together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They lay like that in silence for a while, the warmth of the water cocooning them, the soft rise and fall of their breathing syncing naturally. Agatha could feel the tension in Rio’s frame start to ebb away, the younger woman’s body growing heavier in her arms, a sign that she was finally letting go of the stress that had been weighing on her that day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re warm,” Rio murmured after a while, her voice soft and a little sleepy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s the point of a bath,” Agatha replied with a gentle laugh, her chin resting on Rio’s now damp hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hummed in response, a contented sound that made Agatha smile. She shifted slightly, just enough to press a kiss to Rio’s temple, her lips lingering for a moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Stay as long as you like,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely above a murmur.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head up, her dark eyes meeting Agatha’s, a small smile curving her lips. “I wasn’t planning on going anywhere.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her heart full as she tightened her hold on Rio. The water, the warmth, the intimacy of the moment—it was perfect. And as they lay there, the world outside faded away, leaving only them and the quiet, unwavering love that filled the space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of the evening was spent in quiet intimacy, the bathwater cooling but their hearts warm and steady, once again on the same page.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they sat in Agatha’s office after a meeting, Rio leaned back in her chair, her mind still lingering on the discussion about her thesis. The weight of the conversation had left her feeling energized, yet a little drained, and she glanced over at Agatha, who was organizing a few papers on her desk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha caught her gaze and smiled, a warmth in her expression that made Rio’s heart flutter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Agatha began, her tone casual but with a gleam of something in her eyes, “there’s an event coming up that I’ve been invited to. My alma mater is holding a fundraising gala soon, and I thought—” she paused for a beat, her smile turning a little more playful, “—you might want to go with me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the suggestion. “A gala? What kind of gala?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s a formal event,” Agatha replied, her voice carrying a note of something special, as if she were offering an opportunity that didn’t come often. “All the alumni come back to raise money for the school and several charities. It’s outdoors, and it has this magical atmosphere, if you can overlook all the pompous big shots who think they’re the main attraction. It’s a big deal, and it would be the perfect chance for us to go out together, without all the complications.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat as she realized what Agatha was suggesting. Their first official date. The thought sent a wave of warmth through her. She hadn’t expected anything like this, especially after keeping their relationship so low-key for so long.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really?” Rio asked, her voice barely above a whisper as her smile widened. “You want to go with me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, a light, teasing sound. “I mean, I don’t know who else I’d ask,” she said, though there was an undeniable softness to her words. She leaned back in her chair, her eyes locking with Rio’s. “It’ll be far enough from our university that it won’t raise any eyebrows, and we’ll have the chance to be… well, us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart fluttered at the thought. It felt like the perfect step, a chance for them to finally share their love with the world—at least a little bit more openly. And to do so at something so elegant and beautiful, it made the idea even more special.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’d love to,” Rio replied, her voice soft and full of sincerity. “I mean, if it’s not too weird for you, I’m happy to go with you. I can’t believe you want me there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned forward slightly, her gaze softening as she looked at Rio. “You’re not just a plus-one, Rio,” she said, her voice low and warm. “You’re everything to me. And if this is going to be our first official date, I want it to be perfect. I want everyone to see what we mean to each other.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her chest tighten with emotion, her throat going a little dry at Agatha’s words. She’d known, of course, how much Agatha meant to her, but hearing it spoken so openly, so clearly, made everything feel even more real.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m really excited,” Rio said, her smile bright and full of affection. “This is going to be amazing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile deepened, and she stood up, moving around the desk to stand in front of Rio. She held out her hand, and Rio, without a second thought, took it, her fingers fitting perfectly against Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll make sure it’s perfect,” Agatha promised, her voice soft and serious as she held Rio’s gaze. “This is just the beginning of something beautiful, Rio. I’m so proud of you, of us. And I can’t wait to share all of this with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled in her chest, and for a moment, everything else faded away. It was just the two of them, standing together in Agatha’s office, planning their future, their love finally starting to be something they could embrace in the light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m proud of us too,” Rio whispered, squeezing Agatha’s hand gently. “We’re doing this. Together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened, and she leaned in, pressing a brief but tender kiss to Rio’s forehead. “Always together,” she echoed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And in that moment, Rio couldn’t help but feel like they were finally stepping into something bigger than just the two of them. Something they could share with the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The soft chime of the bell at the door echoed as Agatha and Rio stepped into the boutique, one evening after class. It was the day before the charity gala, and both of them needed outfits. Rio had been particularly excited about the event, not just because it was an occasion to dress up but because it was an opportunity for her to feel a little more at ease in the bustling social academic atmosphere. But more than that, she loved seeing Agatha in her element—her girlfriend, confident, elegant, and commanding, even when they were simply picking out clothes for an evening out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they entered the boutique, the air smelled faintly of fresh flowers and subtle perfumes. The store was filled with racks of high-end clothing, each piece exuding a sophistication that made Rio feel both a little out of her element and incredibly excited. Her eyes lit up as she caught sight of a display of beautiful silk dresses in shades of deep emerald, sapphire, and ruby.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha, look at this,” Rio said, pulling her Agatha’s arm and directing her toward the dresses.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze followed Rio’s excitement, a warm smile crossing her lips. She had learned long ago that Rio’s enthusiasm was contagious, and she had grown to appreciate the joy that her lover found in even the simplest things. “I think it’s you who’ll be the one making everyone look twice tomorrow night,” Agatha replied, her eyes already scanning the racks for her own choices. “But go ahead. You’ve earned it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile stretched across her face, and she picked out a dress with a flowing, almost ethereal feel—a soft lavender number with delicate lacework at the bodice and a flowing skirt that would sway elegantly when she moved. The color reminded her of Agatha. She couldn’t wait to try it on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Agatha was already moving between the aisles with her usual precision. Her eye quickly found a tailored deep forest green pantsuit that perfectly matched her imposing presence—structured but elegant, with a silky sheen to it that caught the light in the most flattering way. She ran her fingers along the fabric, admiring its smoothness, and then picked it up with a confident, almost possessive gesture.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be trying this,” Agatha said, her tone leaving little room for debate. Rio chuckled, loving the way Agatha was always sure of her choices.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s my favorite color,” Rio said, her eyes soft.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha slid her free arm around Rio’s waist and leaned over to kiss her temple. “I know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they made their way to the fitting rooms, Rio took one last look at Agatha, who was already scanning the racks for accessories. Even with a simple outfit like a pantsuit, Agatha had a way of making everything look effortlessly chic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the dressing room, Rio tried on her lavender dress first, stepping into the full-length mirror and turning slowly to admire how it hugged her waist before flaring out in soft waves. The lacework on the bodice felt delicate against her skin, and the soft hue of the dress seemed to make her feel lighter. When she stepped out of the fitting room to show Agatha, she couldn’t help but smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha, what do you think?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes scanned Rio from head to toe, and she took a moment to appreciate how beautifully the dress fit her. Her smile softened. “You look stunning,” she said, her voice rich with affection. “But you always do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blushed, looking down for a moment, embarrassed by the praise but also feeling a deep sense of warmth inside. She loved the way Agatha made her feel—like she was always seen, truly seen, even on days when she didn’t feel her best.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you think it’s too much?” Rio asked, her fingers fidgeting nervously with the lace, as she looked at herself in the mirror. “I don’t want to look like I’m trying too hard.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, placing her hands on Rio’s shoulders from behind, grounding her with the simple touch. “No,” she said firmly, locking eyes with her. “You’re perfect. You don’t need to try. You shine no matter what you wear.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart fluttered at the sincerity in Agatha’s voice. The dress, the event, the pressure of it being their first public outing together—it didn’t matter as much as the fact that Agatha made her feel like the most beautiful person in the room, every single day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Rio said, taking a deep breath and smiling brightly. “I’ll get it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave her a satisfied nod and then disappeared into her fitting room to try on her pantsuit. A few minutes later, she emerged, her posture as poised and strong as always, the suit fitting her perfectly, accentuating her tall frame and confident air. Rio looked up, eyes wide with admiration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You look amazing,” Rio whispered, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s tailored lines and the way the suit made her look both powerful and elegant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked. “I know,” she said with a wink, enjoying the quiet moment of pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Together, they walked to the counter, their shopping complete. Agatha made a few last-minute adjustments to the outfit in her mind, knowing she would add the right accessories when they got home. Rio, meanwhile, was lost in her excitement about the night ahead—of being with Agatha in a space where they could simply be themselves, no matter how formal the event was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they paid for their clothes, Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio’s waist. “I think we’ll turn some heads tomorrow,” Agatha said with a playful grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re definitely going to,” Rio teased back, nudging her shoulder against Agatha’s. “But don’t forget, I’m right there with you, taking the spotlight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The two shared a quiet laugh, their closeness and the playful banter between them filling the space with a sense of joy and anticipation for the night to come.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached Agatha’s house, they spent the evening together, the atmosphere in the house light and filled with love. Rio’s nervousness about the event seemed to disappear under Agatha’s steady and confident presence. The evening ended with Agatha brushing her fingers over Rio’s hair as she was about to leave, a soft moment of connection that grounded both of them in a love that was unconditional, no matter the event or the world around them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night of the charity gala had arrived, and the two women were filled with a mix of excitement and anticipation. The air in Agatha’s home was thick with a sense of warmth, both from the soft golden lighting of their living room and from the intimate atmosphere that had always defined their space together. It was moments like these—quiet, simple, yet deeply significant—that Rio cherished.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They had just dropped Nicky off at Lilia’s house, and it was obvious how ecstatic both Lilia and Nicky were about spending the evening together. Agatha had no doubt that Lilia would spoil Nicky endlessly—letting him eat far too many candies and stay up way too late. But she also knew those moments made her son the happiest, so she didn’t mind in the slightest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On her end, Rio couldn’t help but feel a sense of joy in giving Lilia these moments. Sometimes, she felt a twinge of guilt that Lilia hadn’t had experiences like this before with her at this age, but seeing the pure happiness on her face made everything worth it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But for the moment, Rio stood in front of the full-length mirror, watching Agatha prepare everything they would need for the night ahead. Agatha was calm and composed as ever, effortlessly organizing their things with the grace that came so naturally to her. But Rio, as always, had a buzz of energy around her—a nervous kind of excitement as she thought about the evening and the number of eyes that would be on them. She had gotten used to being in the spotlight when it came to Agatha, but tonight felt different. She wanted everything to be perfect for her girlfriend, but mostly, she just wanted to be present and enjoy the night—free of secrecy, free of worries, just existing in the joy of their shared connection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, noticing Rio’s quiet fidgeting, approached her with a soft smile. “Are you ready for tonight?” Agatha asked, her voice both playful and reassuring.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think so,” Rio replied, her gaze flickering between Agatha’s reflection and her own. “I’m just… nervous, I guess.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, cupping Rio’s face with her hands, her touch gentle and grounding. “There’s nothing to be nervous about. You’re going to look incredible, and everyone will be in awe of you… just like I always am.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her heart warmed by the simplicity of Agatha’s words. She wasn’t sure what she would do without the woman in front of her—Agatha always knew exactly how to ground her, to calm her storms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I want to do your hair and makeup tonight,” Agatha added, a soft twinkle in her eyes. “I want to make you my canvas.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart fluttered at the thought. They had done this a couple times before—Agatha, with her practiced hands, making Rio feel like royalty with each gentle stroke of makeup, each precise movement of her hand in her hair. But tonight, there was something even more intimate about it. It wasn’t just the makeup and hair—it was the care Agatha always took, the way she made Rio feel like she was the center of the universe, with every touch and word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Rio replied, stepping closer to her. “I’d love that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha led Rio to her bedroom, where she had a large vanity with soft lighting. The scent of Agatha’s perfume lingered in the air, and the room was filled with an array of beauty products—some Rio’s that she had left there after a few nights spent here, some Agatha’s. Agatha sat Rio down in front of the mirror, her fingers gently brushing through Rio’s hair as she began to work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Your hair looks beautiful already,” Agatha remarked, running her fingers through the long, dark strands. “But let me add a little something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio closed her eyes, allowing herself to relax into Agatha’s hands as they moved effortlessly through her hair. There was something soothing about the way Agatha worked—her touch was always sure and calming, never rushed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha carefully curled Rio’s hair, she let the silence linger for a while, both of them lost in the quiet intimacy of the moment. Rio could feel the warmth of Agatha’s presence behind her, could hear the soft murmur of Agatha humming a tune she didn’t recognize. It made her feel safe, at home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the end, she softly put the flower crown they had agreed on on top of Rio’s head, securing it lightly with a few pins so it wouldn’t slip.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few minutes, Agatha finished with Rio’s hair and turned her attention to the makeup. “You don’t need much,” Agatha said with a wink. “But let’s highlight your natural beauty.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands were steady and precise as she applied some blush, blending it seamlessly into Rio’s skin, and then adding just a hint of shimmer to her eyes. She worked with the same careful attention she always did—slow and deliberate, every motion filled with love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha worked, she picked up a delicate silver necklace from her jewelry box, one that Rio had always adored. It was a simple piece, with a small moon pendant that caught the light beautifully. The necklace had always reminded Rio of Agatha’s unwavering support, a small, unspoken promise of love and presence. Agatha draped it over Rio’s neck, adjusting it gently before kissing her neck and stepping back to admire her work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There,” Agatha said softly, her eyes scanning Rio’s appearance. “Perfect. You’re perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught in her chest, her heart swelling with the depth of emotion she felt. She had always admired Agatha’s beauty—how she exuded confidence, grace, and strength—but tonight, as she looked at her own reflection, she felt like she was seeing herself for the first time. She saw the way Agatha saw her—a beautiful, confident woman who deserved to be loved and cherished. The necklace around her neck felt like a promise, a constant reminder that Agatha was always there, even when she wasn’t physically present. It was Agatha’s silent way of saying, “I’ve got you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached up to touch the necklace, her fingers gently tracing the smooth surface of the pendant. “I love this,” she whispered. “It’s so beautiful, just like you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled warmly, a soft laugh escaping her lips. “It’s nothing compared to how beautiful you are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, looking at Agatha in the mirror. “You always know how to make me feel special.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, placing a kiss on the back of Rio’s neck, her lips warm against her skin. “That’s because you are special. Never forget that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned around to face Agatha, before reaching for the dresser, taking the other flower crown and placing it on top of Agatha’s hair, to match her own and the whimsical but classy vibe of the gala.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The two women stood together in front of the mirror for a long moment, the weight of their connection grounding them as they admired each other’s reflections. The gala was just around the corner, but in that moment, all that mattered was the quiet love they shared, the comfort they found in each other’s presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With their preparations complete, the evening awaited. And for once, Rio felt ready—not because of the dress or the makeup, but because she had Agatha by her side. Together, they would face whatever the night brought, and nothing could take away the peace they had found in each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening was everything they had hoped for. The air was crisp with the cool night, and the venue was alive with glittering lights and laughter. The charity gala was a lavish affair—an event that brought together the most influential people in the community to raise funds for a cause close to their hearts. But for Agatha and Rio, the night was more than just a social obligation. It was a chance to step out of the everyday hustle of their lives and into a world where they could be together, celebrating the love they shared without the pressure of trying to stay professional for the sake of appearances.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they arrived, the soft glow of the outdoor setting made everything look dreamlike—the flowers arranged in lush arrangements, the candles flickering in delicate glass holders. It felt like something out of a fairy tale. Agatha and Rio stood out, but not in an ostentatious way. There was a quiet elegance about them. Agatha’s green tailored pantsuit, so perfectly fitted to her form, radiated sophistication, and her flower crown nestled in her long brown hair only enhanced her ethereal beauty. Rio, with her flowy violet dress that billowed gently as she moved, wore her own flower crown just as gracefully, her dark hair cascading in soft waves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And it was those small, discreet matching flower crowns they wore that caught the attention of the people around them as soon as they arrived. It wasn’t over the top or too much—it was subtle, an unspoken declaration of their bond, a delicate mix of white, golden, purple and green. A symbol of unity and a quiet nod to the connection they shared. It was their way of honoring each other amidst the glamour of the night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Some of Agatha’s old friends like Wanda had been invited to the event, of course, but seeing the couple together in this setting was something else entirely for them. Wanda had heard so much about Rio in the last months, but tonight, she was in awe of the way they were so in sync with each other. Here, in the glow of the gala, it was as if the world had faded into the background, and the only thing that mattered was the love that seemed to radiate between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Look at them,” Wanda whispered to her Vision, her husband, her voice full of awe as she watched Agatha and Rio walk into the venue. “They’re… stunning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Vision nodded, a little flustered, even if he would never admit it to his wife.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the couple mingled with the guests, Agatha’s calm presence was magnetic, effortlessly drawing people in with her charm and sharp wit, while Rio, a little more reserved, captivated everyone with her intelligent conversations. They moved together like two halves of a whole, almost glowing in the soft lighting of the event.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But it wasn’t just their physical presence that amazed the guests—it was the way they communicated, the quiet moments that passed between them, the way they leaned in close to whisper something in each other’s ear, their soft laughs filling the air. It was the way Agatha looked at Rio with such adoration, and the way Rio, in turn, could always make Agatha smile with just a look.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They’re perfect for each other,” Wanda mused, her gaze never leaving her friends as they socialized with other guests.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the night wore on, Wanda and their friends couldn’t help but watch them in awe. Agatha and Rio were a force together—two strong women who had found something rare and beautiful. And as they shared moments with each other, as they laughed, danced, and whispered between conversations, it became clear that their love was as effortlessly beautiful as the night itself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The gala was in full swing, the music softly playing in the background as Agatha and Rio made their rounds, exchanging pleasantries with Agatha’s old friends and new faces alike. The evening had been nothing short of perfect, but in the midst of the elegant event, Agatha couldn’t help but notice how utterly stunning Rio looked in her flowy lavender dress.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dress hugged Rio’s figure in all the right ways, catching the light with every graceful movement, the delicate shimmer making her look ethereal. Agatha could barely take her eyes off her. The flower crown nestled atop Rio’s dark waves only added to the effect—like some enchanting forest nymph had wandered into the gala, entirely unaware of the way she captivated everyone around her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Agatha was very, very aware.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had spent the better part of the evening watching Rio—watching the way she laughed, the way she moved, the way her lips curled into that knowing little smirk whenever she caught Agatha’s gaze lingering a bit too long. And right now, with a glass of wine in one hand and her other subtly trailing down Rio’s arm, Agatha decided she had been patient long enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They had been talking to a few of Agatha’s old classmates when Agatha leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a quiet whisper. “I have to say… you look breathtaking tonight.” Her hand brushed lightly against Rio’s arm, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, who had been chatting animatedly, looked up, catching Agatha’s gaze. “Thank you,” she replied, her voice warm with affection. She was still caught up in the night, but a subtle blush crept across her cheeks as Agatha’s hand lingered on her arm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened. “But,” she began, her voice taking on a lower, teasing tone, “I’ll admit I can’t wait to see you out of that dress later.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes widened for a moment, her cheeks turning a deeper shade of pink as she caught the underlying meaning in Agatha’s words. “Agatha,” she whispered, a mix of laughter and surprise in her voice. She was always so aware of how the night unfolded, always so attuned to the way things felt, but the promise Agatha had just made sent a flutter of anticipation through her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t act so innocent,” Agatha teased, her hand finding Rio’s, giving it a gentle squeeze as she led her further into the crowd. “You know how I feel about you in that dress.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curled into a knowing smile. She leaned in again, just enough that her breath fanned over the shell of Rio’s ear, sending goosebumps skittering down her spine. “You’re driving me insane,” she murmured. “That dress, that smile, the way you’ve been teasing me all night without even trying. And when we get home…” She let the words trail off deliberately, her voice thick with promise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, suddenly hyperaware of the heat pooling low in her stomach, of the way Agatha’s thumb brushed against the inside of her wrist in a way that was entirely too casual for the effect it had on her. “You’re impossible,” she muttered, but the way she squeezed Agatha’s hand betrayed her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You love it,” Agatha murmured, her gaze hooded, filled with something sinful. “And later, my love, I’m going to show you just how much I love you in return.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words sent a shiver through Rio, anticipation curling in her belly, warm and slow and dangerous. She felt herself leaning into Agatha without thinking, as if some magnetic pull had drawn her closer, but before she could respond—before she could let herself fully indulge in the delicious game Agatha was playing—a familiar voice interrupted, pulling her back into the present.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, Agatha! It’s been years!” one of her former classmates called, entirely unaware of the moment he had just shattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled back smoothly, her expression the picture of calm sophistication, as if she hadn’t just whispered sin into Rio’s ear in the middle of a crowded garden. She turned with an easy smile, greeting the man, slipping back into polite conversation effortlessly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, on the other hand, took a slow sip of her drink, trying to steady her breathing, trying to ignore the way her body still burned from Agatha’s touch. She shot her a glance—one that promised retaliation later—but Agatha only smirked in response, utterly pleased with herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night continued, but Agatha’s teasing didn’t let up. Every brush of her fingers, every lingering glance, every low, murmured comment disguised beneath polite conversation kept Rio on edge. The worst of it was when Agatha leaned in close just as they were saying their goodbyes, her lips ghosting over Rio’s ear as she whispered, “And tonight, when we’re alone, I’ll make sure you know exactly how much I’ve been looking forward to that moment all evening.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her pulse quicken, the anticipation of the evening ahead making her breath catch in her throat. “You’re incorrigible,” she whispered, but the teasing smile on her lips was just as telling as Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha only chuckled, smug and impossibly charming as she slipped her arm around Rio’s waist, guiding her toward the car. “I think that’s the me you fell in love with,” she said, voice full of promise, her fingers brushing just a little too low on Rio’s back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled sharply, her pulse racing as they stepped into the cool night air. If Agatha thought she was going to win this game so easily, she had another thing coming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Because two could play at that game.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And by the time the night was over, Rio would make sure Agatha was the one breathless and wrecked beneath her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The ride home was quiet, but comfortable, the soft hum of the car engine a gentle backdrop to the weight of the evening fading away. Agatha could feel Rio beside her, a soft smile still playing on her lips as they made their way through the streets. It had been a night full of light and laughter, but Agatha knew that there was something even more intimate and personal waiting for them once they were home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment the car rolled to a stop in the driveway, Agatha exhaled slowly, fingers tightening slightly around the steering wheel. She had been patient—so unbearably patient—all night, playing her little game, whispering promises that made Rio flush and shift in her seat, teasing until she could practically feel the anticipation thrumming beneath her skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But now, with the night stretched out before them and no one around to interrupt, Agatha wasn’t feeling particularly patient anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t rush, though. No, she never did. The best things, after all, were meant to be savored.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was already pushing open the door, stepping out with effortless grace despite the lingering effects of champagne and Agatha’s endless teasing. The dress still shimmered in the low porch light, a final taunt, as if it knew just how much it had tortured Agatha all night. She followed, shutting the car door with a little more force than necessary before trailing behind Rio into the house.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment they stepped inside, the air shifted. The house was dark, quiet—too quiet after the hum of conversation, the music, the lingering heat of the gala. It was just them now, just the slow click of Rio’s heels against the hardwood floor, just the barely-there sound of her breath as she turned to meet Agatha’s gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shut the door with a quiet click, and for a long moment, she simply stared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” she finally murmured, voice low and almost lazy, but her eyes gleamed with something much sharper. “You were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight…” She stepped forward, slow, deliberate, fingers brushing against Rio’s arm as she reached down. She slipped off one shoe, then the other, taking her time as if undressing her piece by piece. “But now,” she whispered, straightening up, her lips just a breath away from Rio’s, “I get to have you all to myself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a soft laugh, but there was a breathlessness to it, her pulse betraying her. “You’ve had me all night, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hummed, fingertips grazing the soft fabric at Rio’s waist. “Not the way I want.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words sent a delicious shiver down Rio’s spine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands moved, slow and reverent, slipping over the smooth fabric, tracing the elegant lines of Rio’s dress. “I’m going to take this off of you, love,” she whispered, eyes locking with Rio’s. “And I want to hear you say you want that too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, the intensity of Agatha’s gaze leaving her almost dizzy. “Yes,” she murmured, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That was all Agatha needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The zipper came undone with agonizing slowness, the sound sharp in the quiet space. Agatha didn’t yank, didn’t rush—she simply let her fingers glide, the fabric giving way beneath her touch, slipping down Rio’s shoulders, sliding over her waist until it pooled at her feet in a silken heap.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood there, in nothing but soft, delicate lace, the flower crown still perched atop her loose waves. The cool air ghosted over her bare skin, making her hyper-aware of just how exposed she was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a step back, drinking her in, eyes dark and hungry. “God, you are exquisite.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words sent heat curling through Rio’s stomach, her breath catching. She had spent all evening reveling in Agatha’s attention, in the way those sharp blue eyes followed her across the room, the way Agatha’s fingers had lingered on the small of her back, the way her teasing whispers had left her warm and aching.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But now, with Agatha watching her like this, like she was something sacred and sinful all at once, Rio felt her knees go weak.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha…” she whispered, but she wasn’t sure if it was a plea or a warning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t let her finish.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She closed the distance between them in an instant, hands firm but careful as they found Rio’s waist, pulling her close. Her lips pressed a slow, lingering kiss to Rio’s forehead, then another to her temple, then another just below her jaw—soft, deliberate, maddening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know how much I love you,” she murmured against Rio’s skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio melted into the touch, her body relaxing against Agatha’s as she wrapped her arms around her. It wasn’t about the dress anymore, or the teasing that had filled the evening. It was about this—this connection, this love that always found a way to ground them no matter how chaotic the world might feel.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha ran her fingers through Rio’s hair, the flower crown gently falling away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio barely had time to react before Agatha’s hands slipped lower, fingers grazing the backs of her thighs as she lifted her with ease, earning a quiet gasp as Rio instinctively clung to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s get you comfortable,” Agatha murmured, her lips ghosting over Rio’s pulse as she carried her toward the bedroom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had no doubt the night was about to be anything but.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night had been a celebration of them both, of their bond and their love for each other. But now, in the quiet of their own space, Agatha’s every touch felt like a promise. A promise to care for Rio, to love her, and to always be there, in all the ways that truly mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My turn, now,” Rio whispered, her eyes growing darker.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft hum, her smile laced with anticipation, but she didn’t move. She wanted to see how Rio would unravel her, how she would take her time, how she would turn the simple act of undressing into something far more dangerous—far more delicious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room was quiet except for the soft rustling of fabric as Rio gently reached for Agatha’s jacket. There was no rush tonight, no need to hurry. Not when she had the pleasure of drawing this out, of making Agatha feel every single touch, every single deliberate movement. Her fingers brushed over the smooth material, skimming Agatha’s shoulders before slipping the jacket down her arms, letting it fall to the floor in a forgotten heap. Every gesture, every touch was deliberate, filled with a deep sense of reverence and love. Agatha’s smile softened as she met Rio’s eyes, a quiet understanding passing between them. It wasn’t just the end of the evening or the removal of clothing—it was something deeper. It was a moment of connection, of intimacy, of honoring one another.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled, steady and patient, but her eyes betrayed her—the flicker of heat, the way she watched Rio like she was trying to burn the sight of her into memory.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s fingers traced over the first button of Agatha’s blouse, and she smirked, playful yet wicked. “You were so patient with me, love. Should I return the favor?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft chuckle, the sound low and knowing. “You wouldn’t dare.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh,” Rio breathed, voice teasing, “I think I would.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The first button came undone. Then the next. And the next.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Slow. Painfully slow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took her time, unfastening each button as if it were a secret being unraveled, as if she were peeling back every layer of the night itself. Her hands, warm and steady, brushed against the soft skin beneath, her fingers grazing down the line of Agatha’s sternum with excruciating reverence, savoring each movement as though she were handling something fragile, something precious. Agatha stood still under Rio’s touch, feeling the warmth of her adoration in each delicate movement, in each moment of attention. The tension from the evening seemed to melt away, replaced by a soft, steady pulse of affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The blouse slid from Agatha’s shoulders, slipping down her arms like water, revealing smooth skin, the gentle curves that Rio had memorized a hundred times over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, she still stared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Like she had never seen Agatha before. Like she would never see enough of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> Every inch of Agatha was beautiful to her—every blemish, every curve, every line. She was the woman she had chosen and who had chosen her in return, the one who knew her like no one else could.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Magnificent,” Rio murmured, her hands trailing over Agatha’s collarbones, lingering just long enough to send a shiver down her spine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, watching her with quiet amusement, though her breathing had grown slightly uneven. “Still teasing, are we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio only smiled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her hands moved lower, slipping over Agatha’s waist as she worked on the buttons of her trousers, unfastening them with the same unbearable slowness. The quiet pop of each button, the gentle slide of fabric—it was a symphony in the hush of the room, a quiet seduction that left Agatha standing impossibly still, her lips parted ever so slightly, as if she were holding back a sharp inhale.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the trousers pooled at her feet, Rio knelt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment stretched, heavy and intoxicating, as Rio’s hands traced the backs of her calves, her fingers ghosting over the delicate skin with infuriating patience. She lifted one of Agatha’s feet, slipping off the last barrier of fabric, then the other. But she didn’t rise right away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead, she lingered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her hands traveled up, slow, deliberate, tracing the smooth length of Agatha’s thighs, the warmth of her palms pressing just firmly enough to send a ripple of heat through Agatha’s core.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, Rio didn’t look up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She let her fingers skim higher, let them trail, featherlight, up the curve of Agatha’s hips before finally, finally standing, her breath fanning against Agatha’s collarbone, her lips hovering just above her pulse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shuddered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled back just enough to look at her—really look at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She drank in the sight of Agatha standing before her, bare, exquisite, radiant in the soft glow of the room. Every line, every scar, every inch of her—worshiped with Rio’s gaze alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was no teasing now. No playful smirks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just something raw. Something deeper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached up, cupping Agatha’s face, her thumb brushing over the soft curve of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You undo me,” she whispered, and there was nothing but truth in it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha held her gaze, something soft flickering beneath all that intensity. “Then we’re even.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a breath of laughter, tilting her head up as her lips finally—finally—met Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The kiss wasn’t rushed. It wasn’t desperate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was slow. Sinfully slow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A deep, lingering pull, a silent vow wrapped in the taste of wine and the echoes of laughter from the night before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they broke apart, Rio didn’t move far. With a soft sigh, Rio rose on her tiptoes and kissed Agatha’s forehead. She stayed close, her forehead resting against Agatha’s, her fingers trailing through her lover’s long, dark hair before reaching for the flower crown still resting atop her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took it off gently, reverently, placing it beside her own on the nightstand, her fingers stroking the delicate petals before returning to Agatha—who hadn’t moved, completely captivated, entirely enthralled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s voice was barely above a murmur as she traced a slow path down Agatha’s spine, fingers dancing over skin she knew like poetry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You are everything to me,” she whispered, lips brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear. “Everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s arms wrapped around Rio then, pulling her in, closer, closer still, until there was no space left between them, until they were breathing the same air, lost in the gravity of each other. The night stretched around them, thick with the weight of anticipation, of everything unspoken and yet utterly understood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their hearts beat together, a rhythm so in sync it felt fated, as if this was always meant to be—this love, this hunger, this undeniable need. Tonight was just another chapter in the story they were writing together, a story woven with tenderness and fire, devotion and longing, a love that had carried them through every storm and would see them through every one to come.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips found the curve of Rio’s shoulder, pressing a slow, lingering kiss against bare skin, her voice nothing more than a hushed murmur against her lover’s ear. “We’ve had a night full of eyes on us, full of attention,” she whispered, her fingers trailing aimless patterns down Rio’s spine, teasing, promising. “But this? This is just for us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a breath of laughter, low and knowing, before she pushed Agatha back, guiding her until the backs of her knees met the edge of the bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Agatha was faster.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a wicked smirk, she caught Rio’s waist, yanking her down with her as she fell back onto the mattress. A soft gasp left Rio’s lips as she landed atop her, her legs settling astride Agatha’s hips, her hair falling forward in a dark cascade, a curtain that shielded them from the rest of the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let her fingers slide through the silk of it, twisting a lock around her fingers before tugging gently, just to see Rio’s eyes darken, just to hear the hitch in her breath.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned down, her mouth hovering just above Agatha’s, teasing, taunting, until Agatha reached up, catching her lips in a kiss that was anything but patient.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was searing, all-consuming, her teeth catching Rio’s lower lip just enough to pull a soft, shuddering sigh from her throat before Rio deepened it, her mouth parting, her tongue brushing against Agatha’s in a slow, languid tease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hands roamed, nails dragged, lips traced fire along flushed skin. The hunger between them ignited, something frantic and desperate beneath it, something ancient and primal, the way two forces of nature collided, overwhelmed, unable to stop, unwilling to slow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their touch became more frantic, more searching and exploring and soon, the only thing that could be heard in the room was whispers of each other’s name, cried out gasps and declarations of love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was never rushed with them, but it was never slow either. It was something else entirely—something sacred, something only they could create, something that burned hot enough to consume and yet never turned to ash.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they came together, when their bodies finally intertwined in the most intimate of ways, it was with a certainty so unshakable that it defied reason, defied anything the world could throw at them and that this, right there was where they could be the purest versions of themselves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nothing could touch them here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nothing could tear them apart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They were built for this, for each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And when the fire subsided into a slow, aching warmth, when the only thing left in its wake was the steady pulse of their heartbeats against sweat-slicked skin, they collapsed together, tangled beneath the sheets, breathless and sated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted, settling her head against Rio’s chest, her fingers tracing lazy, absentminded patterns along her ribcage, savoring the quiet hum of Rio’s heartbeat beneath her fingertips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sighed, her voice a soft, sleep-drenched whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You really are a river, my love,” she murmured, her lips grazing the skin just above Rio’s heart. “And I think I am drowning in it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A pause.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And there is nowhere else I’d rather be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a slow breath, her arms tightening around Agatha, pulling her impossibly closer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The world outside no longer existed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was only this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The warmth of their shared bed, the gentle rise and fall of their breathing in perfect synchrony, and the quiet, immutable certainty that in each other’s arms, they had everything they would ever need.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The soft light of morning filtered through the curtains, casting a gentle glow across the room. Rio stirred, her body warm and cocooned in the comforting embrace of the sheets. She shifted slightly, her head tucked into the crook of Agatha’s neck, feeling the steady rise and fall of Agatha’s chest beneath her. It was still early—too early to fully be awake, but the world outside was already beginning to hum with the quiet rhythm of the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand rested on Rio’s back, her fingers tracing idle circles over the smooth skin as she too began to wake, the softness of the touch grounding Rio even as she drifted between sleep and wakefulness. The night had been a blur of elegance, laughter, and whispered moments. But now, in the quiet of the morning after the gala, it was just the two of them—nothing to do, nowhere to be, no masks to wear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stretched slightly, feeling the warm press of Agatha’s body against her own. The soft scent of their shared perfume still clung to her skin, their clothes everywhere on the floor and the delicate flower crowns they’d both worn still lay discarded on the nightstand, a reminder of the night’s celebration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning,” Rio whispered, her voice still heavy with the remnants of sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a sleepy smile, the softest of chuckles escaping her. She tilted her head slightly, her fingers continuing their slow, comforting movement along Rio’s back. “Morning,” she murmured in return, her voice raspy from the night’s quiet conversations.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, feeling the comfort of being held so close, allowed herself to relax further. There was something so serene about the way Agatha held her, as if they were the only two people in the world and the world outside didn’t matter. For a moment, she let the calm wash over her, appreciating the stillness, the peace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think we might have scarred Wanda for life,” Rio said with a teasing glint in her eyes, though her words were soft, more like a sleepy murmur. “I think her and Vision are probably gossiping about us as we speak.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, her hand coming up to gently brush through Rio’s hair, the dark strands soft under her fingers. “Let them,” she said. “We’ve earned our share of teasing. Besides, it’s not every day we get to show up like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, her head tilting up so she could look into Agatha’s eyes, the lingering softness of the night still there. “I just love being with you,” she said quietly, the weight of the words settling between them. “Last night, today—everything, really.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, her hand moving to cup Rio’s face. Her thumb traced the curve of Rio’s cheek. “I feel the same,” she whispered. “You and Nicky are everything I could ever wish for.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a long, quiet moment between them, both of them lost in the simple, powerful connection they shared. The noise of the world outside faded away as they simply existed in this shared space, this bubble of peace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can we stay here for a while?” Rio asked, her voice small, almost vulnerable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes met hers, her smile soft but full of understanding. “As long as you want,” she replied. “No rush. We have the whole day ahead of us. I’m sure Lilia won’t mind if she gets Nicky to herself for a little longer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her heart swelling with affection. “Nope, she won’t I can assure you that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The two of them lay there, intertwined under the sheets, the morning light growing stronger as the hours passed. There was no need for conversation, no need for anything other than the quiet, comfortable presence of each other. This was their time—a stolen moment of peace and closeness that they both treasured, away from the demands of the world around them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha and Rio walked into the main library later that day, under the pretense of a meeting and researching new books for Agatha’s upcoming project—nothing unusual, as it wasn’t uncommon for supervisors to involve their mentees in their work—there was an undeniable lightness about them. They moved through the halls with the same composed authority they always carried, but there was something different this time: an air of quiet contentment that didn’t go unnoticed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen exchanged knowing glances as the two passed by their table, their smiles just a little too soft, their hands brushing a little too often for it to be purely accidental.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They’re glowing,” Alice said under her breath, leaning against the counter as she stirred her coffee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Glowing is an understatement,” Jen replied, smirking. “They look like they’ve just come back from a romantic getaway, not a charity gala.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice chuckled, glancing toward the door. “I don’t know what’s more impressive—that they’re so obvious, or that they still manage to pretend they’re just another pair of teacher-student.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A few rows further, towards the back, they could now see Rio perched on the edge of her seat, across for Agatha, chatting quietly but animatedly about something while Agatha listened with that fond, almost amused expression she reserved exclusively for her girlfriend and that Jen and Alice had come to recognize. When Rio gestured dramatically, Agatha reached up without thinking, gently catching Rio’s hand mid-air before placing it back in her lap, whispering they were still in the library—a small gesture that spoke volumes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are we just not going to talk about this?” Alice whispered to her own girlfriend, her voice dripping with mock scandal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We have to talk about this,” Jen said, grinning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Unbeknownst to the two of them, at their table, Rio cast a quick glance toward Jen and Alice, whom she had noticed earlier and could now feel staring at her. She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table as she spoke softly. “Do you think they can tell?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced up from her book, eyes twinkling with an almost unreadable expression. “They can tell. But it’s no secret, is it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled shyly, her gaze dipping to the table. “No. It’s not.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen and Alice waited until the couple had left the library an hour later to make their move. Later in the day, during a break in their own research, they cornered Rio by the entrance of the English department, pushing her into an empty room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So,” Alice began, her arms crossed but her grin wide but keeping her voice low. “You and Agatha seem… different today.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, her lips parting slightly in surprise. “What do you mean?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, come on,” Jen chimed in. “You two are practically floating through the halls. Spill. Was it the gala? Or the <em>after</em> the gala?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed a deep pink as her mind instantly darted back to the intimacy of the night before. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said, though the slight quaver in her voice betrayed her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice laughed. “Oh, you absolutely know what we’re talking about.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At that moment, Agatha appeared in the doorway, as though summoned by some unspoken signal. She took one look at Rio’s flustered expression and immediately understood. With her signature smirk, she stepped between Rio and the others, sliding an arm around her waist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are we interrogating this lovely girl now?” Agatha asked, her tone teasing but with just enough edge to make the others reconsider their approach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’re just making observations,” Alice replied, undeterred.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Observations,” Agatha repeated, raising an eyebrow. “How fascinating. Well, perhaps you should focus your observations on your own lives instead of ours.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hid her face against Agatha’s shoulder, half-laughing and half-mortified. “You’re not helping,” she muttered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“On the contrary,” Agatha said, tilting her head to meet Rio’s gaze. Her voice softened, just enough that only Rio could hear. “I’m always helping, my love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And with that, she steered Rio away, leaving their two friends laughing behind them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Still glowing,” Alice noted as they disappeared around the corner.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Absolutely glowing,” Jen agreed.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p>

  <em>Home is where one starts from. As we grow older</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Of dead and living. Not the intense moment</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Isolated, with no before and after,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But a lifetime burning in every moment</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And not the lifetime of one man only</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But of old stones that cannot be deciphered.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>              (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The rain outside painted Rio’s apartment windows in streaks of silver, a soothing backdrop to the cozy scene she’d been meticulously preparing. The small dining table, pushed against the far wall of her studio, was set with mismatched but charmingly eclectic plates. A cluster of candles flickered in the middle, their warm light bouncing off the leaves of the countless plants scattered throughout the space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky stepped through the door first, his eyes immediately going wide. “Whoa!” he exclaimed, his small voice echoing with awe. He darted past Rio, who held the door open for Agatha, and started exploring, taking in all the greenery present in the small apartment. “Are these all yours?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, closing the door behind them. “All of them,” she replied, Taking Nicky’s little rain-soaked jacket and hanging it by the door. “Some of them got names, too, you know. Want to meet them?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky turned to her, eyes sparkling with curiosity. “You named your plants?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Rio said, her tone playfully serious. “They’re family. That one’s Aleafia.” She pointed to a towering fiddle-leaf fig near the window. “And over there is Fernando, my favorite spider plant.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, reaching out toward a cluster of pothos vines hanging in a macramé holder by the bookshelf. Agatha’s voice drifted in, wry and warm as she slipped off her boots. “Careful, Nicky. You don’t want to make Fernando upset by tugging on his leaves.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, crossing to the kitchen area to check on the pot simmering on the stove. “Don’t worry. Fernado’s tough. He’s survived worse than curious little hands.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned against the doorframe, her long hair falling over her shoulder as she surveyed the room. Plants filled every available surface, spilling from shelves, climbing up trellises, and even perched atop the fridge, mixed with piles of books. The apartment felt alive, vibrant with Rio’s energy, a reflection of the young woman herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You really are the queen of the jungle, love,” Agatha teased, earning a quick glance and a soft smile from Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Only if it I am <em>your</em> queen of the jungle, <em>darling</em>,” Rio quipped, turning back to her cooking with a wink. "Lilia used to call me her little green witch."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened at the endearment. "Fitting," she chuckled as Nicky darted to Rio’s side, holding up a small succulent in a painted pot. “What’s this one called?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned out towards him, a wooden spoon in hand. “That’s Jack O’Plantern. He’s a survivor.” She winked again. “He almost didn’t make it after I forgot to water him for a month, but now he’s thriving. Just like us, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, her gaze lingering on Rio as Nicky excitedly returned the pot to its spot. There was something grounding about being in Rio’s space, surrounded by her vibrant, chaotic life. And for the first time, Agatha felt like they were taking a tangible step toward merging their worlds—her and Nicky’s and Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So,” Rio said, clapping her hands as she set the spoon down and gestured toward the table. “Are you two ready for the best dinner you’ve ever had in a jungle?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dinner, the dishes were stacked neatly in the sink, and the scent of the homemade dinner still lingered in the air. Nicky sat cross-legged on the rug by the couch, playing with a set of toy dinosaurs he’d fished out of his backpack, their roars echoing softly as he created an epic jungle battle. Rio, meanwhile, moved around her apartment with a small watering can, her usual post-dinner ritual of checking on her “green babies” well underway.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hummed quietly to herself, crouching to inspect the soil of a fern that had been looking a little droopy earlier that week. With gentle precision, she tilted the watering can, letting a steady trickle dampen the soil. Agatha sat on the couch, legs crossed, observing Rio with a faint smile. There was something endlessly fascinating about the way Rio poured so much care into even the simplest tasks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Agatha said casually, her voice smooth and even, “these plants would look amazing in my house.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze, the watering can suspended mid-air. A single drop of water escaped the spout, landing with an almost imperceptible plink against the ceramic pot. She didn’t turn around, her mind racing at the unexpected weight of the comment. Agatha’s house.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could muster a response, Nicky perked up from his spot on the floor, looking up with bright eyes. “Do I get to water them too?” he asked excitedly. “Can I take care of Aleafia?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved into a soft smile at his enthusiasm, her chest tightening at the earnestness in his voice. Setting the watering can down, she turned to him, crouching to his level. “You’d be a great plant caretaker, Nicky,” she said, ruffling his hair. “Aleafia would love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His grin stretched ear to ear, but Rio’s gaze flickered up to Agatha, who was watching her with that same calm, steady expression that betrayed nothing and everything all at once. Agatha’s comment wasn’t just a casual remark about plants. Agatha was asking her to move in, not with words but in the subtle, deliberate way she always had of planting an idea and letting it grow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood slowly, her heart beating faster than she’d like. She wasn’t sure if it was from the rush of anxiety or the flicker of excitement threatening to bubble to the surface. “Agatha,” she started, her voice quieter than usual, “are you… are you saying—?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha uncrossed her legs, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees. Her expression was soft but unyielding, her lips curving into a knowing smirk. “I’m saying you, Aleafia, Jack, and the rest of the jungle would look good in my house.” she said lightly, though her eyes gleamed with meaning. “But yes, love, I’m asking.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s throat tightened. She glanced at Nicky, who was now fully immersed in making his dinosaurs roar again, then back at Agatha. The enormity of what was being asked sank in, and while it should have terrified her, the warmth in Agatha’s gaze—and the thought of Nicky’s laughter filling her space every day—made her heart ache in a way that felt startlingly like belonging.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio picked up the watering can again, though her hands were slower, her movements deliberate as she considered Agatha’s words. She turned toward the towering monstera by the window, tipping the spout just enough to dampen its soil. Her smirk, however, betrayed the tension she was trying to mask.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, that’s it, huh?” Rio quipped, her voice laced with mock offense. She glanced over her shoulder at Agatha, who was now lounging on the couch with Nicky perched comfortably in her lap. “You’re just after my plants?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, feigning an innocent look. “What can I say?” she replied dryly, her fingers idly brushing through Nicky’s hair. “Your jungle adds charm. But…” She let the sentence dangle for just a beat too long before adding, “Nicky might want you to come, too. Right, kiddo?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s head popped up, his wide eyes sparkling with excitement. “Yes!” he declared, his small hands clutching at Agatha’s arms as if to underscore his agreement. “You have to come, Rio! And Aleafia and Jack O’Plantern and—” He paused, his little brow furrowing. “What’s the one hanging by the bookshelf?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s Liliage,” Rio said, biting back a laugh as she turned fully to face them, her arms crossed over her chest, the watering can dangling at her side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha snorted, unable to contain her amusement anymore. “Did you really name a plant after Lilia <em>and</em> made a bad pun about foliage with it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, and so what?” Rio replied, raising an eyebrow, before continuing. “And Liliage is very attached to this place. I’m not sure she’d want to leave.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky gasped, clutching his chest in mock concern. “But Liliage has to come, too!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched an eyebrow, her lips twitching into a smirk of her own. “Oh, dear,” she drawled. “Sounds like Liliage’s feelings might complicate things. What do you say, Rio? Are you going to let poor Nicky live without his new best friend?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, shaking her head as she leaned back against the counter. “Wow, pulling the kid card already? That’s low, Harkness.” She tilted her head, her smirk softening as she watched the way Nicky’s face lit up at the mere idea of them all being together. “But I see how it is. You just want my plants to do all the decorating for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Obviously,” Agatha said, deadpan, earning a giggle from Nicky. She leaned back against the couch cushions, her eyes never leaving Rio. “Though having their eccentric owner around might not be so bad, either.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, though her cheeks flushed at the casual compliment. She let out an exaggerated sigh, setting the watering can down and walking over to the couch. With a flourish, she dropped onto the armrest beside Agatha, playfully invading her space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, if I agree to this—hypothetically, of course—” Rio began, wagging a finger in mock seriousness, “what’s the guarantee that you won’t kill my plants the second I’m not looking?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Unfair,” Agatha replied with mock indignation. “I’ll have you know I’ve kept Nicky alive for six years. I think I can handle a few leaves.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey!” Nicky piped up, twisting around in Agatha’s lap to face her. “I’m not a plant!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, pressing a kiss to the top of his nose. “You are a very pretty plant, my love, the most precious one of all, baby.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio crossed her arms, her lips twitching into a smirk as she leaned back against the counter. Her hesitancy melted for a moment, replaced by her usual fiery humor. “I don’t think either of you has the green thumb required for this level of commitment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched a brow, her smirk matching Rio’s. “Give me some credit, love,” she drawled. “I can learn. It’s not rocket science.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, who had been happily pretending his dinosaur was chomping on the leaves of the monstera next to the couch, perked up immediately. “I can help!” he exclaimed, practically bouncing in place. “I’ll water them <em>every day</em>! Especially Liliage!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes widened in mock horror. “Every day? Oh no, kiddo. That’s how you drown them,” she said, clutching her heart playfully. “Plants need just the right amount of water, not too much, not too little. You’ve got to read their vibe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky blinked, his little face scrunching in confusion. “Plants have vibes?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Totally,” Rio said, crouching down to his level. She picked up a leaf of the pothos trailing nearby. “See this one? Its leaves are perky and green. That’s a happy plant. But if they droop, or get yellow, they’re stressed. You’ve got to know when to give them a drink and when to let them chill.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded solemnly, as if receiving the secrets of the universe. Meanwhile, Agatha rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. “Oh, come on. I could do that,” she said with mock offense. “I know plants need water, sunlight, and… what’s that stuff? Fertilizer?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio straightened, raising an eyebrow at her. “Uh-huh. And how much water, exactly?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “Enough to keep them alive. Obviously.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wow,” Rio said dryly, her smirk widening. “I’m so impressed by your expertise, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hold on,” Agatha countered, holding up a finger. “I know more than you think. Like, that one over there—” She pointed to a fiddle leaf fig standing proudly in the corner. “It needs bright, indirect sunlight and hates being moved around. See? I’ve done my homework.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio burst out laughing, shaking her head. “Okay, first of all, yes, it does hate being moved. But second, if you overwater it or let it sit in bad drainage, it’s toast. So don’t get too cocky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, who had been watching their exchange like it was a tennis match, suddenly chimed in. “But what about Liliage? Does she like bright light too?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Liliage’s a tough girl,” Rio said with a wink at him. “She’s a Boston fern. Likes indirect light, lots of humidity. She’s a diva, but she’s worth it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha placed a hand over her heart, feigning offense. “Are you implying I wouldn’t give Liliage the love and care she deserves? I’m hurt, truly.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave her a sidelong glance, biting back another laugh. “I’m implying you’ve got a lot to learn before I trust you with my jungle.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned, tugging on Agatha’s sleeve. “We can do it, right Mama?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course we can,” Agatha said smoothly, her eyes twinkling as she leaned toward Rio. “You might be the expert, love, but we’re quick learners. And if nothing else, I’ve got a secret weapon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s brow furrowed in mock suspicion. “Oh? What’s that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nicky’s enthusiasm,” Agatha said with a smirk. “And my charm. A winning combination, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, laughing as she grabbed her watering can again. “You two are a dangerous duo, you know that?” She sighed, glancing at her plants. “Fine. Maybe I’ll <em>consider</em> it. But don’t think for a second that means I’m letting you off the hook. Plant care is serious business, and I’m not lowering my standards.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, clapping his hands. “We’re gonna have so many plants!” he said, already twisting in Agatha’s lap to inspect the next one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back, her eyes never leaving Rio’s form, her expression softening as she lowered her voice. “You’ll see, Rio. We would take good care of them—and you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced at her, the teasing banter fading for a moment as the sincerity in Agatha’s voice struck her. She let the weight of those words settle before offering a small, genuine smile. “You better,” she said softly, her tone light but her meaning clear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached over, ruffling Nicky’s hair before letting her hand rest briefly on Agatha’s shoulder. “I’ll think about it, Dr. Harkness,” she admitted. “But you’re still on probation when it comes to Liliage.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky slid off Agatha’s lap, his little dinosaur clutched in one hand as he wandered over to Rio. His big, curious eyes fixed on her as she crouched down near the monstera, her fingers gently brushing one of its glossy leaves. He tilted his head, his voice soft but serious. “Do plants like moving houses?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio paused, a small laugh escaping her lips. She set the watering can aside and turned to look at him. “You know, that’s a really good question,” she said, her tone thoughtful. “Plants can be fussy about moving, but…” She glanced around at the jungle she’d nurtured so carefully, her expression warm and wistful. “They like anywhere they’re loved.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up, his dinosaur momentarily forgotten. “So if we love them, they’ll like our house too?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Rio replied, her smile widening as she gently tugged on one of his curls. “You’re a smart little guy, you know that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He giggled, then ran back to the couch, climbing into Agatha’s lap again and resuming his animated one-sided conversation about Jack and Fernando and Aleafia. Rio watched him for a moment, her chest tightening at the sight. When she finally tore her gaze away, she found Agatha watching her—calm, steady, patient, like she always was when something important was brewing under the surface.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip, standing and brushing her hands on her jeans as she leaned against the back of the couch. She spoke softly, almost as if the words weren’t meant to be heard. “I guess people do too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head back slightly, her lips curving into a faint smile, though her eyes softened with understanding. She didn’t push, didn’t press Rio to elaborate. Instead, she shifted Nicky in her lap so he could sit more comfortably, keeping her attention on Rio as if to say, <em>Take your time. I’m here.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The weight of it all suddenly felt less heavy, less daunting, as Rio stood in her little jungle, surrounded by the life she’d cultivated and the life waiting for her beyond it. She crossed her arms, taking a few steps back and leaning her head back against the wall, next to the counter, and let out a breathy laugh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know, it’s not fair how you both gang up on me,” she teased, her smirk creeping back. “First Nicky charms me with his enthusiasm, and then you hit me with your big soulful eyes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is it working?” Agatha asked, her tone dry but her smirk matching Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but didn’t answer. Instead, she turned back to her plants, running her fingers over their leaves like they were old friends. Her heart felt like it was waging a quiet war with itself, but in the background, she could hear Nicky’s soft chatter and Agatha’s low chuckle as they talked about which plant might be their favorite.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And at that time, Rio thought that maybe, it wouldn’t be so bad to let her little jungle take root somewhere new.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s fingers brushed over the trailing vines of her pothos, her movements slower now, more deliberate. She glanced over her shoulder at Nicky, who was now crouched by a small succulent on her coffee table, carefully inspecting its tiny, rounded leaves. His soft hums of fascination filled the quiet, a reminder of his boundless curiosity and the innocence that came with it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But for Rio, the simplicity of the moment didn’t ease the knot tightening in her chest. She swallowed hard, her gaze dropping back to the plant in her hands. Her voice, when she finally spoke, was quieter than before. “It’s not just the plants, though.” She paused, her words measured. “Moving in would mean… a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha straightened on the couch, her sharp eyes catching the subtle shift in Rio’s tone, the way her usual fire had dimmed to something more hesitant. She gently shifted Nicky off her lap, giving him a light pat on the back as he scurried back to his dinosaurs on the floor. Then she stood, her long stride effortlessly closing the distance between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re right,” Agatha said softly, her voice steady but laced with care. “It <em>would</em> mean a lot. For all of us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced at her, her brow furrowing slightly. “Agatha, I…” She hesitated, the words tangling in her throat. The idea of giving up her independence—this space she’d built for herself, where she’d poured so much of her energy and love—felt daunting. And yet, the thought of stepping into something new, something shared, made her heart ache with a mix of fear and longing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached out, her hand light on Rio’s arm. “I wouldn’t ask if Nicky and I didn’t want you there,” she said firmly, her gaze unwavering. “Really want you there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught. Agatha’s words were simple, but they carried weight, a promise that steadied the storm brewing in her mind. She looked at Nicky again, who was now carefully poking at a succulent, muttering something under his breath about how “That must be Aleafia’s cousin.” His small presence filled the space with so much light that it was hard to imagine ever being without it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t think you’d thrive with us,” Agatha added, her voice softening but never losing its conviction. “The way you thrive here, with all this life around you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips twitched into a faint smile, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. She let out a slow exhale, shaking her head. “You make it sound so easy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s not,” Agatha admitted, her hand still resting gently on Rio’s arm. “But nothing worth having ever is. You’re stubborn, and I’m no picnic, either. But if there’s one thing I know, it’s that you’re worth every bit of the challenge.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung between them, heavy but comforting. Rio glanced around her apartment, at the plants she’d cared for, the books she’d collected, the space that had been entirely hers. And then her eyes found Nicky again, his little laugh ringing out as he pretended one of his dinosaurs was climbing the monstera.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her independence had always been her shield, her sanctuary. But now, for the first time, she wondered if it might be okay to share it—not to lose it, but to let it grow alongside something new. She looked back at Agatha, her hesitation still there, but softened by the glimmer of something else: hope.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the conversation wound down, the easy banter between them gave way to a thoughtful quiet. Nicky had climbed back onto the couch, happily reenacting a dinosaur battle with his toys, leaving Rio and Agatha standing by the counter. Rio’s fingers absently traced the rim of the watering can, her eyes distant as she stared at her little jungle of plants.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha noticed the shift immediately. The energy that had animated Rio earlier seemed to dim, as doubt began to creep in. Agatha stepped closer, her hand brushing lightly against Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey,” she said softly, drawing Rio’s gaze. “What’s going on in that beautiful head of yours?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, biting her lip as she weighed her words. Finally, she sighed, setting the watering can down. “I just… I don’t want to mess anything up,” she admitted, her voice quiet. “You and Nicky—you’ve got your home, your rhythm. What if I disrupt that? What if it’s too soon?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha studied her for a moment, her expression unreadable. Then she reached out, cupping Rio’s cheek gently, her thumb brushing against her skin. “Rio,” she said, her tone steady and reassuring, “you wouldn’t just be moving in. You’d be part of our family. That’s not a disruption—it’s an addition. A beautiful one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her throat tighten at the word <em>family</em>, the sincerity in Agatha’s voice threatening to undo her. She closed her eyes for a moment, leaning into Agatha’s touch as she tried to push back the doubts swirling in her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened her eyes, her gaze meeting Agatha’s. For a moment, the weight of her doubts eased, replaced by the warmth in those words. But still, she wasn’t quite ready to say yes—not yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll think about it,” she said finally, her voice tinged with affection and a touch of vulnerability.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her hand dropping back to her side. “That’s all I’m asking, love,” she said gently.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama!” Nicky’s voice broke the moment as he held up one of his toys triumphantly. “Jack O’Plantern won the battle! He’s king of the plants now!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “All hail King Jack,” she said with mock solemnity, earning a giggle from Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t long before Agatha gathered Nicky and his things, preparing to head home. Rio stood by the door, watching as Nicky gave her an enthusiastic wave before running to the stairs. Agatha lingered for a moment, her hand brushing Rio’s one last time, pecking her lips several times before taking a step back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Goodnight, Rio,” she said softly, her smile warm but knowing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Goodnight,” Rio replied, her own smile faint but genuine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the door closed behind them, Rio leaned against it, letting out a slow breath. The apartment felt quieter now, her plants casting long shadows in the soft glow of the lamps. She glanced at the monstera, at Liliage, at all the life she’d nurtured in this space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her thoughts were a tangle of emotions—fear, hope, longing, and uncertainty all woven together. But amidst it all, Agatha’s words echoed in her mind: <em>You’d be part of our family.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For the first time tonight, Rio really allowed herself to consider what that might mean. And as the night stretched on, she sat amidst her plants, letting the thought take root.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

</p><p> </p><p>              (T.S. Eliot. “East Coker.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The next day, Rio found herself pacing around her apartment, thoughts swirling in a way that made her restless. The conversation with Agatha the night before had left her both unsettled and intrigued. <em>You’d be part of our family.</em> The words had stuck with her, bouncing around in her head like a melody she couldn’t shake. It had felt so simple when Agatha said it-just move in with them- but for Rio, it was anything but. She loved her independence, her space, the life she had built for herself. And yet… the idea of sharing it with Agatha and Nicky felt both exciting and terrifying.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a deep breath, Rio pulled out her phone and dialed the number she knew would offer her some much-needed clarity. The line rang twice before Lilia picked up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, sweet girl,” Lilia’s warm voice came through the phone. “How are you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m okay,” Rio replied, her voice sounding more uncertain than she’d intended. “Actually, no, I’m… I’m not. Can I come over for lunch?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a pause on the other end, then a soft chuckle. “Of course, sweetheart. You know you don’t have to ask. I’ll make something nice. See you soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled faintly. “Thanks, Lilia. I’ll be there in an hour.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio arrived at Lilia’s apartment, the comforting smells of something warm and savory greeted her at the door. Lilia was already at the kitchen counter, chopping vegetables with her usual grace, her movements steady and deliberate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, kiddo,” Lilia said warmly, her eyes softening as she looked at Rio. “I’m glad you came. You look like you’ve got a lot on your mind.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed lightly but it didn’t reach her eyes. She sat down at the kitchen table, resting her arms on it. “Yeah… I think I do.” Her voice wavered slightly, and she sighed, going for it. “Agatha asked me to move in with her and Nicky. Well, she didn’t exactly <em>ask </em>for it, but she <em>suggested</em> it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia set down the knife she had been using, her expression turning thoughtful as she joined Rio at the table. “Okay, I see. And you don’t know what to do? You don’t sound convinced.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled bitterly, shaking her head. “It’s not that. I’m just… I don’t know. I love my space, you know? I love having my independence. And I’m not sure if it’s the right time, or if I’d just be… imposing, or disrupting their dynamic. I mean, it’s <em>their</em> home, Lilia, and Nicky. He’s just a kid. What if I mess that up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s face softened, her hands coming to rest on Rio’s. She was quiet for a moment, letting Rio’s words settle in the air between them before responding with the patience she always seemed to offer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Lilia began gently, her voice a grounding force, “I can hear the weight of all your fears in your voice. But this isn’t something you’re doing alone. Agatha asked because she <em>wants</em> you there. She sees you as part of her family, and Nicky—well, that little boy adores you. It sounds like you’re already part of their world. The question is whether you’re ready to make it official.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back in her chair, glancing down at her hands as she let the words sink in. “It’s just… a lot. I’ve been on my own for so long, and the idea of changing everything—sharing a home with them, with a kid… I don’t know if I’m ready to blend my life like that. What if I can’t handle it? What if I’m not a good fit?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s gaze softened even further, and she reached out, resting her hand over Rio’s. “You’ve always worried about fitting in, sweet girl. But you already fit with Agatha and Nicky. The question is whether you believe it. Moving in doesn’t mean giving up who you are. It means finding a place where you can all grow together, support each other. If you’re not ready, that’s okay. But I think you’ll know when the time is right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a long, slow breath, trying to absorb the weight of Lilia’s words. “I just don’t want to mess things up,” she murmured, her voice quieter now, filled with vulnerability. “I love them, both of them, and the idea of being part of something like that… It’s scary, you know?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia leaned over, folding her arms on the table, her voice steady and reassuring. “Of course it’s scary. But nothing worth having ever comes without fear. Whatever choice you make, you’ll do it with your heart. And that’s all that matters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled softly, her heart lightened by Lilia’s unwavering support. “Thanks, Lilia. You always know what to say.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled warmly, getting up to stir something on the stove. “You’re welcome, darling. Now, how about we have some lunch and let you think this over a little more? No decisions today, just some good food and conversation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled and nodded, feeling the tension in her shoulders ease as she watched Lilia move around the kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they settled down at the table, the warm, comforting food before them seemed to lighten Rio’s mood. She took a bite, but her mind was still busy, turning over the conversation she’d had with Agatha the night before, and the one she just had with Lilia.</p><p align="justify">Lilia watched her, her eyes sharp but filled with understanding. After a few moments, she set down her fork and leaned forward slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Lilia said, her tone gentle but direct, “you’ve always had a way of overthinking things when it comes to people you care about. Agatha, Nicky, the idea of moving in… you’re looking for every possible reason to hesitate, to doubt. I get it, sweetheart. It’s a big step. But if your heart is saying yes, maybe you should trust it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, a little taken aback by the straightforwardness of Lilia’s words. She opened her mouth, but the words didn’t come right away. Lilia was right, of course. Rio had always been quick to question herself, to pick apart the details until they felt too complicated. Her fear of messing things up, of losing herself in the process, often made her second-guess what she truly wanted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know if I <em>can</em> trust it,” Rio admitted quietly, her fingers tracing the edge of her plate. “What if I get in too deep and realize it’s not what I want? What if I can’t do it? What if I disappoint them?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia regarded her with a knowing look, her eyes soft but firm. “You’ll never know if you don’t take the step, Rio. Trusting your heart doesn’t mean everything will be perfect. It means you’re willing to embrace the mess and the beauty of it, even when you can’t predict the outcome.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a soft sigh, the weight of Lilia’s words pressing down on her. <em>Trust your heart.</em> It seemed so simple when Lilia said it, but for Rio, the concept felt like a leap of faith. She had spent so long protecting herself, keeping her emotions in check, that trusting her heart felt like a risk she wasn’t sure she was ready to take.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But there was something about the way Lilia said it, the way she always seemed to know exactly what Rio needed to hear. She wasn’t offering any grand answers, just a simple truth: maybe it was time to stop overthinking and start listening to what her heart had been quietly saying all along.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think… I think I’m scared,” Rio whispered, her voice small but honest. “Scared of losing myself. Scared of things changing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled softly, her expression full of empathy. “You’re allowed to be scared, Rio. But remember, the people who love you aren’t asking you to lose yourself. They’re asking you to share yourself and your life with them. And there’s a difference.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio slumped a little in her chair, the tension in her chest easing just a little. “I want to. I really do. But it’s a lot to take in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded. “Of course it is. You don’t have to have all the answers right now. Take your time. But maybe it’s time to listen to what you really want.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a long breath, feeling the weight of Lilia’s wisdom settle in her bones. She wasn’t sure where this path would lead, but for the first time in a long while, she felt like maybe it was worth taking a step forward, trusting that the answer wasn’t as complicated as she’d made it out to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Lilia,” Rio said again, her voice tinged with gratitude. “I’ll think about it. Really think about it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, a knowing glint in her eyes. “You’ll figure it out, my love. You always do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smile grew, and she reached across the table, her hand resting gently over Rio’s. The moment felt warm, as if the weight of the conversation had shifted, and Lilia’s calm presence filled the space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Lilia began again slowly, her voice takingg on a reflective tone, “when I took you in, I had no idea what I was getting into. It wasn’t a decision that came with a clear plan or certainty. There were a lot of fears—what if I failed you? What if you didn’t feel at home? What if I wasn’t enough?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked up at Lilia, her eyes wide, hearing her adoptive mother speak about that time with a quiet vulnerability she hadn’t fully noticed before. Lilia had always been so steady, so confident. To hear her admit doubts, even in the face of doing something so incredibly generous, struck Rio deeply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But sometimes,” Lilia continued, her voice firm but filled with warmth, “it’s about taking that step when it feels right. When your heart tells you it’s worth it, even if the steps ahead are uncertain. I didn’t know if I was ready to be a mother, but I <em>knew</em> I was ready to take care of you. To give you a home. And look at us now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a lump form in her throat, a mixture of gratitude and emotion bubbling up. Lilia had taken her in when she was a scared, lost teenager, providing her with a sense of security she hadn’t known she needed. To think that Lilia, too, had once faced the unknown in a similar way was humbling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s hand squeezed hers gently, a proud glint in her eyes. “And now look at you. You’ve found people who care about you so deeply, Rio. Agatha, Nicky—it’s clear they see something in you that’s worth holding on to. You’ve built your own life, but you’ve also made space for them. That’s not easy. And it makes me proud, more than you’ll ever know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked rapidly, a tear slipping down her cheek before she could stop it. She quickly wiped it away, embarrassed, but Lilia just smiled, her eyes soft and full of understanding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve done something not everyone can do,” Lilia said, her voice quiet but full of emotion. “You’ve opened yourself up to love. And you’re letting it in, even when it scares you. That’s something to be proud of, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, the room fell into a comfortable silence. Rio sat back in her chair, the emotions swirling in her chest beginning to settle. It was as if the weight of her decision had lightened, if only a little, by the simple reminder of what she had already accomplished in her life. She had built something on her own, but she had also allowed herself to trust others, to open up and let them care for her. Maybe she really was ready for the next step.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s vice thickened with emotion. “I don’t think I’ve ever really stopped enough to think about it like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled warmly, her hand brushing over Rio’s hair. “That’s what I’m here for, sweet girl. To help you see what’s already there. You’re stronger than you think, and you’ve got people who are ready to walk with you, no matter what comes next.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her heart lighter now, though she still had a lot to think through.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sat back in her chair, her fingers gently tracing the edge of her glass. The conversation with Lilia had eased some of her worries, but there was one thing that still weighed heavily on her mind, a lingering uncertainty she hadn’t yet voiced.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I guess there’s one thing I’m still nervous about,” Rio admitted, her voice quieter now, almost uncertain. She shifted uncomfortably, not quite meeting Lilia’s eyes. “I’m not sure about… about what I’m supposed to do with Nicky. I don’t want to step on any toes. It’s one thing to be there for Agatha, but I don’t know if it’s my place to be that involved with him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyes softened with understanding, and she leaned forward slightly, her gaze warm but knowing. “You’re afraid of overstepping, aren’t you?” she asked gently, her tone calm and reassuring.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded slowly, biting her lip. “Yeah. I know Agatha wants me there. I know she’s inviting me in, but… Nicky’s her son. It’s different. I don’t want to assume anything, or try to be something I’m not supposed to be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s expression never wavered, and after a moment, she reached over, placing a hand on top of Rio’s. Her voice was steady, filled with quiet wisdom. “Rio, you already care about him. I can see it when you’re with him, the way you look out for him. You’re already a part of his life. The rest? That will come naturally, sweetheart. There’s no formula for these things. It’s about showing up, being there, and letting him see that you care. You don’t have to force anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a slow breath, the tightness in her chest easing just a little. Lilia was right, in a way. She had always been there for Agatha, and in turn, that had meant she was there for Nicky as well. Her love for Agatha extended to him, too, even if it felt like a delicate balancing act. The idea of fully stepping into that role, though, felt like a much bigger step than she had anticipated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I guess I’m just worried about what kind of role I’m supposed to play,” Rio admitted, her voice quiet now, full of vulnerability. “What if I try to step in too much and confuse things? What if Nicky doesn’t want me in that way, like some… second mom or something?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled softly, a knowing glint in her eyes. “You’re not going to be a second mom, Rio. You’re going to be you. That’s all he needs. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for—they know when someone cares. And they know when that care is real. You’ll figure out what you mean to him later, and it won’t have to fit into some pre-made box.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded slowly, the warmth in Lilia’s words sinking in. The fear hadn’t entirely faded, but the tight knot in her chest loosened a little. She knew she wasn’t being asked to replace anything—only to be a part of something bigger. And maybe that was all she needed to do: be herself, show up when it mattered, and let the rest unfold.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Mom,” Rio murmured softly, the word rare on her lips as she gently squeezed Lilia’s hand, maybe also to show that she understood that she too, had been in Nicky’s position once. “I just… I don’t want to mess it up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia gave her a reassuring smile, her eyes full of love and pride. “You won’t. Just trust yourself. And remember, there’s no need to rush. You’ve got time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back in her chair, feeling the weight of Lilia’s support settle around her. The path ahead wasn’t going to be perfect, and there were bound to be moments of uncertainty. But maybe that was the beauty of it—taking it one step at a time, with an open heart, and trusting that the people who loved her would help her find her way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the conversation drew to a close, Lilia stood up from the table and walked over to the windowsill, her movements slow and deliberate. Rio watched her fumble with something curiously, unsure of what was happening but sensing that Lilia had something important to share.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia turned around, a box in her hand, that Rio couldn’t see yet. She held it out to Rio, her eyes soft and filled with meaning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Here,” she said, her voice quiet but steady. “I want you to take this with you. Just in case.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio frowned slightly as she took the box from her, unsure of what it was. Lilia nodded, urging her to open it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Inside the box was a small, polished stone—smooth and round, a calming shade of deep blue with streaks of white running through it. It wasn’t anything extravagant, but the weight of it in Rio’s hand felt significant, like it held more than just its physical form.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the familiar weight of the smooth, cool surface against her fingers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It had been years ago, during her first summer at Lilia’s house, when she’d discovered the stone on the lakeshore, a few miles from the house. She’d been walking alone, her feet dipping into the cool water, feeling lost but comforted by the silence of the lake around her. It was there, nestled among the smooth stones and driftwood, that she had found it—perfectly round, a deep shade of blue with streaks of white running through it. She hadn’t known why, but it had felt significant, like a piece of the world was offering her a reminder of something she needed to hold onto.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She’d brought it back to Lilia’s house, unsure of why it mattered, but instinctively knowing it was something special. Lilia had smiled when she handed it over, her eyes lighting up with that same knowing warmth Rio had come to cherish. “We’ll put it right there,” Lilia had said, placing it on the windowsill where it caught the light every morning. “As a reminder that you’re home now. And that this house will always be a place for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From then on, the stone had become a small but constant fixture in Lilia’s house, always proudly displayed on the windowsill or on a shelf. It had become a symbol of belonging. A reminder that Rio had found her place, even if it took time to fully undertsand what that place meant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s voice was gentle as she spoke. “This stone has been with us for years. It’s a little piece of our home, a reminder that there’s always a place for you, wherever you go. If you decide that moving in with Agatha and Nicky is what you want, take this with you. Let it remind you that you’re not just gaining a new house—you’re gaining a new chapter, one that’s full of love and possibility.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed, feeling a tightness in her throat at Lilia’s words. It was more than just a keepsake; it was a symbol of Lilia’s unwavering support, a physical representation of her belief that this step forward could be a positive, fulfilling one for Rio. It meant that wherever Rio went, there would always be a home for her, even if that home wasn’t the one she had known for so long.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, her eyes soft but full of love. “You don’t have to make any decisions right now. But no matter what, you’ll always have a place with me. And I believe this will be a good step for you, Rio. A very good one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt the warmth of the stone in her palm, her heart swelling with emotion. She had always known Lilia had her back, but this gesture—this small, meaningful act—solidified that in a way words couldn’t.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now, as she held it in her hand again, the significance of it was clearer than ever. Lilia’s gesture wasn’t just about giving her something physical—it was about offering her the same comfort and reassurance that stone had provided all those years ago. It was as if Lilia was telling her, once more, that wherever Rio went, whatever step she took, she would always have somewhere to go back to. And that, in itself, was a constant she could hold onto.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll keep it with me,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “Thank you, Lilia. For everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, her smile gentle and knowing. “You don’t need to thank me, my sweet sweet girl. You’ve always had a place in my heart. And now, you’re finding a place in someone else’s, too. I’m proud of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio slipped the stone into her pocket, she felt a sense of calm wash over her. No matter where life took her, she would always have Lilia’s love and belief in her. And she hoped that would be enough to help her take the leap forward when the time came.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Two days later, Rio found herself standing in Agatha’s doorway that evening, her favorite plant cradled carefully in her arms. It was a medium, potted fern with delicate fronds that she had nurtured for years. She wasn’t sure why she felt compelled to bring it with her, but something about it felt like a way of testing the waters, a small but significant gesture that spoke louder than words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha opened the door, her usual confident air softening slightly when she saw the plant in Rio’s hands. For a moment, she raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a grin she couldn’t hide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is this… a housewarming gift?” Agatha teased, her voice light, though there was a flicker of something else in her eyes—a quiet amusement, and hope, as though she knew exactly what this meant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, her lips twitching as she replied, “I thought I’d bring something familiar. You know, to <em>test the waters</em>.” Her words were playful, but she couldn’t entirely mask the vulnerability beneath them. The act of bringing her plant was small, but it felt like a step. She wanted to see if she could envision her life here, if this space—this home—was one she could fit into.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s grin widened as she stepped aside, letting Rio into the house. She glanced down at the plant with a nod of approval. “I see you’ve decided to bring <em>the</em> plant,” she said, her voice softer now, as though the humor was melting away to something deeper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged, though the movement felt almost shy. “It’s the one I’ve had the longest,” she explained, carefully setting the pot down on a small table near the window. “It’s like a little piece of home for me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched Rio’s movements closely, her smile never quite fading. “Well, it certainly looks like it belongs here already,” she said, a touch of affection in her voice. She stepped closer, her gaze lingering on the plant before circling Rio’s body from behind with her arms and resting her chin on the younger’s woman shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, neither of them spoke. Agatha’s expression softened, her lips parting slightly as she hugged Rio with something tender—an unspoken understanding. Then she tilted her head, her grin returning, this time with a little more warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know, I think this is a sign,” Agatha said quietly, her tone almost playful again. “Maybe you’re starting to <em>test</em> more than just the waters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, a flutter of nervous excitement stirring in her chest. She glanced at the fern, then back at Agatha, her heart beating a little faster. It wasn’t just about the plant. It was about the possibility of moving in, of fitting into Agatha and Nicky’s world in a deeper, more permanent way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe I am,” Rio admitted, her voice quieter now, almost uncertain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, tightening her hold, her hands covering Rio’s with a softness that made Rio’s heart skip a beat. “Well, I’m glad you’re testing it here,” she said, her words laced with a subtle warmth. “Because this house? It feels more like <em>home</em>with you in it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The weight of Agatha’s words sank in, and Rio felt a wave of emotion rise in her chest. She hadn’t expected the simple act of bringing her plant to be so charged with meaning, but somehow, it was. Maybe it was a small step, but it felt like the beginning of something bigger, something that could grow just as naturally as the plants she tended so carefully.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, sensing the quiet shift in the room, gave her a soft smile, her eyes filled with understanding. “Take your time,” she added, her voice low and reassuring. “But just know, the waters you’re testing don’t have to be cold and stormy. They can be calm and warm too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded, her heart a little lighter. The plant was a small thing—but it felt like a bridge, a way of making the first step without rushing. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio stepped back from the table, admiring her plant in its new spot, Nicky suddenly appeared beside her, eyes wide with excitement. Without hesitation, he planted himself next to the fern, his tiny hands reaching out to gently touch the leaves as if he had been given the most important task in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It can be my job too, right?” he asked eagerly, his voice bright and full of pride. He glanced up at Agatha and Rio for confirmation, clearly eager to prove that he could handle this responsibility.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, watching with a knowing smile, nodded. “You’ve got it, kiddo. Liliage is yours to take care of now, when I’m not here.” She ruffled Nicky’s hair, her voice warm and encouraging. “Just remember, you have to water her every day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but smile at the sight of Nicky’s enthusiasm. There was something about seeing him so excited, so proud of his new “job,” that struck her deeply. She hadn’t expected it, but seeing him this happy with something as simple as taking care of a plant made her heart swell. The idea of this little creature becoming part of her daily life, part of her routine, felt unexpectedly meaningful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha met her gaze, the tenderness in her eyes unmistakable. “I think Nicky’s going to be very good at this,” she said, her voice warm with pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded slowly, a quiet smile tugging at her lips as she looked back at Nicky, who was now chattering away excitedly about all the things he was going to do to take care of the plant. She felt a gentle pull in her chest—something she couldn’t quite explain, but something that made her want to say yes, even if just to this small, simple beginning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe I’ll bring over a few more,” Rio said softly, more to herself than to anyone else. Maybe this could work. Maybe it was time to let her roots grow somewhere new.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s excited voice cut through the moment, his face lighting up as he turned to Agatha with wide eyes. “I want a plant in my room, too!” he declared, his enthusiasm contagious. “A big one, like the ones in Rio’s apartment!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been watching the exchange between Rio and Nicky with a soft smile, chuckled at the request. “Well, if you really think you can take care of it, I suppose we could find room for a plant in your room,” she said, her tone playful, though there was a hint of fondness in her voice. She ruffled his hair again, clearly proud of his newfound sense of responsibility.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky bounced on his heels, his hands clasped together in a gesture of excitement. “I can totally take care of it! I’ll water it every day like Liliage!” His face was beaming with determination, and it was clear that the idea of having his very own plant was thrilling to him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio watched the exchange with a quiet smile, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. Nicky’s enthusiasm was impossible to resist. She could already imagine him taking care of his own little plant in his room, much like he’d promised to care for the fern. The thought of him growing up with a little green companion to look after made her heart flutter. She could picture Agatha’s house full of life—both from the people who lived there and the plants that would thrive in every room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That sounds like a great idea,” Rio said, her voice soft but full of affection. “Plants make any room feel more… alive, don’t you think?” Her gaze lingered on Nicky, who was already imagining the perfect spot for his new plant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her eyes meeting Rio’s with a quiet smile. “They really do. And I think Nicky would make a great plant parent,” she added, her tone full of pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile deepened, and for a moment, she let herself imagine it all. Nicky’s plant sitting proudly in his room, thriving under his care, just like the fern under hers. And her plants, scattered around Agatha’s home, growing and changing alongside the little family they were becoming. It felt like a natural progression—a way to blend her life into theirs, piece by piece.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe we should start with a small plant for Nicky’s room first,” Rio said, her smile soft and warm. “To get him used to take care of one. And then he can graduate to a nice big one, just like you said.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile deepened, and she nodded in agreement. “Sounds perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A few days later, Rio found herself standing in the doorway of Agatha’s house, the weight of her decision settling in her chest. Her heart beat a little faster as she looked at Agatha, who was already at the door waiting for her, a soft smile playing at the corners of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky was playing in the living room, humming to himself as he carefully tended to his new own fern, his concentration almost comical for someone so young.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes immediately flickered to Rio, a question in her gaze, and Rio felt a warmth spread through her as she took a deep breath, stepping across the threshold.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve thought about it,” Rio began, her voice steady, though there was a nervousness bubbling just beneath the surface. “And… I think I’m ready.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes widened in surprise and then, before Rio could finish, Agatha was across the room in a heartbeat, her arms wrapping around Rio in a tight embrace. “Really?” Agatha’s voice in her ear was full of disbelief and joy, as though she couldn’t quite believe the words she was hearing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her lips curving into a small but genuine smile. “I’ve made up my mind. I’ll move in. With you and Nicky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft laugh of relief, her grip tightening around Rio as she pulled her in closer. “I’m so happy,” she murmured against Rio’s hair, her voice full of emotion. “You don’t even know how much this means to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio could feel the warmth of Agatha’s embrace, the weight of the moment sinking in. She had expected to feel more uncertainty, but instead, she felt a calm certainty that this was the right choice. This was where she was meant to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before she could say anything else, Nicky appeared at her side, his small face alight with excitement, as he had apparently heard the whole thing. He looked up at her with wide eyes, his voice filled with enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Does this mean you’re gonna live here for real now?” he asked, his voice almost too big for his little body.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned down to meet his gaze, her smile widening as she nodded. “Yeah, kiddo. I’m moving in. For real.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face broke into a grin so wide it nearly took over his whole face. He threw his arms around her in a hug, nearly knocking her over with the force of it. “I’m gonna help you move all your stuff! I’m big and strong now, you know!” he said proudly, puffing out his chest in the most endearing way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, feeling a warmht she hadn’t expected. “I’m sure you are,” she teased, ruffling his hair affectionately. “I’ll need all the help I can get.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been watching with a quiet smile, couldn’t help herself anymore. She leaned in and kissed Rio—quick, soft, and full of happiness. Then she kissed her again, this time a little longer, a little more lingering, as if she couldn’t quite believe it was really happening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m so happy,” Agatha whispered, pulling back slightly but still holding Rio close. “You’re going to be such a big part of our world, I can’t wait for everything to change with you here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a smile tug at her lips as she held Agatha’s gaze. “Me too,” she said softly. “I think it’s going to be really good.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky bounded off to grab a toy truck for their “moving mission,” Agatha held Rio for a moment longer, her arms tight around her. There was no need for words. Both of them felt it—the quiet joy of a new chapter starting, the promise of growth and love, not just for Rio, but for all three of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t believe it,” Agatha murmured, more to herself than to Rio. “You’re here. You’re really here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And I’m here to stay, my love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as Rio stood there, enveloped in Agatha’s warmth and Nicky’s boundless excitement, she realized that she felt like she belonged in a way she hadn’t before. This house, this life—this was where she was meant to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Two weeks later, the house was a whirlwind of boxes, packing tape, and the unmistakable sounds of laughter. Rio stood in the middle of her new home—Agatha’s house—her hands on her hips as she surveyed the chaos with a grin that wouldn’t seem to fade. It was a mess, but it was a happy mess, and every corner of the house buzzed with the energy of change.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen was busy directing traffic, her voice carrying over the din. “This box says <em>books</em> on it, Rio. It weighs about ten thousand pounds. Where do you want it?” she called, balancing the box precariously in her arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Bookshelves in the living room!” Rio replied, her voice bright with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice followed closely behind, carrying another box labeled <em>ballet stuff</em>. “I’m just saying, if you don’t put these pointe shoes on display somewhere, I’ll riot,” she teased, setting the box down near the couch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, the calmest of the group, was in the kitchen unpacking dishes and humming softly. She looked over at Rio and gave her a warm smile. “It’s coming together beautifully,” she said. “Feels like you’ve been here forever already, sweet girl.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, her heart swelling as she looked at her three helpers. “That’s because you three are working your butts off while I stand here pretending to supervise,” she joked, brushing a stray lock of hair out of her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Nicky darted around the house like a whirlwind, proudly carrying one of Rio’s smaller plants to his room. “I’m putting this one right next to my bed!” he announced, his voice full of determination. “So it can grow big and strong like me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, leaning against the doorway with her arms crossed, watched the scene unfold with a soft, contented smile. Her house was fuller now—not just with stuff, but with life. She caught Rio’s eye and gave her a look that said everything she couldn’t quite put into words in that moment: <em>Thank you for choosing us.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the last box had been unpacked and the furniture rearranged for the third time, the group gathered in the living room to celebrate. Alice popped open a bottle of sparkling cider while Jen handed out glasses, and Nicky insisted on toasting with everyone, even if his cup was just juice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“To Rio,” Agatha said, raising her glass. Her voice was steady, but there was an unmistakable emotion in her tone. “And to the chaos she brings into our lives—in the best way possible.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, the sound bright and genuine, as everyone clinked their glasses together. “To Agatha,” she replied, glancing at her with a soft smile. “For giving me a home, in every sense of the word.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And to me,” Nicky added, eagerly, clinking his little plastic glass with everyone’s, making all the women present laugh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening wound down and their friends left, the house grew quieter. Agatha, Rio and Nicky sat together on the couch, their legs tangled, a blanket thrown on them. Around them, the house was a blend of both their lives now—Agatha’s tastefully decorated living room filled with touches of Rio’s personality: plants in every corner, books piled high, and a round smooth blue stone on the windowsill.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached out, intertwining her fingers with Rio’s over Nicky’s sleeping form. “How does it feel?” she asked softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked around the room, at Nicky sleeping peacefully with his head on her lap , at their hands clasped together, at the life they were building. “Like I’ve never been happier,” she said simply, leaning her head against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed a kiss to the top of her head, her heart full. “Good,” she murmured. “Because we couldn’t be happier to have you here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And in that moment, as the house settled into its new rhythm, Rio knew she was exactly where she belonged.</p><p align="justify">

</p><p> </p><p>         (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">It was the middle of a long day when Rio, Agatha, Alice, and Jen gathered at a cozy café just off campus for one of their rare double dates. After Alice had spilled the news about Rio and Agatha’s relationship—and that Jen had even helped Rio move in a week earlier—Jen had been completely on board with the idea. In fact, she’d been the one to suggest a first double date. Rio had hesitated at first, knowing her best friends’ tendency to tease, but eventually, she had agreed. What started as a tentative outing had now become a regular occurrence. Despite the age gap, Agatha had seamlessly integrated into their friend group, much to Rio’s delight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen were already sitting in their usual booth at the end of the café, talking lightly, Alice almost on Jen’s lap, when they spotted Rio entering, Agatha a few steps behind, rummaging in the bag hanging from her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, here comes Rio,” Alice said with a smirk, tapping her mug against Jen’s. “Bet she’s fresh from another <em>riveting </em>morning with Dr. Harkness. Care to share, Rio? How’s living in sin with the university's finest intellectual heartthrob treating you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze when she reached the table, her eyes wide as a blush crept up her neck. “I—what?” she spluttered, caught completely off guard. “I don’t—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen joined in, grinning. “Oh, come on. We all know you two can’t keep your hands off each other. What’s it like being the University’s secret reigning romantic soap opera?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face turned a deeper shade of red, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water. She turned to Agatha, who was following casually, her hand on Rio’s waist, while the other was still deep in her bag, seemingly unbothered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p class="p1">“Agatha!” Rio hissed, desperate for backup. “Say something!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha finally looked up, raising an eyebrow at the group. For a moment, she seemed ready to offer some diplomatic response, her lips parting with what looked like mild exasperation. But then, Rio saw it—that mischievous glint in her eyes, the slow curve of her lips as a sly smile took over.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Oh, should I?” Agatha drawled, snapping her bag closed with deliberate finality. Her hand slid from Rio’s waist to the small of her back, pulling her just slightly closer. “Well, if you <em>really</em> want to know…”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Agatha, <em>no</em>,” Rio groaned, her hands flying to her cheeks as she realized what was coming.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha ignored her entirely, leaning back in her chair with the air of someone settling in for a performance. “This morning was… <em>enchanting,</em> to say the least. Isn’t that right, darling?” She shot Rio a wink that made her want to evaporate on the spot.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Agatha, <em>stop!</em>” Rio squeaked, her voice muffled as she buried her face in her hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Agatha was on a roll now, leaning back in her chair with an air of mock pensiveness. “Let’s see. There was the part where she insisted on wearing that silk robe I adore and it has that opening down the front—”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Alice’s jaw dropped, and Jen’s laugh turned into a poorly stifled cough as Rio practically shrieked, “Oh my god, <em>don’t</em>!”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha didn’t miss a beat, her smirk growing wider. “And then, of course, I had to help her with her hair—she couldn’t decide between a braid or leaving it loose, and, well…” She trailed off, tapping her chin theatrically. “We <em>might</em> have gotten a little distracted. Come to think of it, I don’t think we ever made it to breakfast.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s jaw dropped as she burst out laughing. “Okay, okay, too much information! I wasn’t ready for that!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen was in stitches, clutching her stomach. “You’re killing me! Agatha, I take it back. You win.” She then turned to Rio. “You poor thing. You thought she’d save you? She’s throwing you right under the bus!”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio, face now a deep crimson, groaned into her hands. “I can’t believe this is my life,” she muttered, her voice muffled by sheer embarrassment.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha leaned down, her lips brushing against Rio’s ear as she murmured just loud enough for the table to hear, “Oh, darling, this is just the beginning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was practically vibrating with embarrassment, her face buried in her hands. “I can’t believe you,” she mumbled, though the corners of her lips twitched despite herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned over, pulling Rio’s hands gently away from her face and planting a soft kiss on her knuckles. “Oh, come now, darling. You know you love me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned dramatically, but the way she leaned into Agatha’s touch betrayed her true feelings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice wiped a tear from her eye, shaking her head. “Remind me never to challenge Agatha again. She’s terrifying when she’s in full unashamed girlfriend mode.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, her gaze full of mischief. “You should have known better, Alice. No one teases my Rio about this but me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room erupted in laughter, and though Rio was still blushing furiously, she couldn’t help but laugh too. She knew what she was signing up for with those people—embarrassment and all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stretched her arms above her head, letting out a soft groan of relief, her head lolling against her partner’s shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t wait to take a bath tonight after this,” Rio said dreamily, her voice carrying the wistful tone of someone already imagining the warm, relaxing water.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">The room didn’t just fall silent—it seemed to hold its collective breath. Then, like clockwork, Alice struck.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Alright, that’s enough,” she said with a wicked grin, leaning forward as she tapped her fingers against the table. “We do <em>not</em> need to know what the two of you are planning to do in the bath. Keep it PG, Vidal.” She wiggled her eyebrows for good measure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face immediately turned bright red again, her hands flying back to her cheeks as she spluttered, “Come on, not again! That’s not—I didn’t mean— oh my god, Alice, seriously?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, never one to shy away from another playful challenge, raised an eyebrow and leaned in closer to Rio, her lips brushing the shell of her ear as she whispered, “Well, I know exactly what’s going to happen when we’re alone tonight, darling.” Her voice was low, teasing, and filled with an affectionate warmth.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Rio practically choked on her own breath, her face somehow managing to turn an even deeper shade of red as she buried it in Agatha’s shoulder with a mortified groan. “Agatha!”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Alice, thoroughly delighted, cackled as she leaned back in her seat, clutching her chest. “Oh my god, Agatha! I was joking, but now you’ve gone and confirmed it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, thoroughly enjoying the scene, leaned forward with a grin. “Looks like Agatha is in charge of bath time,” she remarked, clearly delighted by Rio’s flustered reaction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, however, was completely unfazed. A slow, wicked grin spread across her face as she wrapped an arm around Rio’s shoulders, pulling her out from behind her. “Oh, come now, ladies,” she purred, her voice dripping with mock offense. “If we really wanted to scandalize you, we’d give you details about what <em>actually</em> happened this morning.”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">“Oh, darling,” Agatha teased, her grin downright wicked as her fingers grazed the back of Rio’s neck. “You started this with that little bath comment. I’m just playing along.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Alice laughed so hard she almost knocked over her mug. “This is better than I ever could’ve hoped for!” She turned to Jen, who was barely hiding her smirk. “Agatha’s got no chill whatsoever. Poor Rio doesn’t stand a chance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned down, her lips brushing against Rio’s temple in a teasingly affectionate gesture. “Oh, but isn’t she adorable when she’s flustered?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio muttered something incoherent into her hands, but the telltale twitch of her lips betrayed her amusement despite her embarrassment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, sipping her coffee from the corner, raised an eyebrow and added dryly, “Honestly, I think I preferred it when Rio’s comments didn’t make sense and she was just fawning over you. At least we didn’t have to imagine…” She trailed off, a smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth, letting the implication hang in the air.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha chuckled, unfazed, while Rio peeked up just enough to glare halfheartedly at the group. “I hate all of you,” she grumbled, but her tone was more resigned than angry, laced with begrudging fondness.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Oh, maybe,” Alice said with a shrug, raising her coffee like a toast, “but you keep coming back for more, so who’s the real winner here?”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio sighed dramatically, leaning into Agatha with a defeated groan. “Unfortunately, I’m stuck with you lunatics. But I <em>really</em> hate you all right now,” she added, her voice dripping with mock despair.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">The group’s laughter filled the café as the conversation shifted. Agatha leaned down, her voice low and meant only for Rio. “Don’t worry, my love,” she whispered, her tone turning from playful to irresistibly soft. “I’ll make sure you get that bath tonight, no interruptions… unless, of course, you want them.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swatted at her lightly, but the smile on her face lingered. Despite the teasing, there was no place she’d rather be than right there with the love of her life and the eccentric group of women they called friends.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Indeed, the bathroom at Agatha’s house had become one of their sanctuaries—a small space where time seemed to slow down, and the world outside felt distant, once Nicky was in bed, asleep in the world of dreams, probably filled with dragons, princesses and a big river ready to brave every obstacle in its path. It wasn’t uncommon for one of them to take a bath, the warm water soothing her muscles, while the other sat nearby, usually on the edge of the tub, or on the floor, lost in quiet moments of companionship.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, in particular, loved these moments. She’d lean over the side of the tub, her fingers gently swirling in the warm water, creating small ripples as she watched Rio relax. Rio would often close her eyes, leaning back with her head against the edge of the tub, letting the heat of the water melt away the tension of the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha would talk about anything and everything, sometimes just to fill the space with her voice, sometimes because she loved hearing Rio’s thoughts. She could speak about anything from mundane details—what they’d have for dinner or what had happened in class, or at the faculty meeting that day—to more meaningful reflections about life, about them, or about memories they were starting to share.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Rio would listen, half-distracted but always there, sometimes adding her own thoughts between the bubbles, her voice soft but steady. She’d smile occasionally, her lips curving just a little, or her eyes would open slightly, meeting Agatha’s gaze, the connection deepening with every word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sometimes Agatha would share her thoughts about the things that mattered most to her—like how much Rio’s smile could light up a room, or how she loved the way Rio’s energy filled her house and drew Nicky’s joy out. And Rio, her eyes half-lidded with the warmth of the water, would nod slowly, as if contemplating Agatha’s words before replying with something equally thoughtful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The conversations would meander like the water itself, flowing gently from one topic to another. Sometimes it would be about books they were reading, or a song that was stuck in Rio’s head. Sometimes, it was quiet and calm, filled with small gestures—Agatha reaching out to brush a strand of hair from Rio’s face, or Rio giving her hand a soft squeeze, reassuring and gentle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Even when their conversations wandered into silence, there was a kind of comfort in just being together—no words necessary, just the shared space and the knowledge that they had each other. And occasionally, Agatha would playfully splash Rio with the water, making her laugh, or she would rest her chin on the edge of the tub, her eyes soft with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">These moments were precious, intimate, and easy. In these quiet times, they didn’t have to be anything more than simply Agatha and Rio—no masks, no distractions, no role to play, just two people who knew each other more and more deeply every day, with a kind of love that didn’t need to be spoken out loud to be understood. And in those moments, Agatha couldn’t help but think to herself that there was no place she’d rather be than beside Rio, swirling her hand in the water, talking about anything and everything, knowing their boy was safe and sound in his room a few doors over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Saturday morning light filtered softly through the curtains, casting a gentle glow over the room. Agatha stirred, slowly waking from a restful sleep, and immediately noticed the warm, familiar weight of Rio beside her. For a moment, she thought it was just the two of them, nestled together, until she felt the small body pressing just below Rio’s head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned her head and found Nicky, his small frame tucked between them, his hair messy and his face peaceful in sleep. He must have snuck in during the night, wriggling his way between them, not a sound or movement to disturb them. Agatha smiled softly, her heart swelling with affection as she observed the tender scene.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was still deeply asleep, her breath soft and even, her hair fanned out on the pillow like a dark halo, and an arm lightly draped over Nicky’s form. Agatha couldn’t help but feel a wave of love and contentment, watching the two people she adored so much—so completely, so fiercely—so close to her. The soft rhythm of their breathing, the warmth of their bodies, it all felt like the perfect slice of peace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gently moved her arm, careful not to wake either of them, and brushed a lock of Rio’s hair from her face. She smiled, thinking about how much had changed in the past few months. Their relationship had come with its challenges, its hurdles, but mornings like this made it all feel more than worth it. It was a simple kind of happiness, the three of them tangled together in the warmth of their shared space, of their growing family.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She placed a soft kiss on Rio’s temple, then gently leaned over and kissed Nicky’s forehead too. Both of them stirred slightly but remained asleep, and Agatha’s heart swelled with a love she never thought she’d find. This—this soft, ordinary morning—was everything she wanted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she lay back down, careful not to disturb the peaceful cocoon they had made, Agatha closed her eyes, savoring the quiet moment. She never wanted to let go of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shifted slightly, a soft murmur escaping his lips as he slowly woke. He blinked a few times, rubbing his eyes sleepily before he looked up at Agatha, his small face lighting up in a sleepy smile when he realized where he was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning Mama,” he whispered, his voice still groggy with sleep, but full of warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her heart lifting at the sight of him. “Good morning, sweetheart,” she whispered back, her voice still low to keep from waking Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky yawned and stretched, his little arms flailing as he untangled himself from Rio’s arm and  pushed himself up slightly, still nestled between them. His eyes flicked to Rio, still sound asleep beside them, and he smiled. “Rio’s still sleeping?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She is,” Agatha said, running a gentle hand through Nicky’s messy hair. “But she’ll wake up soon enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky gave a nod, clearly content with this arrangement. He nestled back into the warmth between Agatha and Rio, looking up at Agatha with a serious expression. “Can we stay like this forever?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sweetness of the question caught Agatha off guard for a moment. Her heart clenched in that familiar, protective way it always did when Nicky spoke so openly about his feelings. She kissed the top of his head. “I would love that, Nicky. But for now, let’s just enjoy this moment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded again, his small smile returning. He reached up, wrapping his arms around Agatha in a gentle hug, his warmth and affection filling the quiet space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed contentedly, holding him close for a moment. Agatha couldn’t help but smile softly, feeling her son against her and watching Rio sleep, feeling an overwhelming surge of love for the two people in her life. The bond between them, though simple, was everything Agatha had never realized she needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky snuggled closer, still content to be in the peaceful embrace of his makeshift family, Agatha let herself relax, knowing that these moments—these small, soft mornings—were more than enough to make everything feel right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stirred slowly, the warmth of Nicky and Agatha surrounding her making it hard to leave the peaceful bubble of sleep. She blinked a few times, her eyes adjusting to the soft light streaming through the curtains. She felt Nicky’s small body pressed against hers, and Agatha’s presence beside her, their closeness making everything feel so… right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She shifted, trying to stretch, but the moment she moved, Nicky looked up at her with wide, excited eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio!” he whispered, a grin spreading across his face. “You’re awake!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked a few more times, taking in her surroundings as her mind caught up with the morning. Nicky was nestled between her and Agatha, and it took a few seconds for her to fully register that she had slept through the night with both of them—something so simple, yet so beautiful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, little sunshine,” Rio murmured, her voice soft and warm as she reached out to ruffle Nicky’s hair. She was still half-dazed from sleep, but she couldn’t help the smile tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled and wriggled a little closer, clearly thrilled to have both of them awake. “Rio, did you know you were purring?” he asked, trying to hold back laughter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow, a playful glint in her eyes as she shot Agatha a teasing look. “I don’t purr,” she said dramatically, though she knew better.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, looking at both of them with a tenderness that made Rio’s heart swell. “Oh, she definitely does,” Agatha teased gently, giving Rio a knowing smile. “You sounded like a little cat.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a mock gasp, dramatically clutching her chest. “A cat? Really?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yep.” Agatha nodded, her lips curling into a fond smile as she leaned in to give Rio a soft kiss on the nose. “But don’t worry, it is really cute and I still love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile softened, the playfulness fading into something deeper, more sincere. She kissed Agatha back on the cheek, feeling the warmth of her affection fill the space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, clearly pleased with the exchange, before he leaned up and gave Rio a big hug, draping himself over her chest. “And I love you too, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio wrapped her arms around him, her heart swelling as she held him close. “I love you too, Nicky,” she murmured, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze lingered on the two of them, a soft, content smile playing on her lips as she watched Rio and Nicky together. It felt like everything was falling into place, the weight of the last few months melting away as she simply basked in this quiet, tender moment with the two people she loved most in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that morning, Rio helped Nicky get dressed for his dance class, carefully pulling on his little sneakers and making sure his dance clothes were all set. He was bouncing around with excitement, his enthusiasm contagious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you ready for class?” Rio asked, smiling down at him as she finished adjusting his sleeves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes! I can’t wait to see my friends!” Nicky replied, practically vibrating with energy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, tying his shoes. “Alright, you go ahead and grab your bag while I get my stuff.” Nicky immediately ran off to grab his dance bag from the corner of the room, but Rio’s gaze lingered on him for a moment. Seeing Nicky so happy, excited for his class, and knowing that he was thriving here made everything feel right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After gathering her own things, she turned to Nicky, who was already bouncing at the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ready to go?” she asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes!” he squealed, and they both headed out the door, laughing as Nicky tried to race her to the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was already seated in the living room, her stack of papers in front of her as she graded, though her mind wandered as she watched Rio and Nicky get ready. She smiled to herself as she listened to Nicky’s excited chatter and Rio’s laughter trailing behind them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before they left for the dance center, Rio paused by the door, a warm smile spreading across her face as she looked at Agatha. Nicky had already raced off, his excitement palpable, but Rio lingered for a moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey,” she said, her voice soft but full of sincerity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced up from the papers she was grading, her expression warm. “What’s up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile widened, and she stepped closer to Agatha. “I just… I just wanted to say thank you for trusting me with Nicky, for letting me take him to class today without hesitation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked in surprise but then gave a small, knowing smile. “Of course,” she said, her voice steady and full of conviction. “Why wouldn’t I trust you? You’ve always been so good with him and he loves you. You’re family to him already.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart fluttered at her words. It meant so much to her that Agatha had this unwavering trust in her. It wasn’t just about taking care of Nicky for the day; it was about being part of something bigger, something that felt real and permanent. She knew Agatha’s love for Nicky ran deeper than anything else, and the fact that she could see Rio as a part of that made her feel even more connected to both of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That means a lot to me,” Rio said, her voice thick with emotion. She quickly wiped away a small tear that threatened to fall, not wanting to get too sentimental before she had to leave.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, her lips curling into a reassuring smile. “I know you’ll take care of him. You always do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, feeling the weight of Agatha’s trust settle into her chest. “I won’t let you down, I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached over, giving Rio a gentle squeeze on her shoulder. “I know you won’t.” She let out a small laugh. “Now, go on. Get Nicky ad yourself to class, and have a good time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled brightly, nodding. “I will. I’ll see you later.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Have a good class, my loves!” Agatha called out as Rio opened the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks Mama, I’ll see you later!” Nicky smiled, waving before following Rio out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they arrived at the dance center, Rio walked with Nicky to his class. She could feel the familiar buzz of energy in the air—the hum of feet hitting the floor, the chatter of parents and children, the rush of anticipation as the kids prepared for their lessons. It was a place Rio had always loved, and it felt like home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they entered the studio, she gave Nicky a gentle nudge. “You go on ahead and find your friends, okay? I need to go to the office real quick, but I’ll be there a three minutes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes lit up. “I’ll be the best dancer today, promise, you’ll see!” he called back to her before running off to join his class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled as she watched him, her heart swelling with pride. It was clear he was thriving in this world of dance. It had always been a passion for her, and now she got to share it with him in a way that was meaningful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After ensuring Nicky was settled, Rio made her way to the main office to retrieve her roll call papers and the CD she used for her class. With everything in hand, she headed to the studio, where Nicky was already animatedly chatting with his little friends. When he spotted her, he waved excitedly, and Rio returned the gesture with a bright smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As students began trickling in, Rio moved to the front of the room, radiating energy and ready to teach. The day promised to be a busy one, but this was where Rio thrived—sharing her love of dance with others, the studio alive with movement and music. Having Nicky close by made it all the more meaningful; the way his wide eyes followed her every move filled her heart with joy. Teaching him alongside her other students was a privilege that made her work feel even more special.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, at home, Agatha was surrounded by papers, grading the assignments of her students. She sat back for a moment, rubbing her eyes. It was always a lot of work, but she never minded it—especially not when it gave her time to reflect. She smiled to herself, thinking of Rio and Nicky, and the little family they had started to become. It wasn’t always easy, but it was worth it, and that thought kept her going as she dove back into the work ahead of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Though they were apart for a few hours, each of them, in their own way, cherished the life they had built, and it was moments like these—small, everyday ones—that made it all feel perfect.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dance class, Rio and Nicky made their way to the band’s practice space, a cozy room filled with instruments and the hum of excited energy. Rio couldn’t help but smile as Nicky bounced ahead of her, clearly eager to see what the band was up to. She caught up with him quickly and scooped him up onto her lap as they sat down on the big, plush couch near the drum set.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, kiddo,” Rio said with a grin, adjusting him comfortably in her lap, “This is where the magic happens. You’re going to see how we make music.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes lit up, his face a picture of wonder as he looked around at the instruments. Alice was strumming her guitar, her head bopping to the rhythm as she warmed up, her keyboard already ready next to her, while Jen was adjusting her bass, preparing for their practice. Both of them spotted Nicky and immediately broke into wide grins.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey there, Nicky!” Alice called, giving a playful wave. “You ready to see how it all works?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded enthusiastically, bouncing on Rio’s lap. “Yeah! I wanna play the drums like Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen chuckled from her spot by the bass. “You’re gonna need some serious skills for that, buddy. But you’ve got time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed along with them, her arms around Nicky protectively as she settled into the rhythm of the room. It felt good to be here, to be able to share this part of her life with Nicky, to let him see her world—her music, her friends, her joy. Alice and Jen made it easy, their affection for Nicky clear as they smiled and teased him, calling him their “little band mascot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe one day we can teach you some chords on the guitar,” Alice suggested with a wink.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll teach you how to play the bass,” Jen added, making a few exaggerated plucking motions on her instrument for Nicky to imitate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room was filled with the laughter and lighthearted banter, and Rio was completely in her element. She felt a deep sense of contentment—this was her life now. And Nicky was becoming part of it in such a natural way. She couldn’t have been prouder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t long before Agatha arrived to pick up Nicky, her footsteps soft but steady as she approached the door. She paused for a moment in the doorway, watching the scene unfold. Nicky, perched on Rio’s lap behind the drum set, a pair of drumsticks in his little hands, was laughing at one of Alice’s jokes while Rio playfully mimicked drumming movements, and Jen was encouraging him to keep the rhythm. The sight filled Agatha’s heart in a way she hadn’t quite expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her son, so happy, so at ease. And Rio… she was so effortlessly in her element with him. Agatha couldn’t help but feel a small flutter in her chest. Rio was becoming such an important part of their lives, and seeing how naturally she fit into Nicky’s world was enough to make her feel both proud and deeply in love with her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Agatha cleared her throat, making herself known.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, I guess I’ve come to steal my favorite little guy,” Agatha said with a soft smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked up at her, his face lighting up. “Mama! Can I stay and watch them practice?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, though there was a small hint of hesitation in her eyes. “We’ve got to get home and make dinner. You can come back next time, I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky sighed dramatically, but then grinned. “Okay, okay! But I’m coming back next time for sure!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled and ruffled his hair. “You got it, buddy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky reluctantly slid off her lap and bounded toward Agatha, Rio caught her gaze, her heart swelling with love and affection. Agatha, standing in the doorway, was watching them with such a fond expression, her lips curving up in a way that spoke volumes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll see you tonight?” Rio asked softly, though her tone was filled with that quiet certainty they both shared now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Agatha replied, her voice warm and filled with promise. “When do you think you’ll be home?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The word <em>home</em> still sent butterflies fluttering in Rio’s stomach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky said his goodbyes, Agatha looked back at Rio one last time before leading him out of the room, and Rio felt a deep sense of contentment settle in her chest. She watched them leave, the sound of Nicky’s voice fading as they walked down the hall, and in that moment, Rio realized just how much she had come to love this little, growing family of theirs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>              (T.S. Eliot. “The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The classroom buzzed with the low hum of students filing in, shuffling papers, and exchanging murmured conversations as they prepared for the upcoming lecture. Rio sat in her usual spot in the second row, her books neatly stacked, her pen tapping rhythmically against her notebook. She glanced down at her notes, reviewing a passage she’d underlined the night before, her brow furrowing in concentration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Despite the focus on her studies, she couldn’t ignore the familiar anticipation bubbling in her chest. Agatha’s lectures always left her inspired, the brilliance and passion in her teaching reminding Rio why she’d fallen in love—not just with the subject but with the woman who brought it to life.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door at the back of the room creaked open, and the familiar click of heels echoed softly against the tile floor. Rio didn’t need to look up to know it was Agatha; her imperious presence was unmistakable. Still, she glanced up briefly, catching sight of Agatha as she strode confidently toward the podium at the front of the class, a stack of papers tucked under one arm and her dark hair spilling elegantly over her shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze swept over the room, landing for the briefest moment on Rio. It was so quick and subtle that no one else would have noticed, but Rio did. A flicker of warmth danced in Agatha’s expression, gone just as quickly as it appeared, replaced by her usual composed demeanor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved into a small, private smile as she looked back down at her notes. It felt strange, almost surreal, to be sitting here like this, a student in Agatha’s class, after everything they’d shared. The quiet mornings in their shared home, the way Agatha’s arms felt around her, the late-night conversations in bed that bled into laughter and kisses—it all felt like a secret world they carried with them into this space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha began setting up for the lecture, Rio couldn’t help but marvel at the ease with which they navigated these two versions of themselves. Here, in this room, Agatha was Dr. Harkness, the brilliant professor who commanded the respect of her students and colleagues alike. But Rio also knew the woman behind that title—the one who teased her in the kitchen, who pressed soft kisses to her forehead before bed, who wrapped her son in her arms every time they hadn’t seen each other for more than a few hours, and who could make her feel like she was the only person in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The class settled down as Agatha cleared her throat, her voice cutting through the chatter with practiced authority. “Good morning, everyone. I hope you’ve all had a chance to review the readings for today. We’ll be diving deeper into the themes we’ve been exploring last week. More specifically, we’ll be exploring how Modernist poetry uses allusions, weaving references to classical literature, mythology, and philosophy into new, complex narratives.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio straightened in her seat, pen poised over her notebook, ready to absorb every word. But even as she focused on the lecture, there was a quiet thrill in the knowledge that when the class was over, she’d go home—not just to her own space but to the life they were building together. In this moment, sitting among her peers, she felt the weight of her love for Agatha settle in her chest, steady and sure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the lecture unfolded, Rio’s attention flicked between her notes and Agatha, who was pacing the front of the room with her usual poise. Agatha gestured subtly as she spoke, her words weaving a compelling narrative around the day’s topic. She held a mug in one hand, taking small sips during moments of pause—a common sight during her lectures.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But this time, something caught Rio’s eye. The mug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The realization settled slowly, the green ceramic adorned with delicate golden stars glinting under the classroom lights. Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest. It was unmistakable—the same mug she’d bought for herself months ago, a little treat to celebrate finishing the first chapter of her thesis. She hadn’t thought much of it at the time, just a pretty, whimsical thing she’d picked up during a walk. At home, she’d noticed Agatha reaching for it more and more often, to the point where it had practically become her favorite.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But now, seeing Agatha carrying it here, in the classroom, amidst her strong and authoritative presence, stirred something deep within Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was such a small thing, so subtle that no one else would think twice about it. Yet, to Rio, it was a quiet declaration, a tiny fragment of their shared life that Agatha carried into this separate world. It made her feel… known. Seen. Loved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her chest swelled with warmth, the kind of glow that started deep in her heart and spread outward, curling into her fingertips and toes. There was something profoundly tender about this small gesture, about Agatha keeping this little piece of their home close to her even while she stood here, embodying the image of professionalism and power.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips twitched into a soft, barely-there smile as she watched Agatha set the mug down on the edge of the desk, her voice steady and rich as she fielded a question from a student in the back row.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She leaned her chin into her hand, letting her gaze linger for a moment longer. The duality of Agatha never failed to captivate her—the composed professor with sharp wit and imposing presence, and the woman who curled around Rio at night, who teased her with soft kisses and held her so tenderly when the world felt heavy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And now, the woman who carried a little green mug with golden stars, like a secret tether to the life they were building together, a link between the two worlds they still tried to keep separated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart felt impossibly full. She ducked her head, pretending to refocus on her notes, but her pen didn’t move. She was too busy holding onto the quiet, fuzzy warmth that had bloomed inside her, savoring the sweetness of this moment that was theirs alone to understand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the lecture continued, Rio dutifully kept her eyes on Agatha, though her notes lay forgotten in front of her. Agatha moved seamlessly through her points, the cadence of her voice steady and confident, with only the occasional pause for a sip from her mug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t until halfway through the lecture, as a small wave of laughter rippled through the class at one of Agatha’s sharp-witted comments, that Agatha’s gaze flicked up—and it was fixed directly on her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her heart stuttered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Rio thought she was imagining it. Agatha was always composed, always able to divide her personal and professional lives like a master conductor. But the slight curve at the corner of her lips and the way her sharp eyes softened left no doubt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still watching Rio, Agatha raised her mug slightly, holding it in her hand with an almost imperceptible tilt of her head. Then, with a casual air that no one else would interpret as anything significant, she made a tiny, deliberate toasting gesture in Rio’s direction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed instantly, the warmth spreading from her face to her chest. It was playful, teasing—Agatha’s way of letting her know that, even here, surrounded by students and textbooks, she saw her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip to suppress a grin, her heart doing a little flip as she ducked her head. She could feel Agatha’s eyes lingering for a moment longer before the professor turned her attention back to the rest of the class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The mug. The toast. The secret glance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was nothing that anyone else would notice, but to Rio, it was everything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She clutched her pen tighter, fighting the urge to glance around the room to see if anyone else had caught the exchange. Of course, they hadn’t. Agatha was far too skilled at keeping things under wraps, her movements subtle enough to be dismissed as coincidence. But to Rio, the moment was as clear as a kiss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her mind buzzed with affection and something deeper, something that felt almost sacred. Agatha didn’t need to say a word for Rio to know she was cherished, and here, in the middle of this classroom, Agatha had found a way to remind her of that.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the lecture went on, Rio couldn’t stop the tiny smile that played on her lips, her notes remaining untouched as she basked in the quiet thrill of their unspoken connection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the lecture wrapped up, Agatha closed her book with her signature decisiveness, signaling the end of the session. The students began shuffling their papers and gathering their belongings, murmurs of discussion about the lecture filling the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, still seated in her spot in the second row, took her time putting away her notes. She knew she had a moment before the room cleared out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, standing by her desk, glanced toward Rio as the last stragglers filed out. Her calm, professional demeanor remained in place, but there was a flicker of something else in her gaze—something meant only for Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood and slung her bag over her shoulder, approaching the front with an easy stride. She stopped just short of Agatha’s desk, keeping enough distance to maintain appearances. With a small, playful smirk, she tilted her head toward the green mug with the golden stars, now sitting on the edge of the desk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nice mug,” Rio said, her tone casual, as though she were commenting on the weather.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brow arched just slightly, her lips curving into a knowing smile. She picked up the mug with deliberate care, cradling it in her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s a favorite of mine,” Agatha replied, her voice smooth and unbothered, though her eyes twinkled with amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help the warmth bubbling in her chest. To anyone else, it was a passing exchange about a simple piece of ceramic. But between them, it was a conversation layered with meaning—an acknowledgment of shared moments and quiet intimacies that no one else in the world could understand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good choice,” Rio added softly, before turning on her heel and making her way to the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched her go, her smile lingering even as she composed herself for the next class. The green mug stayed firmly in her grasp, a discreet token of their love that felt even more precious now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening rolled in, Rio was nestled in a cozy corner of the campus library, the soft glow of her phone screen illuminating her face. She tapped out a quick message to Agatha, her thoughts drifting to their shared home and the little details that made it feel complete.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Hey, heading into town after I’m done here. Going to pick up a few things for the house. Need anything?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The message sent, Rio smiled softly to herself. The idea of “their house” still sent a pleasant thrill through her. It wasn’t just a place—it was a symbol of everything they had built together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s reply came almost immediately.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Not that I can think of, love. But thank you for checking. Don’t forget to grab something for yourself, too.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head. Agatha always knew how to slip in that extra bit of care, even in the smallest interactions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>I’ll keep that in mind. See you soon, my starry professor.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She added a cheeky emoji—a star surrounded by sparkles—before slipping her phone back into her bag and heading out, her heart light with the thought of coming home to Agatha later.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio wandered through the aisles of the small grocery store, her basket slowly filling with essentials for the house, she was humming a quiet tune to herself. The day had been pleasant, and the thought of going home to Agatha and Nicky later made her heart feel light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Turning a corner, Rio stopped in her tracks. A group of familiar faces was ahead of her near the produce section. Her stomach dropped when she recognized them—her old foster family.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her chest tightened, a familiar, unwelcome wave of anxiety washing over her. She thought she had left them far behind, buried in the recesses of her memory. But there they were, inescapable and as vivid as ever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air seemed to shift. They hadn’t noticed her yet, giving Rio a moment to decide whether to quietly retreat or walk past as if she hadn’t seen them. But before she could move, the matriarch of the family, a sharp-eyed woman named Carol, looked up and spotted her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, look who it is,” Carol said, her voice tinged with a forced cheeriness that made Rio’s skin crawl. “Little miss Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s shoulders stiffened and she forced herself to stand still, every instinct in her body telling her to run. Her grip on her basket tightened, but she forced herself to stand tall, her head held high.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Carol tilted her head, her smile not reaching her eyes. “My, you’ve grown up, haven’t you? What are you doing in town? Slumming it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I live here,” Rio replied curtly, refusing to elaborate. She wasn’t about to give them any more power over her than they’d already taken in the past.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Carol raised an eyebrow. “Really? And what are you doing these days? Still running around with your silly little notebooks and pretending to be smarter than everyone else? Still chasing those silly dreams of yours?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gritted her teeth, keeping her composure. “I’m working on my PhD,” she said simply, hoping to end the conversation quickly, her voice devoid of the pride she usually felt when she said those words. Here, it felt like it would only be twisted into something small.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Carol sauntered closer, followed by her husband and one of their now-grown children. The man’s presence made Rio’s skin crawl, memories of his harsh words and the occasional slap across the face flashing unbidden in her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, a PhD,” Carol said, laughing. “Wow, didn’t see that coming. You always did have that ‘head in the clouds’ thing going on. Well… aren’t you just a little genius now. Too bad all those smarts didn’t make you easier to live with.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s jaw tightened. She could feel her pulse in her ears, the familiar pang of the humiliation they used to make her feel. She knew better than to engage. Their dismissiveness had always been a part of why her time in their house had been so difficult. They never believed in her, never supported her ambitions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You were always so much trouble,” Carol continued, her voice louder now. “Ungrateful, sneaky… you made it so hard for everyone else… but, good for you,” she said, her tone making it clear she didn’t mean it. “We always did say you were… different.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You were horrible to me,” Rio said, her voice sharp and clear, cutting through Carol’s tirade.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Carol froze, her face stiffening. The husband shifted uncomfortably but said nothing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You pushed me around, yelled at me, made me feel like I was nothing,” Rio continued, her voice shaking now but steady. “You didn’t make it hard for me. You made it impossible.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Carol’s smile faltered, but she quickly recovered. “Oh, don’t be dramatic. You were just a difficult child. You needed discipline.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hands curled into fists. She wasn’t a child anymore, wasn’t powerless like she had been back then. “I needed love,” she said firmly. “And you couldn’t give that to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know, Rio, it’s a shame you didn’t stick with us longer. Maybe you’d have turned out a bit more grounded.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned back slowly, her eyes sharp. “I think I turned out just fine, actually. Have a good evening.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without waiting for a response, she walked away, her heart pounding in her chest. She hated how they could still unnerve her, still make her feel small, even after all these years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stopped a few aisles away, setting her basket on the floor and bracing herself against the nearest shelf, taking a deep breath to steady her nerves. Hearing footsteps drawing closer, she quickened her stride, moving swiftly through the aisles toward the exit, nearly breaking into a run. As she reached the door, she pulled out her phone and sent a quick text to Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Might be a bit later than I thought. Just ran into some… memories. I’ll tell you about it when I’m home.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s reply came swiftly, her steady presence already grounding Rio from afar.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Take your time, love. Whatever it is, we’ll handle it.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, the tension in her chest easing slightly. As she left the grocery store, her mind was racing, her pulse still thundering in her ears. The confrontation had reopened wounds she thought had long since healed. She barely registered the sound of the automatic doors swishing shut behind her or the cold air biting at her cheeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached her car, fumbling with her keys, her hands shaking. Her chest felt tight, as though the memories were physically pressing down on her. She slid into the driver’s seat, gripping the steering wheel as she took deep, deliberate breaths.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Inhaling. Exhaling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t working. The weight of Carol’s words—dismissive, cruel, belittling—still clung to her like a heavy fog.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s phone buzzed in her pocket, snapping her out of her spiraling thoughts. She pulled it out to see another message from Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Are you okay, my love? On your way home?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The text made her realize something was off. She glanced at the empty passenger seat, her stomach dropping. Her groceries.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She’d left them in the store.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, she considered going back, but the idea of potentially seeing them again—Carol, her foster father, that house of horrors personified—made her chest tighten further. No. She couldn’t. Not now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She quickly typed back to Agatha:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>I’ll explain everything when I’m home. Might be without groceries, though.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s response was immediate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Don’t worry about groceries. Just come home to me, love.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio clutched her phone tightly, the familiar warmth of Agatha’s words cutting through the cold knot in her stomach. She started the car, her mind still swirling, but now with a beacon of safety guiding her back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time she reached home, she didn’t even notice the absence of bags next to her anymore. All she cared about was the front door opening and Agatha standing there, waiting for her with open arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as Rio stepped through the door, the weight of the day hit her like a tidal wave. Agatha was already there, her sharp eyes scanning Rio’s face, instantly recognizing that something was deeply wrong.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My love,” Agatha said softly, stepping forward and cupping Rio’s face in her hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the gentle touch, Rio crumpled, the tears she had been holding back breaking free. A deep, heart-wrenching sob tore through her, and she collapsed into Agatha’s arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha caught her effortlessly, pulling her close and holding her tightly. She guided them to the couch, sitting down with Rio practically in her lap, her hands stroking through Rio’s hair as she murmured soothing words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s okay, you’re safe now,” Agatha whispered, over and over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s fingers clutched at Agatha’s shirt like a lifeline as she wept, the kind of crying that came from somewhere deep and raw, dredging up years of pain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached, but she kept her voice steady. “Nicky’s with Wanda and the boys tonight. It’s just us. Take your time, my love. Let it out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her face buried against Agatha’s shoulder, and she cried harder, her body shaking. “I—I ran into them,” she finally managed between sobs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tensed, but her voice remained calm and steady. “Who, darling?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“One of my old foster families.” Rio replied, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hung her head, her tears soaking into Agatha’s shirt and continued. “Carol…the mother… she looked at me like I was still nothing. Like I was still… that scared, useless kid. She… she said things…” Her voice broke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed a kiss to the top of Rio’s head, holding her even closer. “You’re not that kid anymore,” she said firmly, her voice filled with conviction. “You are so strong, so brilliant, and so loved. She has no power over you, Rio. None.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But it still hurts,” Rio whispered, her voice so small it broke Agatha’s heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Agatha said softly, her own throat tightening. “Of course, it does. They don’t deserve another moment of your pain. But you’re here now, with me, and I’ll be damned if I let their shadow linger in our home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded faintly, her breathing starting to even out as Agatha continued to soothe her with soft touches and loving words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re safe,” Agatha whispered again, tilting Rio’s chin up to meet her gaze. Her eyes were gentle but unwavering. “I’ve got you, my love. Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio managed a weak smile through her tears, and Agatha kissed her forehead. “Let’s just stay here for a bit, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t answer, but she didn’t need to. She simply melted into Agatha’s embrace, finding solace in the steady heartbeat beneath her ear, the warmth of her partner’s arms, and the love that wrapped around her like a shield.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gently brushed the tears from Rio’s cheeks, her own expression filled with quiet determination. “What can I do for you, my love? Tell me, anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, her lips trembling as more tears welled in her eyes. She looked down, shame flickering across her features. “I… I don’t know if I can call her myself,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Who, love?” Agatha asked softly, though she already had an idea.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, then finally said, “Lilia. Can you… can you call her for me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached at the vulnerability in Rio’s voice, but she nodded immediately. “Of course, I can.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She shifted Rio gently onto the couch, tucking a blanket around her lap before grabbing her phone. Agatha kept one hand on Rio’s knee, grounding her, as she dialed Lilia’s number.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It rang only twice before Lilia’s warm, familiar voice answered. “Hello, Agatha! What a lovely surprise. Is everything alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia, hi,” Agatha began, her voice calm but serious. “I’m calling because Rio needs you. She had a rough encounter with someone — one of her old foster families?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line, “Which one?” Lilia asked, and the fact she needed to ask that question broke something inside of Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mmh, I’m not sure, Rio mentioned something about a Carol?” Agatha replied, unsure of what to say. The curse she heard Lilia mutter on the other end of the line did nothing to reassure her. Agatha continued, glancing at Rio as she spoke. “She’s very shaken. I’m with her now, but I think hearing your voice might help.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, my poor girl,” Lilia said, her voice breaking slightly. “I’ll come over right away.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled faintly, her gratitude clear. “Thank you, Lilia. It means the world to her—and to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Lilia said firmly. “I’ll be there in twenty minutes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha ended the call and turned back to Rio, her touch gentle as she ran a hand through her hair. “She’s on her way, my love. She’ll be here soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a shaky breath, nodding. “Thank you,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Always,” Agatha said softly, leaning in to kiss her forehead. She settled back beside Rio, pulling her close again as they waited for Lilia, tears still silently falling from Rio’s eyes into her hair and Agatha’s chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia arrived quietly, as always, her presence comforting and steady. She stepped into the living room, finding Rio curled up on the couch almost on top of Agatha, her face still damp with tears. The sight of Rio’s vulnerability made Lilia’s heart ache, and she knelt beside her, taking Rio’s hand in hers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My darling girl,” Lilia murmured softly, brushing Rio’s hair back from her face. “I’m here now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s tired eyes met hers, and she managed a weak smile, but it was clear she was still shaken. “I didn’t want to bother you,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia shook her head, her smile warm but firm. “You never bother me, sweet girl. Never.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a gentle, practiced touch, Lilia helped Rio out of Agatha’s lap and to her feet and guided her to the bedroom, where Rio climbed into bed, still feeling exhausted from the emotional toll of the encounter. Lilia stayed with her for a while, making sure she had everything she needed—water, tissues, the comfort of her presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After Rio was settled in bed, Lilia stayed for a moment longer, sitting beside her, her hand gently rubbing Rio’s arm as she softly spoke to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t need to say anything more right now, sweetheart,” Lilia murmured, her voice soothing. “Just take it easy. Let sleep heal you for now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her eyes heavy with exhaustion but still glistening with the remnants of her tears. “I hate that it still affects me,” she whispered, barely audible. “I thought I was over it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s expression softened as she stroked Rio’s hair. “It doesn’t work like that. Sometimes the past has a way of creeping up on us when we least expect it. But you’re not alone anymore, Rio. You have Agatha, and you have me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a quiet, shaky breath, trying to settle her racing mind. “I know,” she whispered, and for the first time in what felt like hours, a small, fragile smile tugged at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know you know, sweetheart,” Lilia replied, her voice warm and reassuring. “I’ll be here when you need me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her eyes fluttering closed. “Thank you, Lilia… for everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia stayed for a few more moments, watching over Rio as she fell into a fitful sleep. She kissed the top of Rio’s head before standing and quietly leaving the room, letting her get some much-needed rest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she made her way back downstairs, Agatha was waiting in the living room, looking tense, her eyes full of concern. Lilia could see the deep worry etched into Agatha’s features, and she smiled reassuringly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s resting now,” Lilia said softly, sinking into the chair beside Agatha. “She just needed to hear my voice, and a little bit of quiet care. The past caught up with her today.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brows furrowed, her tone low but filled with a quiet intensity. “I hate seeing her like this. What happened?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia sighed, folding her hands in her lap. “This old foster family… they were abusive, Agatha. Not just neglectful, but cruel.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression hardened, her jaw tightening at the thought. “I had no idea…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio keeps so much of it inside,” Lilia said, her voice gentle but laced with a knowing sadness. “She’s learned to shield herself from it. But sometimes, those walls crack, and the pain comes flooding back.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was quiet for a moment, taking in Lilia’s words. She could feel the weight of them settling in her chest, the knowledge that Rio had been through so much before they’d even met. The protective instinct she had for Rio flared, but there was something else too—a deep, aching love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re the first person she’s trusted enough to let in like this,” Lilia continued, her gaze soft but knowing. “You should be proud of that, Agatha. She’s finally found a place where she can heal, even if it’s just little by little.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha swallowed, her throat tight. “I just want to help her,” she whispered, her voice raw with emotion. “I want to be the one who makes it all better for her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You already are, Agatha,” Lilia said, her voice firm with conviction. “Just by being here, by loving her. That’s the most important thing. She’s been through too much alone. Now she has you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded slowly, her gaze distant for a moment. “I don’t know how to make it stop hurting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You won’t be able to take the hurt away completely,” Lilia replied gently. “But you can be the one who helps her hold on to the good things. The love. The safety. That’s what she needs from you right now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her eyes fixed on the floor. “I hate seeing her like this, Lilia. I just want to take all the pain away for her. I feel so… powerless.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s gaze softened, and she placed a comforting hand on Agatha’s arm. “You’re doing so much more than you realize, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha met Lilia’s eyes, her expression earnest. “I just want to help her, to be there for her in all the ways she needs.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You are,” Lilia said with quiet certainty. “She’s been through a lot on her own, but now, she has you. She’s not alone anymore, and that makes all the difference.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest tightened, emotions she hadn’t realized were sitting heavy in her heart coming to the surface. “But I still feel like I could be doing more. I don’t want her to feel alone again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia offered Agatha a gentle smile, her eyes full of understanding. “You’re doing more than you realize. A few years ago, something like this would have been impossible for Rio to even discuss. She would have bottled it all up, withdrawn into herself. She never would have let herself rely on anyone like this, let alone lean on someone the way she does with you. And she certainly wouldn’t have come straight home like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, surprised by Lilia’s words. “I never realized she used to be like that,” she said quietly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She was,” Lilia confirmed, her tone gentle but steady. “All of this, it made her close herself off. It took me so long to get her to open up. She never let anyone get too close, not after everything. But now?” Lilia’s gaze met Agatha’s, full of earnest gratitude. “She trusts you, Agatha. She trusts you with the parts of herself she’s hidden from the world for so long. That’s no small thing. You’ve given her the safety to be vulnerable, and for Rio, that’s a rare and precious gift.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a deep breath, wiping away a stray tear that had formed at the corner of her eye. “Thank you, Lilia,” she said softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled warmly, standing up to leave. “Just keep being there for her, Agatha. That’s all you need to do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled with warmth at the thought, though a tinge of worry remained. “I just want to be the person she deserves.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You are,” Lilia assured her, squeezing Agatha’s shoulder. “You’re already there. Don’t doubt that for a second.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Lilia made her way to the door, Agatha remained seated, her mind reeling with the weight of everything she had just learned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the door clicked shut behind Lilia, Agatha turned toward the bedroom, her heart full of quiet resolve. She was never letting that woman go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once upstairs, Agatha joined Rio in their shared bed. She moved carefully, not wanting to disturb Rio’s rest, but Rio shifted slightly as she sensed Agatha’s presence and pulled her close, wrapping her arms around her. Agatha, always gentle but firm, enveloped her in warmth, holding her close as they lay together in the darkness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, there was only the soft sound of their breathing, the quiet comfort of being together after such an emotionally draining day. Rio’s voice, barely above a whisper, broke the silence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry,” Rio said, her voice thick with emotion. “For needing Lilia so much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt the tension in Rio’s voice and immediately tightened her hold on her, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. She spoke softly, her tone reassuring and filled with understanding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You never need to apologize for that,” Agatha replied, her hand gently stroking Rio’s back. “Lilia is family. She’s been there for you, and I’m glad she’s someone you can rely on. You don’t have to carry everything on your own, Rio. Not anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s body relaxed slightly at Agatha’s words, but there was still an undercurrent of guilt that lingered in her voice. “I just… I hate feeling so weak. It’s like I’m a burden.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha cupped Rio’s cheek, tilting her head so she could look into her eyes. “You’re not a burden. You’re not weak. You’re human. You’ve been through so much, and you’ve come so far. It’s okay to need help. It’s okay to let others in when you’re struggling. And it’s okay to lean on Lilia when you need her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes shimmered with unshed tears, and she swallowed hard, trying to hold them back. “I just don’t want to disappoint you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached at that, and she gently lifted Rio’s chin, forcing her to meet her gaze. “Rio, listen to me,” she said softly but firmly. “You will never disappoint me. I love you, every part of you, and nothing will ever change that. You don’t have to be perfect. You don’t have to be strong all the time. I’m here for you, no matter what.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, and she closed her eyes for a moment, allowing herself to lean into Agatha’s embrace. “Thank you,” she whispered, her voice fragile but full of trust. “I love you, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha kissed the top of Rio’s head, her fingers weaving through her hair in slow, comforting strokes. “Get some rest, my love,” she whispered, her voice soothing and warm. “Tomorrow, I promise you hot chocolate in cups of stars.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And with that, Rio let out a little laugh and relaxed fully into Agatha’s arms, letting go of the last of her tension, and for the first time in hours, allowed herself to rest, comforted by the love and security Agatha provided. The night passed quietly, the two of them holding each other, finding peace in the solace of their shared warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <em>There is a time for the evening under starlight,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A time for the evening under lamplight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(The evening with the photograph album).</em>
</p><p> </p><p>              (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">A week later, the night was crisp and clear, the kind of evening where the stars seemed to stretch endlessly across the sky. Agatha and Rio had agreed it was the perfect moment to escape the weight of their busy lives and share a quiet moment beneath the vastness of the universe. The day had been long and taxing for both of them—Agatha buried under an overwhelming stack of papers to grade and giving lecture after lecture, and Rio locked in the library, struggling to write a new chapter for her thesis.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A break was definitely in order, and they both knew that stargazing was just what they needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha had called the babysitter and put Nicky to bed, and the two had packed a few essentials—blankets, a thermos of hot tea, and a small telescope Agatha had brought home years ago and that she sometimes used with Nicky during summer nights.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they stepped outside into the cool night air, Rio shivered slightly, pulling her green cardigan tighter around her. Agatha immediately draped an arm over her shoulders, her warmth and steady presence making Rio feel warm and grounded.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know a perfect spot,” Agatha said, her voice low and soft, as though speaking too loudly might disturb the peace of the night. She led Rio through the backyard and up a gentle hill that overlooked the woods, behind her house.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached the clearing, Rio gasped softly. It was breathtaking—the stars were brilliant, glowing like diamonds scattered on black velvet. The Milky Way stretched above them in a dazzling arc, and the faint rustling of leaves in the breeze created a soothing soundtrack.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is perfect,” Rio whispered, her voice filled with wonder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha spread out a thick blanket on the grass and gestured for Rio to sit. They settled side by side, and Rio leaned against Agatha, her head resting on her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Look at that,” Rio murmured, pointing toward a particularly bright small cluster of stars. “The Pleiades. It’s always been one of my favorites.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hummed, turning her head slightly to kiss Rio’s temple. “You’ve told me about them before. Seven sisters, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Rio said with a soft smile. “It’s beautiful. And tragic, in a way. The myth says they were turned into stars to escape Orion’s pursuit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head to study the constellation, her brow furrowing slightly. “I suppose being a star is better than being hunted, though it’s still a bit sad. Always running from the Sun, even in the sky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, falling silent for a moment as she traced invisible lines between the stars with her finger. “It makes me wonder,” she said softly, “what stories would be told about us if we were up there?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, her voice warm and low, like the hum of a distant melody. “Oh, I’m sure the gods would find us endlessly entertaining. But they’d also be terribly jealous of us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, leaning into Agatha and nudging her playfully. “Jealous? Really? Even with all the great love stories in the cosmos?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ours is the most beautiful,” Agatha replied, her voice a blend of tenderness and playful confidence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her voice barely above a whisper as she answered, “It is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They lapsed into a comfortable silence, letting the beauty of the night envelop them. Agatha poured them both tea from the thermos, and they sipped it slowly, savoring the warmth. Rio’s gaze flickered between the stars and Agatha’s profile, bathed in moonlight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Rio began, her voice barely audible, “I think nights like these are my favorite.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Why’s that?” Agatha asked, turning to meet Rio’s eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Because it’s just us,” Rio said simply. “No work, no noise, no interruptions. Just you, me, and the stars. It makes everything else seem… small. The only thing missing is Nicky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached over to take Rio’s hand, threading their fingers together. “We’ll bring him with us next time. And you’re right, everything else <em>is</em> small,” she murmured. “At least, compared to this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned into Agatha’s touch, her heart swelling with gratitude. For the first time in days, she felt a sense of calm washing over her. The relentless buzz of her thoughts and memories dulled, replaced by the steady rhythm of Agatha’s presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha adjusted the telescope and gestured for Rio to take a look. “Here,” she said, her voice soft. “I’ve found Jupiter. Want to see?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned over, peering into the lens. Her eyes widened, and a delighted gasp escaped her lips. “Oh, wow. It’s beautiful. You can even see the moons!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, watching the joy light up Rio’s face. “Four of them,” she said. “Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo’s discoveries.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio straightened up and turned to Agatha, a playful glint in her eyes. “How do you know so much about astronomy, Dr. Harkness? Secret passion?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked. “Not a secret. Just another way to impress my brilliant girlfriend, and entertain my ever-curious son.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, a sound that echoed in the quiet night, bright and full of life. She leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s cheek. “You don’t need stars to impress me,” she said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk softened into a tender smile. “Maybe not. But I like seeing that look on your face when you’re amazed by something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The stars twinkled softly above, casting their serene glow over them as they sat side by side on the blanket. Rio’s head rested against Agatha’s shoulder, her fingers absently tracing flowers on the fabric of Agatha’s sleeve. They had been talking about constellations, myths, and the quiet beauty of the universe, but Rio’s thoughts had drifted elsewhere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hm?” Agatha hummed in response, her attention still on the telescope she was adjusting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, biting her lip before continuing. “I’ve been thinking… You know so much about me, about me before you, and I know a lot about your current life—what you’ve done, your accomplishments, your brilliance—but… I don’t know much about your background. Your past. What makes you you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha froze for a moment, her hands stilling on the telescope. She glanced at Rio, her expression unreadable. “My past?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her eyes searching Agatha’s face. “Yeah. Where you came from. Your family. Your life before all of this. Before Nicky. Before us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed softly, leaning back against the blanket and gazing up at the sky. Her features were calm, but Rio could see the faint tension in her jaw, the way her fingers fidgeted slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s not a pretty story, love,” Agatha said finally, her voice low and measured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not asking for pretty,” Rio replied gently. “I’m asking for you. Whatever you’re willing to share.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, silence stretched between them, the only sound the soft rustling of leaves in the breeze. Finally, Agatha spoke, her voice quiet but steady.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My mother, Evanora… she wasn’t a good mother,” Agatha began, her eyes fixed on the stars above. “She was cold. Strict. Nothing I did was ever good enough for her. She had this… idea of what I should be, and anything that didn’t fit into that mold was unacceptable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio listened intently, her hand finding Agatha’s and giving it a gentle squeeze. Agatha didn’t look at her, but she squeezed back, a small sign of acknowledgment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I never knew my father,” Agatha continued. “Evanora never talked about him. He wasn’t in the picture, and from what I could gather, she didn’t want him to be. I used to wonder what he was like, whether he was kind or if he would’ve… understood me better than she did. But it’s hard to miss someone you never knew.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart ached at the quiet pain in Agatha’s voice. She reached up to brush a strand of hair away from Agatha’s face, her touch soft and comforting. “I’m sorry, Agatha. That must’ve been so hard.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head slightly, a wry smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “It was what it was. I learned early on that I couldn’t rely on her—or anyone else, for that matter. So I became self-reliant. Strong. But it left its mark.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shifted closer, wrapping her arms around Agatha and resting her head against her chest. “You don’t have to be strong all the time, you know. Not with me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha finally looked down at her, her eyes softening. She ran a hand through Rio’s hair, her fingers gentle. “I know, love. You’re the one person I don’t have to be strong with.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They sat like that for a while, the stars above them bearing silent witness to the exchange.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve built such a beautiful life,” Rio said softly. “Despite everything. Despite her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, a faint smile gracing her lips. “I have. And Nicky and you are the best part of it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blushed at the sentiment, her heart swelling. “I’m glad you told me,” she said, her voice barely audible. “I want to know every part of you, Agatha. Even the messy, painful parts. Especially those.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned down, pressing a tender kiss to Rio’s forehead. “You already have all of me, Rio. Every part.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. “And I’ll take care of every part, just like you take care of me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, pulling Rio closer. “I think we take care of each other, love. And that’s all that matters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they lay under the starlit sky, the air between them felt lighter, the bond they shared even stronger. In that quiet, sacred moment, it was as if the universe itself held them in its embrace, their love shining as brightly as the stars above.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the quiet of the night enveloped them, Rio nestled closer to Agatha, still processing everything Agatha had shared. The stars above twinkled in their silent dance, offering a semblance of peace to the heaviness of their conversation. Rio’s hand rested over Agatha’s, a steadying gesture as she mulled over her next words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve done so much to rise above all that,” Rio murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. “And Nicky… he’s so lucky to have you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A shadow flickered across Agatha’s face, her features tightening slightly. She stared at the sky for a long moment before replying. “I’ve made sure of that, Rio. I swore to myself that Nicky would never know what it was like to feel unloved. To feel… unworthy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head to look at Agatha, concern flickering in her eyes. “You’ve done an amazing job with him, Agatha. He’s such a sweet, happy kid.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled slowly, her fingers entwining with Rio’s. “He is. But I’ve also been… cautious. Protective. Maybe too much sometimes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What do you mean?” Rio asked softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze remained fixed on the stars, her voice measured but tinged with emotion. “I’ve refused to let him anywhere near Evanora. I made that decision before he was even born. She didn’t get to see him. Didn’t get to be a part of his life. I would never have given her the chance to hurt him the way she hurt me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched at the fierceness in Agatha’s tone, but it wasn’t a harshness that frightened her. It was a resolute, protective love that ran deep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You really think she would have?” Rio asked hesitantly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her head to meet Rio’s gaze, her expression firm. “I know she would have. She was manipulative. Cruel. My mother didn’t know how to love—it was not in her nature. And Nicky… he’s too pure, too kind to be tainted by her bitterness. I would not have allowed it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached up to cup Agatha’s face, her thumb brushing gently against her cheek. “You protected him, Agatha. That’s what good mothers do. And you’re the best mother he could ever have.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s features softened at Rio’s words, a faint smile playing on her lips. “I hope so. I want him to grow up surrounded by love and kindness. The things I never had.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He will,” Rio said firmly. “Because of you. Because of us. He has a family who adores him. And he’ll never have to know anything else.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly around Rio’s as she continued, her voice taking on a quieter, more vulnerable tone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“When Evanora died three years ago… I was relieved,” she admitted, the words heavy with guilt and finality.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught, and she turned fully toward Agatha, her brow furrowed with a mix of concern and understanding. “Agatha…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know how it sounds,” Agatha said quickly, her voice laced with shame. “She was my mother. I should’ve felt… something else. Grief, maybe. Or sadness. But all I felt was this crushing sense of freedom. Like a weight I’d been carrying my entire life had finally been lifted.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart ached at the pain in Agatha’s voice. She could see how deeply the admission was affecting her, the conflict etched into her features.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Rio began gently, “you don’t have to feel guilty about that. Not after everything she put you through.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, and she shook her head slowly. “She was cruel, Rio. But she was still my mother. A part of me wonders if I should’ve tried harder to make things right, even if it was hopeless.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio scooted closer, wrapping her arms around Agatha in a protective embrace. “Agatha, listen to me. You didn’t owe her anything. Not after the way she treated you. Some people don’t change, no matter how much we wish they would. And it’s okay to feel relief. It doesn’t make you a bad person—it makes you human.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned into Rio’s warmth, her long brown hair cascading over Rio’s shoulder as she let out a shaky breath. “I spent so much of my life trying to survive her, trying to undo the damage she caused. When she was gone, it felt like I could finally breathe. But it also felt… wrong. Like I was betraying her memory.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled back slightly to look into Agatha’s eyes, her gaze steady and filled with love. “You’re not betraying anything, Agatha. You’re honoring yourself, your growth, and the life you’ve built. You’ve given so much of yourself to Nicky, to me, to everyone you love. That’s not betrayal—that’s strength.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened, her tension easing ever so slightly. “You always know exactly what to say, don’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio offered a small, teasing smile. “It’s one of my many talents.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned into Rio’s touch, her eyes glistening in the dim light. “Thank you, Rio. For saying that. For… understanding. For reminding me that it’s okay to let go of the past. That it’s okay to move forward.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled softly, her fingers gently tracing Agatha’s jawline. “It’s more than okay, Agatha. You’ve given Nicky—and me—everything. And I’ll always be here to give that back to you. It’s what you deserve.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, pressing a tender kiss to Rio’s forehead. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hopefully, you’ll never have to find out,” Rio whispered, her voice steady and full of promise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shifted slightly in Agatha’s embrace, her playful smile breaking through the heaviness of the conversation. “You know,” she began, her tone lightening, “I’m head over heels for you, Agatha Harkness. And nothing—nothing—will ever change that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, a soft smile spreading across her face. “Even with all my baggage?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio snorted gently, resting her forehead against Agatha’s. “Especially with all your baggage, God knows mine is heavy too. It just makes you… you. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, a glimmer of amusement in her eyes. “You’re something else, Rio Vidal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And,” Rio added, her grin widening, “if you ever feel like you’re missing out on a family figure, we can always share my Lilia. She’s already been roped into my chaos. She wouldn’t mind a little of yours, too. And she already loves you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, pretending to consider it. “Your Lilia, huh? That’s a good idea. But don’t think I won’t tease you mercilessly if she starts doting on me more than you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gasped in mock outrage, her hand over her chest. “How dare you suggest such a thing! Lilia is mine! But, fine, I guess I’ll share her. For you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s cheek. “I’ll take it. Besides, I have all I need right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed, and she buried her face in Agatha’s shoulder, mumbling, “You’re way too good at this romantic stuff.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, pressing a kiss to Rio’s temple. “You inspire me, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they sat under the vast night sky, Rio reached for Agatha’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “For the record, though, if Lilia ends up spoiling you, I demand equal treatment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, her voice warm and full of affection. “Noted, my love. Noted.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened as she looked at Rio, her features illuminated by the soft glow of the moonlight. She gently cupped Rio’s face, her thumb brushing over her cheek. “You know,” she began, her voice low and tender, “before you came into my life, everything felt… muted. Controlled. Like I was just going through the motions and the only color was Nicky. But you…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, her eyes wide and curious. “Me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You brought color back into my world,” Agatha continued, her words filled with emotion. “You made everything so much brighter, so much more alive. And you didn’t just do that for me. You did it for Nicky, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s expression softened, her lips parting slightly in surprise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her eyes glistening. “He adores you, you know. The way you light up his world—the way you laugh with him, teach him, love him. You’ve given him something I always feared I couldn’t. A sense of joy, of warmth… of family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes filled with tears once again as she reached up to take Agatha’s hand in hers. “Agatha, you didn’t need me to give him that. You’re an incredible mom. Nicky is the amazing little kid he is because of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head slightly, her smile bittersweet. “Maybe. But you’ve made us both better. He needed you, and so did I.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sniffled, laughing softly through her tears. “Well, you’ve got me now. You’re stuck with me, forever and ever, or for as long as you’ll have me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, leaning forward to rest her forehead against Rio’s. “Good. I hope you’re ready for forever, because I don’t ever want to let you go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer. “You’re not getting rid of me that easily. And for the record, you’ve changed my life, too. I didn’t think I’d ever feel this loved, this safe. You and Nicky gave me that. You gave me a home. Just like Lilia did.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s arms tightened around Rio, her voice barely above a whisper. “You are my home, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed like that for a while, wrapped in each other’s arms, the stars above bearing witness to their love. Agatha felt a deep sense of gratitude wash over her—gratitude for the little boy who had brought so much light into her life, and for the woman who made their family complete.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In that moment, Agatha silently promised herself that she would cherish Rio and protect her with everything she had, for as long as they both lived, and she wished for this to last forever. Unbeknownst to her, Rio had just made the same wish.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They fell into a comfortable silence, the weight of their confessions dissipating into the cool night air. As the night stretched on and the stars continued to shine down on them, Agatha felt a sense of peace she hadn’t known in years. With Rio by her side, she knew she could face anything—even the shadows of her past.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stayed out there for hours, pointing out constellations, sharing stories, and occasionally stealing kisses under the blanket of stars. By the time they decided to head back inside, the sky was beginning to lighten with the first hints of dawn.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they walked back hand in hand, Rio looked up at Agatha, her heart full. “Thank you,” she said simply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“For what?” Agatha asked, her brow furrowing slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“For sharing yourself and your story with me,” Rio replied. “And for always being my anchor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha squeezed her hand, her voice soft but steady. “Always, love. Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha and Rio reached the house, the warmth of home embraced them. As they entered, Rio quietly slipped her shoes off and followed Agatha down the hall.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Rio reached the living room, Agatha had already paid and relieved the babysitter, offering a few warm words of thanks and promising to call her next time they needed help, especially since Nicky seemed to really like her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll go check on Nicky,” Agatha whispered, her hand grazing Rio’s arm as she started toward the stairs. But just as she reached the first step, she turned and extended her hand toward Rio. “Come with me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you sure?” Rio asked, knowing that this was usually Agatha’s moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve never been surer,” Agatha replied, her voice steady and sure, as Rio took her hand. Together, they moved upstairs, Agatha leading the way with Rio following closely behind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door creaked open just enough to let them peek inside. Nicky was fast asleep, sprawled out on his little bed, his blankets half-kicked off as usual. His soft brown curls framed his cherubic face, and his tiny hand clutched his stuffed dragon.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned her head against Agatha’s shoulder, her heart swelling at the sight. “He looks so peaceful,” she murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her eyes tender as she gazed at her son. “He always does. Like nothing in the world could trouble him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped closer, pulling the blanket gently up to cover Nicky’s small body. Her fingers lingered for a moment, brushing over his hair before she straightened up. “He’s such a good kid. So sweet and kind. Just like his mom,” she whispered, casting a glance at Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, wrapping an arm around Rio’s waist. “He sees it in you too, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She kissed the top of Rio’s head, her voice warm with affection. “You’ve brought so much love into this house, Rio. It’s in everything you do—even the way you tuck him in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s posture opened as she turned to Agatha, resting her head back against her shoulder. “I just want him to always feel safe. Like he belongs. Like he’s loved.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He does,” Agatha assured her, her voice steady and full of conviction. “And he always will, as long as we’re here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stood there for a while, watching over Nicky as he dreamed, the quiet hum of the house enveloping them. The love in the room was tangible—a quiet, unwavering force that bound the three of them together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally left, Agatha softly closed the door behind them, her hand finding Rio’s as they walked down the hallway. “Let’s get some rest, love. Tomorrow is another day, and we’ve got a little boy who will be up bright and early, demanding pancakes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, squeezing Agatha’s hand, following her out of Nicky’s bedroom and into their own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they settled in for the night, the house felt like a sanctuary, as if everything they would ever need was within these walls.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

</p><p> </p><p>      (T. S. Eliot. « The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The sound of the car’s engine hummed softly as Agatha navigated the familiar streets back to their home, Nicky chattering happily in the backseat. It was a typical afternoon, the sun casting its golden glow through the car windows, and Rio had just texted her saying she was getting started on dinner, and Agatha knew it was going to be an amazing evening, even if she would probably have to tend to the disaster Rio would leave in the kitchen. Rio's cooking skills were... infamous.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they pulled into the driveway, Nicky bounded out of the car and into the house, the usual energy of the little boy filling the space. Agatha couldn’t help but chuckle at his exuberance as she opened the door for him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Guess what, Rio!” Nicky squealed as he tossed his backpack aside, his eyes lighting up. “The choir show is on Saturday afternoon! I get to sing with my class in front of everyone!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And that’s wonderful, sweetheart, but Rio is in the kitchen, I’m not sure she can hear you from here, baby” Agatha said, giving him a kiss on top of his head. “I know you’ll be amazing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped out from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish towel with way too much stain to be good news and grinning at Nicky’s excitement. “Oh, I heard! You’re going to shine, kiddo,” she said, her heart warming at the sight of him practically bouncing with joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes widened, a mix of eagerness and a bit of nervousness crossing his face. “You both will be there, right? You’re coming to cheer for me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course we will,” Agatha replied without hesitation. “Wouldn’t miss it for the world.” Her voice was soft, full of warmth, but also a little teasing. “Do you need us to make up a little dance for you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky chuckled, his face lighting up even more. “No dance, Mama! Just you two watching me sing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And maybe your mom’s going to bring the camera, just for memories,” Rio added, giving Agatha a mischievous smile. “You know she’ll want some.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh believe me, I want pictures, lots of them!” Agatha teased, earning a playful scowl from Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But, wait!” Nicky’s voice suddenly grew serious. He looked at both of them, his face thoughtful. “Can we invite Grandma Lilia too? She always says she wants to see me sing, but she wasn’t sure when. She can come, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a swell of affection for Nicky and Lilia. She’d always been there for Rio, and Nicky had quickly come to adore her, claiming her as his grandma, just like Rio had claimed her as her mom years ago. There was never any doubt in Rio’s mind that Lilia would be welcomed to any event, but it still made her smile to hear Nicky’s thoughtfulness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course she can come, sweetie,” Rio answered, her tone warm. “I’m sure she’d love to be there.” She turned to Agatha, giving her a subtle, affectionate look. “What do you think?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled at the thought, clearly charmed by the idea of having Lilia join them. “I think it’s a great idea. We’ll get Lilia a seat right next to us. It’ll be a fun family outing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, his energy now a whirlwind of excitement. “Yes! It’s going to be perfect!” He threw his arms around Agatha’s waist and then Rio’s, his little hands gripping them tightly. “Thanks, both of you!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio squeezed him back, feeling a strange mix of joy and something deeper—something she hadn’t quite identified yet. This wasn’t just about a choir show. It was about family, about everyone she loved showing up for each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t wait, kiddo,” Rio said softly, giving him one last squeeze before he rushed off to practice his songs in the living room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned back to Agatha, her hands finding the collar of her shirt as she gave it a playful tug. “Now come help me, dear. I need more hands to finish dinner before the little singer eats all the bread rolls.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched an eyebrow, letting herself be led toward the stove. “Yes, ma’am, but just so you know, that’s no way to talk to your professor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, leaning closer to whisper in a conspiratorial tone, “Good thing you’re more than that, then.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, her hand brushing against Rio’s as she reached for a cutting board. “Cheeky. I like it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned and turned her attention back to the simmering pots and pans. For a few moments, the kitchen filled with the comforting sounds of bubbling sauces and the soft clinks of utensils as they worked together. Agatha passed her ingredients and chopped vegetables with an efficiency that spoke of years of running a household, while Rio expertly handled the stove. They moved in perfect rhythm, exchanging teasing remarks and the occasional touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">All week, Nicky’s excitement was absolutely contagious. From the moment he woke up to the minute his head hit the pillow at night, there wasn’t a moment when he wasn’t humming, singing, or dancing around the house. It was as though the entire world was building up to the choir performance, and Nicky was ready to take center stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On Tuesday morning, Rio walked into the living room to find him standing in the middle of the room with his arms dramatically raised. He was belting out one of his choir songs with all the gusto of a Broadway star, not caring in the least that his audience was just Rio, who had paused mid-step to take in the scene.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, little star,” Rio said, her tone playful but warm as she leaned against the doorframe, smiling. “You’re ready to take over the world with that voice?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky froze mid-note, eyes wide. He grinned sheepishly and dropped his arms, suddenly self-conscious. “Was I too loud? Did I wake you and Mama?” he asked, wrinkling his nose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not at all, we were already awake.” Rio replied, her smile never wavering. “And even if you did, it would have been the best alarm clock we could have asked for.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His face brightened at that, and without missing a beat, he started singing again, his voice softer this time, but no less full of enthusiasm. Rio couldn’t help but chuckle, leaning against the doorframe as she watched him. She’d seen Nicky excited before, but this was a different level of energy—a pure, unbridled joy that made her heart so happy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On Wednesay, the excitement was still growing. Agatha walked into the kitchen after school to find Nicky at the table, a set of papers sprawled out in front of him. His coloring book was open in front of him, but he was busy drawing on the side, what looked like a stage and stick figure children singing on it, his little voice filling the room with one song he was practicing over and over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, who had just come through the front door after a long day in the library couldn’t help but smile when she heard the little voice. She walked over, kissed Agatha sqaurely on the mouth before leaning down to look at the drawing. “You’ve been practicing a lot, huh?” she said gently. “Just make sure to leave a little room for fun. You want to enjoy it too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will! I promise,” Nicky said, his eyes twinkling with determination. “I’m going to do my best, and everyone’s going to cheer for me!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think they’ll be cheering so loud, we won’t even hear you sing,” Agatha teased, her voice full of affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Nicky didn’t hear that. He was already off, running back to the living room, where he immediately started practicing his moves, twirling in the middle of the space like an over-excited tornado.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Throughout the rest of the week, the energy was infectious. Even Rio, who usually preferred quiet moments with her books, found herself humming along to Nicky’s constant rehearsals. By Thursday afternoon, he was beyond ready, practically bouncing with excitement every time someone mentioned the performance. He couldn’t stop talking about it, asking everyone a million questions about what to expect, how they were going to cheer for him, and what he should wear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I want to wear my special blue shirt,” he said that evening while eating dinner, his fork halfway to his mouth. “You know, the one with the stars on it. It’ll make me look like a rock star, like Rio and her band.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think that sounds perfect, but maybe underneath you actual uniform, don't you think?,” Agatha said, a soft smile tugging at her lips as she met Rio’s gaze across the table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On Friday night, the house had quieted down after the flurry of activity surrounding dinner and Nicky’s ever-present excitement. Agatha had finally managed to convince Nicky that it was time for bed, even though he was still buzzing with energy, asking her if she’d come to his room to help him pick out the perfect outfit for the next day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now, in the peaceful silence of the living room, Rio found herself kneeling at the small wooden table in front of the couch, the soft glow of the lamp casting gentle shadows on the walls. She had quietly pulled out a piece of poster board and was carefully decorating it, her focus entirely on the little sign she was making. It wasn’t anything extravagant, just a simple phrase in big, bold letters: <em>Go Nicky! You’re a star!</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She smirked slightly to herself, feeling a little silly for going all out with a cheer sign for a school choir performance. She wasn’t even sure Nicky would need it, but there was something about the idea of being there with him, fully invested in his moment, that made her feel like she had to do something extra.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she finished, she paused to study the sign, biting her lip in slight hesitation. “Okay, maybe this is a little much,” she murmured to herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just then, she heard soft footsteps approaching from behind. She looked over her shoulder to see Agatha standing in the doorway, a knowing smile on her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I should’ve known,” Agatha said with a playful grin, crossing her arms. “You’re making a sign for him?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blushed slightly, trying to hide her unease behind a sheepish smile. “I know, I know. It feels a little silly, but I want to make sure he knows we’re both cheering him on. And… well, I guess I’m just caught up in the excitement.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, her smile warming with genuine affection. She walked over to Rio, gently sitting down behind her on the couch and looking at the sign over her shoulder. “It’s not silly,” she said softly, her voice rich with fondness. “You’re invested in him, in <em>us</em>, and that means everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t know why, but hearing Agatha say that made something inside her tighten with emotion. She hadn’t realized how much she’d come to care about Nicky in such a short time—how deeply she wanted to be a part of his world, of their world. The sign, the excitement, even the small things she did to show up for him, felt like more than just little gestures. They felt like they meant something bigger, something deeper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced up at Agatha, unsure of what to say. Agatha smiled softly, her eyes searching Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re really doing this, aren’t you?” Agatha asked, her voice low but full of admiration. “You’re fully committed to him, to <em>us</em>.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged, the sudden weight of the question settling in. “I don’t know, it just feels right. I mean, it’s Nicky. I want him to know I care. I guess this is how it’s happening.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened even more, and she reached out, gently brushing her hand against Rio’s. “It’s not just that,” she said, her voice now tinged with warmth. “You’ve only been a part of his life for a little while, and yet… you’re so <em>all in</em>. You’re making a sign, planning to cheer him on. It’s not just about the performance, Rio. It’s about how much you love him. And I think he knows that. He’s going to feel it tomorrow.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart fluttered in her chest as she looked at Agtaha, realizing the depth of the bond that was already forming between her and Nicky. It wasn’t just about moving in together, about plants or signs or even a simple school choir show. It was about the way she felt a sense of belonging with them, a new, growing family that felt more like home with each passing day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I guess I am all in,” Rio admitted softly, the words feeling natural, as if they had always been there. She paused before adding with a teasing smile, “But I <em>still</em> think a sign for a school choir is a little over the top.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her eyes twinkling with affection as she leaned over, pressing a kiss to the side of Rio’s head. “I think it’s perfect. I can’t wait to see Nicky’s face when he sees it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, feeling a lightness in her chest. “Yeah… me too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, there was a comfortable silence between them, the only sound in the room the soft rustle of paper and the distant hum of the house settling. as she leaned back to rest her back on Agatha’s legs, Rio felt the weight of Agatha’s gaze on her from behind, full of love and quiet pride, and something stirred deep within her—something that told her this, right here, right now, was where she was meant to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So,” Agatha said after a beat, her voice teasing again. “What do you think—should I make a sign too, or will that be too much?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, her heart full as she shook her head. “We might have to make a whole row of signs at this rate.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha grinned, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “Now that’s an idea. But, for now, let’s just focus on cheering him on. He’s going to be amazing, and we’re going to be there, cheering louder than anyone.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her heart swelling as she finished the final touches on the sign. She didn’t need a fancy gesture to know she was part of something real. She had everything she needed right here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning of Nicky’s big performance arrived with the sun shining brightly through the windows, casting a warm golden glow over the house. Rio was bustling around the kitchen, preparing lunch for the small gathering they had planned before heading to the school for the choir show. The excitement in the house was palpable, though Nicky’s nervous energy was just as noticeable as his enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Nicky called, his voice a mix of excitement and worry as he sat in the living room, his hands under his legs to keep them from flailing about, “What if I forget the words? What if my voice cracks? What if—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio caught him mid-sentence, walking over and kneeling beside him. She gently cupped his face in her hands, forcing him to stop his anxious bouncing. “Nicky, you’ve been practicing all week, right? And you’re going to do amazing. We’re all so proud of you.” She smiled warmly at him, brushing a stray lock of hair from his forehead. “You’ve got this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He nodded, though his eyes still seemed unsure. “But what if I mess up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You won’t, and even if you do, it’s okay” Rio reassured him, giving him a soft squeeze of the shoulders. “We’ll be there cheering you on, no matter what happens, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded again, his small hands fiddling with the hem of his shirt. Just then, there was a knock at the door, and Rio smiled as she opened it to reveal Lilia, standing with a warm smile and a basket of freshly baked bread under her arm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hello, my loves!” Lilia greeted, stepping inside with a cheerful air, her presence always bringing a sense of calm with it. “I thought I’d bring something special to keep our energy up before the big performance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia!” Nicky shouted excitedly, running over to her and wrapping his arms around her legs. She bent down to hug him tightly, ruffling his hair affectionately.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey there, superstar,” Lilia said warmly, standing up and giving Rio a knowing look. “How are you feeling, sweet boy?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m nervous,” Nicky admitted with a small frown, looking down at his shoes. “But also excited. I really want to make you proud, Grandma Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled gently, bending down to his level. “You don’t need to worry about that. We’re all so proud of you already. Just get up there and have fun. Your voice is beautiful, my sweet sweet boy, just let everybody hear it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky smiled shyly at her, his nerves slowly melting away under Lilia’s calming words. He seemed to grow just a little more confident at the thought of her support.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha appeared in the doorway at that moment, holding Nicky’s neatly folded choir uniform in her hands. The crisp white shirt and deep navy trousers looked freshly pressed, proving the care she’d put into preparing for the afternoon. Her face lit up when she spotted Lilia standing near Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hello, Lilia,” Agatha said warmly, stepping forward. “I’m so glad you could make it today!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she opened her arms. “Agatha, of course, I wouldn’t miss this for the world.” The two women embraced briefly, the kind of hug that spoke of mutual respect and shared affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled back, one hand still lightly resting on Lilia’s shoulders, while the other held the little uniform out of the way so it wouldn’t get crinkled. “Nicky’s been so excited to see you. He’s been practicing non-stop,” she said with a fond chuckle, her gaze shifting toward her son.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled warmly and turned to her son. “Alright, baby, it’s time to get ready. Let’s make sure everything’s perfect for you,” she said, holding out his uniform.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded enthusiastically, taking the clothes with care. “Okay, Mama! But don’t forget, you have to sit in the front row with Grandma Lilia and Rio so I can see you when I’m singing!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t dream of sitting anywhere else,” Agatha promised, smoothing a hand over his hair before guiding him upstairs toward his room to change.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio moved toward the kitchen, Lilia in tow, to finish the last of the lunch as Agatha and Nicky went upstairs. From the stairs, they could hear the soft sound of Agatha talking to Nicky, probably giving him a pep talk or reminding him to breathe and relax.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she finished putting the final touches on the meal, she could feel her excitement growing as well. Seeing Nicky so nervous yet excited, the palpable tension in the house, made her realize just how much she cared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky came back downstairs a few minutes later, now dressed in his choir uniform. His hair was neatly combed, and he looked a little more at ease, though his nerves still lingered in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He looked around at the group, giving Rio and Lilia a quick, shy smile. “I’m ready. I think I’m ready.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha followed closely behind, grinning at how adorable Nicky looked, his uniform a perfect fit. She placed a hand on Nicky’s shoulder, giving him an encouraging squeeze. “You look great, baby. You’re going to rock it out there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The group gathered around the table, sitting down together for a quick lunch before they would head off to the school. Lilia’s bread was warm and fresh, and Rio had made a light salad with a few sides. The conversation was light, with laughter echoing through the room as they shared stories, teasing Nicky gently, and encouraging him to focus on enjoying the experience. Rio couldn’t help but smile as she watched Agatha and Lilia interact so easily, like they had always been part of the same circle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As lunch came to a close, Nicky was feeling a little more at ease. His nervous energy had shifted into excitement, and he was already talking about the choir performance in detail. But amid the conversation, something seemed to linger in his mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia had just passed him another piece of bread when Nicky suddenly looked up from his plate, a curious expression on his face. “Hey, Rio,” Nicky asked suddenly, his voice tentative, “You call Lilia ‘mom’ sometimes, but not all the time. Isn’t she your mom all the time?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question hung in the air, quiet but thoughtful. Rio froze for a moment, her fork hovering just above her plate as she glanced at Lilia. She wasn’t sure how to explain it—how to answer in a way that Nicky would understand. It was true—Rio did call Lilia “Mom” occasionally, but it wasn’t consistent. It was a word that slipped out only in certain moments, when warmth and familiarity welled up so strongly that it felt natural. And Nicky, ever observant, had picked up on that. His gaze flickered between Rio and Lilia now, full of quiet curiosity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia broke the silence first, her voice soft and inviting. “That’s a very good question, Nicky,” she said, her tone carrying no judgment, just patience. She glanced at Rio, offering her the space to respond.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled slowly, offering Nicky a small, reassuring smile. “Well, kiddo,” she started, setting her fork down to give him her full attention. “Lilia’s to me kind of like your Mama to you. She didn’t raise me from when I was a baby or even a little girl, but… she’s been there for me in the ways that matter most, just like a mom would be.” She paused, her voice softening. “I guess calling her ‘Mom’ isn’t something I do all the time, but it’s how I feel about her. Does that make sense?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky furrowed his brow, clearly taking her words to heart. He traced the edge of his plate with his fingers, his thoughtful gaze darting between Rio and Lilia as if piecing together a puzzle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So…” he said slowly, tilting his head, “Lilia’s your mom, but she hasn’t always been?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smile widened, a warm glow in her eyes. “That’s exactly right, darling boy,” she said gently, reaching over to tousle his hair. “You’ve got it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face brightened a little at the praise, but he wasn’t done thinking. “So… you call her ‘Mom’ when it feels like she’s your mom?” he asked, looking back at Rio for confirmation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her smile soft and steady. “Exactly. It’s not about how often I say it. It’s about what it means when I do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled, her voice light and reassuring. “Sometimes things don’t need a perfect explanation, Nicky. We just do what feels right in the moment, don’t we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tilted his head, his small face scrunching up in deep concentration as he worked through everything Rio and Lilia had said. For a moment, the room felt quiet, the soft clinking of plates the only sound as he mulled it over. Then, he gave a little nod, his expression clearing as if a light had just switched on in his mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His bright eyes settled on Rio, lingering longer than usual, as though trying to piece together something deeper about her. “Okay,” he finally said, his voice carrying the quiet confidence of someone who had cracked an important mystery. “I think I get it now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He flashed them a small, satisfied smile before his attention turned back to his plate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio and Lilia exchanged a quiet, knowing look, as Agatha watched on. They could tell Nicky was processing what they’d said, and though he didn’t press further, it was clear he understood—perhaps not in the way an adult might, but in his own, quiet way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Across the table, Agatha watched the interaction unfold with a quiet smile, her hands wrapped around her glass. She chose not to interject, knowing Nicky needed the space to work it out in his own way. Still, she felt a deep sense of pride in her son’s empathy and thoughtfulness—and in Rio and Lilia’s ability to handle his questions with such grace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the conversation shifted to lighter topics, Nicky’s excitement returned in full force. He launched into an animated description of his upcoming choir performance, detailing every note, step, and gesture he planned to make on stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back in her chair, her smile growing as she listened to his exuberant chatter. Lilia joined in, asking him questions and encouraging his enthusiasm, while Agatha observed, her heart swelling. She had decided to not say anything during the conversation, but she knew her son, and she couldn’t help feeling like she knew exactly where this was going.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the time for the performance drew nearer, the four of them gathered their things and and piled into Lilia’s car. Nicky’s excitement bubbled over as he chattered about the choir songs, but it was Agatha who seemed to be the most anxious. She had barely stopped moving since they’d finished lunch, fussing over Nicky’s hair, adjusting his clothes, and reminding him to take a deep breath and relax.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did you have everything you need, baby?” Agatha asked for what felt like the tenth time, smoothing a wrinkle in his shirt that didn’t even exist. “You’re going to do great, sweetheart, but remember—take it easy before the performance, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, trying to contain his excitement, rolled his eyes playfully but nodded. “Yes, Mama. I have everything. You’ve asked me like a million times.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, a little sheepishly, but her concern never wavered. She leaned down and kissed Nicky on the top of his head. “I know, I just want you to be ready. You’re going to shine out there, I know it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but smile at the sight. Agatha’s love for Nicky was undeniable, and it made her heart swell to see how much care she took with every little detail. She couldn’t help but chuckle softly, leaning over to Agatha and teasing, “I think Nicky might just be able to handle this one on his own, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced over at Rio, giving her a playful glare, but it was clear she wasn’t offended. “I know, but I’m his mom. Let me have my moment. He’s my little star and my baby, and I just want everything to go perfectly.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, appreciative of Agatha’s devotion. She could see how much Agatha adored her son, how fiercely she wanted to protect him, and how deeply she believed in his potential.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, who was sitting beside Rio in the passenger seat, leaned over and whispered with a smile, “I think Agatha’s going to need a nap after this, don’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, glancing back at Agatha in the rearview mirror, who was adjusting Nicky’s collar one last time. “I’m starting to think she might need one right now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They all arrived at the school shortly after, the air buzzing with excitement. Nicky was practically bouncing in his seat, barely able to keep still as they walked towards the school auditorium. Agatha, still fussing over him, kept a steady hand on his shoulder, making sure he felt secure and ready.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they reached the door to the auditorium, Nicky turned to Rio and Agatha, his face beaming with excitement. “Are you guys ready to see me sing?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha kneeled down to his level and gave him a soft kiss on the cheek. “I was born ready, sweetheart. Just remember to have fun, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled and ruffled Nicky’s hair. “You’re going to do amazing, kiddo. We’re so proud of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The group moved into the auditorium, finding their seats. Agatha settled in beside Rio, who took her sign out, her mom gaze never straying far from Nicky, who was already making his way backstage with the other choir members. As the lights dimmed, Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand, her excitement palpable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the choir took their places on stage, the atmosphere in the auditorium shifted from nervous energy to real enthusiasm. The lights softened, casting a warm glow on the performers. Nicky was right at the front, his eyes scanning the crowd before settling on Agatha and Rio. A little wave from the front of the stage, and Rio couldn’t help but return it with a wide, encouraging grin. He gave her a thumbs-up, the excitement in his face infectious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The music started, a soft, harmonious hum that filled the room, and Nicky’s voice joined in, clear and bright. As the song continued, Rio’s eyes found him again, his voice standing out with such clarity and confidence. It wasn’t just his tone that caught her attention—it was the effort and heart he poured into every note, reminded her of the dance recital all those months ago. The way he moved with the music, his focus unwavering, made Rio feel as though he was the only one in the room. He wasn’t just singing; he was <em>performing</em>, putting his heart into every lyric, his face lighting up with joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Next to her, Agatha sat with her gaze fixed on Nicky, her expression a mix of admiration and pride. Rio felt Agatha’s hand gently rest on her knee, a quiet, but intense gesture that spoke volumes. It was a shared moment of pride, a wordless acknowledgment of how far Nicky had come and how proud they both were of him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, unable to hide her smile, felt her heart swell in her chest. She was proud of him too—proud of how much effort he had put into this moment. It made Rio’s heart ache in the best way possible. She didn’t know when it had happened, but somewhere along the way, Nicky had become someone she loved deeply. He was a part of her life now—he <em>was</em> her family, just as much as Agatha was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced at Agatha, who was watching Nicky with a tenderness that made Rio’s chest tighten. There was so much love in Agatha’s gaze, a quiet pride in everything Nicky did, and Rio could see how much this moment meant to her. She gently squeezed Agatha’s hand on her knee, grateful for the way they shared this, how their hearts both swelled for the boy who had brought them all closer together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the song finally reached its crescendo for the first song and the last note lingered in the air, the audience erupted into applause, and Rio joined in enthusiastically, her hands clapping together with pride. Nicky’s grin was so wide it almost took over his entire face, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh with happiness at the sight, before getting ready for the second song.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the choir’s voices filled the room, Rio’s attention was completely absorbed by Nicky. His face was a picture of pure joy, his eyes sparkling with excitement, and his smile wide and uncontainable as he sang. She couldn’t take her eyes off him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a brief moment, Rio was overwhelmed. Her chest tightened, and she felt an emotional swell she hadn’t expected. It was as if a dam inside her had broken open, flooding her with the realization of how much Nicky had come to mean to her. It wasn’t just the boy she had come to know and love in bits and pieces; it was the part of him that had woven itself so deeply into the fabric of her own life. He wasn’t just Agatha’s son anymore—he was <em>her</em> family too, and that truth hit her harder than she anticipated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A lump formed in her throat as her eyes filled with tears, the feeling so raw, so beautiful. She hadn’t known how deeply she had already fallen for him. She hadn’t known how much he had changed her life simply by being in it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked quickly, trying to regain composure, but the emotion wasn’t going anywhere. She smiled, wiping away the first tear that slid down her cheek, though she didn’t bother to hide the warmth that spread across her face. Her heart ached with love for this young boy who had so easily become a part of her world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was in that moment that Agatha, sensing the depth of Rio’s feelings, subtly reached for her hand. Rio’s fingers instinctively curled around Agatha’s, and Agatha gave her a gentle, reassuring squeeze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t stop the smile that crept onto her lips, her heart full, her chest light despite the tears. She squeezed Agatha’s hand back, silently grateful for the understanding between them. Agatha’s touch was grounding, a reminder that she wasn’t alone in this, that they were in this together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes never left Nicky, but she knew Agatha was watching her, her presence a comforting anchor. The tears that had threatened to overwhelm her settled into a quiet contentment, and she couldn’t help but smile as she saw how much joy Nicky was radiating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The song ended, and the applause erupted. Rio’s hands joined the others once again, clapping with genuine pride and joy. Nicky was grinning, his eyes sparkling as he took in the praise, but Rio saw him looking toward them too, seeking their approval. And when he caught their eyes, his grin widened, and Rio’s heart swelled again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, her voice low and filled with emotion. “He’s amazing, isn’t he?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her voice soft. “He really is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her thumb gently stroking the back of Rio’s hand. “We’re so lucky, all three of us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her gaze still on Nicky. She could only agree. Her eyes met Agatha’s for a moment, brown meeting blue in a mix of love and pride, before settling back on Nicky, who was beaming up at the stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia leaned over Rio, her voice loud enough to cover the applause that kept erupting all over the room. “He was incredible. I think he’s made his own fan club.” She smiled warmly, her heart full of pride. “You’ve done an amazing job, Agatha. And he’s done an amazing job.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened as she watched Nicky, her eyes sparkling. “I think we’ve all done an amazing job.” Her hand gently squeezed Rio’s knee again, this time with a quiet sense of contentment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p class="p1" align="justify">As the choir began to file off stage, Nicky’s eyes immediately sought them out. The moment he spotted them, he took off running, his excitement palpable in the way his feet hardly seemed to touch the ground. His face was alight with joy, his eyes wide with pride.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Did you see me? Did you hear me?” he asked eagerly, his voice practically bubbling over with excitement. He barely gave them a chance to respond before Rio was already pulling him into a big, tight hug. She squeezed him close, her heart soaring.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“You were incredible, Nicky,” Rio said, her voice full of admiration. “You were the star up there.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky’s arms wrapped around her tightly, soaking in the praise. Agatha stood beside them, a proud smile on her face as she gently ruffled his hair.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“You were absolutely amazing,” Agatha added, her voice full of affection, as Nicky turned to her to bury his face in his mother’s stomach. Agatha bent down to pick him up, placing him on her hip, rejoicing in the fact that he wasn’t too big yet for her not to be able to do it anymore. “I’ve never seen anyone shine like you did up there. You’re so special, Nicky. You really are.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky grinned, his face flushed with the joy of their praise. But it was Lilia’s voice that caught his attention next.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“You were the best out there, Nicky,” Lilia said, her tone full of warmth and pride. “The best grandson any grandmother could ask for.” She leaned in, her eyes twinkling. “And you’ve got Rio’s talent for music. You’re going places, kid, I can tell.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">At the mention of Rio’s talent, Nicky’s eyes lit up even more. He beamed at her from his spot in Agatha’s arms, his heart swelling with pride at the comparison. It was the kind of validation that made everything feel just a little more real. He wasn’t just performing for his own satisfaction anymore; he was doing it for the people who meant the most to him, and hearing their words made him feel on top of the world.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky grinned even wider, his chest puffed out a little. “Thanks, everyone!” he said, his voice gleeful, and then he looked back at Rio. “I think I want to sing even more now! And I’ll learn how to play the drums and I’m gonna be like you someday!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “You’re already a star, Nicky. Keep singing, and you’ll go far.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened as Nicky wiggled to be put down and she took Rio’s hand, her voice tender. “He’s already so much more than I ever imagined.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The group lingered for a moment, all of them basking in the warmth of the day’s accomplishment and the joy of Nicky’s success.</p><div align="justify">

</div><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As they made their way out of the auditorium, Nicky tugged on Rio’s hand, his excitement still bubbling over. “Wait! I want to show you something!” he insisted, his eyes shining with enthusiasm. Rio chuckled, glancing at Agatha, who shrugged with a smile and gestured for Rio to follow. Lilia gently said she was going to wait for them outside, sensing this moment was just for them.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky led them through the school hallways, his little feet quick as he nearly skipped with anticipation. Finally, they arrived at his classroom, and he pushed open the door, eager to show Rio everything. The walls were covered with colorful posters and student work, and Nicky immediately started pointing to various drawings he was particularly proud of.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“These are my pictures!” he said, practically beaming as he gestured to the collection pinned up on a corkboard. “I did these in art class! Look!” He rushed to a drawing he had made of a giant rocket ship, then moved on to one of a dog with three tails.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio smiled at each one, admiring his creativity, but it was one particular drawing that made her pause. It was a picture of a little boy standing between two women, one with very long brown hair and blue eyes and the other with dark, long hair and brown eyes. The boy in the middle was smiling brightly, his arms outstretched as if he was holding both of their hands. The two adults on either side of him were smiling down at him with as much warmth and affection that stick figures could convey.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky watched her reaction closely, his expression hopeful. “I drew this one last week,” he explained, his voice low as he pointed at the image. “It’s… it’s me with you and Mama.” His face was a little shy as he looked between Rio and Agatha, but there was something so tender in the way he had drawn them together—something that spoke volumes about how he saw their place in his life.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio felt her heart melt at the sight of the drawing. There was something so simple and pure about it, and it took her a moment to collect herself. She crouched down to Nicky’s level, gently placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“This is beautiful, Nicky,” she said softly, her voice thick with emotion. “You’re so talented.” She smiled warmly, her heart full. “I love it. You’ve captured exactly what it feels like, being with you.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky beamed, clearly pleased with her response, and his eyes sparkled as he said, “I’m glad you like it! I drew it because I want you and Mama to always be with me.” He paused, looking at the picture with a quiet kind of understanding, as if he knew just how special it was to him.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha, who had been standing by the door watching with a proud smile, stepped forward. “Nicky, that’s perfect,” she said, her voice filled with emotion. “I think you’ve made a masterpiece.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but feel a lump form in her throat at Nicky’s words, the sincerity in his voice making her chest ache in the best possible way. She hadn’t realized how deeply he too already saw them as a family, how much he wanted them to be together, always.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky, completely unaware of the impact his simple drawing had, looked up at them both, eyes full of joy. “You’ll always be with me, right?” he asked, his tone full of trust and certainty.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio met Agatha’s gaze, and for a moment, everything felt perfect. She smiled, her heart full of love for this little boy who had so easily become such an important part of her life. “Always, Nicky,” she said, her voice steady but full of emotion. “We’re here, and we’re not going anywhere.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up at her words, and he ran over to her, throwing his arms around her in a tight hug. “Thanks, Rio!” he exclaimed, his voice muffled by her shoulder. “I’m so happy!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha stepped forward, placing a gentle hand on Nicky’s back and the other on Rio’s, keeping them close. “We’re all happy, sweetheart,” she said softly, her voice filled with warmth. “You’ve brought so much joy to us today, and everyday.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio pulled Nicky back gently and met Agatha’s gaze, a silent understanding passing between them. This—this was their family, right here, in this small classroom, surrounded by Nicky’s drawings and the love that had grown between them all.<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span> <span class="apple-converted-space"> Agatha leaned down to kiss Rio with Nicky still sandwiched between them, before they made their way back to the hall where Lilia was waiting for them. </span></p><div align="justify">

</p><p class="p1" align="justify">After Nicky’s excitement had died down, the four of them headed out into the cool afternoon air, their laughter still lingering as they made their way to the small ice cream shop just a few blocks away from the school. Nicky, who was still practically glowing from his performance, bounced along between Agatha and Rio, chattering non-stop about how much fun he’d had and how his friends and him had loved being on stage.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Lilia, walking beside Rio, their arms linked together, looked at her pseudo-daughter with a soft smile. “You looked so proud of him, Rio,” she said, her voice warm with affection. “I can tell how much he means to you.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio glanced at Lilia, her heart full. “He means the world to me,” she replied quietly. She glanced at Agatha, who had her hand trapped in Nicky’s, her face lit up with pride and love. “I think he’s becoming someone really special.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha, overhearing, smiled and nodded. “He is,” she agreed, her voice full of affection. “And he’s lucky to have you both in his life.” Her eyes softened as she glanced down at Nicky, who was practically bouncing with energy, unable to contain his excitement.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">When they reached the ice cream shop, the little bell above the door jingled as they entered, and Nicky immediately ran to the counter, his eyes scanning the flavors with intense concentration. “I want the biggest one ever!” he declared, his hands on his hips in a stance that was both determined and adorable.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha chuckled, following him up to the counter. “I think you’ll need to pace yourself, sweatheart,” she said with a teasing grin.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky pressed his nose against the glass display, his eyes wide as he examined the colorful assortment of flavors. “I want… chocolate!” he announced before immediately changing his mind. “No, wait! Vanilla! Or maybe both?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha chuckled, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. “How about we get you a scoop of each, hmm? It’s a special day, after all.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky grinned up at her, nodding eagerly. “Okay! And sprinkles, too!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio stayed back, watching with a smile as Nicky eagerly pointed to his choice, clearly excited to enjoy a treat after such a big day. Lilia sidled up beside her, nudging her gently with her elbow. “You see how Agatha is proud of Nicky? That’s exactly how I feel about you.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled, and she took a deep breath, glancing over at Agatha and Nicky. “I never thought I’d have this,” she admitted softly. “But now that I do, I can’t imagine my life without them.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Lilia smiled gently, her eyes twinkling. “That’s the way it goes sometimes, sweet girl. You just find where you belong when you least expect it.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha, having ordered for Nicky, walked over to Rio and Lilia. She handed Nicky his ice cream, and the little boy immediately turned to Rio, holding it up to show her his choice with a proud grin.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Look, Rio!” he said eagerly, holding up the massive cone with two scoops of chocolate and vanilla, the ice cream nearly threatening to topple over. “I got the biggest one like I said!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio chuckled and bent down to his level, her hands on her knees as she smiled at him. “That’s impressive, Nicky,” she said with a grin. “You’ll have to make sure to share some with me.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky nodded seriously. “Of course! I’ll even save some for you,” he said, his voice full of determination. “But only if you promise to try the chocolate!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha, watching the exchange with a soft smile, leaned in and kissed Rio’s cheek gently. “You’re doing great,” she whispered, her voice low enough that only Rio could hear. “I’m proud of you.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat at the tenderness in Agatha’s voice. She looked at her partner, her eyes full of love, and nodded. “I’m proud of us,” she said quietly. “I’m really happy, Agatha. Thank you for giving me this.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky interrupted their moment by tugging on Rio’s arm, eager for them to sit down. “Come on, you need to get your own ice creams now!” he said, his voice full of excitement. “I can’t wait any longer!”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The three women chuckled and went back to the counter. Rio studied the options, trying not to laugh at the sheer delight on the boy’s face. Lilia leaned over, nudging her shoulder. “Don’t overthink it, Rio,” she teased. “It’s just ice cream.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio grinned back, finally settling on a classic vanilla cone with caramel drizzle. Lilia chose pistachio, and Agatha settled on mint chocolate chip, earning a scoff from Rio.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Don’t even think about kissing me after that,” she teased, eying the green and brown monstrosity in Agatha’s hand.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Not a fan of my choice, love?” Agatha teased back, bringing her ice-cream closer to Rio’s face, almost smearing her cheek with it.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“If I wanted to eat toothpaste, I would eat the one in the bathroom, way less expensive.” She replied, taking a step back to avoid the ice cream touching her face.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha childishly stuck out her tongue and took Rio’s hand with her unoccupied one, leading her after Nicky and Lilia to a cozy booth by the window. Nicky’s cone was so tall he had to concentrate to keep it balanced, but he attacked it with gusto, managing to get chocolate on his nose within seconds.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Careful, baby,” Agatha warned, laughing as she handed him a napkin. “We don’t want your ice cream wearing you.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio couldn’t stop smiling as she watched Nicky happily devour his treat, his chatter filling the air. He was still riding the high of his performance, describing every moment in vivid detail, including how he’d spotted them in the audience cheering him on.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“You were the best one on stage, you know,” Rio said, leaning over to tap the tip of his nose with her finger, leaving a little caramel smudge there. “And not just because we’re biased.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky giggled, wiping his nose with his napkin before turning to Lilia. “Did you like my songs, Grandma?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Lilia’s face lit up at the nickname, and she nodded emphatically. “You were amazing, sweetheart,” she said warmly.<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The compliment made Nicky beam, and he took another enthusiastic bite of his ice cream before announcing, “I’m gonna sing more songs for you when we get home!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha chuckled, brushing a hand over his hair. “I think we’d all love that.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><div align="justify">

  <p class="p1">  </p>
</div><p class="p1" align="justify">After finishing their ice cream, the four of them stepped out into the crisp evening air. Nicky was still buzzing with energy, skipping along the sidewalk between Agatha and Rio, holding their hands tightly. Lilia walked a few steps behind them, a soft smile on her face as she watched the little family.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">When they reached the spot where Lilia had parked her car, she turned to Nicky and crouched down to his level. “You did so well today, sweet boy,” she said, brushing a stray curl from his forehead. “I’m so proud of you. Keep practicing those songs, okay?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I will!” Nicky promised, throwing his arms around her neck in an exuberant hug. “Bye, Lilia! See you soon!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Lilia stood, giving Rio a knowing smile before pulling her into a hug as well. “Take care of them,” she murmured, her voice filled with warmth.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Always,” Rio promised, her voice soft but sure.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Lilia gave Agatha a nod, her approval evident, before climbing into her car and waving as she drove away.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As they watched her taillights disappear down the street, Nicky tugged on Agatha’s hand. “Can we go home now? I wanna show Rio my other drawings!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha chuckled, wrapping an arm around his shoulders as they started walking again. “Of course, sweetheart. Let’s get you home.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The walk was peaceful, the cool breeze carrying the scent of leaves and rain. Nicky chatted excitedly about the songs he wanted to learn next, his little voice filling the quiet streets. Agatha and Rio exchanged fond glances as they listened, their hands occasionally brushing as they walked side by side.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">When they finally arrived at the house, Nicky burst through the door, already heading toward his room. “Come on, Rio! You have to see this one!” he called over his shoulder.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio laughed, slipping off her coat and following him down the hall. Agatha lingered in the entryway for a moment, watching them with a tender smile before locking the door behind her.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As Nicky excitedly shuffled through his stack of drawings, Rio knelt beside him on the carpet, giving her full attention to each one he held up. There were rainbows and stick figures, animals and houses. Each one came with an enthusiastic explanation of the story behind it.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“This one is a dragon, but he’s a nice dragon and he lives in the river,” Nicky said, holding up a colorful scribble with pride. “He helps the knights instead of fighting them!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio grinned. “I like that idea. A dragon with a good heart. And a river is good place to live.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky beamed and quickly grabbed another drawing, this one of a treehouse with three figures beneath it. “This is us,” he explained. “That’s me, and that’s Mama, and that’s you!” He pointed to each stick figure in turn, their smiles clearly drawn in.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio felt her chest tighten with emotion as she looked at the simple but heartfelt drawing. “You really like drawing us together, don’t you?” she asked softly, her voice catching.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky nodded, his curls bouncing. “Because we’re a team now, right?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Before Rio could respond, Agatha appeared in the doorway, leaning against the frame with a soft smile. “That’s right, sweetheart,” she said, her voice full of warmth. “We’re the best team there is.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky turned back to Rio. “Can we put this one in the living room? So everyone can see it when they visit?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio glanced at Agatha, who gave a small nod of encouragement. Smiling, Rio said, “Of course, Nicky. I think that’s a great idea.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Yay!” Nicky bounced to his feet, holding the drawing carefully. “I’m gonna go get some tape!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As he dashed off, Rio rose to her feet, shaking her head fondly. Agatha stepped closer, slipping an arm around her waist. “You’re amazing with him, you know that?” Agatha murmured, her voice low.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio leaned into her, feeling the warmth of Agatha’s embrace. “He makes it easy,” she admitted.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio turned to look at her, her heart full. Before Agatha could respond, Nicky’s voice echoed from the other room. “I found the tape! I’m putting it up!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Both women laughed softly and followed the sound of his voice to the living room, where Nicky was carefully sticking his masterpiece to the wall next to the window.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Perfect,” Agatha said, stepping back to admire his work. “Now, I think we should get started on dinner, don’t you think my loves?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Please, Mama, can I stay here and play with my Legos instead?” Nicky askes, tunring his best puppy eyes to his mother.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Okay, love. You stay here while Rio and I make dinner. But promise you’ll come as soon as we say it’s ready?” Agatha relented, already making her way to the kitchen, Rio in tow.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Promise, Mama, thank you ! »</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Soon enough, Rio found herself in the kitchen with Agatha, chopping vegetables while Nicky played in the living room. The scent of garlic and rosemary filled the air, mingling with the low hum of their casual conversation.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha leaned casually against the counter, her sleeves rolled up, stirring the simmering pot of soup. She stole a glance at Rio, a playful smirk curling at the corners of her lips. “You know,” she said, her voice dripping with mock innocence, “if anyone at the university saw us like this, they’d probably have a heart attack.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio snorted, shaking her head as she chopped a carrot with precision. “Oh, absolutely. ‘Dr. Harkness, the brilliant, terrifying genius, cooking dinner with her student? Scandalous!’” She affected a dramatic tone, one eyebrow raised in exaggerated shock.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Not just any student,” Agatha added, her smirk widening, eyes glinting mischievously. “Her PhD student, and the best one, at that.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, though a smile tugged at her lips. “I think you’re a little biased, love.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Of course, I am,” Agatha teased, her tone light and knowing. Then, her eyes sparkled with playful accusation. “But don’t think for a second I haven’t noticed those lingering glances of yours, Miss Vidal.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Thanks for the reminder,” Rio shot back, though her cheeks flushed slightly, betraying her mock irritation. She dropped the sliced carrots into a bowl and pointed her knife at Agatha with a smirk. “And let’s not pretend you’re all sunshine and roses either. You’ve scared at least half the department into submission.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha laughed, her eyes flashing with mischief. “Fair point. But they love me for it.” She crossed her arms over her chest, her smirk turning sly, and leaned in slightly, lowering her voice as if sharing a secret. “But you, Rio Vidal, you’re the real scandal. Imagine the looks on your band groupies’ faces—your peers’ faces—if they knew you spent your evenings here, cooking soup with your professor, helping me untangle Nicky’s toy helicopters, and making those little signs for his choir shows. Oh, honey, your reputation would never survive.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio couldn’t help herself—she burst out laughing, tilting her head back as the sound filled the kitchen. “Alright, fine, you win,” she said between breaths, her voice light with humor, before she put down the knife and hopped on the counter, sitting down in it gracefully. “But let’s be honest here—your ‘fearsome researcher’ reputation would take just as big a hit if they knew you hum lullabies to Nicky when he’s upset.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha gasped dramatically, one hand flying to her chest as if mortally wounded. “How dare you expose me like this?” she said, her voice full of mock horror.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s voice lowered to a near whisper, ensuring that Nicky couldn’t overhear. “Or if they knew about the nights when you make me your own." Her eyes twinkled with something more intimate as she leaned in closer."Over and over again.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s expression shifted in an instant. Her eyes darkened, and she placed the spoon she had been stirring with down on the counter with deliberate slowness. She stepped closer to Rio, closing the distance between them in a single fluid motion, invading her personal space with intent. Standing between Rio’s legs, she placed her arms on either side of her, trapping her in a sensual embrace. “Is that so, Miss Vidal?” she murmured, her voice low, a provocative edge to it. “Is that something you want again? Maybe tonight?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s breath caught in her throat. Her heart raced as she looked up at Agatha, their faces mere inches apart. “Yes, Dr. Harkness, that’s exactly what I want,” she replied, her voice hushed but full of desire and certainty.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Well, I’ll make sure you have it then”. Agatha replied and without another word, Agatha closed the gap between them, her lips crashing onto Rio’s in a fierce kiss that stole the breath from her lungs. Rio’s hands instantly found their way into Agatha’s long, brown hair, pulling her closer, if that was even possible. The world outside the kitchen ceased to exist, and all that mattered was the fire that flared between them.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">When they finally pulled apart, both of them breathless, Agatha took a step back, her hands lingering on Rio’s thighs, grounding them both. Her voice softened, the teasing edge replaced by something more genuine, more resolute. “In all seriousness, though,” she said quietly, meeting Rio’s gaze with unwavering intensity, “if anyone judged us for this— for being here, making a life together— well, that’s their problem, not ours.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio looked into Agatha’s eyes, the warmth and truth of her words settling into her chest like a comforting weight. Her smile softened, her voice quiet but steady. “Yeah,” she replied, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s. “You’re right. Let them think whatever they want.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha leaned in then, pressing a kiss to Rio’s temple, her lips lingering as she whispered, “That’s my girl.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">They turned back to their cooking, the moment hanging between them like a quiet promise. But before they could fully return to the task at hand, Agatha’s fingers brushed lightly along Rio’s waist, slipping beneath her shirt and lingering for just a beat longer than necessary. Rio’s breath hitched at the touch, a small smile tugging at her lips.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As dinner came together, Rio set the table while Agatha checked on Nicky in the living room. His giggles carried into the kitchen as Agatha pretended to wrestle one of his action figures away, her playful growl making Rio shake her head fondly.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">When the table was set and everything was ready, Rio leaned against the doorframe, watching the two of them. Agatha sat cross-legged on the floor, holding up a toy dragon while Nicky explained its magical powers with animated gestures. The sight warmed Rio’s heart in ways she still wasn’t entirely used to.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Alright, you two,” she called, her voice breaking through the moment. “Dinner’s ready. Dragons can wait.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Nicky jumped up, already bounding toward the dining table. “Is it the soup?” he asked excitedly.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Soup and your favorite garlic bread,” Rio confirmed as she ruffled his hair on his way past.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha rose more slowly, smoothing down her shirt. “We’re spoiling him, you know,” she said teasingly as she joined Rio.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio grinned, tilting her head toward the dining room. “And who insists on baking cookies with him every weekend?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Touché,” Agatha admitted with a smirk, brushing past Rio as they headed to the table. “But if my memory is correct, you’re the one who baked cookies with him the very first time you were in this house babysitting, right?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Guilty as charged. But look at him! Who could say no to this little face?” Rio said, pointing slightly towards where Nicky was settling in his chair at the table.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Over dinner, Nicky’s excitement about his drawings, the choir show, and his new idea for a comic book spilled out in an endless stream of chatter. Rio and Agatha listened attentively, laughing at his wild ideas and encouraging his creativity.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">At one point, as Rio reached for more bread, Nicky looked at her seriously. “Rio,” he said with his mouth full of soup, “can we do the dragons’ treehouse drawing together tomorrow? You’re really good at drawing trees.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio paused mid-reach, glancing at Agatha, whose amused gaze met hers. “Of course, buddy,” Rio replied, her voice warm. “We can do that after breakfast, while I work on my thesis.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Yay!” Nicky beamed, already launching into detailed plans for their masterpiece.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha leaned back in her chair, her gaze soft as it drifted between Rio and her son. Moments like these made her heart swell—this seamless, shared life they were building. She reached under the table, her fingers finding Rio’s and giving them a gentle squeeze.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio squeezed back without looking, though her small smile betrayed that she’d noticed. Dinner carried on with laughter and warmth, the three of them a perfect little team.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">*</p><p class="p1" align="justify">*</p><p class="p1" align="justify">*</p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T.S. Eliot. “The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets.)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning at the house was unusually quiet, a rarity that Agatha relished. She had just returned from dropping Nicky off at school and was now savoring the stillness with a steaming cup of tea in the living room. The faint hum of the kettle and the soft rustling of leaves from the numerous houseplants were the only sounds accompanying her as she mentally braced herself for the impending faculty meeting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tranquility was abruptly interrupted by the chime of the doorbell. Agatha frowned slightly at the unexpected visitor, setting her mug down with deliberate care. She smoothed her cardigan, already summoning the polite demeanor she kept ready for such intrusions, and walked to the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On the porch stood Professor Eleanor Crenshaw, an elder professor of the English department, cane in hand and an air of undeniable authority about her. Eleanor had a habit of arriving unannounced, as if the world operated on her schedule alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, Agatha,” Eleanor greeted, her voice warm but her eyes sharp, missing nothing. Her cane tapped lightly against the porch as she added, “I thought I’d offer you a ride to the meeting later. You’ve done so much for the department—consider it a small token of appreciation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s irritation was carefully masked behind a practiced smile. “How very thoughtful of you, Eleanor. Please, come in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor stepped inside with the measured grace of someone who expected her presence to command the room. Agatha closed the door behind her, already feeling the older woman’s gaze roving over every inch of her home. Eleanor’s sharp eyes lingered on the subtle yet unmistakable changes—a cozier warmth in the decor, the vibrancy brought by the abundance of houseplants, and most tellingly, the additional pair of shoes neatly lined by the door, and the unmistakable signs that a another presence had made its mark.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My, my,” Eleanor said, eyebrows raised. “Your home’s had quite the tranfsormation. It’s looking… different.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile didn’t waver, though she could feel the weight of Eleanor’s unspoken questions hanging in the air. “Life evolves, Eleanor,” she replied smoothly, her tone light yet firm. “Would you care for some tea?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s lips curved into the faintest of smiles, though it was impossible to tell whether it was one of approval or merely amusement. “That would be lovely, thank you,” she said, her tone suggesting she’d already decided it would be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha moved to the kitchen, she could feel Eleanor’s gaze lingering, quietly assessing, drawing conclusions she’d never voice outright. Agatha,played the good hostessa dn busied herself with preparing the tea, the clinking of cups and the whistle of the kettle filling the silence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Your plants are thriving,” Eleanor remarked idly from the living room, her voice carrying just enough weight to suggest she wasn’t simply commenting on the greenery. “I didn’t know you had a green thumb.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced over her shoulder with a serene smile. “Oh <em>I </em>don’t. They do brighten up the space, don’t they? A little bit of care goes a long way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And care is something you’ve always excelled at,” Eleanor mused, her tone laced with subtle implication. “Though it seems you’ve found new… inspirations.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha returned to the living room with two cups of tea, her smile unshaken. Handing one to Eleanor, she settled into her seat with an air of calm that matched the quiet strength of her words. “Inspiration comes in many forms, Eleanor. It’s what keeps life interesting, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Eleanor could respond, a voice called down from upstairs—Rio’s, light and casual, completely unaware of the scene unfolding below.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha, have you seen my green notebook? I think I left it in the living room!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air in the room seemed to shift. Eleanor’s expression froze mid-sip, her sharp gaze snapping to Agatha. For a brief moment, the older woman’s mask of polite curiosity faltered, replaced by an unmistakable flicker of suspicion as she recognized the voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Was that Miss Vidal I just heard?” Eleanor’s voice was measured, but the disbelief beneath it was palpable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, calm as ever, didn’t miss a beat. “Indeed, it was,” she replied smoothly, reaching for the teapot to refill Eleanor’s cup as if this was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Eleanor could probe further, Rio appeared at the top of the staircase. She was barefoot, dressed in leggings and an oversized sweater that hung slightly off one shoulder, her hair still damp and curling from a recent shower. She bounded down the stairs with the easy confidence of someone entirely at home, her voice trailing after her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I swear it was here yesterday—oh.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stopped abruptly mid-step, her gaze landing on Eleanor. A flicker of hesitation crossed her face, a subtle tightening of her posture, though she quickly smoothed it into a polite smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, Professor Crenshaw,” Rio greeted, her voice steady but tinged with a faint awkwardness. Her cheeks, however, betrayed her as a faint pink stain appeared over them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor blinked, her head tilting slightly, as if trying to fit an unexpected piece into an otherwise orderly puzzle. “Miss Vidal,” she said, her tone polite but laced with pointed curiosity. “I didn’t realize you were… here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes darted to Agatha, who was watching her with a soft, steady gaze that carried no apprehension—only quiet reassurance. It was enough to steady Rio, who took a breath and straightened her shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I just needed to grab my notebook,” Rio said, descending the remaining stairs and crossing the room. Spotting the notebook on the side table, she snatched it up quickly, then, without missing a beat, reached for Agatha’s mug and took a casual sip.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The gesture was so natural, so unselfconscious, that it seemed to hang in the air, a silent declaration that no explanation would be offered—or required.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s sharp gaze darted between the two women, her sharp mind clearly working to piece together the dynamics at play. The faint tension in the room was almost tangible, yet Agatha remained the picture of composure, her small smile suggesting she was entirely unbothered by the older woman’s scrutiny.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Placing her tea down with deliberate care, Agatha straightened in her seat, her tone calm and unyielding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal and I share this house now,” she said, her tone calm and composed. “We’ve chosen to keep our personal lives private—not secret, but private. The dean is fully aware of our situation, and we’ve taken every necessary measure to ensure professional boundaries remain intact. There is nothing unethical about our relationship.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s eyebrows shot up, clearly caught off guard by Agatha’s directness. “I see,” she said slowly, her tone more judgmental than curious. Her expression shifted as Agatha’s calm explanation settled over the room. Her brow furrowed deeply, and she shook her head, stepping back slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is not something I expected for you Agatha. This… this is entirely improper, Dr. Harkness,” she said sharply, her voice tight with indignation. “You’re her teacher, her <em>supervisor</em>, for goodness’ sake! Do you have any idea how this looks? It’s unprofessional, unethical, and frankly, it’s disgraceful. What kind of example does this set for your colleagues-or your students?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes narrowed slightly, but her voice remained steady. “Eleanor, I assure you, everything has been handled with complete transparency. Dean Montgomery is aware—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The dean shouldn’t have approved this!” Eleanor snapped, cutting her off. “And what about your boy? How does it feel for him, being part of this… arrangement? Have you considered what kind of confusion this might cause for young Nicholas? Children thrive on stability, not… impropriety.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the mention of Nicky, Rio’s knuckles whitened as she tightened her grip on her notebook. She stepped forward, her voice calm but edged with steel.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“With all due respect, Professor Crenshaw,” Rio said, her tone measured, “you know nothing about how Nicky feels or the kind of family we’ve built together. He’s happy, he’s loved, and he’s thriving.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s sharp gaze snapped to Rio, her lips thinning. “Miss Vidal, this isn’t about your feelings or your defenses. It’s about principles, about maintaining integrity in academia. This is not how things should be done.” She turned back to Agatha, her voice rising with frustration. “Agatha, you’ve always been a pillar of professionalism—a model for this institution. And now? To be entangled in something so… inappropriate. It’s a disappointment, plain and simple.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze hardened, her arms crossing over her chest. “Eleanor,” she said, her voice low but imposing, “you’re entitled to your opinions, but you don’t get to define what’s proper or ethical for me or my family. My personal life does not diminish my professional accomplishments, nor does it affect my ability to teach or mentor. And as for my son, Nicky is growing up in a home filled with love, respect, and stability—far more than many can claim. I would caution you against making unfounded assumptions about my life or my choices. I’m afraid you’ve misunderstood the situation entirely. This isn’t a whim or a reckless decision. It’s a relationship built on mutual repsect and care, and we’ve done everything by the book.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s voice was calm but unwavering, each word precise and deliberate. She stood tall, her posture radiating quiet authority, her eyes locking onto Eleanor’s with unflinching resolve. Before Eleanor could respond, Agatha pressed on, her tone cutting through the room like a blade.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This isn’t about appearances, Eleanor, or whatever narrative you’ve constructed in your mind. It’s about two <em>adults</em>navigating their lives with honesty and integrity, regardless of your discomfort with the concept.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s expression tightened, her lips a thin line of disapproval. “Honesty and integrity?” she repeated, her tone biting. “Agatha, you’re her supervisor. Whether you acknowledge it or not, that position comes with power, influence, and the potential for favoritism. This raises serious ethical concerns—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised a hand—not sharply, but with enough purpose to halt Eleanor mid-sentence. Her voice was steady but carried an edge of finality. “Those concerns have been addressed with diligence and transparency,” she said. “If you’d taken a moment to ask instead of rushing to judgment, you’d know that we disclosed our relationship to the dean before making any decisions about living together. I offered to remove myself from any direct involvement in Rio’s academic evaluations. The dean reviewed the situation and determined no such step was necessary.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, who had been standing silently beside Agatha, felt a surge of gratitude as she watched the older woman hold her ground. Straightening, she met Eleanor’s piercing gaze with her own, her voice calm yet resolute. “Professor Crenshaw, I’ve worked hard to ensure my work speaks for itself. If anyone doubts my abilities, they’re free to review my progress. Agatha has never shown me preferential treatment, and I wouldn’t accept it if she tried.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor scoffed, folding her arms tightly across her chest. “And I suppose you think that’s enough? That we should all just turn a blind eye and pretend this situation doesn’t compromise professional standards?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No one is asking you to turn a blind eye,” Agatha replied, her tone cooling further, her words deliberate. “We’re asking for respect—for the care we’ve taken to ensure our personal life doesn’t interfere with our professional responsibilities. I refuse to apologize for finding happiness, Eleanor, nor will I allow you to weaponize morality to undermine what we’ve built.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s face darkened further, her frustration battling against Agatha’s steady, unyielding presence. Her lips parted, as if searching for a sharp retort, but the words faltered under the weight of Agatha’s calm resolve. The silence that followed was thick with unspoken judgment, the tension in the room almost tangible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Eleanor exhaled sharply, shaking her head in a gesture of reluctant defeat. “You’ve changed, Agatha,” she said, her voice tinged with both disapproval and something almost wistful. “I don’t know what’s happened to you, but this… this isn’t the person I used to know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened just a fraction, her shoulders relaxing slightly, though her eyes remained sharp, unwavering. “People grow, Eleanor,” she replied, her tone steady yet laced with quiet warmth. “We learn, we adapt, and we discover what truly matters. Sometimes that means stepping outside the lines others have drawn for us. I’m sorry if that doesn’t align with your expectations, but I refuse to apologize for living authentically.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s gaze darted between Agatha and Rio, her disapproval as clear as the furrow in her brow, but no further argument seemed to come to her. She raised a hand in a half-hearted gesture of dismissal, shaking her head as though to rid herself of the moment entirely. “I’ve heard enough,” she muttered, her voice clipped.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She finally straightened, her expression tight. “I’ve made my stance clear,” she said briskly, reaching for her coat. “What you choose to do with it is up to you. But don’t be surprised when others aren’t as… understanding.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood as well, her composure unshaken. “Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Eleanor. I’ll let you see yourself out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without another word, Eleanor gathered her things and left, the door clicking shut behind her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A heavy silence settled over the house and the two women still standing in the living room, stretching between them like a thread pulled taut. Rio stood frozen, her chest tight, her mind replaying Eleanor’s words. Agatha, still staring at the door, remained unreadable, her hands loosely clasped in front of her. Finally, Rio broke the stillness, her voice tinged with strained humor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” she said, her tone light but strained. “That went great.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned to her, her sharp gaze softening as it landed on Rio’s troubled face. She closed the distance between them, resting her hands gently on Rio’s shoulders. “Eleanor is entitled to her opinion,” she said evenly. “But that doesn’t make it the truth.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a shaky breath. “I know we’re not doing anything wrong, but it still… stings. She didn’t even give us a chance to explain.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, brushing a stray strand of hair from Rio’s face. “It stings because she doesn’t know us. If she did, she’d see the truth. But what matters is that we know—and the people who care about us know too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned into Agatha’s touch, finding comfort in her unwavering calm. “It just feels so unfair,” she murmured. “Like we’re constantly defending something that’s we shouldn’t even have to hide.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, her lips brushing against Rio’s forehead in a quiet gesture of reassurance. “I know, love,” she said softly. “It’s exhausting. But we’ve stopped hiding, haven’t we? That’s progress. Let Eleanor and others like her think what they will—it doesn’t change the truth of what we have.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled slowly, the tension in her chest loosening under the steady strength of Agatha’s embrace. “Are <em>you</em> okay?” she asked softly, lifting her gaze to meet Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s shoulders relaxed as she looked at Rio, a small smile breaking through the tension. “I’m fine,” she said. “People like that will always have their opinions. What matters is what we know to be true.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her hand brushing against Agatha’s in silent support. “And we know we’re doing just fine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile widened slightly as she leaned in. “Better than fine, my love. Much better than fine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha, letting herself feel the weight of the moment before slowly letting it go. They might not have convinced Eleanor, but they didn’t need to. They had each other, and that was enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the faculty meeting later that day, Agatha walked into the conference room with her usual air of quiet authority. Her head was held high, her dark hair falling neatly over her shoulders, and her expression betrayed nothing of the morning’s incident. If anyone noticed the subtle tension in her jaw or the fleeting shadow in her eyes, they were polite enough not to comment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She scanned the room and immediately noticed Eleanor sitting at the far end of the table, chatting animatedly with another professor. Eleanor caught her eye for the briefest moment, then quickly turned away, focusing intently on her conversation as if Agatha weren’t even there. The slight was subtle but deliberate, a clear message that Eleanor wasn’t ready to let their earlier confrontation go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a flicker of irritation but tamped it down. <em>Let her stew,</em> she thought. <em>It’s not my job to manage her discomfort.</em>She moved to her usual seat near the center of the table, nodding cordially to a few colleagues who greeted her on the way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The meeting proceeded as usual, with discussions about upcoming curriculum changes, departmental budgets, and student engagement initiatives. Agatha contributed when necessary, her voice steady and professional, her points concise and well-articulated. She noticed, however, that Eleanor avoided looking in her direction entirely. Even when Agatha presented her input on a key issue, Eleanor directed her responses to another faculty member, blatantly circumventing her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was childish, Agatha thought, but not entirely surprising. Eleanor was clearly rattled, though she hadn’t said anything to anyone else—at least, not yet. Agatha hoped she’d keep it that way, though the morning’s encounter suggested Eleanor might not let this go without a fight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Across the table, Professor Graham, a senior member of the department and someone Agatha considered a reasonable colleague, leaned over during a lull in the discussion. “Everything alright with Eleanor?” he asked quietly, a note of concern in his voice. “She seems… off today.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled faintly, keeping her tone neutral. “I think she’s just having a tough morning,” she said, deflecting the question. “We all have them from time to time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Graham nodded, seeming satisfied with the answer, though his gaze lingered on Eleanor for a moment longer. Agatha couldn’t tell whether he was simply curious or already piecing together that something had shifted between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The meeting finally drew to a close, and as the faculty began filing out, Agatha deliberately lingered, gathering her things with measured precision. She caught snippets of idle chatter as her colleagues exchanged pleasantries and exited the room, but Eleanor’s silence was conspicuous. She brushed past Agatha without a word, her expression set in a mask of stony indifference, and disappeared out the door without even glancing back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed softly, adjusting her bag on her shoulder. <em>Let her sulk,</em> she thought. <em>As long as she keeps her opinions to herself, we’ll be fine.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, as she walked back to her office, her mind lingered on the interaction. Eleanor’s silence was preferable to open hostility, but it didn’t mean the issue was resolved. Agatha knew better than to underestimate her colleague. Eleanor’s moral indignation might simmer quietly for a while, but it had the potential to boil over if provoked—or if she found an audience willing to listen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha reached her office, she set her bag down carefully, leaning against her desk for a moment of stillness. The confrontation had been exhausting in a way she hadn’t fully registered until now. She ran a hand through her hair, exhaling deeply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her phone buzzed softly on the desk, breaking the quiet. A text from lit up the screen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong> <em>Rio</em> </strong> <em>: How’s it going? Hope you’re holding up. Love you.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small smile touched Agatha’s lips as she read the message. Despite everything, Rio’s unwavering support anchored her. She tapped out a quick response.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> <strong><em>Agatha</em></strong><em>: Nothing I can’t handle. Love you too.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For now, that was enough. She’d weather Eleanor’s judgment and whatever fallout came next, knowing she and Rio would face it together. Still, a part of her couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that Eleanor’s disapproval would perhaps mean they would need to brace for another storm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor Crenshaw arrived at her book club meeting that evening, her irritation from the morning still bubbling under the surface. The group met in a cozy, well-lit communal space lined with bookshelves, the aroma of freshly brewed tea and coffee filling the room. Lilia was already seated, flipping through the pages of the novel they were set to discuss, a peaceful smile on her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Evening, Eleanor,” Lilia greeted warmly as the older woman took a seat next to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor nodded stiffly, setting her bag down and smoothing her cardigan. “Evening Lilia. Though I must say, my day has been anything but pleasant.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s the matter?” Lilia asked, sipping her tea, her tone light but genuinely curious, always ready to help.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor huffed, leaning in conspiratorially. “I had quite the shock this morning, Lilia. It turns out one of our esteemed professors is carrying on an inappropriate relationship with her <em>PhD student</em>. And the worst is that they even live together apparently, so it’s happening under her own roof, with her child present! It’s utterly scandalous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s teacup paused midair as recognition flickered across her face. Her usually warm expression grew sharp, though she kept her tone even. “Oh? And what makes you think it’s inappropriate?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, she’s the student’s <em>supervisor</em>! It’s a clear conflict of interest,” Eleanor said, clearly feeling justified. “Not to mention what it must be like for her poor son, witnessing such a thing. And the <em>student</em>—don’t even get me started on her. You should have seen her, acting as if she owned the place when she is nothing but a child biting more than she can chew! It’s just not proper. She’s far too young for Agatha, and—well—it’s just wrong.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia placed her teacup back down on the table with a soft clink, her eyes narrowing slightly. The warmth in her gaze disappeared, replaced by a hard edge, but her tone remained steady and controlled. “Eleanor, I think you’re making quite a lot of assumptions about something you don’t fully understand.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor bristled. “Excuse me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“First,” Lilia began, her voice firm but controlled, “there’s nothing inappropriate about two consenting adults being in a relationship—especially when they’ve disclosed it to the proper authorities. Knowing Agatha, I’m confident she’s done exactly that.” She paused, letting the weight of her words settle. “Second, if we’re speaking of Rio Vidal—and I suspect we are—you should know she’s one of the brightest and most hardworking individuals I know, and she’s far from the meek, naïve and overreaching child you’re making her out to be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor opened her mouth, but Lilia raised a hand, her gesture both polite and commanding. “And third,” Lilia continued, leaning forward slightly, her tone taking on a razor-sharp edge, “if this relationship bothers you so much, I suggest you take a long, hard look at why that is. Because frankly, dear, this sounds less like concern and more like misplaced judgment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words landed like a slap, and for a moment, Eleanor stared, stunned into silence. Her face flushed with a mixture of embarrassment and defensiveness, the kind that often accompanied a jab too close to the bone. She struggled to maintain her composure, opening her mouth to respond but finding that no words would come out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You… know them?” Eleanor finally managed to croak, her voice now more uncertain than before, the edges of her anger slipping away under the weight of Lilia’s calm authority.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s lips curved into a small, tight smile, but her eyes remained sharp. “Yes, I do,” she said, her voice firm with a quiet strength. “You see, Rio is <em>my daughter</em>. I raised her when no one else would. And Agatha? She’s practically my daughter-in-law at this point. So, when you speak ill of them, you’re speaking ill of my family. And I won’t stand for it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s face drained of color. She opened and closed her mouth, trying to formulate some sort of defense, but the words stuck in her throat, caught in the sudden realization that Lilia was not someone she could dismiss or push around. The tables had turned completely, and she was no longer the one in control of the conversation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For several long moments, there was a tense silence between them, the air thick with unspoken truths and lingering tension. Eleanor’s hands twitched in her lap, and her gaze flickered nervously from Lilia to the teacup, as though seeking some escape from the uncomfortable confrontation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Eleanor could open her mouth to reply, Lilia continued, her voice unwavering. “Their relationship is built on respect, love, and honesty. It’s not for you—or anyone else—to decide what’s ‘proper.’ They’re not hurting anyone, and they’ve done everything by the book. Agatha is a wonderful mother, and Rio is stronger than you could possibly imagine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room was silent, the other book club members listening intently, some nodding in agreement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I suggest,” Lilia finished, “that instead of fuming over something that doesn’t concern you, you focus on your own life. And perhaps consider an apology to Agatha. She’s a good woman, and you owe her that much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment and anger, but she didn’t respond. Instead, she picked up her tea, drinking in silence for the remainder of the meeting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, for her part, leaned back in her chair, calm and composed. She had defended her family, and she knew she had done so well. She wasn’t a woman who let things slide easily, especially when it came to those she considered family. Agatha and Rio were under her protection, and anyone who dared speak ill of them would feel the weight of her disapproval. But as she looked down at her teacup, she couldn’t help but wonder how many more people would need to be reminded of the boundaries they were crossing, how many more challenges would arise from the ignorance and assumptions of those who thought they knew better.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the tension settled into the room, one of the other book club members, a kind woman named Marjorie, took the opportunity to steer the conversation. “It’s always a pleasure to hear about young Rio. She an amazing young woman.” she said, her voice light but genuine. “How’s she doing these days? I always enjoy hearing about her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s face softened immediately, her warmth returning as she smiled. “Oh, Rio’s doing wonderfully, thank you for asking, Marjorie. She’s in the final stages of her PhD now—writing her thesis. She’s been working so hard, and I couldn’t be prouder of her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s ears perked up, though she kept her expression carefully neutral, her hands clasped tightly in her lap.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s always been such a determined young woman,” Lilia continued, her voice brimming with affection. “Even as a teenager, she was relentless in pursuing her goals. And now, seeing her balance everything—her studies, her passions, even teaching children at the dance center—it’s remarkable. She’s truly blossomed into an incredible person.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Marjorie nodded enthusiastically. “That’s lovely to hear. And she teaches dance too? Such a creative spirit!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Lilia said with a proud chuckle. “She’s been dancing since she was a little girl, and it’s something that’s always brought her joy. She’s also playing with her band in her free time. Music, literature, dance—my Rio’s got a knack for bringing people together through her passions.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor, still silent, struggled to reconcile the image Lilia was painting of Rio with her own assumptions. The young woman she had seen earlier that day—confident and poised in Agatha’s home—suddenly seemed more layered, more grounded than Eleanor had given her credit for.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Marjorie added, “It sounds like you’ve done a wonderful job raising her, Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia gave a humble shrug, her smile tinged with emotion. “She’s done the hard work herself, really. But I’ll admit, I’m proud to have played a part in shaping the person she’s become. And now, seeing her in a loving relationship with someone who cherishes her—that’s all I’ve ever wanted for her. Agatha is amazing with her, always wanting the best for her, supporting her. And she has the most adorable son ever, if you could see them together, it’s like watching a Christmas movie sometimes. They both make each other better.” Lilia finished, with a pointed look towards Eleanor who was doing her best not to look at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At this, Eleanor shifted uncomfortably, her earlier indignation crumbling ever so slightly under the weight of Lilia’s words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The conversation shifted naturally to the book they were meant to discuss, leaving Eleanor quiet and reflective. She couldn’t shake Lilia’s words, nor the clear admiration in the room for Rio and her accomplishments.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the end of the meeting, as Eleanor gathered her things, her thoughts were a whirl of confusion and reluctant acknowledgment. Perhaps there was more to Rio Vidal—and to her relationship with Agatha—than she had allowed herself to see.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the members filtered out, Eleanor lingered by the door, adjusting her scarf with a pensive expression. Lilia noticed her hesitation and paused as well, her demeanor calm and open.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia,” Eleanor began hesitantly, her tone softer than before, “I still… I still don’t think it’s entirely appropriate. A professor and a student—it’s unconventional, to say the least. It doesn’t sit well with me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded slowly, not dismissive but measured. “I understand why it might seem that way, Eleanor. It’s not the usual path people take in relationships, and I can see how it might raise eyebrows, especially within the department. But I’ve seen them together, truly together, and I can tell you—there’s nothing improper or harmful about their relationship.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor frowned, folding her arms as she mulled this over. “But how can you be sure?  There must be a power imbalance somewhere. In my time…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyes hardened ever so slightly, her voice steady but firm as she cut Eleanor off. “You’re right—power dynamics can be tricky. But this isn’t a case of manipulation or exploitation. Rio is one of the most fiercely independent and self-aware people I know. She’s no stranger to adversity, and she wouldn’t be with someone who didn’t respect her autonomy. And Agatha… she’s steady, grounding. She supports Rio without ever overshadowing her or demanding anything from her. Their relationship is built on trust, not coercion.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor’s lips pressed into a thin line, but her posture seemed to relax ever so slightly. “I suppose… I suppose I can see your point. I know you Lilia and it’s clear you care about Rio deeply, and if you trust Agatha with this, that says something. Still, it’s hard for me to let go of my reservations.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia gave her a patient smile. “That’s fair. No one’s asking you to change your mind overnight. Just… give them the benefit of the doubt. Watch how they navigate this, and maybe you’ll see what I see—a partnership between equals, both lifting each other up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor sighed, her expression conflicted but not closed off. “I’ll try. That’s the most I can promise right now. But if I ever see anything that makes me question it…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ll bring it up, I’m sure,” Lilia said with a small, knowing smile. “And I wouldn’t expect anything less. Just keep an open mind, Eleanor. You might be surprised.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eleanor gave a reluctant nod before stepping out into the cool evening. “Goodnight, Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Goodnight, Eleanor,” Lilia replied, watching her walk away. As she closed the door behind her, she let out a soft sigh. Despite Eleanor’s lingering reservations, Lilia felt confident that time—and the undeniable bond between Rio and Agatha—would win her over in the end.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the cozy warmth of their shared home settled around them, Agatha sat at the kitchen table with her laptop open, her glassed perched on top of her nose. The soft glow of the setting sun filtered through the windows, casting a golden hue over the room. She sipped her tea slowly, the warmth of the cup settling her as she scrolled through her inbox. The quiet hum of the house and the soft sounds of Nicky playing upstairs was comforting, a stark contrast to the tension of the earlier faculty meeting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she saw Eleanor’s name pop up in the subject line, Agatha raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Eleanor had remained silent all afternoon, but Agatha knew better than to think the matter was settled. She clicked on the email, her fingers hovering over the keys as she read it carefully. Her expression shifted from guarded to mildly surprised as she processed the words. Eleanor’s email, though formal, was an unexpected mix of contrition and barely veiled challenge.</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> <em> </em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> <em> </em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify"><strong> <em>Subject:</em> </strong> <em> Apologies</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>      </em> <em>Dr. Harkness,</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>I have had time to reflect on our earlier conversation, and I feel that I may have been too quick to judge your personal life. I want to apologize for how I acted this morning. My reaction was inappropriate, and I didn’t take the time to listen or understand. I won’t interfere in your personal life or bring this up again. </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>However, I would still like to reiterate that I find your situation unconventional. If I see anything that I find improper or unprofessional, I will report it. I hope this clears the air and that you understand my concerns and that we can move forward with mutual respect.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>      Best regards</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>      Dr. </em> <em>Eleanor Crenshaw</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">Agatha sat back in her chair, a wry smile tugging at her lips. The email was as much a concession as it was a passive-aggressive critique, a classic example of Eleanor’s inability to fully let go of her judgment. She sipped her tea, her eyes narrowing slightly as she processed the words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, darling,” Agatha called out, her voice calm but tinged with something else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From the living room, Rio looked up from her book, her brow furrowed in a way that always made Agatha smile. “What is it, love?” she asked, her tone light, though there was a trace of concern in her voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gestured toward the seat beside her, an invitation that Rio didn’t hesitate to accept. She set her book aside with a soft thud and walked over to the table, the movement fluid and graceful as always, like the dancer she was. Agatha adjusted the laptop slightly, turning it so that Rio could read the email for herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat down, leaning in slightly as she read through the message, her expression flickering between amusement and disbelief. When she finished, she raised her eyebrows, her voice laced with a touch of sarcasm. “Well, isn’t that a diplomatic way to say ‘I’m still judging you but I’ll try to be nice about it’?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her eyes gleaming with something akin to amusement. “You’ve got that right. It’s Eleanor’s brand of apology: a mix of begrudging acknowledgment and thinly veiled criticism.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms with a smirk. “At least she’s not being completely hostile.”</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked faintly. “Not exactly an olive branch, but it’s better than nothing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her fingers drumming lightly on the table. “She’s clearly still not thrilled about us, but at least she’s not going to be a thorn in our side—unless we give her a reason.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not that we would,” Agatha said, her voice steady. She reached out, placing a reassuring hand over Rio’s. “We’ve been careful. Transparent. And frankly, we’ve done nothing wrong.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, a small smile creeping onto her face. “I know. But it’s still nice to have this little… resolution, I guess. I wasn’t worried, but it feels better knowing she’s stepping back.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her thumb brushing over Rio’s knuckles. “Exactly my thoughts. It’s not about fear—it’s about peace of mind.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in, resting her arm on Agatha’s shoulder. “You’re good at this, you know. Staying calm under pressure. Talking people down when they’re being ridiculous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, pressing a kiss to Rio’s shoulder. “It comes with age and wisdom, my love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio playfully nudged her. “Oh, so now you’re going to pull the age card?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Always when I need to,” Agatha teased, her voice warm. “But seriously, Eleanor’s email is just noise. What we have is real, and we know we’re doing it the right way. That’s what matters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, letting herself sink into the comfort of Agatha’s presence. “Yeah. That’s what matters.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed the laptop, their spirits lighter, and moved on with their evening, secure in the strength of their love and partnership.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p>*</p><p>*<br />

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding.”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On Friday night, in their shared bedroom, Rio stood in front of the full-length mirror, adjusting the leather jacket she’d thrown over her outfit. Tonight’s gig was at one of the livelier local bars, and she had dressed to impress—not that she ever needed to try. A green cropped top hugged her torso, exposing a tantalizing sliver of toned stomach, while high-waisted black jeans fit her like a glove, accentuating every curve. Her boots, scuffed but undeniably stylish, added an extra edge to the look, while silver jewelry shimmered with every movement, catching the light like a beacon, with among the many layered necklaces, the moon pendant Agatha has slipped around her neck the night of the gala and that she had worn every day since.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Behind her, Agatha leaned against the doorframe, arms folded over her chest in what might have passed for a casual stance—if not for the way her eyes were practically devouring Rio, pupils dark and blown wide, tracking every shift of her body with the kind of unfiltered hunger that sent a delicious thrill down Rio’s spine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her gaze tracked Rio’s movements with the kind of focus that made her heart race—a mix of adoration, desire, and pure helplessness at how effortlessly Rio attracted attention. Her blue eyes followed Rio’s every movement, from the way she adjusted her hair to the confident sway of her hips. She swallowed hard, her composure slipping just enough for a low hum of appreciation to escape her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pretended not to notice at first, continuing to adjust her hair, sliding rings onto her fingers, letting Agatha burn in her own torment for just a little longer. She bit back a smirk, but in the mirror, she caught the way Agatha swallowed hard, shifting on her feet, her knuckles tightening slightly where they pressed against her forearms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was usually composed. Collected. The controlled and dangerously intelligent Dr.  Harkness, the woman who could reduce grown men to fumbling messes with a single sharp remark.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But right now? Right now, she looked wrecked, just standing there watching.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Rio turned—slow, deliberate, torturous. She tilted her head, her smirk deepening, her voice rich with amusement and just a touch of sultry provocation. “Something on your mind, Dr. Harkness?” she teased, her voice playful but sultry, as if daring Agatha to put her thoughts into words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled, long and measured, but it did nothing to mask the gravel in her voice when she responded. “You.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just one word, but the weight of it sent heat curling low in Rio’s stomach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped forward, abandoning any pretense of restraint. Her movements were smooth, unhurried, but there was something prowling beneath them—a barely leashed intensity, like she was moments away from doing something reckless.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stopped just short of touching, her breath warm against Rio’s cheek. “Looking like that,” she murmured, voice like silk over steel, “it’s downright criminal. How am I supposed to let you leave the house?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, the sound warm and light as it filled the room. She crossed the distance between them in a few easy steps, her boots clicking softly against the hardwood floor. “You’re not supposed to <em>let</em> me do anything, Agatha. I’m a grown woman, remember?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers found her waist, skimming just beneath the hem of her shirt, tracing the bare skin with a touch so light it sent a shiver racing up Rio’s spine. “Oh, I remember,” she murmured, her voice dropping to something darker, something dangerous. Her grip tightened, her other hand coming up to cup the back of Rio’s neck, keeping her close. “But the way you’re testing my patience right now, love—I don’t think you do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, but she recovered quickly, pressing even closer, their bodies nearly flush. “Mm, is that right?” she mused, lips grazing the corner of Agatha’s mouth but never quite touching.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a slow, frustrated exhale. “You’re killing me here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do that a lot, don’t I?” Rio teased, though the slight tremor in her voice betrayed how much Agatha’s proximity was affecting her, too.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands slipped higher, fingers splaying over Rio’s ribcage beneath the thin fabric of her top. “I should just take this off you,” she muttered, her mouth trailing lower, lips grazing the shell of Rio’s ear, then lower still, pressing a slow, deliberate kiss to the sensitive spot beneath her jaw. “Cancel your little gig, keep you here all night. Make you beg for more.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sharp inhale Rio took was almost embarrassing. Almost. But she wasn’t about to let Agatha win that easily.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She placed her hands on her hips, her grin widening. “No, I’ve got a gig to play. The band’s counting on me, and you don’t want to deal with a pissed off Alice if I’m late.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers brushed against warm skin as she pulled Rio even closer. “The band might be counting on you,” she murmured, her lips grazing the shell of Rio’s ear, “but they don’t have to deal with the torture of watching you walk out of here like this.” She punctuated her words with a soft kiss just below Rio’s ear, a deliberate, slow kiss that left Rio momentarily breathless.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shivered but quickly recovered, placing her hands on Agatha’s chest to push her back gently. “Easy there, Professor. We don’t have time for this right now,” she said, her tone playful but firm. “I’ve got to get to the bar, and so do you. You’re my designated groupie tonight, remember?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, though her hands lingered at Rio’s waist, reluctant to let go. “Groupie? Is that what we’re calling it now?” she teased, her smirk sharp but affectionate. “I thought I was your <em>manager.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, leaning up to press a quick, teasing kiss to Agatha’s lips, quickly followed by several other ones punctuating every word. “Manager, groupie, partner, professor, girlfriend, lover—whatever helps you sleep at night. But right now, you need to let me go, or I’m going to be late.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out an exaggerated sigh but released her hold, her hands falling to her sides with deliberate slowness. “Fine,” she said, though her tone carried a subtle edge of mischief. “But just so you know, I’ll be counting down the hours until we get back home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio slung her bag over her shoulder and winked. “Good. Because once tonight’s over, I’ll be all yours. Promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk deepened, her gaze following Rio as she moved toward the door. “You’d better keep that promise, Miss Vidal. Or I might have to think of a way to get back at you for teasing me like this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned at the doorway, her eyes sparkling with amusement. “Wouldn’t dream of breaking it, Dr. Harkness.” She shot Agatha one last playful look before disappearing down the hall, the sway of her hips deliberate and maddeningly enticing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Left alone, Agatha exhaled slowly, running a hand through her hair as she tried to steady herself. “How does she manage to do this to me every single time?” she muttered under her breath, her lips quirking in a mix of frustration and adoration. She grabbed her coat, shaking her head as she prepared to support her partner for the evening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As much as she enjoyed watching Rio shine on stage, the thought that Rio would come home with her at the end of the night was enough to make her heart skip a beat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bar was alive with energy, a steady hum of conversation mingling with bursts of laughter and the rhythmic clink of glasses. The warm, golden glow of overhead lights bounced off polished wood surfaces, adding to the cozy, electric atmosphere. As the band began setting up on stage, the room’s energy shifted, the low murmur of voices giving way to eager anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat at a small table near the back, cradling a glass of wine between her fingers. She had chosen her spot carefully—close enough to enjoy a perfect view of the stage but far enough to avoid the crush of the crowd gathering near the front. Her eyes, however, never strayed from Rio, who was setting up her drum kit with a fluidity and confidence that betrayed years of practice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dressed in the effortlessly edgy outfit that drove Agatha crazy, Rio exuded a magnetic presence. The cropped top and leather jacket seemed almost like armor, her confidence shining brighter with every move. As she tightened the snare and adjusted the cymbals, she ran a hand through her hair, causing a few strands to fall casually across her face. Agatha’s gaze lingered on that small, unintentional gesture, her heart fluttering at the sight. The air of focus around Rio made her even more captivating, a quiet intensity that Agatha knew could explode into raw energy the moment the music started.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of the band was no less engaging in their own way. Alice had finished setting up her keyboard and was currently adjusting her mic stand, her easy laughter carrying over the noise of the crowd. She exchanged playful banter with a group of regulars at the front, her natural charisma drawing people in like moths to a flame. Agatha couldn’t help but notice how effortlessly Alice owned the room, her warmth a perfect contrast to Jen’s quieter but equally strong presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen stood off to the side, her electric guitar slung low across her hips. She strummed a few experimental chords, each one sending ripples of excitement through the air. The crowd’s attention sharpened, heads turning toward the stage with renewed interest. Jen’s sharp eyes, however, weren’t scanning the crowd—they were stealing glances at Alice, with a subtle, affectionate and loving smile that softened her otherwise cool demeanor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But for Agatha, there was only Rio. Even surrounded by her bandmates, Rio’s presence was magnetic, a force Agatha couldn’t resist. As Rio bent slightly to adjust a pedal, the light caught the silver chains she wore around her neck, the shimmer pulling Agatha’s thoughts into dangerous territory. She took a sip of her wine, as though the cool liquid could temper the warmth blooming in her chest. It didn’t help.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The crowd around her grew restless, their excitement building as the band’s setup neared completion. The buzz of anticipation was almost palpable, and Agatha could feel the contagious energy pulling her into the moment. Yet, her focus remained entirely on Rio—on the way her fingers drummed absentmindedly against the edge of her snare, her head nodding slightly to a beat only she could hear. Agatha knew that beat would soon ignite the entire room, but for now, it was a private rhythm, a glimpse into the world Rio carried within her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio finally looked up, her gaze sweeping the room as she did a quick mental check of her setup. Her eyes found Agatha almost immediately, as if drawn by some invisible thread. A grin spread across her face, equal parts teasing and affectionate, and she gave a small, subtle wave. Agatha raised her glass in acknowledgment, her lips curving into a smile that was meant only for Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a small moment, unnoticed by anyone else in the bustling bar, but it was theirs. And in that fleeting connection, Agatha felt the kind of exhilaration that no stage performance could replicate. This was her Rio—bold, talented, and utterly magnetic. And tonight, she would get to watch her shine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the band finally launched into their first song, the atmosphere in the bar transformed. The low hum of chatter was replaced by an electric current that seemed to ripple through the room as the music took hold. The opening chords of Jen’s guitar rang out, sharp and soulful, cutting through the air like a call for attention. Alice’s voice followed, smooth and rich, wrapping around the audience like a warm embrace, while Rio’s drumming drove the heartbeat of the song—a steady, powerful rhythm that anchored everything together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha could feel the shift as if the room itself was breathing in time with the music. Her wine sat untouched on the table as her attention locked entirely on Rio. It wasn’t just her skill—it was the way she played, the sheer passion radiating from her every movement. Rio’s hands moved with a precision born of years of practice, her drumsticks blurring as they struck the kit with a controlled intensity that seemed effortless.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her whole body was immersed in the performance, from the slight sway of her shoulders to the rhythmic tapping of her boot against the pedal. Rio didn’t just play the drums; she became part of them, her movements fluid and instinctive, her focus absolute. Her cropped top had shifted slightly with the effort, revealing more of her toned stomach, and strands of her dark hair fell over her forehead, framing her flushed face. She looked fierce, untamed, and utterly captivating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand as her gaze followed every motion, utterly mesmerized. The energy Rio poured into her performance was palpable, a force that seemed to draw Agatha in and hold her there. She could feel the bass vibrating through the floorboards, could hear the cheers and whistles from the crowd, but it all seemed distant compared to the hypnotic pull of Rio on stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Occasionally, Rio would glance up from her drum kit, her eyes scanning the crowd briefly until they found Agatha. The instant their gazes met, Rio’s lips curved into a grin, equal parts playful and affectionate, as if to say, <em>This one’s for you.</em>Agatha felt her heart skip each time, the connection between them cutting through the noise and chaos like a direct line.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re incredible,” Agatha murmured, her voice inaudible over the music. She knew Rio couldn’t hear her, but it didn’t matter. She just needed to say it, to let the words escape as her chest swelled with pride and love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The crowd was already caught in the band’s spell, swaying to the rhythm, their cheers growing louder with each transition in the song. Alice commanded the mic, her voice soaring effortlessly as Jen added intricate riffs that seemed to dance around her vocals, and Rio drove the energy, her drumming building in intensity, carrying the band to an electrifying crescendo that left the room breathless.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the final beat of the song hit, the bar erupted in applause and cheers. Rio tossed her hair back, her grin wide and exhilarated as she raised one drumstick in the air in acknowledgment. Agatha couldn’t help but join in the applause, her heart pounding as if she’d been part of the performance herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the band launched into their next song, Agatha found herself leaning back in her chair, her smile soft but unshakable. There was something profoundly beautiful about watching Rio in her element, seeing her passion laid bare for everyone to witness. It was raw, unfiltered, and entirely Rio. And for that moment, Agatha felt like the luckiest woman in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before the band began their next song, Alice stepped up to the mic, her signature cheeky grin lighting up her face. The crowd quieted just enough to hear her voice as she addressed them with an easy charm that made it feel like she was speaking directly to each person in the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“All right, folks,” she began, her fingers lightly tapping the mic stand. “This next one’s a special treat—it’s brand new.” A ripple of excitement passed through the audience, punctuated by cheers and whistles. Alice let the noise build for a moment before continuing, her grin widening. “It’s dedicated to anyone who’s ever looked at someone and thought, ‘Wow, they’re the best thing I’ve ever had.’ You know that feeling, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The crowd responded with a chorus of enthusiastic shouts and claps.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice chuckled, her eyes twinkling as she added, “Now, here’s a little inside scoop for you. All three of us—your beloved ‘Three of Swords’—definitely know this feeling all too well. So, we thought, why not turn it into a song and share it with you?” She threw a playful glance over her shoulder at Jen and Rio, who both laughed along with the crowd.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, sitting at her table near the back, chuckled softly as well. She caught the quick, knowing glance Rio shot her way from behind the drum kit, her dark eyes sparkling with mischief. Agatha’s lips curved into a smile, her heart skipping at the subtle exchange.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Alice stepped back and gave a nod, the music began. Rio’s drums came in first, setting a steady, sultry beat that drew the room’s collective attention like an irresistible force. The rhythm pulsed through the air, a perfect foundation for Jen’s dreamy guitar melody to weave over the top. Alice’s voice soon joined, smooth and evocative, carrying lyrics that felt both deeply personal and universally relatable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the song built toward its chorus, the energy in the room shifted. The lyrics spoke of love so intense it felt like gravity, a pull so strong it was impossible to resist. Agatha couldn’t help but feel like the words were meant for her. She swayed along with the beat, her smile growing wider with each verse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the song reached its crescendo, Jen’s guitar soared, Alice’s voice rang out with raw emotion, and Rio’s drumming drove it all home with a fierce, unrelenting energy that brought the audience to their feet. The bar erupted in applause as the final note rang out, and Agatha found herself clapping harder than anyone else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice stepped back to the mic, her cheeks flushed from the performance. “Thank you! You guys are amazing!” she called out, earning another wave of cheers. Then, with a sly grin, she added, “And if you felt like that song hit a little too close to home, well… good. That’s the point.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The crowd laughed and cheered again, and Agatha felt a rush of pride as she watched Rio exchange a triumphant high-five with Alice. For a moment, Rio’s eyes found Agatha’s again, and she mouthed something that looked suspiciously like, <em>All for you.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled, and she couldn’t help but smile back. She didn’t need words to respond; the look in her eyes said it all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On stage, Rio stood from behind her drum kit, brushing her hair out of her face with an easy, confident grin. Alongside Alice and Jen, she gave an exaggerated bow, the three of them basking in the adoration of the crowd.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the band began packing up their equipment, Agatha remained at her table, reluctant to disturb the moment. Watching Rio perform had been like witnessing pure magic, and she found herself replaying the set in her mind—the energy, the skill, the way Rio had commanded the stage with every beat of her drums. She couldn’t wait to tell her just how incredible she’d been.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped off the stage, her presence captivating even in the post-performance chaos. The crowd was still abuzz, and several people gravitated toward her and the other band members almost instantly. Agatha sipped the last of her wine, her gaze following Rio as she was approached by a small group lingering near the stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The group consisted of two women and a man, all of whom seemed utterly enamored with Rio. One of the women, a brunette in a leather jacket, leaned in close, her voice too soft to be heard over the residual noise, but her posture was unmistakably engaging. The man beside her nodded enthusiastically at whatever Rio said, his laughter coming too easily, while the second woman—a striking redhead—hovered just behind them, her eyes never leaving Rio’s face. Their admiration was palpable, their attention bordering on outright flirtation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha remained at her table, swirling the last of her wine with deliberate ease, her outward demeanor a perfect picture of calm. But her sharp eyes betrayed her true feelings, narrowing slightly every time one of the women hovering near Rio leaned in too close or touched her under the pretense of congratulating her. Agatha’s gaze tracked every movement, every overzealous smile, every light touch that lingered just a fraction longer than necessary.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The brunette with the saccharine smile and an air of practiced charm, was especially persistent. She laughed at something Rio said, her laugh too loud, too eager, and placed her hand on Rio’s shoulder. It was a casual gesture on the surface, but the way her fingers lingered betrayed her intent. Agatha’s grip tightened slightly on her wine glass as she took a slow, measured sip, her lips twitching downward in the faintest frown.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Despite the brunette’s overtures, Rio’s body language was relaxed but firmly neutral. She accepted the congratulations with a polite smile and nodded along as the small group vied for her attention, but there was no real engagement, no reciprocation in her posture. If anything, she seemed mildly amused by the whole interaction, as if humoring a group of overeager fans.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">What soothed Agatha most, however, were the subtle, searching glances Rio kept sending her way. Every few moments, Rio’s eyes would flicker across the room, scanning the crowd until they found Agatha. And when they did, her expression would shift just slightly—a small quirk of her lips, a barely perceptible lift of her brow that seemed to say, <em>Still with me?</em> It was a quiet reassurance, a tether that connected them despite the noise and chaos around them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a faint smirk. Oh, she was still with her, all right. And she wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The brunette leaned in again, this time brushing her hair over her shoulder in what was clearly meant to be a coquettish gesture. Agatha’s eyes narrowed further as she leaned back in her chair, her fingers tapping idly against the stem of her glass. She wasn’t the jealous type—she trusted Rio implicitly—but that didn’t mean she had to enjoy watching someone blatantly overstep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, always one to sense the subtle undercurrents in a room, appeared beside Agatha with two drinks in hand, Jen following close behind. She flashed Agatha a knowing grin as she slid one of the glasses toward her, replacing her now empty wine glass. “You good, Agatha?” she asked, her tone teasing but laced with a slight concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced up at her, one eyebrow arching as she reached for the drink. “Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?” she replied, the words coming out a touch too sharp, a little too quick.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smirked knowingly, leaning back slightly in her chair. “Oh, no reason. Just thought I’d check, seeing as how your girlfriend over there is currently being adored by her little fan club.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze flicked back to Rio, who was still surrounded by the group of admirers. The sight of the woman leaning in a little too close, laughing a bit too loudly, was enough to make Agatha’s stomach tighten in a way she wasn’t entirely comfortable with. Her fingers curled around the glass in her hand, her grip tightening as she tried to mask her growing discomfort. “She’s hardly encouraging them,” Agatha muttered, her voice betraying a flicker of irritation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“True,” Alice agreed with a nod, settling herself into the chair beside Agatha and crossing her legs. “But still, it’s kind of cute seeing you jealous. Very unflappable Dr. Harkness, rattled by a couple of groupies.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not jealous,” Agatha said, her tone cool and controlled. But the sharpness of her response and the way she absentmindedly tapped her fingers against the side of her glass said otherwise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Uh-huh,” Alice said, her grin widening as she leaned back and took a sip of her own drink. “If you say so.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shot Alice a sidelong glance, her lips pressing into a thin line as she held her gaze for a moment longer than necessary. But before she could come up with a retort—something biting, something that would leave Alice without a comeback—Rio finally managed to escape the small crowd. She waved off the lingering group with a polite but firm smile, her movements graceful and unhurried.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio made her way toward the table, Agatha’s heart skipped a beat. The moment their eyes met, Rio’s face lit up, a genuine smile blooming across her features. The light in her eyes seemed to reach Agatha from across the room, making all the noise, all the attention, fade into the background. The way Rio’s entire demeanor shifted when she saw her, how she moved with a quiet confidence, told Agatha everything she needed to know: <em>She’s mine and I’m hers.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small sigh of relief escaped Agatha’s lips before she could stop it. Rio’s presence was like a balm, soothing the tension that had been building since the moment the first admirer had sidled up to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned down to kiss Agatha’s cheek, her lips soft but lingering, in stark contrast to the fiery energy she had just poured into her performance. “Hey, gorgeous,” Rio greeted, her voice a low murmur that somehow cut through the ambient noise of the bar, wrapping Agatha in a cocoon of warmth. She rested her hands on the edge of the table, on either side of Agatha, her gaze lingering on her partner with a quiet intensity. “Enjoy the show?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t stop the smile that tugged at her lips, despite herself. “You were incredible,” she said, her voice softer than she had intended, her eyes warm as they followed the movement of Rio’s hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio straightened, her gaze narrowing slightly as she took in the subtle shift in Agatha’s posture, the way her shoulders had tensed ever so slightly. “Everything okay?” she asked, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s as she leaned closer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha quickly masked her emotions, reclaiming her composure like she always did. “Of course,” she said smoothly, her voice as steady as ever. “Just enjoying the atmosphere.” But there was something in her eyes that Rio immediately saw—an unease, a fleeting tension that didn’t belong.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, studying Agatha for a moment, the wheels in her mind turning. Then, with a knowing glint in her eyes, she smirked. “Did those people bother you?” she asked, the playfulness in her tone softening just enough to show she wasn’t dismissing the subtle undercurrent she had picked up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha huffed lightly, the corners of her lips quirking upward. “Hardly. They were harmless,” she replied, though her words didn’t quite match the slight hardness in her voice. She wasn’t rattled, not exactly, but the way those admirers had hovered around Rio had gnawed at something inside her, an instinct to protect that she couldn’t ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s grin deepened, and she leaned closer, her breath warm against Agatha’s ear, sliding on her lap. “You know you’re the only one I care about, right? Always.” Her voice was low and filled with a quiet promise, as though reminding Agatha that her heart was forever tethered to hers, regardless of how many admirers might surround her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened, the knot of jealousy unravelling as Rio’s words washed over as she snaked her arms around her waist, her touch gentle, almost reverent. “I know,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “You were phenomenal. I couldn’t take my eyes off you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s grin widened, a faint flush creeping up her neck at the unexpected praise. “Careful, Professor Harkness,” she teased, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “Flattery like that might go straight to my head.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in just a little, her voice dropping into a teasing murmur. “I think you’ve earned it,” she said, her words light but filled with sincerity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, love,” Rio replied, her smile turning tender as she planted another quick kiss on Agatha’s cheek. She straightened then, her expression shifting into a more playful one as she backed away slightly. “Now, let me pack up, and we can head home. I believe I made you a promise earlier.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, the last of her earlier irritation fading as Rio’s energy enveloped her once more. “Don’t keep me waiting too long, Miss Vidal,” she said with a raised brow, her voice playful but laced with an undeniable longing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio winked, a mischievous sparkle in her eyes, before she turned on her heel and headed back toward the stage. Her presence lingered in the air, leaving Agatha with a smile that seemed to shine brighter with every second. As Rio mingled with the last of the fans and gathered her things, Agatha let herself settle into the quiet contentment that only Rio could bring, her heart still fluttering from the closeness they’d shared in that moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Even as the noise of the crowd ebbed away, Agatha’s smile stayed with her, a warm reminder that, no matter the noise, no matter the world outside, Rio was always hers. And that was all that mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as the front door closed behind them, Agatha couldn’t wait another second. The click of the door barely echoed before she had Rio in her arms, her body instinctively pulling Rio close as she turned her around and pressed her gently against the doorframe. Her hands settled on Rio’s waist, the warmth of her touch instantly grounding her. Without a word, Agatha’s lips captured Rio’s in a kiss that was equal parts fiery passion and tender devotion, a perfect reflection of everything Agatha had been holding in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s soft laugh vibrated through the kiss, her hands lifting to rest on Agatha’s shoulders, her fingers grazing over the fabric of her clothes as if memorizing every curve and line. “Well, hello to you too,” Rio teased breathlessly, her voice a soft tremor against Agatha’s lips, the playful edge in her words belying the heat that simmered between them. “Careful, you’ll wake Nicky up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please, that boy could sleep through a nuclear apocalypse.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled back just enough to look into Rio’s eyes, her own gaze darkened with an intensity that could only come from the depths of the emotions she was feeling. Her breath was steady but low, a hint of vulnerability in the way her lips parted as she searched Rio’s face for any sign of doubt. But there was none. There never was. “You’re mine,” Agatha whispered, her voice steady but laden with a possessiveness that was pure and unapologetic. “You know that, right? I don’t care who looks at you, who flirts with you, who dreams about you—you’re mine, Rio Vidal.” The words hung heavy in the air, a promise and a declaration, a truth Agatha needed to make clear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s teasing expression melted away in an instant, her features softening, her eyes locking with Agatha’s. She reached up to cup Agatha’s face, her thumb gently sweeping across her cheek in a soothing motion that made Agatha’s heart race. “Always, Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice low and sincere, as though there was no one else in the world but the two of them. “I’m yours. Completely.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And that was all the invitation Agatha needed. Without another word, she leaned in again, her lips pressing against Rio’s with an urgency that spoke of everything she couldn’t say in that moment. Every ounce of love, of desire, of longing poured into the kiss, a kiss that was both tender and searing in its depth. Rio responded immediately, her hands threading into Agatha’s hair, pulling her closer, their bodies aligning as they deepened the kiss, lost in the heat and passion that swirled around them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The world outside didn’t matter anymore. There was only the feeling of Rio in her arms, the sound of their breath mingling, and the way their hearts beat in perfect sync. Time seemed to stretch out, every second an eternity as they kissed with a hunger that was only ever satisfied when they were together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands roamed with deliberate slowness over Rio’s body, exploring the feel of her curves, the soft fabric of her outfit—an outfit that had driven her mad all evening. She could still feel the tension that had built up as she watched Rio move on stage, the subtle allure in every motion, the way the crowd had gravitated toward her. And yet, Rio had been hers all along. “This outfit,” Agatha murmured, her voice low and thick with desire as her lips brushed against Rio’s and she slipped her hand underneath the damn crop top to place her hand high in Rio’s torso, “was torture. Watching you all night, knowing they were looking at you, wanting you… all while I had the privilege of knowing exactly who you were going home with.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved into a teasing smirk, her fingers sliding down the length of Agatha’s arms as she let her explore her chest, leaving a trail of warmth behind and making Rio moaned slightly, throwing her head back to give her more access. “Well, I wore it for you, you know. Their attention wasn’t exactly my goal, only yours.” Her voice was playful, but Agatha could hear the underlying truth in it—Rio had dressed to captivate only her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s growl rumbled low in her throat, dark and possessive, more instinct than thought. Rio barely had time to react before she was swept off her feet, Agatha lifting her with effortless strength. A delighted laugh bubbled from Rio’s lips, breathless and teasing as she clung to Agatha’s shoulders, her legs wrapping naturally around Agatha’s waist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Someone’s feeling assertive tonight,” Rio teased, her lips brushing against Agatha’s ear, her fingers threading through thick waves of dark hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t answer—not with words, at least. She walked them straight to the bedroom, her grip firm but careful, her body radiating heat and intent. The door swung shut behind them with a soft click, sealing them away from the rest of the world. And then, without ceremony, Agatha tossed Rio onto the bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gasped as she bounced slightly against the mattress, her head tilting up just in time to see Agatha stalking toward her, the flicker of candlelight catching in her dark eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What are you doing?” Rio asked, though her breathlessness betrayed that she already knew the answer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha climbed over her in a fluid motion, caging Rio beneath her, pinning her wrists to the mattress with a grip that sent shivers down her spine. She leaned in, lips hovering just above Rio’s, teasing her with the mere ghost of a touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Reminding you,” Agatha answered, her voice soft but carrying a note of command that sent a shiver down Rio’s spine. She hovered above her, her gaze intense, the depth of her love and possessiveness clear in her eyes. “Reminding you that you’re mine. And I’ll never let you forget it.” The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, her pulse pounding in her throat. Agatha’s control, her confidence, the sheer power she exuded—it made Rio dizzy in the best way. She swallowed hard, licking her lips before whispering, “I don’t need reminding.” The tremor in her voice betrayed her, though, and Agatha smirked knowingly. “But I won’t stop you if that’s what you want and need.” The admission was barely audible, but it carried all the weight of Rio’s own desires and understanding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes darkened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, love,” she murmured, pressing her lips just below Rio’s ear, letting the words ghost over her skin. “What I want is to ruin you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound that escaped Rio was somewhere between a sigh and a gasp, her back arching instinctively as Agatha moved lower, her lips curling as she leaned down to kiss the soft skin of Rio’s jaw, trailing her lips down her neck with the utmost care, before moving lower as Rio moaned lowly. She savored each movement, each kiss a promise, each touch a way of marking her in the most intimate of ways. The urgency was there, but it was tempered by the unspoken depth of their bond, the trust between them that allowed them to savor each moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s body responded instinctively, her hands threading through Agatha’s hair, pulling her closer as their kisses deepened, more fervent, more passionate with each passing second. The air was thick with desire, the world outside fading into nothingness as they celebrated each other—not just physically, but emotionally, spiritually. There was no room for doubt, no room for insecurity; they were together, completely and utterly. And in that moment, nothing else mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Clothes fell away, lost somewhere between sighs and laughter, between teasing bites and desperate hands. There was no distance left between them, no space untouched. Agatha was all over Rio’s body, ravishing it with her with kisses, grazes of her tongue and teeth like she was something to be savored, something exquisite, something worth taking her time with. And Rio—Rio gave back just as fiercely, returning every gesture with an equal intensity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they finally collapsed together, tangled in damp sheets and lingering heat, the air still buzzed with the remnants of their pleasure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hours later, they lay tangled in each other’s arms, the room bathed in the soft glow of moonlight. Rio lay draped against Agatha’s chest, utterly spent, her body still thrumming with satisfaction. She let out a sigh of contentment, pressing a lazy kiss to the warm skin just beneath Agatha’s collarbone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you,” Rio murmured, her voice a sleepy whisper against the soft rise and fall of Agatha’s chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed a kiss to the top of her head, her fingers idly tracing small circles on Rio’s back. “I love you too, <em>my</em> Rio,” she replied, her voice thick with affection. Her eyes closed, the sound of Rio’s heartbeat steadying her own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they drifted into a peaceful sleep, the world outside ceased to exist, leaving only the warmth of their love, their quiet promises, and the unspoken certainty that, come morning, they would do it all over again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">                  (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding.” <em>Four Quartets.)</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">One quiet Saturday afternoon, Rio and Agatha had decided it was finally time to tackle the house’s basement, a task they’d been putting off for weeks. The goal: clear enough space to move the last of Rio’s belongings from Lilia’s house, where they’d been patiently waiting for their owner to retrieve them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned against the doorframe at the top of the stairs, arms crossed as she watched Rio descend first. The wooden steps creaked slightly under her weight, and the faint hum of the flickering basement light added a layer of nostalgia to the otherwise mundane task.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Rio called back over her shoulder, her voice laced with humor, “if I’m doing this, I think I deserve veto power over anything questionable down here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, pushing off the doorframe and following her down. “Questionable? I’ll have you know everything in this basement has been carefully curated. It’s all perfectly respectable. Well,” she paused, a playful glint in her eyes, “except for maybe that one box of old Christmas ornaments. Those might actually be possessed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, flipping the light switch and illuminating the organized chaos before them. The basement was a maze of mismatched boxes, old furniture, and forgotten knick-knacks, the kind of space that told the story of a life well-lived. She crouched by a pile of unlabeled boxes, curiosity sparking in her gaze. “All right, let’s see what we’re working with.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They dove into the task with a shared rhythm, sorting items into piles: keep, donate, and discard. Agatha took the opportunity to play the curator, explaining the backstory of certain items, while Rio brought her clever commentary to the process.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">About twenty minutes in, Rio pulled out a dusty, framed photo from one of the boxes and froze. Her lips quirked into a mischievous grin as she held it up for Agatha to see. “Care to explain this?” she asked, her tone mock-serious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced over and immediately groaned, covering her face with one hand. The photo showed a much younger version of herself – maybe fifteen or sixteen - sporting an absurdly oversized hat, her expression a mix of forced enthusiasm and embarrassment. “That,” she began, her voice heavy with mock exasperation, “was a teenage phase. A short-lived attempt to join a local history reenactment group, just to get away from home for a while. The hat was mandatory, and let me tell you, it weighed a ton.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio burst into laughter, holding her sides as she set the photo carefully to the side. “Oh, this is a keeper. Forget the basement—it’s going on the mantle.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Absolutely not,” Agatha said, narrowing her eyes playfully as she reached for another box. “Over my dead body.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, clearly relishing the banter. “We’ll see about that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they continued, Rio unearthed a series of quirky items: an ancient, battered teapot that Agatha claimed once belonged to her grandmother, a set of mismatched candlesticks, and a collection of handwritten letters tied together with a faded ribbon. Each discovery led to a story, a laugh, or a playful jab.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">An hour in, they’d made significant progress, the basement was looking far less chaotic, and both women were covered in dust and slightly out of breath. Agatha stretched, arching her back with a satisfied sigh. “Not bad, Vidal. We might just make an adult out of you yet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but smiled, brushing her hands off on her jeans. “You know, this wasn’t half as bad as I thought it’d be. Even if your basement is basically a treasure trove of questionable life choices.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, tossing a balled-up piece of newspaper at her. “Keep that up, and I might reconsider letting you move in your <em>own</em> stuff.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio dodged the paper, grinning as she stood and offered Agatha a hand to move to the next box. “Come on, let’s finish up. We’ve got space to clear and memories to make.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they worked through another pile of boxes, Agatha reached for a smaller one tucked neatly into a corner. The handwriting on the label—her own—read: <em>“Nicky - Baby Stuff.”</em> She smiled for a moment before pulling it out and setting it on the floor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, perched nearby and wiping dust off her hands, noticed immediately. Her eyes lit up with curiosity. “Oh, now this I <em>have</em> to see.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “It’s nothing exciting. Just sentimental clutter.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio scooted closer, practically bouncing with enthusiasm. “Sentimental clutter is the <em>best</em> kind. Don’t hold out on me.” She reached for the lid, glancing at Agatha for permission. When Agatha nodded, Rio carefully opened the box, and her excitement softened into something warmer. Inside was a collection of tiny folded clothes, soft blankets, and a few well-loved toys.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached for the first item on top, a pale blue onesie with little embroidered clouds. She held it up, her expression a mix of delight and disbelief. “He was <em>this</em> small? I can’t even wrap my head around it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her eyes softening as she traced a finger over the fabric. “He was tiny. He was born a little early, so even this was too big for him at first. I remember rolling up the sleeves so his little hands wouldn’t get lost in them.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s brows furrowed, her curiosity piqued. “What was he like as a baby? I bet he was adorable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Settling back onto her heels, Agatha’s gaze turned distant, filled with a tender kind of nostalgia. “Quiet, at first. He had this way of staring at people, like he was trying to figure out the whole world before he even got started. And when he laughed…” Her voice softened further, and a small, wistful smile graced her lips. “That sound could light up a room. I used to do the most ridiculous things just to hear it again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, pulling out a pair of impossibly tiny socks. She held them up between her fingers, her eyes wide with amusement. “These are <em>ridiculous</em>. How did you not lose them the second you took them off him?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, covering her face for a moment. “Oh, I did. Constantly. I can’t even tell you how many lone socks I found in the weirdest places—inside couch cushions, under the car seat, even in the fridge once. Eventually, I gave up and started buying them in bulk.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, shaking her head as she picked up a soft yellow blanket. She held it to her cheek, testing its texture. “This is so soft. Did he have a favorite?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile grew fond as she reached over and took the blanket from Rio, running her fingers along its frayed edges. “This one, actually. He used to clutch it so tightly in his little fists. It had to go everywhere with him—car rides, naps, you name it. I tried to replace it once, but he wasn’t having it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, imagining the stubbornness. “That tracks. He’s got your determination.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Or my stubbornness,” Agatha quipped, shaking her head. “It’s a fine line.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they continued unpacking the box, Rio unearthed a small stuffed bear with a missing ear. She held it up, her expression half-teasing, half-sentimental. “Please tell me this little guy has a story.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, reaching out to take the bear. “Oh, this is Mr. Buttons. He was a gift from a neighbor when Nicky was born. The ear didn’t survive Nicky’s teething phase, but he refused to give it up. Mr. Buttons was his co-pilot through all sorts of toddler adventures.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio cradled the bear for a moment before gently setting it back in the box. “This is all so precious, Agatha. I love seeing this side of you—mom mode.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they packed up the box, Rio paused, her fingers lingering on the tiny, soft onesie. The pale blue fabric felt delicate, almost sacred, in her hands. She looked up at Agatha, her expression thoughtful and a little hesitant. “Will you tell me more about him? Stories from before I knew him?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s face softened immediately, her warm smile lighting up the dim basement. “I would love to, my love. And I’m sure he’d love that, too. He’s always asking me about when he was little—as if he’s all grown up now.” She scoffed lightly, shaking her head as a fond image of her little boy filled her mind. “He’s still such a baby in so many ways.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved into a gentle smile as she carefully folded the onesie, smoothing out its creases before placing it back in the box. Her movements were deliberate, almost reverent. “Thank you,” she said quietly. Then, with a mischievous glint in her eye, she added, “And I want to know everything. All the accomplishments, all the little moments, the big milestones—and especially the embarrassing stories. You know, so I can really wow him when I bring them up at just the right moment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha burst into laughter, her head tilting back as she let the sound echo around them. It was a rare, uninhibited kind of laugh that made Rio’s chest swell with affection. “You’re impossible,” Agatha said, wiping at the corner of her eye as her laughter subsided.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not impossible,” Rio countered, grinning as she set the onesie down and closed the box. “Just thorough.” She winked, her playful energy bouncing off Agatha like sunlight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, still smiling. “I can already hear him now: ‘Rio, stop embarrassing me!’ And you’ll just keep going, won’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned over, pressing a quick kiss to Agatha’s cheek. “Of course. It’s my duty as his cool Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened at the wording. It still felt surreal sometimes—how naturally Rio had stepped into their lives, becoming a vital part of her and Nicky’s little world. “You’re way more than just his ‘his cool Rio’,” she said, her voice dipping into something quieter, more serious. “You’re everything he needs. And everything I need, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blushed faintly, but she met Agatha’s gaze head-on, her expression full of love. “Well, I learn from the best,” she said, giving Agatha’s hand a squeeze. “You’re a pretty amazing mom yourself, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft, almost shy chuckle, brushing off the compliment with a wave of her hand. “I do my best. Now, come on, there’s still plenty of this mess to tackle.” She gestured to the remaining stacks of boxes, her tone light but her smile still lingering.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They worked side by side, sorting through the decades of accumulated boxes and forgotten items that had long since claimed the dimly lit basement. The air was thick with dust, the faint scent of old wood and cardboard lingering as they delved into the clutter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hummed softly to herself, her hands busy organizing a pile of books into categories. Every now and then, she glanced over at Agatha, who was kneeling by an older stack of boxes in the corner. Agatha’s brow furrowed as she opened another lid, her movements slower than usual. Rio caught the subtle tension in her posture—the way her shoulders stiffened, the slight downturn of her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s in there?” Rio asked gently, her voice cutting through the quiet hum of their work. She dusted off her hands and tilted her head, watching her partner closely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, her fingers tracing the edge of the box. Her gaze lingered on it, distant and conflicted, before she finally spoke. “It’s… Evanora’s things. I must’ve shoved this down here after she died. I haven’t touched it since.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s movements stilled, her playful energy replaced with quiet attentiveness. She moved closer, her presence grounding without being overbearing. “Do you want to go through it?” she asked softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a small nod, though her hesitation was palpable. She lifted the lid slowly, as if bracing herself for whatever memories might emerge. Inside was an assortment of items that once belonged to her mother: a faded scarf, its fabric worn thin; a set of tarnished hairpins with delicate engravings; a stack of letters, their edges yellowed with age. Beneath these lay photographs, their black-and-white starkness – Evanora hated colored pictures - amplifying the sense of distance and coldness they carried.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached for the photographs, her fingers trembling slightly as she pulled out a handful. Rio, sensing the weight of the moment, crouched beside her and peered over her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The images told a story Rio didn’t need Agatha to narrate. A younger Agatha, perhaps no older than eight or nine, stood stiffly beside a woman who exuded an oppressive authority even in the flatness of the photographs. Evanora’s expression was sharp, her features set in a way that seemed designed to intimidate rather than welcome. Her gaze pierced the camera lens with an icy clarity that sent a chill down Rio’s spine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But it wasn’t Evanora who captured Rio’s attention—it was the little girl by her side. Agatha’s small frame seemed dwarfed by her mother’s presence. Her face was carefully blank, her lips pressed into a thin, neutral line. Wide, dark eyes stared back at the camera, not with curiosity or fear, but with a haunting kind of resignation. Her shoulders were drawn inward, as though trying to make herself smaller, to disappear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, Agatha…” Rio whispered, her voice cracking under the weight of what she saw. She reached out instinctively, her hand brushing Agatha’s arm, searching for the right word. “You look so… melancholy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a short, humorless laugh, though it lacked any real amusement. Her voice was tight when she finally spoke. “Melancoly would’ve been an improvement. I don’t even remember feeling much of anything back then. Just… numb.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s chest ached at the admission. She slid closer, her hand moving to rest gently on Agatha’s knee. “I’m so sorry,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “No one—especially not a child—should have to feel that way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t respond immediately. Instead, she flipped through the photographs, her gaze lingering on each one. “She was cruel, but not in the way you might expect,” she murmured, almost as if trying to convince herself. “She demanded perfection. Anything less was a failure. And failure… wasn’t tolerated.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio frowned, anger flashing briefly in her eyes before she tempered it with the understanding Agatha needed in this moment. “You didn’t deserve that. None of it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her head, meeting Rio’s gaze. The mask she usually wore, the one she used to keep her past at bay, faltered. “I didn’t know how to be anything but what she wanted,” she admitted, her voice trembling. “I didn’t know I could be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hand moved to cup Agatha’s cheek, her touch firm but tender. “You’re so much more than that, Agatha. You always were. And she doesn’t define you—not now, not ever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed her eyes briefly, leaning into Rio’s touch. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart ached as she watched Agatha flip through the photos, her fingers lingering over the edges of each one as if each image carried an unbearable weight. There were more images of a young Agatha, each one like a frozen moment in time, capturing a girl who never quite seemed to belong in the scenes. One showed Agatha seated at a piano in a starched dress, her hands placed stiffly on the keys, while Evanora loomed behind her, her presence almost suffocating. Another showed Agatha standing alone in a garden, her arms at her sides, her gaze distant and directed somewhere just out of frame, as if she were trying to disappear into the background.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s voice broke the silence, quiet and tinged with a weariness that Rio could feel deep in her chest. “She was… everything a mother shouldn’t be,” Agatha said, her voice hollow, the words heavy with years of unspoken pain. “Cold. Demanding. Unforgiving. Nothing I ever did was enough for her. I wasn’t enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s chest tightened, and she felt a wave of anger rise in her, but she swallowed it down. This wasn’t about her feelings—it was about Agatha’s. She was the one who had lived through it. “You didn’t deserve that,” Rio said softly, her voice steady, though her heart was anything but. She spoke with a conviction that carried through the quiet space, filling the air between them. “Not as a child. Not ever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded but didn’t respond, her focus remaining fixed on the photographs as if the images held the key to unlocking some long-buried truth. Her hands trembled slightly as she sifted through them, but she didn’t stop until she reached the bottom of the pile. There, she stopped, her breath catching as her fingers brushed against a photo she hadn’t seen in years. It was a rare one—a glimpse of her as a toddler, her small frame sitting on a soft blanket with a book in her lap. Evanora’s hand was visible in the corner of the frame, gripping the edge of the book with a force that made it seem as though even that small moment was not her own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in closer, her heart heavy as she studied the photo. Even at such a young age, Agatha’s body language was telling. The tension was visible in the small curve of her shoulders, the way her tiny hands clutched the book so tightly, as if afraid it might be taken away at any moment. Rio’s voice was soft as she asked, “She never let you just… be a kid, did she?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No,” Agatha admitted, the word carrying the weight of a lifetime’s worth of unspoken truths. Her gaze stayed fixed on the photo, her fingers tracing the edges of the image as though to ground herself in the present. “She didn’t believe in softness. Or affection. Everything was about control.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart clenched at the rawness in Agatha’s words. She placed a gentle hand over Agatha’s, grounding her in the moment, reminding her that she wasn’t alone. “You’re so much more than what she tried to make you, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice tender yet filled with fierce certainty. “You’re kind. And warm. And strong. You’ve built a life that’s full of love, despite everything she tried to take from you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha set the photos down carefully, almost reverently, as though they were fragile and could shatter if handled too roughly. She took a deep breath, her hand reaching for Rio’s, her fingers lacing with hers tightly. There was a tremor in her touch, but it wasn’t from weakness. It was from something far deeper—emotion, vulnerability, and a need for contact and connection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sometimes,” Agatha began, her voice quiet, almost contemplative, “I wonder how I managed to get here. To have you. To have Nicky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze softened, her grip on Agatha’s hand firm as she met her eyes. “You got here because you’re you,” she said, her voice unwavering. “You didn’t let her destroy the best parts of you. And now, you’re giving Nicky everything she never gave you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A faint smile tugged at Agatha’s lips, though there was a sadness behind her eyes that hadn’t fully lifted. Her expression softened as she squeezed Rio’s hand, her voice cracking just slightly. “You always know what to say, don’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, a lightness returning to her features as she leaned in, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s forehead. “It’s my job, love,” she whispered, her lips lingering for a moment, offering more than just the kiss—an anchor, a promise, a reminder that Agatha was no longer alone in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The brush of her lips was gentle, but it carried with it an unspoken promise to be there, to heal the wounds that could never truly disappear, and to create a future built on love and understanding. As Rio pulled back, she kept her hand in Agatha’s, offering the steady comfort that Agatha had always given her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a small, forced chuckle as she placed the photographs back into the box. Her fingers lingered over the edges of the images for a moment, but she quickly closed the lid with a decisive motion, as though the simple act of sealing it away would somehow lessen the weight of the memories inside. “It’s all ancient history,” she said lightly, brushing the dust from her hands, a hollow laugh escaping her lips. “It doesn’t affect me anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung in the air, but Rio didn’t respond right away. She studied Agatha carefully, her gaze tracing the lines of her face, the set of her shoulders. Agatha’s expression was composed, but there was something in the way she avoided eye contact, the deliberate way she kept her gaze fixed on the box, as if the objects inside were more real than the woman sitting beside her. She was trying to seem unaffected, trying to bury the feelings that the photos had stirred up, but Rio knew better. She knew Agatha’s patterns too well by now. The tightness in her jaw, the way her breath came just a little faster than usual, the subtle tremor in her fingers as they brushed against the lid—Agatha was trying to push the emotions away, but they were still there, just beneath the surface.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t push right away. She wasn’t foolish enough to believe that Agatha would open up just because she saw through her carefully crafted mask. She knew better than most that Agatha could hide behind walls made of stone if she wanted to. And yet, Rio also knew that Agatha didn’t have to do it alone anymore. That she didn’t have to hide from her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Rio spoke, her voice soft but unwavering, the sincerity in it as clear as the concern that shadowed her eyes. “You don’t have to pretend with me, you know,” she said, her tone just shy of a plea.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes flickered toward her, a brief flash of something—vulnerability, perhaps, or a deeper sorrow—but it was gone in an instant. She looked away quickly, and her voice, when she answered, was almost too even. “I’m not pretending,” she said, though the words sounded hollow in the space between them. “It just… doesn’t matter anymore. I’ve moved on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let the silence settle for a moment, allowing Agatha’s words to linger. She wasn’t buying it—not fully. She knew those things too well herself to believe that everything, especially something as painful as one’s past, could just disappear. But she also understood the importance of giving Agatha the space to navigate the conversation at her own pace. Pushing too hard wouldn’t help anyone. “Okay,” Rio said gently, her voice soft but steady, carrying an unspoken promise of patience. “If that’s how you feel.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Agatha seemed to relax, the tension in her shoulders loosening slightly as if the lack of resistance was a relief. She was quick to move on, clearly eager to shift away from the topic, but Rio reached out then, placing her hand over Agatha’s with a quiet tenderness that spoke volumes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Just… promise me something?” Rio asked, her voice low, almost a whisper, as though the words were something precious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced at her, her brow furrowing in confusion and curiosity. “What?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s thumb gently stroked the back of Agatha’s hand as she spoke, her gaze unwavering. “Promise me that if you ever do want to talk about it—about her, about anything—you’ll come to me. I’m here for you, always. You don’t have to carry this alone.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hung there, raw and honest, vulnerable in a way that Rio rarely allowed herself to be. She held her breath, waiting for Agatha’s response, not wanting to rush her, but needing her to understand just how deeply Rio meant what she was saying.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a long moment, Agatha didn’t respond. Her eyes softened as she looked at Rio, something flickering across her face—something that might have been recognition, or maybe even gratitude, but it was fleeting. Agatha’s lips parted, but the words came slowly, almost as if they were too difficult to say. “I know,” she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. “I really do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, the warmth in her eyes deepening. She squeezed Agatha’s hand gently, a quiet reaffirmation of the promise she had just made. “Good,” she said, her voice steady, with no hesitation. “Because you’ve been there for me more times than I can count. Let me return the favor, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small smile tugged at the corners of Agatha’s lips, faint but real. It wasn’t the big, radiant smile Rio was used to seeing, but it was something. It was a crack in the walls, a crack that, though small, was enough to let in a little bit of light. “Okay,” Agatha replied softly, her voice warm, the promise in her words just as real as Rio’s had been.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They didn’t say anything else after that. Rio didn’t push, and Agatha didn’t elaborate further. Instead, they simply sat together, side by side, their hands still joined, the box of Evanora’s things resting quietly between them. It was a silent witness to a painful past that neither of them could erase, but the weight of it felt different now. It wasn’t something Agatha had to carry alone anymore. And that, in itself, was a kind of healing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the silence, Rio hoped that Agatha could feel the weight of her love, could feel the support that was now hers to lean on. Agatha had given so much to others, had carried so much of the world on her shoulders. And now, Rio was here, ready to carry it with her. To be the shoulder she could lean on, without reservation or fear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they finished tidying the basement, Rio couldn’t help but steal glances at Agatha as they worked. Her partner moved with her usual grace, every motion fluid and purposeful, but there was something off. A subtle rigidity had crept into her posture, a tightness in her shoulders that spoke volumes, despite the calm expression she wore. The way she lifted the boxes, the way she adjusted her movements, it all felt controlled, as though she was trying to keep herself in check. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally emerged from the basement, the scene that greeted them was a sharp contrast to the quiet tension that had filled the house. Nicky, sprawled out on the living room rug, was so absorbed in a puzzle that he barely registered their presence. The sight of him, so engrossed and innocent, seemed to pull something out of Agatha. A brief flicker of warmth softened her expression, just enough for Rio to catch it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha knelt down beside Nicky, her voice shifting to its usual softness as she asked him about his progress. “How’s it going, sweetheart? Got all the pieces in place?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled at the tenderness in Agatha’s voice, even though it was tinged with an undercurrent of something else—something that didn’t belong. Rio moved to sit beside them, crossing her legs on the floor, and offered to help with the puzzle. “Need an extra hand?” she asked, her tone light, trying to fill the space with something easy, something uncomplicated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next hour was spent in laughter, the three of them working together on the colorful puzzle that spread out before them. The pieces clicked together with satisfying ease, just like the familiar rhythm of their little family. The air was warm, filled with the hum of everyday life. But despite the seemingly calm atmosphere, Rio couldn’t shake the sense of tension that lingered around Agatha. It was subtle, but it was there—an almost imperceptible distance between Agatha and the moment. It was in the way she fidgeted with Nicky’s hair absentmindedly, the way her laugh didn’t reach her eyes, the way her responses seemed just a little too deliberate. Rio knew Agatha wasn’t okay. Not entirely. But for now, she stayed quiet, watching, waiting for the right moment to ask—to offer and reaffirm, if only Agatha would let her in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they had finished dinner and Nicky was tucked into bed, the weight of the evening had settled over Rio like a thick fog. She could feel it, the unspoken tension, hanging in the air between her and Agatha. The dinner had been pleasant enough, Nicky chattering about school and his latest obsession with puzzles, but Agatha had been distant—her laughter a little forced, her responses a little too quick, her attention always just a bit off. When Agatha had read Nicky his bedtime story, her voice was as soothing and melodic as ever, but Rio couldn’t help but notice as she passed by the way her fingers gripped the edges of the book a little too tightly, her knuckles white from the tension. It was subtle, but it was there. Agatha was trying to hold it together, to be present, but it was clearly eating at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once Nicky had kissed them both goodnight and was safely in bed, Rio found herself walking beside Agatha in silence, the quiet stretching between them like an unspoken agreement to pretend everything was fine. But Rio knew better—Agatha’s silence was always a signal. She could feel the heaviness that had descended on their home, and though she didn’t want to push, she knew she couldn’t just let it slide. Not tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they made their way to their bedroom, the only sounds in the house were the soft creaks of the floorboards beneath their feet, the faint hum of the evening settling in. Rio could sense Agatha’s internal battle, the way she was holding herself a little too rigidly, as if she were trying to keep a storm inside. When they both climbed into bed, the space between them felt wider than it should have, even though they were side by side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once they were under the covers, Rio turned towards Agatha, gently tucking a strand of her long, brown hair behind her ear. The soft light from the bedside lamp cast a warm glow across Agatha’s face, but it couldn’t hide the subtle strain in her features. Rio’s voice was low, barely a whisper, but it carried the weight of her concern. “You’ve been tense all night,” she said, her hand resting lightly on Agatha’s arm. “I know you don’t have to tell me what’s on your mind if you’re not ready, but I want you to know I’m here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes met hers, a flicker of something unreadable passing between them. She turned her head slightly, as if deciding how to respond. Her expression softened, but there was still that guarded edge to it, the one that told Rio Agatha was holding back. “I know, darling. I’m sorry. Can we just… can we not talk about it tonight? I swear we’ll talk more, just not right now, if that’s okay.” Agatha’s voice cracked ever so slightly on the last word, and Rio could hear the vulnerability beneath her calm exterior.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment, but only for a moment. She understood. Agatha needed time, needed space, and pushing her wouldn’t help. Rio nodded slowly, her thumb gently brushing over the back of Agatha’s hand where it lay beside her on the pillow. “That’s okay. Whatever you want. I’m not going anywhere,” she whispered, her voice steady and sure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a shaky breath, a tremor passing through her as she leaned into Rio’s embrace. The tension that had been so tightly coiled in her body seemed to unravel just a little as she let herself relax against Rio. Her face pressed against Rio’s shoulder, and for a long moment, there was nothing but the sound of Agatha’s slow, steady breathing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Agatha murmured, her voice muffled against Rio’s skin. “I love you, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pressed a soft kiss to the top of Agatha’s head, the gesture warm and comforting. “I love you too,” she whispered back, her hand curling around Agatha’s, holding her close.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They lay there together, the silence between them no longer awkward but peaceful, the kind of silence that spoke of shared comfort and understanding. Agatha’s breathing grew deeper, slower, and eventually, Rio felt the subtle shift in the weight of her partner’s body. Agatha had fallen asleep, her body relaxed against Rio’s, the weight of the day finally catching up with her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, however, stayed awake for a while longer, watching Agatha’s peaceful expression in the dim light. No matter what came next, no matter how long it took for Agatha to open up, Rio would be there, waiting, ready to catch her when she fell.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room was quiet, the soft hum of the night filling the space like a lullaby. Outside, the world had settled into its usual calm, the stars glimmering faintly through the curtains. Rio had drifted into a light sleep, her arm still draped protectively around Agatha, the warmth of their bodies keeping the chill of the night at bay. It was peaceful, serene—the kind of moment that felt suspended in time, untouchable and safe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Until it wasn’t.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted beside her, a soft, incoherent mumble escaping her lips. Her body jerked once, a small tremor running through her as if she were trying to shake off some lingering nightmare. Her breathing grew shallow and rapid, each exhale slightly uneven. Then, a soft, anguished sound slipped from her throat—a sound that chilled Rio to the bone. She woke instantly, her mind sharpened with concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha?” Rio whispered, her voice thick with sleep but filled with worry, her hand instinctively reaching for Agatha’s trembling body. “Agatha, hey… It’s okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes shot open with a sharp gasp as she sat up, her chest rising and falling with quick, erratic breaths, as though she’d been running through a nightmare and had just come to a sudden, crashing halt. She muttered something under her breath, a chant of sorts, almost like a prayer to herself. “I can be good. I can be good. I can be good…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her eyes darted around the room, unfocused, wild, as if she couldn’t quite orient herself to the reality of the room around her. Her breathing was fast and frantic, the edges of her panic creeping through. It took a moment for her gaze to land on Rio, and when it did, there was a brief flash of recognition—a flicker of something resembling clarity before the confusion returned. The mumbled words stopped, but the look in her eyes remained haunted, distant, like something deep inside was still trapped in that nightmare.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat up immediately, her heart twisting at the sight of Agatha so visibly shaken. The serene calm of their night had shattered, leaving only the sharp edges of fear in its place. She reached out, her hand moving to Agatha’s damp forehead, brushing the strands of hair away gently as she spoke in soothing tones. “It’s okay, love. You’re safe here. You’re with me. I’m right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha swallowed hard, her breath catching in her throat as she wiped her trembling hands over her face, trying to shake off the remnants of the terror that clung to her. Her voice was a mere whisper when she spoke, raw and fragile. “It was her,” she said, her eyes downcast, avoiding Rio’s gaze as she fought to steady herself. “My mother… she… she was so real. Like she was right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hit Rio like a punch to the gut. She hadn’t known Agatha’s mother but the venom and fear in Agatha’s voice whenever she spoke about her was enough for Rio to understand. She hated her, too. Hated what that woman had done to Agatha, and how her shadow still seemed to loom over her, even now. Even after all this time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s voice was gentle, but firm, as she cupped Agatha’s cheek, guiding her to meet her eyes. “It was just a nightmare, my love,” she said softly, her thumb brushing over the damp skin of Agatha’s face. “She’s gone. She can’t hurt you anymore. You’re safe, I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed at Rio’s touch, a shudder rippling through her as she leaned into it, her face pressing against Rio’s palm like she was searching for some tether to reality. “I know,” she whispered, her voice breaking with the weight of the admission. “But it felt so real. So <em>real</em>.” Her breath hitched, and her words faltered, as if the memories were clawing their way to the surface. “She was telling me… all the things she used to say. That I wasn’t enough. That I was wrong and evil. That I couldn’t be good. That I didn’t deserve…” She trailed off, her voice cracking, the rest of the sentence left unsaid.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The pain in her voice shattered Rio’s heart. She could feel the echo of that trauma in every word Agatha spoke, the poison that Evanora had poured into her years ago still reverberating in Agatha’s soul. Rio wanted to rage, wanted to tear it all apart—wanted to erase every trace of that woman’s cruelty from Agatha’s life. But for now, all she could do was hold her, to remind her that she was loved, that none of those horrible things were true.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shifted closer, wrapping her arms around Agatha in a tight, comforting embrace. She pulled her in close, feeling the tremors still running through Agatha’s body. “None of that is true,” Rio said firmly, her voice steady, even though her heart was breaking. “You’re not weak, my love. You’re not evil. You are the strongest person I know, Agatha. And you deserve everything good. Every bit of love, every bit of happiness. Don’t you dare believe anything else. You hear me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t respond with words, but her fingers—still trembling—gripped at the fabric of Rio’s shirt, clutching it like a lifeline. She didn’t need to say anything. The silent plea in the way she held on spoke volumes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio held her tighter, her voice softer now, more tender. “I’m here, Agatha. You’re not alone in this. You’ll never be alone again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a long moment of silence, the weight of it heavy but comfortable. Rio didn’t push, knowing that sometimes silence was the only space where healing could begin. She held Agatha close, letting her process the words she’d spoken, giving her the time and space she needed to decide how much she wanted to share. Rio wasn’t in a rush. She had learned over time that Agatha would open up when she was ready—when the walls came down, it would be on her terms, and Rio would be there for every moment of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you want to tell me more about it?” Rio’s voice was quiet, soft, respectful of the vulnerability between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s only response was a slow shake of her head, her face still buried in the warmth of Rio’s shoulder, the movement small and almost imperceptible. She exhaled shakily, the weight of the nightmare still clinging to her, and whispered, “No… I just… Can you just hold me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t hesitate. Her arms tightened around Agatha instinctively, as if the very act of holding her could shield her from every cruel moment of her past. She tucked Agatha closer to her chest, as if trying to protect her from the weight of the world. “Always,” Rio whispered back, her voice a quiet promise. “You’re good, Agatha. You’re safe now. And you’re loved—so, so loved.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a shuddering breath, and Rio could feel the tension in her body slowly begin to ebb away. It was a long time before Agatha’s shoulders relaxed more, the jagged edge of panic finally slipping away into a fragile stillness. Rio continued to hold her, moving slowly and carefully to lay back down, pulling Agatha with her so she could cradle her against her chest. They settled into the familiar comfort of each other’s embrace, the weight of the world outside their little bubble fading into nothing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a long while, there were no words between them—just the soft rhythm of their breathing, the steady heartbeat beneath Agatha’s ear, and the quiet hum of their world, completely separated from the chaos of everything else. Rio pressed a soft kiss to the top of Agatha’s head, her lips lingering there, as if to reassure her that she was real, that she was safe, that she was loved. Rio’s fingers traced soothing patterns on Agatha’s back under her shirt, every touch slow and deliberate, a silent offering of comfort and support.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The minutes stretched on, and Agatha’s breathing gradually evened out, the quick, shallow inhales replaced with deeper, steadier breaths. The tension that had gripped her so tightly at first began to melt away, and Rio felt it too—their bodies, entwined, finding a peaceful rhythm. Rio stayed there, holding her as if there was nowhere else she could possibly be. She whispered quiet reassurances into Agatha’s hair, her words barely audible in the stillness, but they were enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eventually, Rio could feel the moment when Agatha fully relaxed, when her body gave in to the warmth of Rio’s presence and the exhaustion of the night’s emotional toll. Her breathing deepened, slow and even, her body growing heavier on top of the younger woman and Rio knew she had fallen back into sleep, though she didn’t let go. She stayed exactly where she was, holding Agatha close, her heart steady as she offered the same unwavering comfort she had received so many times before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In that quiet, soft moment, Rio stayed awake, her thoughts drifting but never straying too far. She didn’t have all the answers. She couldn’t undo the damage of the past, the pain that still lingered in Agatha’s heart, but she could be here now. She could be the safe harbor Agatha needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she lay there, with Agatha curled against her, Rio made a silent vow—a promise to herself, to Agatha, and to the life they were building together. She couldn’t erase the past, couldn’t change the scars that had been left behind. But she could make sure that from this point forward, Agatha’s days would be filled with warmth, safety, and love. Rio would be there to protect her, to hold her through the storms, and to give her a future where light could finally chase away the shadows.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning sunlight filtered softly through the curtains, casting a warm, golden glow across the room. Rio stirred, blinking her eyes open and stretching slightly, careful not to disturb the still form of Agatha still on her chest. Agatha was sound asleep, her face relaxed now, free of the turmoil that had haunted her during the night. But Rio could still see the lingering sadness in her features—the echoes of the nightmare that had disturbed her night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart ached for Agatha, but she knew better than anyone how strong she was. Agatha’s past didn’t define her—it was the love they had now, the life they were building, that mattered. And that was exactly what Rio intended to show her this morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She carefully slid out of bed, her bare feet brushing the cool floor, and padded quietly to the door. She glanced back at Agatha one last time before closing the door softly behind her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The house was still quiet as she made her way down the hallway, passing Nicky’s room. He was still fast asleep, tucked up in his little bed, his small chest rising and falling gently with each breath. His stuffed dragon had fallen on the floor during the night, so she went in to pick it up and tuck it back in the little boy’s arms. She smiled and exited the room, on a mission.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She entered the kitchen, determined to make breakfast that would bring a little comfort to Agatha after her night. She opened the fridge, pulling out eggs, butter, and fresh ingredients. Her movements were quick but deliberate, as if she was crafting something more than just a meal—a small, simple act of love that would hopefully help Agatha feel a little lighter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio?” Nicky’s voice was soft from the doorway, and Rio turned to see him rubbing his eyes, still half-asleep. “Are you making breakfast?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her heart warming at the sight of him. “I am, little love,” she said gently. “Would you like to help me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up, and he nodded eagerly, scampering over to the counter where Rio was preparing the ingredients. Rio lifted him up onto a stool, and together, they started cracking eggs and whisking them in a bowl. Nicky’s small hands were clumsy, but Rio didn’t mind. The mess didn’t matter—it was the moment of connection that she cherished.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they worked together, Rio’s mind wandered back to Agatha’s nightmare. She couldn’t help but relate to some of her own experiences. Growing up in foster care in some less than ideal families, she had had her fair share of lack of love, hopelessness and loneliness, but seeing Agatha also struggling with similar problems made her feel terrible. She could deal with the world being unfair towards herself, but she couldn’t stand idea that Agatha had known anything else but love and support.  </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few minutes, Nicky’s giggles pulled her out of her thoughts as he dropped a little bit of egg batter on the counter. Rio laughed softly and wiped it away before turning her attention back to the stove, where the eggs were beginning to sizzle. She hummed a little tune to herself, the warmth of the morning filling her with a sense of peace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once the breakfast was ready, Rio and Nicky carefully carried everything upstairs, Nicky holding a small bowl of fruit in his hands as if it were the most precious thing in the world, and Rio in charge of the heavier tray. They quietly entered their bedroom and set the tray down on the bedside table, careful not to wake up Agatha, who was still nestled under the covers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, Mama,” Nicky whispered, leaning over to kiss her cheek.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stirred at the sound of his voice, her eyelids fluttering open. She looked up at Nicky, her lips curling into a soft, tired smile. “Good morning, my love,” she said, her voice still thick with sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat on the edge of the bed, gently leaning down to kiss Agatha’s sleepy face. “We made you breakfast,” she said quietly, her gaze tender as she met Agatha’s eyes. “I thought it might help.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened, but there was a glint of something else in her eyes—a mix of appreciation and vulnerability. “Thank you,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky climbed onto the bed beside her, placing the bowl of fruit in her lap with a proud grin. “We made it together, me and Rio!” he said brightly, his little chest puffing up with pride. “I helped!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her fingers lightly brushing Nicky’s hair. “Rio and I, love,” she corrected gently. “You’re the best, Nicky,” she said, her voice thick with love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha reached for the tray and began to pick at the breakfast, Rio stayed close by, her heart full as she took a berry from the bowl still on Agatha’s lap.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened as she watched Rio and Nicky, her heart swelling with warmth. She had never imagined that this kind of love and care was something she could have—something that was all hers. The way Rio had thought to make breakfast for her, the way Nicky eagerly helped, and how both of them were so present, so willing to make her feel better, made Agatha feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could feel the lump in her throat as she gazed at the simple, yet deeply meaningful gesture. Her past, the harsh memories of Evanora seemed so distant in that moment, replaced by the love and family she and Nicky had built with Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile widened as she leaned in and kissed Rio gently on the lips. It was a kiss full of gratitude, love, and the quiet promise of forever. When she pulled away, she gave Nicky a tender look. “And you, little one,” she said, grasping an squeezing his chubby cheeks, making his giggle, “you’ve made my life so much brighter. I can’t imagine it without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed up at her, his eyes sparkling with pure joy. “I’m happy, too, Mama. I’m glad we’re all together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart fluttered at their words, the love between the three of them wrapping around her like a warm blanket. In this moment, the pain of the past seemed to fall away, replaced by the strong, unwavering bond they shared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p>*</p>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">                  (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of breakfast passed in a warm haze of family togetherness. Wrapped in cozy blankets, the three of them stayed in bed longer than they probably should have, Nicky animatedly recounting the latest adventures of his favorite superheroes while Rio and Agatha occasionally exchanged amused glances over his head. Agatha’s nightmare felt like a distant memory now, fading further with every burst of laughter and shared bite of fruit from the tray.The nightmare had left no shadow here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When breakfast was done, Nicky was practically bouncing with excitement, declaring himself ready to help with “important moving stuff.” He stood on the bed and struck a superhero pose, fists on his hips, as if preparing for a mission.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha quirked an eyebrow at him, suppressing a smile. “Important, huh? Are you sure you’re up for it? It’s a big job.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m super up for it!” Nicky declared, jumping down from the bed and landing with an exaggerated stomp.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, sitting up and ruffling his hair. “Well then, super helper, let’s see what you’ve got.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once everyone was ready, they gathered what they needed for the trip to Lilia’s house, the last stop in their moving process. A few lingering boxes stored at Lilia’s were finally coming home now that space had been cleared in the basement—a task they’d put off for weeks but had suddenly become urgent with Nicky’s enthusiasm leading the charge.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they piled into the car, Rio reached back to buckle Nicky into his booster seat, her tone playful. “You ready to be our official box carrier, buddy?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned wide, puffing out his chest dramatically. “I’m the strongest! I can carry <em>all</em> the boxes!” He flexed his little arms with great effort, his face scrunching up in mock determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled from the driver’s seat, glancing at Rio as she started the car. Her free hand rested briefly over Rio’s on the center console, a silent gesture of affection. “That’s good to know, little man. We’re counting on you to save the day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The drive to Lilia’s wasn’t long, but it was filled with lighthearted chatter. Nicky bounced in his seat as Rio pointed out landmarks along the way, her voice animated as she wove stories about her past. “See that little park over there?” she said, gesturing out the window. “That’s where Lilia took me for a run when I needed a break from studying. I tripped over that big tree root and swore I’d never run again, but Lilia made me get up and finish a whole lap around it, while she was just sitting on that bench, reading.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky gasped, wide-eyed. “You didn’t just give up?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course not,” Rio said, grinning at him through the rearview mirror. “Lilia said, ‘If you give up, you’ll always trip over the same spot in your mind.’ And she was right. I never tripped over that root again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced at Rio from the corner of her eye, her lips curving into a fond smile. She loved how Rio could bring even the smallest memories to life, captivating both her and Nicky with her stories. Rio’s voice had a way of weaving warmth into every detail, as if the world itself was softer when seen through her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned toward Agatha briefly, catching her smile, and gave her a wink. “And that’s why you both should listen to me when I tell you to wear good shoes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, but Agatha only laughed softly, her gaze returning to the road. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they arrived at Lilia’s house, the older woman was already on the porch, her arms folded against the crisp breeze, a fond smile lighting up her face. “There’s my favorite trio,” she called out warmly, her voice carrying the kind of comfort that felt like coming home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t hesitate, bounding out of the car and up the steps with all the energy of an uncontainable six-year-old. “Hi, Grandma Lilia!” he said brightly, throwing himself into her open arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hello, sweet boy,” Lilia greeted, wrapping him in a hug and pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “I see you’re ready to help today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky pulled back just enough to beam up at her. “I’m the strongest!” he declared, flexing his tiny arms again for emphasis.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled, brushing a stray curl from his forehead. “I don’t doubt it for a second, sweetheart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio and Agatha approached, Lilia straightened, her eyes softening even more. Her gaze rested on Rio first. “How are you, sweet girl?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in for a hug, letting out a content sigh as she wrapped her arms around Lilia. “I’m good. Better than good actually.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha followed a step behind, her usual composed demeanor shifting into something gentler in Lilia’s presence, also stepping into Lilia’s embrace. There was always an unspoken respect between the two women, as if they understood the unique role each played in Rio’s life. Agatha offered a small nod, her voice low and sincere as she said, “Thank you for keeping everything safe for us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Lilia replied, reaching out to pat Agatha’s head affectionately. “You know there’s no need to thank me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s get those boxes,” Rio said, smiling at both women before reaching for Nicky’s hand. “We’ve got a helper on the job, after all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Inside the house, the small stack of Rio’s belongigns was neatly arranged near the door, each box carefully labeled in Lilia’s elegant handwriting. The sight made Rio pause for a moment, a wave of nostalgia washing over her. This house held so many memories—of late-night talks at the kitchen table, Lilia’s calming presence during her most chaotic days, and the quiet reassurance that she always had a place to come back to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You didn’t have to do all this,” Rio said softly, running her fingers along the edge of a box marked <em>Books.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course I did,” Lilia replied with a knowing smile. “I had to make sure everything was ready for the strongest box carrier in the world.” She winked at Nicky, who giggled as he grabbed the smallest box he could find and carried it toward the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they worked together to load the car, Lilia stood back, watching the three of them interact. Nicky’s laughter filled the air as Rio pretended to struggle with a box only to let him “help” lift it, while Agatha quietly stepped in to organize the boxes in the trunk with her usual efficiency. Lilia’s heart swelled at the sight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could see it in the way Agatha’s hand brushed Rio’s back as she passed, in the way Rio’s face lit up every time she looked at her family, and in the way Nicky seemed to radiate pure joy in their presence. There was love here—steady, deep, and boundless.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the last box was carried out, Lilia turned to Rio, her voice soft but thoughtful. “Are you sure you don’t want to leave some of it here, just in case?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio paused, her hands resting on the top box still balanced on her hip. She glanced at Agatha, who was leaning against the car, her eyes steady and full of quiet encouragement. Then she looked back at Lilia.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think… I think it’s time I bring it all home,” Rio said, her voice soft but resolute. “Home with <em>us</em>.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smile widened, her eyes shimmering with pride. She reached out and squeezed Rio’s hand, holding it for a moment longer than usual. “I’m proud of you, sweetheart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they returned home, Nicky was practically bouncing out of his seat in the back of the car, unable to contain his excitement about helping unpack. As soon as they stepped inside, he darted around the living room, inspecting each box with the enthusiasm of someone who had just discovered a treasure chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This can go in your room with Mama, Rio!” Nicky said triumphantly, holding up a book with a big grin on his face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, ruffling his hair fondly as she took the book from him. “That’s the plan, kiddo,” she said, her voice warm. “You’re really good at this. Maybe you should become an organizer when you grow up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky puffed out his chest proudly. “I could totally do that! I’m the best at organizing!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, meanwhile, had begun carefully unwrapping some of Rio’s more fragile keepsakes—photographs, small trinkets, mementos that had gathered over the years. She paused for a moment, her fingers brushing over a small, framed photograph of a younger Rio with Lilia. Her gaze softened, and for a moment, she simply studied the image, tracing it with reverence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio noticed her pause and leaned over, her voice gentle. “That was the day Lilia officially adopted me,” she explained, her tone tinged with a mix of nostalgia and quiet affection. “She insisted on taking a picture right after we signed the papers. It meant the world to her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned toward Rio, her gaze lingering on the photo for a moment longer before meeting her eyes. There was something unspoken in her expression—something deep, tender, and full of understanding. “It’s beautiful,” she said quietly, her voice soft but steady. She placed the photo frame on a nearby shelf, making it visible to all, a quiet tribute to the love and history Rio carried with her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they continued to unpack, the room slowly began to take shape. Boxes were emptied, and last trinkets were unpacked, and the space around them felt a little fuller, a little more complete. Rio stood back for a moment, her arms crossed, taking it all in with a soft, contented sigh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It feels… good,” she said, her voice low, as if savoring the simple truth of the moment. The walls, the furniture, the memories—they all seemed to settle into place, filling the space with a quiet warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio’s waist, pulling her close and pressing a kiss to her temple. “It should,” she said, her voice soft, almost like a promise. “This is your <em>home</em>, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, who had been darting between the boxes, suddenly appeared in front of them with a big grin on his face. Without missing a beat, he wrapped his small arms around both of them, squeezing tightly. “And you will never leave!” he declared with all the confidence of someone who truly believed that nothing could ever tear them apart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio and Agatha exchanged a soft, affectionate glance, a shared moment of silent understanding passing between them. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they reached the next box, Nicky’s sharp little eyes spotted a photo album resting on top, its cover simple yet well-worn, the corners softened by time and the gentle touch of countless memories revisited. He tilted his head curiously before reaching out to pick it up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s this?” he asked, turning it over in his hands, his small fingers running over the slightly frayed edges.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned at his question, her gaze landing on the familiar album. A soft smile curved her lips, a hint of nostalgia dancing in her eyes. “That’s a photo album Lilia made,” she explained, her voice warm and steady. “It has pictures from when I first came to live with her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s brow furrowed in thought, his curiosity evident as he hugged the album close to his chest. “When did you start living with her again?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a seat on the couch and patted the cushion beside her, inviting him to join her. “I moved in with Lilia when I was sixteen,” she said, her tone gentle but honest. “Before that… I was with other people in different homes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s gaze softened as he climbed onto the couch, settling himself beside her with the album still clutched in his hands. “Can I look?” he asked hesitantly, glancing up at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” she said, gently taking the album and opening it to the first page.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes lit up as he leaned closer, his small hands resting lightly on the edges of the pages. The first photograph was of a teenage Rio standing in front of Lilia’s house, her posture slightly stiff, her expression tentative but filled with a flicker of hope. The image seemed to radiate a bittersweet charm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s you?” Nicky asked, his voice laced with wonder, as if he couldn’t quite believe the teenager in the picture was the same Rio he adored.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s me,” Rio confirmed with a soft laugh, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush. “I wasn’t very good at smiling for pictures back then. I was still figuring out a lot of things.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky studied the photograph intently before looking back at her. “You look pretty,” he said earnestly, his voice filled with the kind of sincerity that only a child could manage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart melted at his words, her chest tightening with affection. She reached out to gently ruffle his hair. “Thank you, bud. That means a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been quietly observing the interaction, allowed herself a rare moment of unguarded emotion. Her heart swelled as she watched Rio and Nicky together. She stepped closer, resting a hand on Rio’s shoulder and squeezing it lightly, a silent gesture of support and love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, oblivious to the tender exchange between the two adults, eagerly turned the page.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next photo showed an almost adult Rio sitting at a cozy kitchen table, a plate of pancakes stacked high in front of her. In this picture, her smile was softer, more genuine, her shoulders beginning to lose the stiffness that marked the earlier photographs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia made pancakes every Saturday morning, even when I got older,” Rio said, her voice tinged with warmth as she traced a finger over the photo. “She still does when I visit. It was her way of showing me she cared, even when I didn’t know how to accept it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s little face lit up. “Pancakes are the best way to show love, I love them!” he declared, clutching the album tighter as though it were a treasure map to Rio’s past.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, her hand moving instinctively to tousle his hair. “You’re not wrong, buddy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they flipped through more pages, the story of Rio’s journey began to unfold, each photo a testament to the life she’d built after finding Lilia. There was one of Rio and Lilia baking cookies together, flour smudged across both their faces as they grinned for the camera despite the blurry faces of other people around. Another captured now adult Rio in the glow of a Christmas tree, holding a brightly wrapped present.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been watching from the edge of the couch, quietly moved closer and eased onto the seat beside Rio. Her hand found Rio’s knee, giving it a reassuring squeeze as her eyes flicked over the photographs. “It’s incredible,” Agatha murmured, her voice soft yet filled with conviction. “To see how far you’ve come, how much strength you’ve carried with you through it all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned into Agatha’s side, her head tilting slightly to rest against her shoulder. Gratitude surged through her—a deep appreciation for Lilia, for Agatha, for Nicky. For the family she had never thought she would have. “It’s all thanks to Lilia,” she said quietly, her voice steady but filled with emotion. “She showed me what it meant to be safe, to have a home, to feel… loved.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked up at her, his small face unusually serious, his brow furrowed in thought. “Do you miss being a kid?” he asked, his voice laced with the kind of innocent curiosity that only a child could muster.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curved into a gentle smile as she considered the question. “Not really,” she admitted. “My childhood wasn’t the easiest. But everything changed when I met Lilia. And now…” She glanced between Nicky and Agatha, her voice softening with affection. “Now I have you and your Mama, which makes it better than I ever thought it could be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s serious expression melted into a radiant grin. Without warning, he flung his arms around Rio, hugging the photo album tightly between them. “You’re part of the best family ever!” he exclaimed, his voice muffled against her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, wrapping an arm around the boy and pulling him close. Agatha’s hand slid from Rio’s knee to her back, tracing soothing circles as she looked at both of them with a quiet, unguarded tenderness. Nicky then shuffled off her lap and resumed his careful scrutiny of each of the album pages.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky flipped another page in the photo album, his eyes went wide with astonismhment. “Whoa!” he exclaimed, practically bouncing in his seat. “Is that you, Rio? You’re wearing… a crown!” His finger jabbed at the picture with unbridled enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in, her curiosity piqued. The moment her eyes landed on the image, a laugh bubbled up from her chest. “Not a crown, bud,” she corrected, a teasing lilt to her voice. “That’s a tiara.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The photo in question captured a younger Rio standing under a spotlight on a grand stage, poised in an elegant pose. She wore a pale blue tutu, its sequins glinting like tiny stars, and a delicate tiara rested on her head, catching the stage lights just so. Her arms were gracefully arched above her head, and though her expression was serene, there was an intensity in her eyes that hinted at the determination behind the poise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You look like a princess!” Nicky gasped, his face lighting up with genuine awe. His little hands clutched the album as he brought it closer to his face to see better.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened as she glanced over at the photo, her gaze lingering on Rio. “I will have to thank Lilia for that shot,” she murmured, a hint of admiration threading through her tone. “You look so poised, so… ethereal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A blush crept up Rio’s cheeks as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “Poised? Ethereal? Let’s not get carried away. I was terrified,” she confessed with a sheepish chuckle. “That was my first big recital with a packed audience. I was convinced I’d trip over my own feet or forget the choreography.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked up at her, his small face serious. “You don’t look scared. You look amazing! Like a real ballerina, like in the movies!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh, reaching out to ruffle his hair. “Thanks, bud. That’s the magic of ballet—making it look effortless even when you’re convinced your legs are about to give out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky returned his attention to the photo, utterly mesmerized. “Do you still have the crown? And the dress?” he asked, his tone filled with the boundless hope of a child.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, leaning in closer to Rio with a playful glint in her eyes. “The tiara, darling,” she corrected with exaggerated precision, mimicking Rio’s earlier correction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a mock glare, though the smile tugging at her lips gave her away. “No, I don’t have the tiara or the costume anymore. Ballet costumes are rented for recitals, and the tiara was part of the set.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face fell for a moment before he perked up again. “But you still dance, right?” he asked eagerly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded. “A little. How else would I keep up with teaching you and your wild little classmates?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s grin stretched ear to ear. “I wanna see you dance like that again! Can you wear a crown?” With still absolutely no regards for the correction earlier made.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, her hand resting gently on Rio’s back. “You know,” she said, her voice warm and teasing, “I wouldn’t mind seeing that myself. It sounds… enchanting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, though the sparkle in her eyes betrayed her amusement. “You two are incorrigible,” she said, shaking her head. “But maybe I’ll show you a little something later, if you <em>both</em> behave.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, I know another kind of <em>dancing</em> you can show me later, love”, Agatha whispered, low enough that only Rio’s ear could hear it, making said ear heat up and flush a little.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Promise?” Nicky pressed, oblivious to the exchange, his voice tinged with unshakable excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned forward, tapping the tip of his nose. “Promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Satisfied, Nicky practically bounced with joy, clutching the album to his chest. “You’re the coolest ever, Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s temple. “You’re full of surprises, my love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And you’re full of flattery,” Rio shot back, though her pink cheeks suggested she didn’t entirely mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The photo of Rio in her recital costume quickly became Nicky’s favorite. When they were done with the album and set it on the bookshelf, he insisted they leave it open to that page. The rest of the afternoon, he couldn’t stop talking about how amazing it was that Rio used to dance on a stage, asking question after question about her ballerina days, and running to see the picture again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At some point, he decided that if he wanted to dance like Rio one day, he needed to practice. <em>Right now</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, can you show me how to do that spin? You know, the one where it looks like you’re floating?” Nicky asked, pointing at the photo again with an eager bounce in his step.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, reaching out to ruffle his hair. “You mean a pirouette?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah! That one!” he exclaimed, practically vibrating with excitement. “I wanna get better for ballet class! And you’re my teacher, so you <em>have</em> to help me, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From her spot on the couch, Agatha looked up from the stack of papers to grade in her lap, her eyebrow arched in amusement. “He’s got a solid argument, love. Very persuasive,” she teased, her lips curling into a smirk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a mock glare before turning back to Nicky. “Alright, little ballerino. Let’s see what you’ve got.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky let out a delighted squeal and darted to the center of the living room, where there was just enough space to practice. Rio followed, rolling her shoulders like she was about to step onto the stage herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” she said, crouching slightly to meet his eye level. “First things first—show me how you prepare. Remember, a good pirouette starts before you even spin. It’s all about balance and finding your center.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded enthusiastically, planting his feet in what he thought was a preparatory stance. His arms wobbled a little, and his focus was completely fixed on Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not bad for a start,” Rio said, her tone encouraging. “But let’s clean it up a bit. Arms here,” she said, gently repositioning them, “chin up, and remember to breathe. Oh, and don’t forget to smile! Ballet’s all about looking graceful, even when you’re trying really hard.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tried again, this time with Rio’s adjustments, his face scrunching up in concentration as he lifted his chin and stretched his arms out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Better!” Rio exclaimed with a grin. “Now let’s work on that spin.” She demonstrated slowly, her movements fluid and deliberate, her years of experience clear in the effortless way she spun on the ball of her foot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“See? You start here, push off from your back foot, and keep your eyes on one spot as you turn. That’s called spotting—it helps you not get dizzy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Whoa,” Nicky whispered, his eyes wide with admiration. “How do you not fall over?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Magic,” Rio teased, winking at him.  </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tried to mimic her, spinning with so much enthusiasm that he stumbled and nearly toppled over. Rio caught him with a laugh, steadying him before he hit the floor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not bad for your first attempt,” she said, helping him back to his feet. “But maybe a little less <em>zoom</em> and a little more control.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From the couch, Agatha had abandoned all pretense of focusing on her papers. Her gaze was fixed on them, her smile softening as she watched Rio guide Nicky with infinite patience.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio demonstrated the spin again, this time slower, and Nicky mimicked her movements with growing determination. His little tongue poked out in concentration, and his arms were still a bit wobbly, but his effort was undeniable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re getting there!” Rio cheered, claping lightly. “One more time, and don’t forget to spot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky tried again, his laughter echoed through the room, joining Rio’s as she corrected his form or teased him gently about his dramatic attempts. Agatha’s hand drifted to her chin as she leaned forward, her heart swelling at the sight. It wasn’t just the dancing—it was the bond between them, the way Rio’s lightness brought out Nicky’s joy, and the way Nicky’s boundless energy seemed to reflect the love he felt for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s voice carried across the room, full of encouragement. “You’ve got this, bud. One day, you’re going to be the star of your own recital.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky spun again, this time a little steadier, and when he stopped, he threw his arms in the air with triumphant flair. “Did you see that? I did it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You sure did!” Rio laughed, pulling him into a quick hug. “Keep practicing, and you’ll be spinning like a pro in no time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back against the couch, her smile widening as she spoke, her voice warm and teasing. “With a teacher like Rio, how could he not?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked over her shoulder, catching Agatha’s eye, and winked. “Again, flattery will get you everywhere,” she said, though her cheeks flushed with faint color.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, the light catching in her eyes. “It’s not flattery if it’s true, my love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes playfully but couldn’t quite hide the smile tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed up at both of them, his energy undimmed as he grabbed Rio’s hand. “Can we do it again? I wanna get it perfect!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, letting him pull her back to the center of the room. “Alright, little man, let’s give it another go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few more tries, Nicky managed a decent spin, and Rio cheered, sweeping him into a hug. “That was awesome! You’re going to rock it at your next class.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really?” Nicky asked, his cheeks flushed from excitement and effort.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really,” Rio confirmed, smoothing his hair. “You’ve got natural talent. Just keep practicing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha finally set the papers aside, her curiosity and amusement winning out. Rising to her feet, she smoothed her jeans and walked over to where Rio and Nicky stood. “Alright, Nureyev,” she said, her voice laced with playful authority. “How about we give your teacher a well-deserved break and let her show us how it’s really done?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes widened in alarm, her hands immediately going up in protest. “Oh, no. This is Nicky’s moment. I’m just here to guide.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched a perfectly shaped brow, her smirk growing. “Oh, come on, love. We both know you’ve got more than a few moves left in you. Don’t make me pull rank.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could formulate a response, Nicky bounced on the balls of his feet, clapping his hands together with the enthusiasm only a child could muster. “Yes, yes, yes! Please, Rio! Show us!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, long and dramatic, but the smile tugging at the corners of her lips betrayed her. “Fine,” she relented, shaking her head as if they had both twisted her arm. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, stepping aside and gesturing grandly to the open floor. “The stage is yours, my darling.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the warmth spreading through her chest. With a small shake of her shoulders, she moved to the center of the room, her posture shifting effortlessly into that of a trained dancer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky watched in wide-eyed anticipation as Rio began. Her movements were fluid and precise, each twirl and leap exuding a quiet grace that spoke to years of practice without overdoing it. She spun on the tips of her toes, her arms extending as though she were carving shapes into the air, and for a moment, the living room seemed to transform into something grander—a stage lit by golden light, where Rio was the star, in a pale blue tutu and a tiara on top of her dark hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s hands flew to his mouth as he watched, utterly enraptured. “You’re amazing!” he burst out as Rio ended with a final twirl, lowering into an elegant bow, one arm close to her chest and the other straight in line with her torso towards her bent knee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room erupted into applause—well, as much as two people could make. Nicky clapped wildly, jumping up and down with sheer delight, while Agatha’s hands met slowly but with deliberate warmth. Her gaze was steady on Rio, filled with admiration and a hint of something else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio straightened, brushing a strand of hair that had escaped her ponytail, her cheeks flushed but her smile genuine. “Alright, alright, that’s enough,” she said, trying to downplay the praise but failing miserably as her grin grew wider.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, her voice low and fond as she teased, “I think I just saw the ghost of that tiara.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky was practically bouncing with excitement, his hands clasped together as he looked up at Agatha with his most convincing puppy-dog eyes. “Mama, come on! You have to try, too! Rio can teach both of us!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms in mock defiance. “Me? Dancing? Oh, I think not, ballerino. I’m much better at cheering from the sidelines.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mamaaaa,” Nicky whined, grabbing her hand and tugging with all the determination of a pint-sized persuader. “Please? It’ll be so much fun! And Rio’s the best teacher in the whole world!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, resting a hand on her hip as she looked at Agatha. “Come on, love. It’s just us. No audience. Besides, don’t you want to show Nicky how it’s done?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha heaved an exaggerated sigh, though the soft smile tugging at her lips betrayed her growing amusement. “Fine,” she relented, unfolding her arms and shaking her head in mock resignation. “But let’s set expectations low, shall we? My last dance lesson was probably before <em>you</em> were born,” she added, pointing at Rio with a playful smirk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress her grin. “Well, then, it’s high time you had a refresher, don’t you think?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky cheered in triumph, grabbing Agatha’s hand and practically dragging her toward the open space in the center of the room, which had unofficially been transformed into their makeshift dance studio. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio clapped her hands together. “Alright, let’s start simple. Nicky, show your mama the preparation pose we worked on earlier. Remember: strong and steady.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky immediately snapped into position, his arms stretched out like a miniature professional, his chest puffed up with pride. Agatha blinked at him, her expression one of mock trepidation. “Well, look at you, mister professional. Now I have to keep up, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stifled a laugh, gesturing for Agatha to follow. “Your turn, love. Feet like this, arms like that. And… don’t forget to smile!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed dramatically as she attempted to mirror Nicky’s stance. The result was… less than perfect. Her arms were a bit stiff, her posture slightly awkward. Nicky giggled, his laugh high and infectious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, <em>Mama</em>,” Rio said gently, stepping beside her. She placed her hands lightly on Agatha’s shoulders, guiding her into a more relaxed position. “Drop your shoulders a bit, and keep your head up. There you go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced at Rio out of the corner of her eye, her expression softening into something more tender. “You’re enjoying this way too much,” she murmured, though her tone carried no edge.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, her hand brushing Agatha’s arm as she stepped back. “You bet I am,” she replied, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “Let’s see if you can keep up.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They moved on to basic arm positions and foot placements, with Rio patiently guiding them through each step. Her voice was calm but encouraging, her movements precise as she demonstrated each position. Nicky followed with boundless enthusiasm, his arms and legs a little wobbly but his determination shining through. Agatha, on the other hand… well, she tried.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, now let’s add a spin,” Rio announced, stepping into the center of the room. She demonstrated a slow, elegant pirouette, her movements fluid and controlled. When she stopped, she flashed a smile at her two students. “Your turn. Let’s see what you’ve got.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t hesitate. He spun on the spot, his arms flailing wildly and his feet stomping more than turning. He stopped abruptly, his eyes wide as he grinned at Rio. “How’d I do?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Perfect!” Rio declared, giving him a high five. “That was amazing, little man. Now, Mama’s turn.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, her hands resting on her hips. “You’re really enjoying this, aren’t you?” she said again, her voice tinged with mock suspicion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, I am,” Rio replied with a wink, stepping back to give Agtaha space. “Go on, love. Show us what you’ve got.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a dramatic sigh, Agatha squared her shoulders and attempted a spin. Her form was stiff, her footing uncertain, and as she completed a rather clumsy turn, she stumbled, reaching out instinctively to grab Rio’s arm for balance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky burst into giggles, clapping his hands. “Mama, that was funny!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio steadied Agatha, laughter bubbling up as she gave her an exaggerated look of mock approval. “Not bad for a first try,” she teased. “But I think you might need a little more practice before we book your debut on stage.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, her tone playful. “Oh, really? Let’s see if <em>you</em> can do better,” she shot back, taking Rio by surprise as she grabbed her hand and spun her into an impromptu twirl.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Caught off guard, Rio let out a startled laugh as she stumbled into Agatha’s arms. “Hey! That wasn’t fair,” she said, though the smile on her face said otherwise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, unwilling to be left out, threw his arms in the air and yelled, “Me too!” He launched himself at them, wrapping his little arms around their legs in a triumphant tackle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">What had started as a structured dance lesson dissolved into chaos. Rio shook her head, laughing, and walked over to the speaker. “Alright, you two troublemakers, if we’re going to dance, let’s do it right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned on some music, a lively tune that filled the room with energy. Nicky squealed with excitement, immediately spinning in circles. Agatha joined in, spinning him around with exaggerated, dramatic movements that sent Nicky into fits of laughter. Rio twirled and leaped around them, her genuine grace now mixed with a carefree silliness, her theatrical expressions making Nicky laugh so hard he nearly fell over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the music slowed down, all three of them were sprawled on the living room floor, the once orderly space now littered with scattered cushions and a pair of socks Nicky had flung off mid-action. Their chests rose and fell as they tried to catch their breath, their laughter slowly fading into quiet giggles. Nicky lay nestled between them, his small body warm and snug against Agatha’s side, his cheeks flushed from all the excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“See, Mama?” Nicky mumbled, his voice muffled by her shirt. “You’re a great dancer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head to look at him, her lips curving into a soft smile. “Well, I had the best teachers,” she replied, her voice low and full of affection. She leaned over to press a kiss to Nicky’s forehead, lingering just long enough to hear his contented sigh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio watched the exchange with a quiet warmth in her eyes. As Agatha turned toward her, Rio shifted closer to rest her head on Agatha’s shoulder. Her free hand found Nicky’s hair, her fingers weaving soothing patterns through his messy curls.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Best dance party ever,” Rio murmured, her voice soft but filled with sincerity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agreed,” Agatha said, her tone carrying that rare warmth she reserved for the two people she loved most. Her arm wrapped around Rio, pulling her closer, as her other hand rested protectively on Nicky’s back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a while, none of them spoke. They simply stayed there, tangled together on the floor as the music faded into silence and the gentle hum of the world outside drifted through the windows. The room, though dimly lit now, seemed to glow with the quiet joy of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shadows that once lingered in the corners of their lives felt distant, pushed away by the strength of the love they shared. Together, they basked in the simple, perfect peace of their little family, letting the happiness of the present wrap around them like a warm blanket.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the quiet of the night wrapped around them, Rio and Agatha lay side by side in their bed, their hands intertwined beneath the covers. The laughter and warmth of the day still lingered in the air, but the room now held a soft, serene stillness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her head to look at Rio, her gaze tender as her fingers brushed a stray curl away from Rio’s face , her fingers lingering just a moment longer than necessary.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Agatha murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, as though the words were meant only for the two of them and no one else in the world, “one day, I’ll ask you to marry me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, her eyes widening slightly before a soft, surprised smile spread across her face. Her cheeks flushed with warmth as she shifted to face Agatha fully, her heart thudding in her chest in that way it always did when Agatha surprised her with moments like this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And I’ll say yes,” she whispered back, her tone sure and steady but carrying an undeniable softness, as though she were sharing a secret too sacred to say aloud.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her thumb brushing over Rio’s knuckles. “But I’ll do it right,” she added, her voice rich with promise, the weight of her words resonating in the stillness of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, her smile growing as she studied Agatha’s face—the face she had come to know so well, yet one that still managed to captivate her every day. Her eyes shone with affection, with trust, with everything she didn’t need words to express.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” she said simply, her tone light yet carrying the quiet strength of her unwavering belief in Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a long moment, neither of them spoke, letting the unspoken depth of their promise fill the space between them. The air felt heavier, but not in a burdensome way—it was heavy with meaning, with a love that needed no further explanation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s forehead. “Good,” she murmured against her skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled as she tucked herself closer to Agatha, resting her back against her front with Agatha's arm curling around her middle, her hand resting in Rio's stomach, her breath falling in time with Agatha’s steady rhythm. Her voice, already heavy with sleep, was a soft murmur when she added, “Just don’t make me wait too long.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed quietly, the sound vibrating through Rio’s frame. “Not too long,” she promised.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And with that, the two of them drifted into a peaceful sleep, their fingers still entwined beneath the covers. The quiet promise of their future together wrapped around them, warming the cool night air and settling over their hearts like the softest of skies.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p>

  <em>This is the use of memory:</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>For liberation—not less of love but expanding</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Of love beyond desire, and so liberation</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>From the future as well as the past. </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">                  (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning sunlight filtered through the tall windows of the lecture hall on a cool Wednesday morning, casting golden streaks across the polished wooden floors and bathing the room in a gentle glow. Agatha stood at the front, watching over her students like an imperious hawk. Her movements were fluid, every gesture purposeful, and her voice resonated with a smooth confidence that captivated her audience. The lecture hall was packed, but for Rio, it felt like they were the only two people in the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seated in her usual spot in the second row, Rio had her notebook open and pen poised, determined to keep her mind on 20<sup>th</sup> century poetry. She tried to focus on the words flowing from Agatha’s lips—on T.S. Eliot and the way fragmented narrators dismantled the notion of objective truth. But it was proving to be an impossible feat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was in her element, her sharp blue blazer tailored to perfection, accentuating her statuesque figure. The light glinted off her black-rimmed glasses, framing her piercing blue eyes in a way that seemed almost unfair. Rio could feel a familiar warmth creeping up her neck when Agatha pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose with a delicate flick of her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, the pen twirling began.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was effortless, a casual rotation of a sleek black pen between Agatha’s fingers, as if it were merely an extension of her. She continued to lecture, her voice dipping to emphasize a key point about the aesthetic of fragmentation in Eliot’s later works<em>,</em> but Rio barely registered the words. Her focus had shifted entirely to that small, infuriatingly elegant motion. <em>How does she make that look so good?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pressed her pen harder against her notebook, scribbling notes that were increasingly illegible in an effort to appear focused. Her mind, however, betrayed her—flashing back to the night before, when Agatha’s hands weren’t preoccupied with pens or chalkboards but with her. The memory of Agatha’s touch, the way she had traced either lazy or frantic patterns across Rio’s skin as they lay tangled together in the soft afterglow of their bedroom, sent a pulse racing through her veins.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced up again, her gaze drifting to Agatha’s lips as they formed each word with precise articulation. <em>Body and soul,</em> Rio thought, her pulse quickening at the mere recollection of their whispered conversations and the quiet intimacy they shared when the world was left behind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned slightly against the podium, her fingers brushing the edge as she made a particularly insightful remark about the disjointed narrative structure of some text that Rio hadn’t even picked up on. Her voice dropped lower, and Rio swore she could feel the resonance of it in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her notebook remained open, the same line of notes untouched for several minutes now. <em>Pull it together, Vidal,</em> she scolded herself, though the thought was half-hearted at best. Even as she tried to redirect her attention to the lecture, her gaze inevitably found its way back to Agatha—the way her hair framed her face just in the way Rio had seen Agatha work on that morning in their bathroom mirror, the faint smile that tugged at her lips when she asked a question and a student fumbled for an answer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The voice cut through Rio’s haze like a blade. Her head snapped up, heart skipping a beat as she met Agatha’s challenging gaze. “Yes?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room seemed to still for a moment, the hum of ambient noise fading to a dull background as Agatha regarded her. Though her expression was professionally neutral, the faint quirk of her lips betrayed her amusement. Agatha knew. She always knew. <em>I’m going to kill her… If she doesn’t kill me first…</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Your thoughts on how Eliot’s use of the fragmented narrator complicates our understanding of truth?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, her mind scrambling to catch up. She willed herself to appear calm, even as heat crawled up her neck and into her cheeks. Swallowing hard, she nodded. “I—I think it forces the reader to work harder to piece together meaning, and in doing so, it mirrors how truth can be subjective or multifaceted.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A flicker of approval passed through Agatha’s eyes, and her lips curved into the faintest of smiles. “Good,” she replied, her gaze holding Rio’s for a heartbeat longer than necessary before sweeping back to the rest of the class. “Now, does anyone else think this fragmentation alienates the reader, or does it engage them more deeply?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room stirred as a few students murmured and flipped through their notes. Rio exhaled softly, her shoulders dropping a fraction. She hoped no one had noticed the flush in her cheeks or the way her pulse raced from that fleeting moment of attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But regaining her focus was easier said than done. Agatha was moving again, pacing slowly in front of the podium, her necklace catching the light with each step towards the window. Rio couldn’t stop her eyes from tracking her every motion—the slight roll of her sleeves over her elbows, revealing elegant forearms, the deliberate way she gestured with her hands, demanding attention with effortless precision.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then there was the pen. That damn pen. Agatha twirled it between her fingers again as she listened to a student’s hesitant answer, her expression thoughtful. The smooth rhythm of the motion was hypnotic, and Rio found herself wondering—absurdly—how many times she’d seen those same fingers trace other kinds of patterns on her own body, only to now watch them absentmindedly twirl a piece of plastic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At one point, Agatha’s gaze flicked to Rio again, and their eyes met briefly. Rio quickly looked down, her heart racing. <em>Stop it,</em> she chastised herself internally. <em>She’s just teaching. You’re supposed to be listening.</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">Rio forced herself to jot down the words, Agatha was saying, hoping the act of writing would steady her. But even the deliberate motion of her pen couldn’t drown out the sound of Agatha’s voice, so rich and deliberate, carrying over the room with an ease that left no question as to who held its attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She dared another glance, and her heart sank and soared in equal measure when she found Agatha looking at her again. The look was brief, fleeting—just a flicker of something playful—but it sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the class finally ended, Rio stayed rooted to her seat, her heart still racing from the lingering tension of the past hour. She kept her head down as the other students shuffled out, the low hum of their conversations fading into the hallway. She needed a moment to steady herself, to calm the erratic thrum of her pulse before facing the outside world—or worse, Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the front of the room, Agatha remained composed, methodically gathering her notes and slipping them into her leather folder. Her movements were unhurried, deliberate, a quiet contrast to the chaos Rio felt within herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, with a deep breath, Rio stood and slung her bag over her shoulder, willing herself to walk out like a normal person. But as she approached the exit, she felt the weight of a familiar gaze on her. She glanced up—and froze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes were on her, sharp yet amused, with a flicker of something else beneath the surface. It wasn’t just amusement. It was knowing. And worse, it was mutual.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Vidal,” Agatha called, her voice smooth and unhurried, stopping Rio in her tracks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned slowly, trying—and failing—to mask her nervousness. “Yes, <em>Dr. Harkness</em>?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head slightly, her lips curving into a faint, knowing smile. Her voice was low, pitched just for Rio. “You seemed… unusually focused today. I’m pleased to see you’re so <em>engaged</em> with the material.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The deliberate weight on the word <em>engaged</em> sent a jolt through Rio, her cheeks flushing. She scrambled to find her voice, her thoughts colliding like mismatched puzzle pieces. “Uh, yes. Very… engaging,” she managed, cursing the way her voice wavered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes gleamed with amusement, and Rio swore she saw the faintest twitch of her lips, as though the older woman were savoring the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Desperate to regain control of the situation—or at least distract herself—Rio cleared her throat and straightened her shoulders. “Actually, I was hoping we could schedule a quick meeting about my thesis,” she blurted, her words rushing out. “<em>Right now</em>.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched an elegant brow, her expression unreadable except for the trace of a smirk at the corner of her mouth. “A quick meeting,” she repeated, her voice smooth as silk. “About your thesis.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Rio replied, her tone too eager, too high-pitched. “Just a short discussion. I’ve been working on some ideas, and I thought it would be a good time to get your feedback.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed her folder with deliberate slowness, the soft click reverberating in the quiet room. She stepped around the desk, her heels tapping softly against the floor as she approached Rio. “As it happens,” she said, her voice a study in calm control, “I have half an hour free before my next meeting. Shall we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded quickly, her throat dry as she followed Agatha toward the door. Her footsteps felt clumsy in comparison to Agatha’s confident strides, each one perfectly measured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The hallway stretched out before them, quiet and empty, but the tension between them felt palpable, as though the air itself crackled with unspoken words. Rio’s mind raced, alternating between trying not to fall and avoiding the way Agatha’s blazer accentuated the line of her shoulders and of her….</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced over her shoulder as they walked, her eyes catching Rio’s briefly, pulling her out of her questionable thoughts. “You seem a bit… preoccupied, Miss Vidal,” she remarked lightly, her tone betraying nothing but professionalism.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine,” Rio lied, her voice cracking slightly as she hurried to match Agatha’s pace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good,” Agatha replied, her lips twitching into that infuriatingly knowing smile again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they reached Agatha’s office, Rio’s nerves were pushed to the breaking point. She hovered awkwardly as Agatha unlocked the door, stepping aside to let her in. The office smelled faintly of cedar and Agatha’s perfume, the neat rows of books and carefully arranged papers reflecting Agatha’s meticulous nature.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio dropped her bag onto the chair across from Agatha’s desk with a soft thud, then quickly sank into the chair herself. Her hands gripped the armrests, her fingers digging into the plush fabric in an effort to steady herself. The moment Agatha closed the door with a soft click, the weight of the room shifted. It was just the two of them now, and Rio’s heart began to beat faster with every second that passed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, ever composed, settled into her own chair with deliberate calm, folding her hands neatly on the desk. Her gaze never wavered from Rio as she spoke, the quiet sultry authority in her voice sending a shiver down Rio’s spine. “Now,” she began, her tone cool and collected, “let’s hear these ideas of yours.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shifted in her seat, suddenly feeling every ounce of the tension building between them. Her pulse raced in her ears, drowning out her thoughts. She swallowed hard before blurting out, her voice almost too loud in the quiet room, “You’re doing this on purpose.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, the hint of amusement tugging at the corner of her lips as she feigned innocence. “Doing what, my darling?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, feeling the heat rise in her cheeks. “You know exactly what! The glasses, the pen, the way you look at me during class—it’s maddening!” She threw her hands up in frustration, her voice cracking with the overwhelming mix of desire and exasperation that had been building since the moment she’d walked into the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, effortlessly composed, leaned back in her chair, crossing one leg over the other with an almost casual air of confidence. She looked at Rio as though she were savoring every moment of her discomfort. “You seemed very focused earlier,” Agatha teased, her voice laced with a hint of mischief. “Or was that just a valiant effort to hide your distraction?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes narrowed, her cheeks burning with the intensity of Agatha’s scrutiny. “You’re impossible,” she muttered under her breath, wishing she could hide from the overwhelming attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, slow and knowing. “And yet,” she said, rising from her chair with a fluid grace that made Rio’s stomach tighten, “you’re here, asking for a meeting you don’t need, because you couldn’t wait until we were home to see me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened her mouth, ready to protest, but the words caught in her throat as Agatha stepped toward her with predatory ease. Every movement was deliberate, calculated, designed to torment her. She leaned back against the desk just inches away from Rio, their proximity making Rio’s breath hitch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve been very quiet, Miss Vidal,” Agatha continued, her voice dropping to a lower register, thick with mock professionalism. “Do you need me to prompt you further? Or perhaps you’re distracted again?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, her body suddenly unable to sit still. Every tiny detail about Agatha’s presence—the way she adjusted her glasses, the way her gaze remained fixed on Rio as if she were the only thing in the room—was pushing Rio to the edge. Her thoughts scattered, unable to focus on anything other than Agatha, the intoxicating closeness between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The silence in the room was thick with tension, suffocating yet magnetic. Rio shifted again, desperate to regain some semblance of control. “I—” she began, but the words caught in her throat as Agatha leaned in just a little closer, the scent of her perfume lingering in the air, sharp and intoxicating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Perhaps,” Agatha murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, as she sat back down, “you’d prefer if I didn’t make this so… difficult for you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s stomach twisted. She was certain Agatha knew exactly what she was doing, knew exactly how much this was getting to her. And yet, it seemed Agatha was savoring every moment, every flicker of discomfort, every unspoken desire that lingered between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s it,” Rio said suddenly, her voice low and laced with tension. Her breath was uneven as she stood and moved towards the door, locking it with quick, decisive motions. She checked the blinds, ensuring they were drawn tightly, blocking out any possible distractions. The air between them thickened, charged with something undeniable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes gleamed with curiosity, though her smile remained unchanged, a knowing tug at the corners of her lips. “Oh? Decided to finally share your thoughts?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she turned back, her eyes blazing with a mix of frustration, desire, and something else, something deeper. She crossed the room with a few swift strides, not bothering to conceal the raw urgency in her movements. Before Agatha could react, Rio was on her, gripping the armrests of Agatha’s chair with fierce determination. Their faces were mere inches apart, the heat between them palpable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re insufferable,” Rio growled, her voice thick with emotion. Her breath brushed against Agatha’s lips as she spoke, the words laced with a longing she couldn’t suppress any longer. “Do you have any idea what you’re doing to me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk widened, her gaze never leaving Rio’s face. There was a predatory gleam in her eyes, a quiet confidence that only seemed to make Rio’s pulse race even faster. “Oh, I have some idea,” Agatha purred, her voice dropping to a teasing whisper, a challenge wrapped in velvet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without another word, Rio’s lips crashed into Agatha’s, fierce and unrelenting. Agatha let out a soft hum of approval, her hands slipping up to grip Rio’s waist, pulling her closer as Rio climbed onto her lap, straddling her with a sense of purpose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You and those glasses,” Rio murmured against Agatha’s lips, her hands trembling slightly as they moved to remove the glasses from Agatha’s face, tossing them onto the desk with a carelessness that didn’t match the reverence she had shown them earlier. “Do you even know what they do to me? The way you look at me over them, like you own the world—and me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled darkly, her hands sliding up Rio’s back, pulling her even closer, their bodies pressed together with a fierce heat. “I do own you,” she said, her voice thick with desire and a smug satisfaction. “You make that quite clear every time you look at me like you’re ready to devour me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, a growl rumbling low in her chest as her fingers tangled in Agatha’s hair. She kissed her again, deeply, pouring every ounce of frustration, yearning, and heated longing into the kiss. Agatha responded in kind, her usual composed exterior cracking just enough to let the passion slip through, raw and unguarded.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio’s lips trailed down Agatha’s neck, she whispered, her voice a hushed reverence, “You drive me crazy, you know that? The way you move, the way you speak—it’s impossible to focus on anything else. It’s like everything else disappears when I’m with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good,” Agatha breathed, her voice breathless, but still threaded with authority. “That’s exactly the effect I was hoping for.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled back just enough to look into Agatha’s eyes, the fire between them intensifying. Her lips curled into a wicked smile, “You’re so smug,” she teased, brushing her thumb over Agatha’s swollen lips, her voice dropping to something teasing and dangerous. “I should make you pay for teasing me like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched an eyebrow, her smirk returning in full force, every bit as confident and enticing. “Oh, I’d love to see you try, my love,” she said, her voice rich with unspoken promises.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, the sound low and sultry as she leaned in to kiss Agatha once more. This time, their kiss was slower, more deliberate. Rio took her time, savoring every second of the connection between them. For once, it seemed, she was the one in control—determined to make Agatha feel the same unrelenting desire that had been coursing through her veins all morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But as the kiss deepened and Agatha’s hands tightened on her hips, pulling her closer still, Rio felt a soft surrender sweep over her. The truth settled in her mind as Agatha’s body pressed against hers, each movement a reminder of who held the power in this dynamic. Agatha pulled back just slightly, her voice a hushed whisper against Rio’s ear. “For the record,” she said with a reverent glint in her eyes, “you own me just as much, my love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a soft sigh, the tension that had once existed between them now a faint memory. As their lips met again, deeper this time, Rio realized something that both thrilled and humbled her—control was never something she would completely have with Agatha. And honestly, she didn’t mind one bit. With Agatha, she was willing to lose herself, to give in to whatever force pulled them together. Because, in this moment, it was clear that they were equals, bound by desire and unspoken promises.</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">The faint sound of footsteps and voices echoed down the hallway, jolting both women back to reality. Rio froze, her fingers still tangled in Agatha’s hair, her breath warm against the curve of Agatha’s neck. Agatha’s body stiffened for a moment, her posture sharpening as she tilted her head slightly, listening for a few seconds, her eyes narrowing with a hint of amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Looks like we’re not as alone as we thought,” Agatha murmured, her voice a cool, controlled whisper, though the amusement lingered in her tone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped a beat, panic flickering through her before she quickly slid off Agatha’s lap. She adjusted her blouse with frantic precision, her cheeks burning with a mixture of embarrassment and lingering desire. Agatha, on the other hand, remained effortlessly composed. She slid her glasses back on, smoothing her hair back as though nothing had happened, her demeanor a perfect portrait of casual poise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Relax, love,” Agatha said with a soft chuckle, her hands meeting over her chest as she leaned back in her chair, looking up at Rio who as now standing over her. “No one’s going to barge in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Still,” Rio muttered, her voice quieter now, a mix of nerves and something else that lingered in her chest like a slow-burning flame. “We probably shouldn’t tempt fate.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a small nod, but her teasing smirk didn’t fade. She leaned over her desk, watching Rio with eyes that burned with unspoken understanding. Rio quickly grabbed her notebook, her hands still a little shaky as she tried to regain her composure, but every movement felt charged with the memory of their shared moment. The sound of the footsteps in the hall seemed to echo louder now as Rio reached for the door, her legs trembling just a little as she closed the distance between herself and the outside world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before she could turn the doorknob, Agatha’s voice rang out again, calm and casual but with that unmistakable warmth in her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Before you go,” Agatha began, her tone still light but her presence commanding, “I’ll drop Nicky off at the dance center later for his class. I’ll pick you both up afterward, and we can head home together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hand froze on the doorknob, and she turned back toward Agatha, her lips curving into a small smile. There was something in her voice, something soft and affectionate that made Rio’s heart flutter. “Perfect,” she replied, her voice a little breathless with affection, her smile deepening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha returned the smile, her eyes holding Rio’s with a kind of quiet indulgence. For a brief moment, it felt like everything else faded into the background, leaving just the two of them in that intimate space. But then, with a playful flick of her fingers, Agatha broke the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Go,” she said, her voice teasing but warm. “Before I change my mind and keep you here longer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, shaking her head as the tension between them melted into something lighter, warmer. She opened the door, stepping into the hallway with a reluctant but satisfied sigh, her heart still pounding, her mind still swirling with thoughts of Agatha. She stole one last glance over her shoulder, catching Agatha’s gaze once more before the door clicked shut behind her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">Rio pushed through the heavy doors of the library, the cool air doing little to dispel the heat still prickling her skin. Her cheeks burned with the memories of what had transpired earlier, and no matter how hard she tried to shake it off, she couldn’t seem to banish the feeling of Agatha’s gaze, the way her touch lingered, the heat of their kiss. The library’s hushed atmosphere, the scent of books and paper, only added to her sense of unease as she made her way toward the back corner, where Alice and Jen were stationed as usual.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice was leaned back in her chair, her headphones draped carelessly around her neck, eyes fixed on her notebook as she scribbled something down. Jen, on the other hand, was lazily twirling a pen between her fingers – and even the sight of it sent Rio in another spiral, remembering other fingers twirling another pen - her laptop open in front of her to what looked like an unintelligible sea of chemistry diagrams. When they both caught sight of Rio, Alice’s lips curled into a knowing smirk, and Jen paused mid-spin, her eyes narrowing with mischievous intent.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">“Well, well,” Alice drawled, her voice practically dripping with curiosity and wicked glee. She leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms as her gaze fixed on Rio like a predator stalking its prey. “What’s this? Miss Vidal, why do you look like you just ran a marathon—or <em>something</em> equally… exhausting?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, but the heat of her cheeks betrayed her. She tossed her bag onto the table with more force than necessary and immediately set to work organizing her laptop and notes, anything to distract herself from Alice’s unrelenting gaze. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she muttered, her tone flat, praying the conversation would die a quick death.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen’s grin widened, her gaze flicking between Alice and Rio, sensing an opening. “Oh no, Alice is right. You’re all flushed, Vidal,” she said, her voice playful but with a sharp edge of curiosity. She put the pen down and leaned forward slightly. “Spill. What’s going on?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nothing,” Rio replied, a little too quickly. She pulled her notebook out of her bag, arranging the papers with exaggerated care as if they would somehow shield her from the relentless teasing she knew was coming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned forward with a predatory gleam in her eyes, her smile widening to almost impossibly wide proportions. “Oh, come on, Rio. You’ve got that <em>look</em>—the one people get when they’ve been thinking about something very… distracting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, her fingers slightly trembling as she adjusted her notes, trying to regain control. “I was just in a meeting about my thesis,” she muttered, her voice almost too soft, too flustered. She didn’t dare look up, too afraid of the teasing glint in Alice’s eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen’s pen stopped mid-twirl, the sudden pause in the air between them a clear sign of her attentiveness. She exchanged a brief, knowing look with Alice before her gaze returned to Rio, her grin widening as if she’d just uncovered some hidden treasure. “A meeting, huh? With <em>Dr. Harkness, </em>I presume,” she drawled, the word stretching out like a tease. “Must’ve been a very <em>stimulating</em> discussion.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Enough,” Rio groaned, her face now a deep shade of red, almost matching her flustered expression. She dropped her head into her hands for a brief moment, then looked up, trying to muster as much composure as she could. “Can’t a girl just have a normal meeting without you two assuming things?” she asked, though the faint smile tugging at her lips betrayed the struggle to pretend she wasn’t entertained by the relentless teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Normal?” Alice said, feigning shock and pressing a hand to her chest as if Rio had just committed a great sin. “Since when has anything between you and <em>Dr. Harkness</em> been normal? You literally live together, Rio. We know better than that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen chuckled, leaning back in her chair with a smug look on her face as she tapped her pen against her notebook. “Seriously though, you’re flushed, your hair’s all mussed—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It is <em>not</em>,” Rio interjected immediately, reaching up to pat her hair self-consciously, suddenly aware of every strand that had probably fallen out of place. She sighed in defeat as Jen continued, completely ignoring her protest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And you’ve got that ridiculous little grin,” Jen finished, her voice full of knowing amusement. “So, spill. What did you do to Agatha? Or should I say, <em>what did Agatha do to you</em>?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, her face burning even more, if that was possible. “I hate you both,” she muttered, half-joking, half-exasperated. Her cheeks were on fire, and no matter how hard she tried to hide it, it was obvious she was fighting a battle she wasn’t going to win.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p class="p1">“Oh, come on, Rio! You’re making it too easy!” Alice leaned forward, her grin absolutely wicked. “I’m not saying you have to share <em>everything</em>… but just a little detail wouldn’t hurt.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Absolutely not,” Rio groaned, shaking her head but unable to keep the corners of her lips from twitching upward.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Jen chuckled, raising her water bottle in a mock toast. “To Dr. Harkness,” she said, her voice smooth. “The woman who’s clearly the reason Rio’s looking so—what’s the word—<em>ravished?</em>”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“<em>Jen!</em>” Rio practically shrieked, her voice high-pitched as she grabbed one of Jen's discarded pens and threw it at her friend.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Alice ducked as the pen flew past her and cackled. “Oh, this is the best entertainment I’ve had all week,” she wheezed. “Agatha’s got you absolutely wrecked, Rio, and I love it.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio groaned louder, leaning back in her chair as if she could disappear into it entirely. “You’re <em>both</em> the worst,” she grumbled, though the faint smile on her lips betrayed her affection despite her embarrassment.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Maybe,” Alice said, grinning wide, “but at least we’re honest about it.”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">"Well, I still hate you both."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, you don’t,” Alice said, leaning her chin on her hand, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “We’re just trying to keep you grounded. Don’t forget, we’re the ones who knew you before you were the cool professor’s girlfriend. Back when you were just a stressed-out literature nerd.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m <em>still</em> a stressed-out literature nerd,” Rio muttered under her breath, her lips quirking up despite herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s grin only widened. “Fair enough. But seriously, you’re giving off some serious ‘just made out with my hot teacher’ vibes,” she teased, her tone dripping with exaggerated sweetness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tried to ignore the comment, her hands shaking slightly as she opened her laptop in an attempt to dive into her work, but the truth was, her flushed cheeks gave her away. “Can we focus on our theses now?” she asked, forcing an air of professionalism, but it was clear the effort was half-hearted. Her fingers danced over the keys as if that would somehow distract from the heat still lingering in her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen leaned closer across the table, her grin wicked, and Rio couldn’t help but notice how she seemed so comfortable with the teasing, as though she’d done it a thousand times before. “You’re so obvious, Rio,” she said, her voice low and almost conspiratorial. “I bet Agatha knows exactly what she’s doing to you, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice let out a loud laugh at Jen’s comment, then quickly shushed herself as the noise caught the attention of nearby students. “Oops,” she muttered, still grinning like a cat who had caught a mouse. “Sorry, got carried away. Okay then, we’ll let you be. For now. But you have to halp me with these readings, or I’m bringing this up again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the conversation shifted back to their academic work, Rio let out a breath of relief, though a smile tugged at her lips despite herself. She couldn’t help but appreciate the bond she shared with Alice and Jen, even if they delighted in making her squirm. Life with them around was never dull, always filled with banter and chaos, and no matter how embarrassing it got, Rio wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She forced herself to focus on the readings, but even as her friends began discussing the texts, her thoughts kept wandering back to Agatha, to the way her presence still lingered on Rio’s mind like a soft hum, impossible to ignore. No matter how much Rio tried to redirect her attention, the feeling remained—a warm, chaotic, undeniable pull that even her friends couldn’t tease away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And somewhere deep down, Rio was secretly glad that it was a feeling she didn’t want to escape.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">                  (T. S. Eliot. “The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The late afternoon sunlight streamed through the tall windows of the university hallways, casting warm, golden streaks across the polished floors of the English Department, almost as if the light itself was welcoming Rio after a long, busy day. Her footsteps echoed softly, the rhythmic sound accompanying the steady pulse of her thoughts as she made her way toward Agatha’s office. Her bag, slightly slung over one shoulder, was a familiar weight, and a faint smile tugged at the corners of her lips. It had been a long day filled with lectures, library sessions, and never-ending deadlines, but the thought of heading home to Agatha and Nicky made everything feel worthwhile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio reached Agatha’s door, she noticed it was slightly ajar, the quiet murmur of Agatha’s voice talking to herself drifting through the crack. With a small smile, she leaned closer, her fingers brushing the cool doorframe. Peering inside, she caught sight of Agatha seated at her desk, her signature dark curls cascading around her face, giving her the kind of sophisticated elegance that Rio found utterly captivating. Agatha was in her usual element—reading glasses perched on her nose as she flipped through a stack of essays, her focused expression radiating effortless authority.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Knocking lightly on the doorframe, Rio couldn’t help but tease, “Hey, Professor. Ready to wrap up for the day?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s head snapped up, her eyes instantly softening as they met the younger woman’s gaze. “Rio,” she greeted, her voice warm, rich with the kind of tenderness that always made Rio’s heart skip a beat. She set her pen down on the desk and leaned back in her chair, her fingers lightly tracing the edge of the armrest. Agatha took a moment to drink in the sight of Rio—her partner standing there, clad in her certain casual grace, now carrying that slightly rumpled, beautiful tiredness from her day. “Let me guess,” Agatha continued, her lips curling into a playful smirk. “You’re here to rescue me from the mountain of mediocrity I’ve been grading?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, stepping inside and closing the door gently behind her. She leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, her expression teasing. “That, and to remind you that your adoring son is waiting for us. Well, probably not waiting—he’s probably bossing Wanda’s twins around—but still.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk turned into a full-blown grin, as she gracefully rose from her chair and slipped off her glasses. “And what about my adoring partner? Is she waiting too?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow, the playful spark in her eyes matching Agatha’s. “Maybe. But if you’re not careful, I might just leave you here with your essays. Let them be the ones who entertain you for the night.” </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s laugh was a rich, low sound that always sent a little shiver down Rio’s spine. She walked over to Rio, her steps confident and sure, stopping just a breath away, so close that Rio could feel the warmth of her presence. “You wouldn’t dare,” Agatha teased, her voice quiet but knowing. “Besides, who else would make sure you eat a proper dinner tonight?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, the smile still on her face despite her best efforts to appear unimpressed. “Touché,” she said softly, reaching out to smooth an imaginary crease on Agatha’s sleeve. “Ready to go?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced at her desk, then back at Rio. “As ready as I’ll ever be. These essays will still be mediocre tomorrow.” She grabbed her coat from the back of her chair and slipped it on, her movements purposeful and deliberate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they walked out together, side by side, not touching, but nor far away from each other either, Rio felt a deep sense of contentment. The day might have been long, but with Agatha by her side and the promise of Nicky’s cheerful chatter waiting at home, everything felt just right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, after they had picked up Nicky from Wanda’s house, the little boy seemed different. Normally a bundle of energy and independence, Nicky was unusually clingy with Rio, as though he couldn’t get close enough to her. His small hand remained firmly clasped in hers, and as they moved around the house, he stayed right beside her, his steps quick to match hers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio went to set the table for dinner, Nicky insisted on being by her side the entire time. He even climbed onto the counter to stay as close to her as possible, his tiny body sitting there with an air of quiet determination. Rio glanced at him, a smile tugging at her lips as she tried to balance her task with his insistence on proximity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At dinner, though, Nicky’s behavior only became more noticeable. He barely touched his food, the usual enthusiasm for mealtime nowhere to be found. Instead, he leaned his head against Rio’s arm, his little body curled up next to her as though seeking comfort, his usually bright eyes duller than normal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, seated across from them, had been watching the exchange with a furrowed brow, her gaze soft but full of concern as she observed the unusual silence from her normally chatty son. She had never seen him like this before—withdrawn, as if carrying a weight he couldn’t quite express.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once Rio had gently coaxed Nicky into eating a few bites, she caught Agatha’s eye across the table. The question was clear in her expression, so she mouthed silently, <em>What’s going on?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a small, almost imperceptible shrug, her lips pressed together as her own confusion mirrored Rio’s. Neither of them could figure out what had caused this sudden shift in Nicky’s behavior.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dinner, when the kitchen had quieted and the last dish was washed, the three of them moved into the living room for their usual evening routine. The soft glow of the lamp filled the space, as Agatha settled onto the couch with a content sigh, Rio next to her. But before she could fully relax, Nicky climbed into Rio’s lap with the urgency of someone who needed to be close.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio welcomed him with open arms, her heart swelling as he snuggled into her chest, his small frame curling into her with a quiet, desperate cling. His hands gripped the fabric of her shirt like it was the only thing tethering him to her, and his head pressed against her, soft and warm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sweatheart,” Rio murmured, her fingers gently stroking his hair, trying to soothe the unease she could feel radiating off him. “What’s going on? You’ve been my little shadow all evening.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t answer immediately. He shifted in her lap, and his face remained pressed to her, as though the mere act of speaking was too much to bear. For a moment, Rio held him tighter, the heaviness in his silence wrapping around her heart like a weight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, after a long pause, his small voice broke through the quiet, muffled by her shirt but trembling with uncertainty. “I don’t know… I just don’t want you to go away.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At his words, both Rio and Agatha froze. They exchanged a glance, their shared understanding pulling at their hearts. The depth of his fear—unspoken, but so raw—was clear now, and it hit both of them in a way that left no room for words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, the tenderness in her eyes deepening as she cradled him even closer. “Why would I go away, Nicky?” she asked, her voice soft and soothing, though her heart ached for him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know,” he mumbled, his voice small, like he was afraid to say it too loudly. “But… but you don’t live with us that long yet. What if you leave?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rawness of his uncertainty hung heavy in the room. Rio’s heart squeezed. She could see it now—the fear of something changing, the worry that their small family wasn’t as permanent as he wanted it to be. And the ache in his voice was too much to ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agathe reached over, brushing Nicky’s hair back with a softness that seemed to calm the air around them. Her hand lingered gently on his head, her voice unwavering as she spoke. “Oh, darling,” she said, her words slow and comforting, “Rio’s not going anywhere. She’s here to stay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hugged him tighter, pressing a tender kiss to his temple as the weight of her promise settled between them. “Of course I’m staying, little love,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “I love you and your Mama so much. We’re a team, remember? You’re stuck with me, kiddo.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His grip tightened as he looked up at her, his eyes wide and uncertain. “You promise?” His voice was so small, so fragile, as if the question itself held the weight of his greatest fear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt tears prick at her eyes, but she smiled, her lips trembling with affection. “I promise,” she said, her voice steady, yet full of love. “Cross my heart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, feeling the tenderness of the moment, leaned closer, wrapping her arms around both of them. She pulled them into a tight embrace, the warmth of their small family filling the space. “See, Nicky?” she said, her voice warm and soothing. “Rio’s not just part of this house. She’s part of our family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At last, Nicky’s tense little body began to relax. His tiny arms wrapped around Rio’s neck, and he sighed, the weight of his fear finally lifting. “Okay,” he whispered, his voice small but relieved, his head resting gently on her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled as she held him, kissing the top of his head. Agatha pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek, her eyes filled with gratitude and love. Together, they settled in, Nicky between them, the three of them wrapped in each other’s warmth for the rest of the evening, playing a game Nicky liked. As they held him close, letting him feel the security of their love, they knew this was exactly what he needed to hear—that they were a family, and nothing would ever take that away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio stayed downstairs, tending to her beloved plants and humming softly, a gentle peace settled over the house. She smiled to herself, grateful for the grounding nature of her little sanctuary.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Agatha guided Nicky upstairs for his bedtime routine. The room was dimly lit, the only light coming from the nightlight in the corner casting a gentle starry  glow across the walls and ceiling. Nicky quietly slipped into bed, clutching his stuffed dragon tightly to his chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha approached him with a tender smile, smoothing his blanket out with practiced hands. She sat down on the edge of the bed, her voice calm and steady as she spoke, knowing that this quiet ritual was one of their favorite parts of the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you want a story tonight, sweetheart?” she asked, her voice warm and familiar, a question she always asked, but tonight, there was a softness to her tone that lingered just a little longer, as though sensing something different in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, however, shook his head slowly, his little face unusually pensive, eyes downcast, as if deep in thought. Agatha tilted her head slightly, her brow furrowing ever so slightly in concern. She watched him for a moment, taking in the subtle shift in his mood. He usually loved story time, his imagination running wild with the adventures he’d ask for, but tonight, there was something about his quiet demeanor that gave her pause.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She leaned in slightly, brushing a stray strand of his hair back from his face, her fingers soft against his skin as she spoke again, her tone gentle and inviting. “What’s on your mind, darling?” she asked, her words barely above a whisper as she studied him with an attentive gaze, hoping to give him the space to open up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shifted a little under the blanket, a small movement that spoke volumes. He seemed to be thinking deeply, hesitating as if unsure of how to begin. Finally, after what felt like an eternity of silence, he looked up at her with wide, searching eyes, his little face full of questions he wasn’t sure how to ask.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama,” he began hesitantly, his voice quieter than usual, as though the weight of what he was about to say had settled heavy on his small shoulders, “can I ask you something?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart softened at his tone, and she leaned in a little closer, her expression open and reassuring. “Of course,” she said, her voice warm with the promise that there was nothing he couldn’t ask, no question too big or too small. She smiled gently, hoping to make him feel safe enough to share whatever was on his mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s small fingers toyed with the corner of his blanket, twisting it between his hands as though it were the only thing anchoring him in the moment. He seemed lost in thought, his gaze focused on the fabric as if trying to gather the courage to speak. The silence stretched between them, and Agatha could feel the weight of it, the tension building in the air like a soft but steady pressure. Then, finally, he looked up at her, his wide eyes filled with uncertainty.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Would it… would it be okay if I called Rio ‘Mom’?” His voice was soft, almost hesitant, as if the question itself was something that needed careful handling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hit Agatha like a wave, unexpected and powerful, and for a brief moment, she was taken aback. She froze, unable to immediately respond, her heart swelling with a mixture of love, pride, and emotion. Her chest tightened, and before she could stop herself, she felt the sting of tears threaten to blur her vision. She blinked quickly, trying to keep her composure, her gaze softening as she placed a hand gently on Nicky’s small, tense shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, Nicky,” she said, her voice unexpectedly shaky. She took a deep breath, willing herself to steady her racing heart. “That’s such a sweet thing to ask.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s small face was filled with vulnerability, his eyes searching hers for a response, for reassurance. He must have felt the weight of his own question too, wondering how it might change things between them, or whether it would make sense to Agatha. But Agatha, though her emotions were stirred, found herself focusing on her son, on his needs, on his sense of belonging and the love that surrounded him. She swallowed the lump in her throat and steadied her breath before continuing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” she said gently, her fingers brushing his hair back, “that’s really up to Rio. But for me? It wouldn’t bother me at all. Not one bit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s brow furrowed slightly, a flicker of confusion crossing his face. “Really?” he asked, his voice quiet, seeking confirmation, as if the possibility seemed almost too good to be true.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded firmly, her smile soft but sure, as she cupped his cheek with one hand. “Really,” she reassured him. “I love Rio so much, and I know she loves you just as much as I do. She wants nothing but the best for you, always. If calling her ‘Mom’ is what feels right to you, then I think you should ask her. It’s your and her choice. It’s about what feels like family to you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky chewed on his lip, his small face scrunching with thought. He seemed to consider her words, turning them over in his mind, weighing the significance of what it meant to call Rio something so personal, something so tied to the deep affection he felt for her. Agatha’s heart swelled with warmth, knowing just how much Rio had already become a part of their lives, and how much love Nicky had already given her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you think she’d say yes?” Nicky asked finally, his voice small, filled with hope but tinged with a hint of uncertainty, as though he was unsure of how such a change would be received.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her heart light, and leaned down, brushing a kiss across his forehead. Her lips lingered there for just a moment, as if she could convey all the love and security he needed through that single gesture. “I think she’d be so happy, sweetheart,” she said softly, her voice rich with certainty. “She loves you more than you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky relaxed a little, his grip on his stuffed animal loosening as he let out a sigh of relief, as though the weight of the question had lifted off his small shoulders. He settled deeper into his blankets, his expression softening, a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” he whispered, the word almost imperceptible but filled with the quiet resolve of a child who had found the answers he needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha lingered a moment, stroking his hair and watching him settle. She leaned in close to whisper, “I’m really proud of you, you know. For being so thoughtful and kind.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small, shy smile crept onto Nicky’s face. “Thanks, Mama.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat back down on the edge of Nicky’s bed, sensing that he wasn’t quite finished with their conversation. His little brows were furrowed, his fingers twisting the edge of his blanket nervously.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama,” he began again, his voice small and uncertain. He hesitated, his words coming slower this time, as though he was weighing them carefully before speaking. “Are you really, really sure it wouldn’t bother you? If I called Rio ‘Mom’?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart melted at his sincerity, and she reached out to cup his cheek gently. “Sweetheart,” she said, her voice warm and steady, “I’m absolutely sure. Do you want to know why?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s wide, trusting eyes met hers, and he nodded, eager for the answer. Agatha leaned in a little closer, her voice becoming more confident, as though the words she was about to share held an important truth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There’s something very special about love,” Agatha explained, her tone filled with quiet conviction. “It’s the only thing in the world that doesn’t run out when you share it. Love isn’t like a cookie or a toy where, if you give it to one person, there’s less for someone else. Love grows. The more you share it, the bigger it gets.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky blinked at her, letting the words sink in. His small hands stopped fidgeting with the blanket as a smile started to form on his face. “Really?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really,” Agatha confirmed with a smile. “Loving Rio doesn’t take anything away from me. In fact, it makes my heart even fuller because I love her too. And I know she loves you more than anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned now, his happiness evident in the way his eyes sparkled. “So… it makes your heart bigger?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Agatha said, laughing softly and brushing his hair back. “You’re such a smart boy, you know that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, clearly reassured. Then, as if making up his mind, he suddenly sat up straighter. “Mama,” he said, “can you go get Rio now? So I can ask her?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, taken aback by his eagerness but touched by his determination. “Are you sure you’re ready to ask her tonight?” she asked, her tone soft, but carrying the hint of a smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes!” Nicky said, nodding so vigorously his hair flopped over his forehead. “I want to tell her now!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her heart swelling with pride and affection for her little boy. “Alright,” she said, standing up and kissing his forehead once again. “I’ll go get her. Wait right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She left the room and walked downstairs, in search of Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha found her in the living room, standing in front of her beloved collection of plants. She was carefully misting the leaves, her posture relaxed, as if the task was her own soothing ritual. The sight was so quintessentially Rio—grounded, calm, and utterly focused— that Agatha almost didn’t want to interrupt. But she knew she had to. And, truthfully, she wanted to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, love,” Agatha called softly, stepping into the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned at the sound of her voice, her expression immediately lighting up. “Hi,” she said, setting the mister down on the table. “What’s up? Is Nicky all tucked in?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crossed the room to her, reaching out to rest her hands lightly on Rio’s arms, feeling the soft material of her shirt. “He’s not asleep yet,” she admitted, her tone gentle. “He, uh… he wants to talk to you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, her brow furrowing slightly as concern flickered across her face. “Is he okay? Did something happen?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, shaking her head as she leaned in closer, her hands moving to brush small circles on Rio’s arms. “Everything’s fine,” she reassured her, the words soft but firm. “He’s okay. But… he has a question for you. And it’s—” She paused, looking for the right words to frame what she was about to say. “It’s a big question.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s frown deepened, her eyes searching Agatha’s face for any sign of what this might be about. She wasn’t used to Agatha being so mysterious. “What kind of big question? Agatha, you’re starting to make me nervous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled faintly and shook her head. “Don’t be nervous,” she said, her voice warm and reassuring. “I just… I wanted to prepare you. This question is something only you can answer, and there’s no expectation here. Whatever you decide, whatever you say, I’ll support you completely. And Nicky will too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes widened slightly, and she studied Agatha’s face carefully, trying to piece together what this was about. But she could see that Agatha wasn’t going to reveal more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Rio said slowly, taking a deep breath. She could sense the seriousness in Agatha’s tone, the quiet gravity of the situation. “Let me go see what this is all about.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pecked her lips softly before stepping back. “He’s in bed waiting for you,” she said, her voice filled with quiet encouragement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded and headed upstairs, followed closely by Agatha, her heart racing slightly from the seriousness of Agatha’s words. Whatever this was, it mattered. And she was determined to handle it with care.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart clenched the moment they walked back into Nicky’s room. Tucked under his blankets, his little face peeking out, he looked a mix of determined and nervous. His fingers played with the edge of his blanket as his big, expressive eyes flicked between her and Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave Rio a soft, reassuring smile before sitting down on the edge of Nicky’s bed. She rested a gentle hand on Nicky’s shoulder, a silent encouragement for him to find his voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio knelt beside the bed, bringing herself closer to Nicky’s level. She reached out and placed her hand lightly on the bed near his. “What’s up, buddy?” she asked gently, her voice warm and full of care.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hesitated, his small hands gripping the blanket tighter. He looked at Rio, then at Agatha, then back at Rio, as if gathering all his courage. Finally, he took a deep breath and started, “I’ve been… thinking about something. A lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, her expression soft and open, urging him on. “Okay. Tell me, sweetheart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked at her directly now, his voice a little shaky but earnest. “You told me once that… when you first started living with Grandma Lilia, you didn’t call her ‘Mom’ all the time. Just sometimes. When it felt right. Right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, surprised by the memory he’d held onto, slowly sensing where this was going. She nodded slowly, her voice quiet. “Yeah, that’s right. At first, I didn’t call her ‘Mom’ all the time, and I still don’t. It took a while, but when I felt like I wanted to, I did.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shifted under his blanket, his small face serious, his eyes locked on hers with a kind of thoughtful intensity. “I was thinking… if it’s okay with you… maybe I could call you ‘Mom.’ Not all the time, but… sometimes. When it feels right. Like you do with  Grandma Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room was quiet for a moment, the weight of Nicky’s words hanging in the air. Rio felt her chest tighten with emotion, tears already pricking her eyes as she looked at the boy who had so clearly been carrying this thought for days, maybe weeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her eyes instinctively shifted to Agatha, seeking her reassurance in this moment that felt so delicate, so fragile. Agatha met her gaze without hesitation, her own blue eyes shimmering with unshed tears. She gave Rio a soft, trembling smile, one that spoke volumes, a silent reassurance that said more than words ever could. <em>It’s okay. More than okay.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Only if it’s okay,” Nicky added quickly, his words tumbling out. “I don’t want to make you feel weird or—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio cut him off gently, reaching out to take one of his little hands in hers. Her voice trembled slightly, but her words were steady. “Oh, Nicky… it’s more than okay. I would be so honored if you wanted to call me ‘Mom.’ Even if it’s just sometimes. You know that, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up instantly, relief and happiness flooding his features. He squeezed her hand tightly, as if making sure this wasn’t a dream. “Really?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really,” Rio said firmly, her smile breaking through the tears welling in her eyes. She glanced at Agatha, who was watching them with her own teary, radiant smile, before turning back to Nicky. “You’re the most wonderful kid, Nicky. You can call me whatever feels right to you, whenever it feels right. Okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Nicky whispered, grinning now, his earlier nerves melting away. He suddenly sat up and threw his arms around Rio, almost suffocating her but she didn’t mind one bit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, <em>Mom</em>,” he whispered, his voice muffled against her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hugged him tightly, her tears finally slipping free. “Thank <em>you,</em> buddy. For trusting me with this. It means the world.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky pulled back, he looked over at Agatha, who was quietly wiping her own tears with a tissue she’d pulled from her pocket. “Mama, you’re still not mad, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed softly, her voice full of affection. “Oh, sweetheart, no. Not even a little. You’re allowed to have as much love in your life as you want, and I know Rio loves you just as much as I do. There’s nothing to be mad about. I’m so proud of you for sharing what was on your mind, sweetheart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned and and he reached for Agatha’s hand with one of his, his other hand still firmly holding Rio’s. “I’m lucky. I have the best Mama and Mom in the world.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned forward, kissing his forehead again, her heart full to bursting. “And we’re the luckiest to have you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat back on her heels, still overwhelmed but filled with warmth. Her hand brushed against Agatha’s, and their fingers intertwined briefly, sharing a silent moment of connection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky nestled back into his pillows, looking completely at peace now, Agatha and Rio stayed by his bedside a little longer, as they watched him take his dragon that laid forgotten in his bed back in his arms and fall slowly into a peaceful sleep, the three of them basking in the quiet, perfect completeness of their family.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the door of their bedroom gently clicked shut behind them, Rio felt the weight of the emotions from the night settle in. She didn’t even make it to their bed before the tears began to fall, spilling down her cheeks uncontrollably. The rush of love, the trust that Nicky had shown her, was overwhelming. The reality of the moment was more than she had ever imagined it would be. She had always known in her heart that she loved Nicky, but hearing him say the words, offering her a place in his heart—it was more than she could have ever prepared for.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been walking quietly behind her, reached out immediately, her arms encircling Rio from behind. She held her tightly, feeling the tremors of emotion in Rio’s body. “Hey, love,” Agatha whispered softly in her hear, her head coming to rest on Rio’s shoulder, her voice breaking with her own tears. “It’s okay. It’s okay to feel everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned in her arms, burying her face in Agatha’s chest, the tears flowing even more freely now. She wasn’t sure why she was crying. Maybe it was because she hadn’t realized just how deeply she had been yearning for this connection, this bond with Nicky, until that moment. Maybe it was the magnitude of the love she felt for both Agatha and Nicky, and the realization that she was truly a part of their family. She didn’t know, but she couldn’t stop.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gently lifted her face with one finger under her chin, wiping away the tears that fell from Rio’s cheeks. “I love you so much, my love. I’m so proud of you. I know Nicky feels the same way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I didn’t expect this… I didn’t know I could feel this much love,” Rio choked out, her voice raw. “It’s just so… overwhelming. I love him so much, Agatha. He’s everything to me, just like you are. And to think he trusts me enough to call <em>me</em> that...”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled, tears spilling down her own cheeks now. “He’s your family, Rio. You’ve always been his family, ever since you stepped foot in his life. He just needed to see it too.” She kissed the top of Rio’s head, her voice thick with emotion. “I know you’ve always had a big heart. And now you have him in your arms, too. You’re his mom, Rio. He sees it. I see it. Lilia sees it. We all see it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a shaky breath, leaning into Agatha’s embrace, finding the comfort and grounding she needed in her arms. She let herself cry freely, her tears mixing with Agatha’s as they both stood in the middle of their room, overwhelmed by the depth of their love for Nicky and for each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I didn’t think I deserved this,” Rio whispered after a long pause. “I didn’t think I could have this kind of family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stroked her hair gently, her voice filled with quiet certainty. “You deserve it all, Rio. You’ve always deserved it. You’re a wonderful mom. You’re a wonderful partner. And now, we’re a family. Together. Forever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her heart swelling with gratitude for the woman in her arms. “I love you so much, Agatha. And I love Nicky. I never thought I’d have this kind of family, but here we are… and I’m never letting go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t let you go either,” Agatha murmured, her hands tightening around Rio, holding her close. “You’re everything to me. To both of us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They stood there for a long time, wrapped in each other’s arms, the weight of their shared love and happiness filling the room. Slowly, their tears subsided, and they pulled back just enough to link their foreheads. There was no need for words anymore. They had everything they needed. They had each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Agatha kissed Rio gently on the lips, her touch tender, as if sealing the promise they’d made to each other — that no matter what, they would be there, loving and supporting one another.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And in that moment, Rio knew that everything was exactly as it should be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they began to settle into their nightly routine, the warmth of the evening still enveloping them, Agatha paused for a moment while adjusting the pillows on their bed. She turned to Rio, a soft smile playing on her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, <em>Mom</em>,” Agatha said casually, as though the word had been part of her vocabulary for years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze for a moment, her heart skipping in her chest at the sound of it. The way Agatha said it—so natural, so tender—made the word feel like it was just meant to be. She turned to face Agatha, her chest tight with emotions she hadn’t even known she’d been holding onto.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did you just—” Rio started, her voice a bit unsteady.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile grew, her gaze warm and knowing. “I just wanted to say it out loud.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, feeling a rush of love and tenderness swell inside her. She couldn’t speak for a moment, her throat tightening, trying to process the reality of it all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt tears welling up again, though this time, they were different. These were tears of gratitude, of recognition. She had always felt like she didn’t truly belong to a family beside Lilia, and yet here she was, being called “Mom,” by a child who had found her way into her heart in a way she never expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I… Agatha…” Rio’s voice broke, and she let out a soft, emotional laugh as she wiped away a stray tear. “I don’t know if I can ever get used to that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer, cupping Rio’s face gently in her hands. “You don’t have to get used to it, love. It’s who you are now. It all comes naturally.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught in her throat. The weight of Agatha’s words—their truth—settled into her chest, a steady, beautiful reminder of the family they had built together. She leaned into Agatha’s touch, closing her eyes for a moment as she let the emotions wash over her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio whispered, barely able to get the words out through the lump in her throat. “For everything. For helping me understand.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her hand reaching for Rio over the bed. “You’ve always known, love. You just had to see it for yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t stop the smile that tugged at her lips, even as her heart felt full to the point of bursting. She was Nicky’s mom now, truly. And somehow, the word felt as though it belonged to her, in every sense of the word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you,” Rio murmured, her hand reaching out to meet Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> “I love you, too, darling.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, the word still carrying such a weight with it, but this time it felt like a promise, a new chapter in their lives. It felt like home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, as Rio lay next to Agatha, her mind began to spiral in a way it hadn’t before that night. The warmth of the bed, the soft breaths of Agatha beside her, and the thought of Nicky peaceful sleeping in the room down the hall were grounding her, but something deep inside kept tugging at her thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The word <em>mom</em> echoed in her mind, still new and unfamiliar, though she’d already heard it a few times out loud. It felt right, but also like a weight she wasn’t sure she was strong enough to carry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She couldn’t help but think: <em>Am I too young for this? Do I have enough experience?</em> She had never imagined herself in this role, never imagined being someone’s mom—not with all the emotional baggage she still carried from her own childhood. And yet, here she was, being called “Mom” by a little boy who had so much love and trust in his eyes, it made her heart ache.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But still, the questions lingered. <em>Do I deserve this? Can I be the mother he needs?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha must have sensed the shift in her, for she stirred in the bed and turned toward Rio, her voice soft in the quiet of the night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, you okay?” Agatha asked, her hand reaching out to brush a strand of hair from Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, fighting to keep her emotions in check as she turned to face Agatha, her eyes shimmering with uncertainty. “I… I don’t know. It’s just… sometimes I feel like I’m too young for this. Too inexperienced. I’m not like you, Agatha. You’ve raised Nicky, you’ve been through so much. I… I don’t even know if I’m enough for him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened with understanding, her gaze steady but full of compassion. She shifted closer to Rio, pulling her into an embrace, one hand resting gently on the small of her back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, listen to me,” Agatha said, her voice quiet but firm. “You don’t need to be like me. You don’t need to have all the answers. You don’t need years of experience to be Nicky’s mom. You’re already exactly what he needs.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, the weight of Agatha’s words sinking in, but still, she wasn’t sure. “But… what if I mess up? What if I don’t know how to help him the way you do? What if I’m not enough?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled back slightly, cupping Rio’s face in her hands, her gaze locking with hers. “You already are enough, Rio. The fact that you care so much, that you’re here, that you’re asking those questions, that you love him the way you do—that’s all he needs. Trust me, love, there’s no perfect parent. There’s only you, doing your best, and that’s all Nicky will ever ask of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio closed her eyes, the soft pressure of Agatha’s hands comforting her as her thoughts began to quiet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t have to be perfect,” Agatha continued, her voice gentle but full of conviction. “You just need to be there for him. And you’re already doing that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But I’m still learning, Agatha,” Rio said softly, her voice tinged with vulnerability. “I’m still figuring it out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, brushing her thumb along Rio’s cheek. “That’s okay. We all are. Parenting isn’t about having it all figured out. It’s about showing up, loving with all you have, and doing the best you can. And that’s exactly what you’re doing. Don’t ever doubt that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart fluttered in her chest as she met Agatha’s eyes, the warmth in her gaze making Rio feel more grounded. Slowly, the knot in her stomach began to loosen thanks to Agatha’s unwavering belief in her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio whispered, her voice barely audible. “Thank you for believing in me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio softly, a kiss full of reassurance and affection. “Don’t ever doubt that, my love I believe in you, Rio. You’re more than enough,” she whispered against Rio’s lips. “Now go to sleep darling, you need it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled and closed her eyes again, letting Agatha’s words settle deep within her, and for the first time that night she felt the doubts start to fade. Maybe she didn’t have all the answers. Maybe she wouldn’t be the perfect mom. But she was there, and that was enough. She had Agatha by her side, and together, they were more than enough for Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, the tranquil quiet of their room was abruptly shattered by the unmistakable sound of little feet pattering hurriedly down the hallway. Agatha stirred first, barely registering the commotion before Nicky, with all the energy of a cannonball, launched himself onto their bed. He landed squarely between them with a bounce that sent both adults jolting awake.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, you two!” he chirped, his grin practically glowing in the soft morning light streaming through the curtains.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned theatrically, dragging a pillow over her head. “Nicky,” she mumbled, her voice muffled, “do you know what you just committed? An ambush. That’s punishable by law, young man.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, still wiping the sleep from her eyes, let out a soft laugh. She reached over to ruffle Nicky’s already chaotic bedhead. “Oh, come on, Rio,” she teased, her voice warm and amused. “This wasn’t an ambush. It was a well-executed tactical wake-up call.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, visibly pleased with his stealthy success. “I wanted to wake you up because it’s pancake day!” he declared, as if it were a universally known holiday.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio peeked out from beneath her pillow, her hair a mess and her face scrunched in confusion. “Pancake day?” she repeated, squinting at him through sleep-blurred eyes. “I’m pretty sure it’s Thursday. Don’t you have school today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yep!” Nicky said brightly, undeterred. “But last week, you promised we’d make pancakes together, and you said today would be the day! You did, you really did. You <em>promised!</em>” He clasped his hands together for added emphasis, his eyes wide and impossibly convincing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back against the headboard, a smirk tugging at her lips as she watched Rio grapple with the very awake and very determined six-year-old. “He’s got you there, my love,” she said with mock solemnity. “A promise is a promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned again, flopping dramatically onto her back and throwing an arm over her face. “You two are ganging up on me,” she grumbled, though a smile was already tugging at the corners of her mouth. She peeked at Nicky, whose hopeful expression was impossible to resist. “Okay, okay, pancake day it is. But you’re in charge of cleanup, little man.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes!” Nicky cheered, throwing his hands in the air. “Best morning ever!” He scrambled to his knees, bouncing on the bed like an overexcited puppy. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio and Agatha could even think about getting up, the mattress became a battlefield of chaos as Nicky started bouncing up and down with uncontainable energy. It was as if the bed had turned into his personal trampoline, each leap higher than the last.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on, come on! Pancake day!” he chanted gleefully, his voice ringing through the room like a celebratory anthem.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nicky!” Rio groaned, yanking her legs back under the covers just in time to avoid being trampled by his enthusiastic jumps. She grabbed her pillow and plopped it back over her face, letting out a dramatically long sigh. “We already said yes to pancakes but I need <em>more sleep, </em>kiddo. Is that so much to ask?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, already sitting up and rubbing her temples to shake off the remnants of sleep, laughed softly at the scene. With a well-practiced motion, she reached out mid-jump and caught Nicky, pulling him into her lap. “Alright, young man,” she said, trying to muster some sternness in her voice, but the amusement betrayed her. “If you keep this up, your pancakes are going to be <em>delayed.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky froze in her arms, his small hands flying to her shoulders as his eyes widened in mock horror. “Noooo, Mama! Not delayed! I’ll stop, I promise!” He turned his wide, pleading eyes toward Rio, his voice softening to a dramatic whimper. “Right, Mom? Pancakes need to be on time. Pancakes are <em>important.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart clenched at the word “Mom,” the sound of it slipping so effortlessly from his lips still catching her off guard. She peeked out from under her pillow, trying to suppress the warm smile tugging at her lips. “Alright, little man, you’ve got a deal. No more jumping, and pancakes will be on time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Deal!” Nicky exclaimed, wiggling out of Agatha’s lap to plop himself down between them again. He was still buzzing with excitement, but at least the bed had stopped trembling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stretched and let out an exaggerated yawn, glancing over at Agatha. “He’s really taking to that word, huh?” she said, her voice soft and a little hesitant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached out, her hand finding Rio’s over the pillow now resting on her chest. Her eyes, still a little sleepy, were warm and full of love. “He is,” she said simply. “And he means it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her chest filling with a mix of pride, love, and the weight of her new role in Nicky’s life. “Alright, alright,” she said, swinging her legs over the side of the bed. “Let’s get this pancake party started before he explodes from excitement.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But just as Nicky started to hop off the bed, Rio lunged toward him with a playful grin, wrapping him in her arms and pulling him into a ticklish hug. Her fingers danced over his sides, and he squealed with laughter, squirming in her hold. “Oh no, you don’t!” she teased. “Not without giving me a good morning hug first!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky dissolved into giggles, his small arms wrapping around her neck. “Okay, okay! Good morning, Mom!” he gasped through his laughter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched the scene with a soft smile, her heart brimming at the sight of her son and partner so at ease with each other. “Alright, you two,” she said, standing and stretching before putting on her robe over her pajamas. “If we’re doing this, we’re doing it right. Nicky, go wash your hands and grab the mixing bowls. Rio and I will be downstairs in just a minute.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, Mama!” Nicky chirped, bouncing off the bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on, let’s go! I’ll get the eggs and the flour and—oh, and the chocolate chips!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Chocolate chips?” Agatha raised a brow, her tone laced with amusement. “Since when are chocolate chips part of pancake day?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Since today!” Nicky declared, his confidence unwavering. And without another word, he was out the door, and the sound of his little feet in the stairs could be heard a few seconds later.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the door slammed shut behind him, Rio flopped back onto the mattress with a groan, her limbs heavy with exhaustion from the whirlwind that was Nicky’s morning energy. “How does he have so much energy this early in the morning?” she muttered, eyes half-lidded.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned over the bed, her lips pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s forehead, her warmth melting some of the tension in Rio’s body. “Some mysteries of the universe are unsolvable, my love,” she replied with a knowing smile, brushing a lock of hair from Rio’s face. “Besides, he’s a six-year-old with a mission. That’s a powerful combination.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but smile up at her, even though she was still heavy with sleep. “Good luck keeping up with him, Mama,” she teased, mimicking Nicky’s chipper tone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed softly, her gaze full of affection as she ran her fingers through Rio’s hair, tucking it behind her ear. “Come on, <em>Mom</em>,” she said, stretching the word playfully, her eyes twinkling with adoration. “We’ve got pancakes to make.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the sound of the word, a warm, still unexpected feeling bloomed in Rio’s chest. It was still a little surreal, hearing Nicky call her that, but there was something about it now, something that felt undeniably right. The reality of it settled deeper in her heart. She smiled, a little overwhelmed but full of love, and nodded as she sat up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha squeezed her hand gently before pulling her up to her feet. </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Downstairs, the kitchen buzzed with the warmth of family. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the sweet, comforting scent of pancakes. Nicky sat at the table, his feet swinging beneath his chair as he waited eagerly for pancakes, his bright eyes fixed on the stove as he eagerly awaited his pancakes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was at the stove, her hands expertly flipping the golden discs of batter onto a plate, each one a perfect, fluffy circle. She had long since learned the art of pancake-making, the delicate balance of heat and timing that turned each one into a golden treasure. Agatha, with her usual calm, was at the counter, quietly brewing coffee, the rich aroma swirling around them like a comforting embrace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re the best pancake maker ever,” Nicky declared, his voice muffled between mouthfuls, as Rio set another stack in front of him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Flattery will get you extra syrup,” Rio declared, reaching for the bottle and drizzling a little more on his plate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yayyyy,” Nicky said with a mischievous grin, and Agatha couldn’t help but chuckle from where she sat, cradling her coffee cup in her hands as she joined the easy banter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they ate, the conversation was light and full of laughter. Nicky chattered non-stop, excited to share everything on his mind, from his plans for the day to the latest happenings in his world. His eyes sparkled as he talked about his art class, about how he’d been working on a drawing he couldn’t wait to show his teacher.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, kiddo, finish up,” Agatha said, glancing at the clock. “We’ve got to get you ready for school.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded, shoveling the last bite of pancake into his mouth. “Done!” he said, wiping his face with his napkin in a somewhat haphazard manner.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood and stretched, a small yawn escaping her. “Alright, let’s get you sorted, mister. Clothes, shoes, and backpack check.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Upstairs, Nicky darted around his room, grabbing his things while Rio helped him pull on his sweater, smoothing it over his head as she tugged it down. Agatha double-checked his backpack, making sure all the essentials were there—his lunch, his homework, his favorite book just in case the day got too long.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright,” Agatha said as they all met at the front door. “Shoes on, jacket zipped, and you’re good to go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Mama,” Nicky said, slipping his hand into hers as they stepped outside into the crisp morning air. The little boy’s hand was warm and small in hers, his other hand already reaching for Rio’s as they stepped outside into the crisp morning air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio locked the door behind them, and they walked together toward the car, Nicky sandwiched between them. The little boy hummed a tune as he skipped along, holding hands with his moms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they reached the car, Rio bent down to buckle Nicky into his seat, her hands moving with practiced ease by now, while Agatha leaned toward her with a smile. Her voice was soft but sure, full of the warmth that had always been present between them. “We make a pretty good team, don’t we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, her heart full, her hand resting gently on Nicky’s head as he chattered away, oblivious to the exchange. “The best,” she replied, her voice thick with love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With everyone loaded up, they drove off, the morning sun lighting their path as another day began.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the car hummed along the road, the soft whir of the engine almost blending with the rhythm of the tires on the pavement, Nicky swung his legs back and forth in his car seat, a thoughtful expression on his face. His fingers drummed lightly against the seatbelt as his mind clearly worked through some monumental thought. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” he began, his voice taking on a tone that immediately made both Agatha and Rio lean in slightly, “I think it would be really, really cool if we got a pet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but chuckle softly, her eyes flicking to Agatha, whose lips curled into a knowing smirk. “Oh, really?” Agatha asked, keeping her voice light and playful, though the amusement was clear in her gaze. “And what kind of pet are we talking about here?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky narrowed his eyes with the intensity of a young strategist, clearly savoring the moment. He tapped a pen he’d found abandoned on the seat next to him – the perks of having two scholars for mothers - against his chin thoughtfully, looking very serious. “Hmm… well, I was thinking maybe a dog. But then I remembered dogs are a lot of work, and you’ve got to walk them, and they bark all the time… That could get annoying.” He paused for a moment, rubbing his chin as if weighing the pros and cons in his head. “Then I thought maybe a cat, but cats are kinda picky, and I don’t want it to scratch my toys. Plus, they just sit around and look at you like they are the kings.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t suppress a small laugh at that. “A royal cat, huh?” she teased, her eyes twinkling with amusement. “And then what did you think?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face shifted from one of deep contemplation to a sudden burst of excitement, his eyes lighting up as he had his ‘aha’ moment. He sat up straighter, his small shoulders straightening with enthusiam. “A bunny! I think a bunny would be perfect. They’re so soft, and they hop around and have these cute little noses, and they’re small, so they wouldn’t take up much space! And we could build it a little house in the backyard or in the living room!” He was practically bouncing in his seat now, his energy palpable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart melted at the thought, her mind immediately conjuring the image of a fluffy little bunny hopping happily around their home, its soft fur glowing in the sunlight streaming through the windows. “A rabbit, huh?” she mused, her voice soft and affectionate. “That’s… actually kind of adorable. And a lot less demanding than a dog or a cat.” </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right?” Nicky grinned, his excitement contagious. “It could live in the garden! Or my room! Or—oh, maybe it could share the living room with your plants!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Share the living room?” Rio laughed. “You know rabbits love eating plants, right? It might end up snacking on all my hard work. Aleafia wouldn’t stand a chance.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky gasped, horrified. “Okay, maybe not the living room. But still! A bunny would be perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled from the passenger seat, her voice light with amusement. “You know, bunnies also need a lot of care. Cleaning, feeding, giving them space to run around… It’s not all cuddles and cute little hops.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can help!” Nicky insisted immediately, his voice earnest and full of determination. “I promise I’ll take care of it. I’ll feed it every day and play with it and—” He paused dramatically, as if contemplating the deeper complexities of pet ownership. “And even clean up after it—well, most of the time,” he added with a slight wrinkle of his nose, as if admitting the chore was a bit less glamorous than he’d originally thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, the warmth in her eyes unmistakable as she glanced over at Nicky in the rearview mirror. “It’s a big responsibility, buddy,” she said gently, her tone serious but kind. “A pet isn’t just for fun. It’s like having another family member. You have to make sure they’re well taken care of, not just when it’s easy but all the time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Rio chimed in, her voice soft yet firm as she turned slightly in her seat to look at Nicky, the way a parent would when teaching a valuable lesson. “And you’ve got to think about what they need, too. Pets need love, attention, and care just like people. They have their own needs—like space to run and play, and food and water, and a safe, clean home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes widened, as if the weight of the responsibility was just starting to dawn on him. But then, with his characteristic enthusiasm, he threw his arms wide and beamed. “I have so much love to give!” he declared, his face lighting up with the sheer innocence and sincerity only a child could muster. “I’ll love the bunny sooo much!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh, the sound full of affection and joy. The car was filled with an easy warmth, the kind that only moments like this could create—moments where the possibilities of a family’s future were still wide open, full of dreams and laughter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, though, seemed to consider it all for a moment before speaking again. “Well, we’ll think about it,” she said finally, her voice warm but also a bit noncommittal, as if weighing the pros and cons of having a new addition to their little family.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really?” Nicky’s voice was high with hope, his wide-eyed gaze fixed on the back of Agatha’s seat. “You’re really thinking about it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot a playful look at Agatha, her expression full of mischief. “We’ll see,” she said with a grin, making sure Nicky couldn’t interpret it as a definitive answer, though she didn’t want to crush his excitement. “It’s not a no.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not a no!” Nicky cheered in pure delight, his energy practically palpable as he bounced in his seat. He was clearly taking it as a win, even though it was still far from a definite “yes.” His joy was infectious, and Rio found herself grinning despite herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, shaking her head fondly, glanced over at Nicky in the mirror. “You’re persistent, I’ll give you that,” she said with a chuckle. “I’m not sure if you’re negotiating for a pet or running for office.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed at the comparison, her eyes dancing with amusement. “I think he’s got the politician thing down,” she said, raising an eyebrow at Nicky. “We might have a future negotiator on our hands.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky let a few moments of silence pass, his eyes narrowing with determination as he shifted tactics. This time, his approach was far more calculated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” he began sweetly, his voice dripping with innocence as he leaned forward from his seat. His wide, round eyes locked onto her, and his voice softened to a near-whisper. “You know how much you love animals, right? And how good you are at taking care of things, like your plants?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow, instantly suspicious of the charm offensive. “Mmhmm,” she replied, trying to suppress the smile tugging at the corners of her lips. She knew exactly where this was headed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, don’t you think a pet would be, like, perfect? You’d be such a good… pet mom, just like you are with me,” Nicky continued, laying it on thick with a saccharine sweetness that could melt even the most hardened heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha snorted from the driver’s seat, unable to hold back her laughter. “Nice try, buddy,” she said, shaking her head. “But Rio isn’t the one you need to convince. And stop comparing yourself to a pet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But Mama,” Nicky whined, “you’re harder to convince! Rio’s nicer about these things.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey!” Agatha feigned offense, glancing at Rio with a teasing grin. “I’m nice, too. I just happen to know how to say no.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, holding up her hands as if to ward off the conversation. “Don’t look at me. I haven’t said yes!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yet,” Nicky said slyly, his grin wide and mischievous.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “Stay strong, Rio. He’s trying to break you down. Resist the puppy-dog eyes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gasped dramatically. “Puppy-dog eyes? Is that what you think of me, that I would cave at the slightest puppy-dog eyes? I’m hurt, Agatha. Really.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ll recover,” Agatha teased. “But seriously, Nicky, pets are a <em>huge</em> responsibility. It’s not just cuddles and playtime. There’s feeding, cleaning, training, vet visits—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip, struggling not to laugh at Nicky’s determined, yet endearing, expression. Nicky, however, was not deterred. He turned his full attention to Rio, his eyes growing even wider, his expression so sincere that Rio could almost see the gears turning in his head as he made his final pitch. “Please, <em>Mom</em>? You know how responsible I can be. Didn’t you say I’ve been getting better at taking care of my stuff, and of the plant friends?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced sideways at Agatha, the words tugging at her heartstrings. “You <em>have</em> been doing well,” she admitted, her voice soft with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, clearly resigned to the fact that Nicky was playing every card he had. The little rascal was already fully aware that “mom” was his new secret weapon, and it was working.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t you dare,” Agatha said, her voice light but firm, her eyes narrowing playfully. “Stay strong, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky groaned in frustration. “Mama! I’m talking to <em>Mom</em>! It’s not fair!” he complained, his tone full of exaggerated annoyance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Agatha replied, smirking. “That’s how this works. You’re my beloved son, and she’s my beloved girlfriend. Neither of you gets to cave on my watch.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes affectionately. “I’m not caving… yet. But don’t think I won’t remember this next time <em>you</em> want something, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, leaning over to kiss Rio’s cheek at a stoplight. “Fair enough. But for now, we’re staying pet-free until further notice. Right, Nicky?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right… for now,” Nicky muttered, clearly not pleased with the answer, though his wide grin suggested he wasn’t giving up just yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they pulled into the driveway, Agatha shot Rio a knowing look, her eyes sparkling with humor. “Told you he was persistent.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And I told you I’m not caving,” Rio replied, smiling playfully but her voice not entirely convincing. Her heart softened at Nicky’s antics, but she wasn’t ready to give in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, a smile tugging at her lips. “We’ll see.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dropping Nicky off at his school—his small hand waving enthusiastically from the school steps until they drove out of sight—Rio leaned back in the passenger seat with a contented sigh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He’s determined,” she said, grinning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please, you want it just as much,” Agatha replied dryly, casting Rio a teasing glance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, stretching her arms above her head and yawning. “Well, at least I didn’t cave.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hummed in agreement, pulling into the university parking lot. They stepped out, and the crisp morning air carried the scent of fresh winter wind. The campus buzzed with the energy of students rushing to classes and professors chatting in clusters.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s your agenda for the day?” Agatha asked, slinging her bag over her shoulder and walking alongside Rio toward the main building.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Library,” Rio said. “I have to dig up a few more sources on the exploration of mortality—still trying to strengthen that middle chapter.” She glanced at Agatha, her expression brightening. “And you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Second-year lecture, fourth-year lecture, then my office for a mountain of papers to grade and, likely, fielding questions from overly eager first-years who think they’ve uncovered some groundbreaking theory on the Lost Generation.” Agatha’s lips curled into a knowing smirk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed. “I can’t wait to hear those stories later.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They reached the building, walking through the bustling hallways filled with students, laughter, and the soft hum of academic life. Agatha’s office was on the second floor, while the library, Rio’s second home, was just a short walk away on the ground floor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they neared the staircase where they would part ways for the day, Rio paused and glanced back at Agatha. “Alright, that’s me,” she said, her tone a little lighter as she turned to head toward the library. “Let me <em>hop</em> right into my world of books. I’m already <em>late for a very important date</em>.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>? you’re worse than Nicky…” Agatha replied, rolling her eyes with a fondness that betrayed her true feelings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged nonchalantly, her eyes twinkling. With a grin, she leaned in, just enough to let her fingers brush softly against the lapel of Agatha’s blazer. “Have a good morning, Professor Harkness,” she murmured, her voice a little lower, laced with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha met her gaze, her eyes softening. “Work hard, Miss Vidal,” she replied, her voice warm as she began her ascent up the stairs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio watched her for a moment before heading toward the library, a small smile lingering on her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the quiet of her office that afternoon, Agatha sat at her desk, the soft click of her pen punctuating the stillness. Her reading glasses perched on the bridge of her nose, she tried to focus on grading, flipping through the essays in front of her. The papers were as varied as always—some sparkling with insight, others barely worthy of a passing grade—but her thoughts kept straying.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She sighed, leaning back in her chair and crossing her arms over her chest, her gaze drifting to the window as her pen tapped rhythmically against the desk. The image of Nicky’s wide, hopeful eyes and Rio’s poorly disguised interest in the idea of a pet played on a loop in her mind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“A rabbit,” Agatha muttered under her breath, her lips curling into a reluctant smile. Of all the pets Nicky could have chosen, something chaotic—like a dog, perhaps, or even a cat—would’ve made more sense. But a rabbit? Quiet, manageable, and surprisingly low-maintenance. Not at all the kind of pet she’d have expected from her spirited, persistent son.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But still.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha wasn’t entirely convinced. Pets, after all, were a big responsibility. They needed care, attention, and routine—all of which would eventually fall on her shoulders if Nicky’s initial enthusiasm started to wane. She knew all too well how quickly her son’s boundless energy could shift to the next big thing. His love for something new was always fierce but fleeting, and a rabbit, however adorable, would eventually become just another thing to manage. As much as Rio was drawn to the idea, Agatha couldn’t help but worry that her demanding schedule—and her tendency to get completely absorbed in her work—might add an extra layer of complication.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft sigh, tapping her fingers absently against her temple as the image of Nicky’s excited face flashed in her mind again. The way his eyes had sparkled when he spoke about the rabbit, as if this were the answer to all of his hopes and dreams. And Rio—sweet, wonderful Rio—hadn’t even tried to hide her amusement, or the faint spark of excitement in her own eyes. She’d tried to remain stoic, to stand firm, but Agatha could tell from the twinkling glint in Rio’s smile that she, too, was already softening under Nicky’s persistence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Even Agatha’s teasing in the car—telling Rio to resist—had been more for show than anything else. A half-hearted effort, a game she wasn’t even sure she wanted to win.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Who was she kidding? The moment Nicky had mentioned the bunny, Agatha had known. She had already lost this battle before it had even begun.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Agatha wasn’t ready to surrender just yet. No, she would hold her ground a little longer, just to make sure they understood—really understood—that getting a pet wasn’t something to be taken lightly. It was a responsibility, one that required long-term commitment, and she wasn’t about to let them gloss over that fact.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A rabbit, though. She smirked, the image forming in her mind with startling clarity. Nicky crouched on the floor, his little hands gently petting the soft, fluffy fur of some imaginary bunny, while Rio sat beside him, utterly enchanted by the scene. It was such a vivid picture that Agatha could almost hear the soft sound of Nicky’s voice, full of excitement, as he coaxed the rabbit closer. And Rio, her eyes soft with affection, offering gentle words of encouragement. It was a scene that could have been pulled straight from a daydream.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shaking her head, Agatha turned back to the essay in front of her, trying to refocus on her work. “Not today,” she muttered under her breath, though her tone lacked any real conviction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She’d resist for now, that much was certain. But deep down, she knew the truth—this battle had already been lost. And, perhaps more than that, she was powerless to fight it. Because, in the end, she was completely and utterly wrapped around the little fingers of the two people she loved most in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <em>It seems, as one becomes older,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere sequence— </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Or even development: the latter a partial fallacy</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Encouraged by superficial notions of evolution,<br />
</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Which becomes, in the popular mind, a means of disowning the past. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “The Dry Salvages”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">Agatha woke up that morning with a heaviness in her chest that made it hard to breathe, let alone move. The weight was familiar, an old, unwelcome guest that visited like clockwork once a year. No matter how much time passed, it didn’t seem to lose its grip on her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The anniversary. Four years ago today, Evanora had drawn her last damn breath.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned onto her side, her gaze landing on Rio, who was still fast asleep. She looked peaceful, her face serene in the dim morning light, her breathing steady and calm. Agatha’s heart twisted at the sight. She reached out instinctively, wanting to tuck a stray strand of hair behind Rio’s ear or trace the soft curve of her cheek. But she stopped midway, her hand hovering in the air before she pulled it back. Instead, she let it rest on her own chest, where the ache throbbed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This wasn’t something she wanted to share, not today. It wasn’t because she didn’t trust Rio—Agatha knew better than anyone how deeply Rio cared—but because the memory of Evanora was too sharp, too raw. Her mother’s cruelty lingered like an unhealed wound, and she didn’t want that darkness to touch Rio, didn’t want it to sully the light Rio brought into her life. Some ghosts were best kept buried.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Slipping out of bed as carefully as she could to avoid waking her, Agatha padded to the bathroom. The cold tiles beneath her feet sent a shiver up her spine, but she didn’t bother finding her slippers. She flicked on the light, squinting at her reflection in the mirror. Her eyes were tired, the faint lines around them deeper than usual. She placed her hands on the edge of the sink, gripping it tightly as if it could anchor her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re fine,” she whispered to herself, though the words felt hollow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her routine felt mechanical—quick shower, washing her face, brushing her teeth, tying her hair into a neat bun. She pulled on one of her favorite purple sweaters, the soft knit fabric a small comfort against the cold morning air. When she stepped back into the bedroom, Rio was stirring, stretching languidly under the covers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning, love,” Rio mumbled, her voice warm and thick with sleep. She reached out a hand, her fingers brushing the edge of the blanket as her eyes blinked open. “You’re up early.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Couldn’t sleep,” Agatha replied, keeping her tone as light as she could manage, as she sat on the edge of the bed on Rio’s side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s brow furrowed slightly, her sleepy gaze sharpening. “Are you okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine,” Agatha lied, her smile small but practiced. She leaned in to press a kiss to Rio’s sleepy lips. “Go back to sleep. You’ve got a long day ahead.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t look convinced, but she didn’t push. “Come back to bed for a bit?” she asked softly, her fingers squeezing Agatha’s hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, her smile faltering just enough that Rio noticed. “I’ve got papers to grade and a faculty meeting in two hours,” she said quickly, brushing Rio’s hair back. “You rest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips parted as if to argue, but she hesitated, her eyes searching Agatha’s face. Whatever she saw there, she decided against pressing further. Instead, she offered a quiet, “Okay. But don’t overdo it, alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, standing and giving Rio’s hand one last squeeze before she stepped out of the room. As she closed the door behind her, the familiar ache in her chest tightened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was going to be a long day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Downstairs, the house was still and quiet, save for the soft hum of the kettle boiling in the kitchen. Agatha leaned against the counter, waiting for the water to heat. Her arms were folded tightly across her chest, her fingers tapping against her bicep in a restless rhythm. When the kettle whistled, she poured the water over a tea bag in her favorite green starry mug, watching as the amber color seeped into the water.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She carried the mug to the table, sitting down heavily in one of the chairs. The steam rose in slow curls, fogging her glasses as she stared out the window. The early morning light filtered through the trees that swayed gently in the breeze. Their movement was almost hypnotic, a rhythm she could lose herself in if she let it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But peace was elusive. As she stared into the trees, Evanora’s face flashed in her mind, sharp and uninvited. Her mother’s cutting eyes, the cold, disdainful curl of her lips, and the weight of her words—all of it came rushing back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Why are you so weak? Why can’t you be better?</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers tightened around her mug, her jaw clenching as if she could physically push the memories away. She took a slow sip of her tea, letting the warmth calm her nerves. It didn’t completely work, but it was enough to steady her hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t hear Rio until she felt familiar arms wrap around her shoulders from behind. Agatha startled slightly but relaxed the moment Rio’s chin rested on her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You okay?” Rio asked softly, her voice still laced with sleep but tinged with concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha forced a small smile, tilting her head toward Rio’s. “Of course. Just tired.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t move, her arms tightening slightly. “Sure about that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for a fraction of a second, but she nodded. “Mmhmm. Long night, that’s all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t press, though Agatha could feel her lingering hesitation. Instead, Rio kissed her cheek, her lips soft and warm against Agatha’s cool skin. “Let me make you some breakfast,” she offered, her tone gentle. “You’ll feel better with something in your stomach. Nicky will be up soon anyway.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Agatha could protest, Rio was already moving to the stove, pulling out eggs and bread. Agatha watched her, the familiar pang of guilt twisting in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio moved with easy efficiency, her bare feet padding softly against the tile and Agatha watched her, a pang of guilt gnawing at her. She hated hiding this from Rio, but she wasn’t ready to unpack it, not yet. For now, she would let Rio’s warmth be enough to carry her through the day, a quiet reminder that she was no longer the scared, hurt child Evanora had tried to break.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Rio said, glancing over her shoulder, her smile bright despite the early hour. “If you keep staring at me like that, I’m going to think you’re in love with me or something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, the sound more genuine than she’d expected. “Lucky guess,” she murmured, lifting her mug to her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, flipping the eggs in the pan. “I’m always lucky when it comes to you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest tightened again, but this time it wasn’t entirely unpleasant. It was a bittersweet ache, a reminder of how much Rio had given her—a life filled with warmth and love, something she never thought she’d deserve after Evanora.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time Rio set a plate of eggs and toast in front of her, the sound of small feet thudding down the stairs echoed through the house. Nicky appeared in the doorway, his hair a messy tangle and his eyes still half-closed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning, Mama. Morning, Rio,” he mumbled, climbing into the chair next to Agatha and leaning against her side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning, kiddo,” Rio said cheerfully, ruffling his hair as she brought his plate to the table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha wrapped an arm around him, pulling him close as she kissed the top of his head. She felt the weight in her chest ease just a little.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wasn’t the broken child Evanora had tried to make her. She was stronger now, even if some days it didn’t feel that way. She had Rio, and she had Nicky—and that made all the difference.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sun was high, casting a cold glow over the campus, but Agatha barely noticed it. Her steps were mechanical, her heels clicking rhythmically against the polished floors as she moved between her office, lectures, and meetings. She kept her head high, her demeanor as calm and collected as ever, but beneath the surface, her thoughts were in turmoil.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Every corner of her mind felt steeped in the past, as if Evanora’s presence had seeped back into her life, unbidden and suffocating. The anniversary of her mother’s death wasn’t something she celebrated, nor was it something she allowed herself to grieve openly. Instead, she carried the weight of it in silence, locking it away where no one could reach it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The ache in her chest spread like a slow poison, making it harder to focus. By mid-afternoon, her lectures were a blur, her voice moving through the motions while her mind remained elsewhere. Her students didn’t seem to notice anything amiss—Agatha Harkness was as poised as ever—but she could feel the cracks forming, threatening to split her open.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Back in her office, she stood behind her desk, her hands hovering over a stack of lecture notes she’d been meaning to work on. Her breathing was uneven, the oppressive silence of the room pressing in on her. She reached up to pinch the bridge of her nose, trying to steady herself, but it was no use.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She needed someone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The thought surprised her—Agatha had always prided herself on her independence, on her ability to carry her burdens alone. But today, the weight was too much.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The only person who came to mind was Lilia.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia wasn’t her mother. She didn’t share Agatha’s history or scars. But she was Rio’s mother, the woman who had loved and cared for the person Agatha adored more than life itself. Somehow, in her desperation, it made sense. Lilia’s presence felt like the kind of safe harbor Agatha had never really experienced.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">If she couldn’t have had that with her own mother, perhaps she could borrow it here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her hand shook as she reached for her phone. She stared at the screen for a long moment, hesitating, before dialing Lilia’s number. The ringing seemed to stretch on forever, each second amplifying the lump in her throat, until finally, Lilia’s warm, familiar voice answered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha, dear? What a pleasure to hear from you. Is everything alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips parted, but no sound came out at first. She swallowed hard, forcing herself to speak. “I… I was wondering if I could come by.” Her voice wavered, betraying her. “Without Rio. I just… I need some time. If it’s alright.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a pause on the other end, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. It was the kind of silence that made space for understanding. “Of course, sweetheart. Come whenever you’re ready. I’ll have tea waiting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed her eyes, exhaling deeply. Relief washed over her, loosening the tight knot in her chest just a fraction. “Thank you,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She ended the call and stood there for a moment, the phone still in her hand. The decision to reach out felt strange, unfamiliar, but not wrong. It was a small step—a quiet acknowledgment that maybe she didn’t have to face this day alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she gathered her things to leave, Agatha paused, her hand lingering over her phone on the desk. The weight of the day pressed heavily on her chest, but she knew she needed to send a message to Rio—something simple, something that wouldn’t invite too many questions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a moment of hesitation, she unlocked her phone again and typed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Hey, love. I’ll be home a little later than usual. Just have something I need to take care of first. Don’t wait up for me to eat, okay?</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stared at the screen for a beat before hitting send, hoping her words wouldn’t spark worry in Rio. She hated the vague nature of the message, but the alternative—explaining the knot of emotions she was carrying—felt impossible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, she hit send, her chest tightening as the message disappeared into the ether.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The reply came quickly, as it always did with Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Okay. Be safe, Nicky and I will be just fine. I’ll make sure there’s food waiting for you when you get back. I love you, Agatha.</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a small, grateful smile. Just reading Rio’s reply grounded her. Even without knowing the details, Rio always had her back. It was a reminder of why she needed to make peace with this day, to let herself heal for the sake of the family she had now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Slipping her phone into her bag, she exhaled slowly and glanced around her office. The familiar surroundings—her books, her neatly organized desk, even the faint scent of lavender that usually soothed her felt strangely distant, as though she were looking at her life from the outside in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shaking off the thought, she grabbed her coat and made her way out of the building, the crisp late afternoon air biting at her cheeks as she stepped outside. The sun was beginning to sink lower in the sky, creating colors and shapes that weren’t there earlier that day. It was beautiful, but Agatha barely registered it, her focus already on the drive ahead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She started the engine, the hum of the car filling the quiet as she pulled out of the parking lot. The roads stretched ahead, familiar yet distant, much like her thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">On impulse, she reached over and turned on the radio, letting the soft strains of music fill the space. It was a station Rio always listened to, full of oldies and gentle tunes. The familiarity of it eased the tension in her shoulders, if only slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The drive felt longer than it was, every mile stretching out as her mind wandered. Memories of Evanora flickered in and out, her sharp eyes and cutting words as vivid as if they were happening now. Agatha clenched the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the leather.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But then she thought of Lilia’s voice, warm and inviting, and the image of Rio’s text lit up in her mind. <em>I’ll make sure there’s food waiting for you when you get back. I love you, Agatha.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That was what mattered. That was her reality now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time she pulled up in front of Lilia’s house, the sun had dipped low, casting long shadows across the quiet street. Agatha sat in the car for a moment, staring at the warm glow spilling from the windows. The house exuded the same welcoming energy its owner did, and for the first time that day, Agatha felt the smallest sliver of relief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a deep breath, gathered her things, and stepped out of the car. With each step toward the front door, the knot in her chest loosened ever so slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She hadn’t fully decided what she would say—or if she would say anything at all—but the weight on her chest was suffocating. She needed this, even if she didn’t entirely understand why.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She climbed on the porch and  knocked lightly on the door, and it opened not even five seconds later, and there stood Lilia, her warm, knowing smile easing some of the tension in Agatha’s chest. “Agatha,” Lilia greeted, stepping aside and gesturing for her to come in. “Just so you know, you never have to knock. My door is always open for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha managed a small smile, stepping into the cozy home. It smelled faintly of cinnamon and chamomile, a comforting mix that reminded her why Rio always said Lilia’s house felt like a safe haven.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Agatha said softly, removing her coat and hanging it by the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on in,” Lilia said, guiding her to the living room, where a pot of tea and two cups waited on the coffee table. “I wasn’t sure what kind of day you’d had,” Lilia said gently, sitting across from her. “But I figured tea couldn’t hurt—or something stronger.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled quietly, the sound dry and thin. “Tea is fine. Thank you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Lilia bustled into the kitchen, Agatha sank into the sofa, her eyes scanning the room. It was a space filled with warmth—photographs of Rio, even one of Nicky and her at his choir show,  bookshelves overflowing with well-loved novels, and a collection of plants also thriving under Lilia’s care, not as much as Rio’s but enough to know who she had gotten that love from.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a room brimming with life, love, and history—a stark contrast to the cold, sterile environment of Agatha’s childhood home. Sitting here, surrounded by evidence of so much care, Agatha felt almost like an outsider, as though she were intruding on a world she didn’t quite belong to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Lilia returned, she silently put a plate of little biscuits in front of her, before settling into the chair across from her. Lilia didn’t ask questions or offer platitudes. Instead, she simply waited, her sharp eyes soft with patience and understanding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha wrapped her hands around the mug, its warmth grounding her. She hesitated, the weight of the day pressing heavily on her chest. “I… I didn’t mean to impose,” she began, her voice barely above a whisper. “I wasn’t sure where else to go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia shook her head, her tone firm but kind. “Impose? Nonsense. You’re family, Agatha. You’re my Rio’s family, and that makes you mine too, dear. Now,” she continued, her gaze unwavering but gentle, “what’s weighing you down?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s instinct was to deflect, to claim she was fine and avoid the vulnerability that question demanded. But the steady warmth in Lilia’s voice and the genuine care in her expression unraveled her defenses. Here, in this space, lying felt impossible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s…” Agatha paused, the words catching in her throat. She swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around the mug. “Today is an anniversary,” she admitted, her voice so soft it was almost lost in the quiet room. “Not… a good one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded slowly, her expression never faltering. “You don’t have to say more if you don’t want to,” she said gently. “But if you do, I’m here. No judgment. No rush.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze dropped to her tea, the rising steam swirling in mesmerizing patterns. The silence between them was thick but not oppressive; it was a space Lilia had created for her, free of expectations.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know how to talk about it,” Agatha confessed after a long pause. “I’m not even sure I know how to feel about it. It’s just… heavy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia leaned forward slightly, her presence a quiet anchor. “Grief and pain have a way of doing that,” she said softly. “But carrying it alone doesn’t make it any lighter, Agatha. Sometimes, sharing even a small piece of it can help.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked up, her chest tightening at the sincerity in Lilia’s words. This kind of gentle, unwavering support was so foreign to her, and yet, she found herself wanting to trust it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” she murmured, her voice tinged with emotion. “Just… being here helps.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia reached out, resting a comforting hand on Agatha’s knee. Her touch was light but steady, grounding. “You’re always welcome here,” she said firmly. “You’ve given Rio so much, and I see how deeply you love her and Nicky. But you need to remember, Agatha—love and care aren’t things you just give. You deserve them too. Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s throat tightened, and for a moment, she couldn’t speak. The words settled deep in her chest, warm and unfamiliar. It wasn’t the suffocating weight of her memories—it was something else, something softer—an almost maternal comfort she’d never truly experienced before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Agatha murmured again, her voice thick with emotion. She looked down at her tea, her heart feeling just a little lighter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers traced the rim of her tea mug, her eyes locked on the swirling liquid as if its movements might offer some clarity. The room was still, the silence heavy with unsaid words. Lilia didn’t rush her, didn’t ask any questions. Her presence was quiet, but it anchored Agatha, as steady and constant as the earth beneath her feet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The minutes stretched out, a thick web of unspoken emotions, until Agatha finally exhaled a long, shaky breath. Her voice came out softer than she intended, trembling with the weight of years of buried pain. “It’s about my mother.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia didn’t react with surprise or interruption. She simply leaned forward slightly, her hands folded calmly in her lap, her expression one of quiet, nonjudgmental patience. She allowed Agatha to take her time, to speak when she was ready.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Evanora,” Agatha said, the name a sharp bite in her mouth, each syllable like sandpaper. “She… wasn’t a good person. Not to me. Not to anyone.” Her eyes darkened, the pain that had been buried for so long breaking through in waves. “She hurt me in ways I didn’t even understand until I was much older.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s brows furrowed slightly, but she remained silent, allowing Agatha to speak at her own pace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She was controlling, cruel, and manipulative. Nothing I did was ever good enough. If I succeeded, it was because she expected it. If I failed, it was because I wasn’t worthy of her attention. She… she used to tell me I was unlovable, that I was a burden. That everything I touched would wither because that’s who I was—evil, a disappointment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her voice cracked, and she clutched the mug in her hands like it was the only thing keeping her tethered to the present. “She passed away four years ago today,” Agatha murmured, her voice cracking. “But sometimes, it feels like she’s still here. Her voice echoes in my head, even when I know it’s not true. Even when I know Rio loves me. Even when I know Nicky adores me. I can still hear her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s expression softened, and without a word, she reached out, her hand warm and steady as it rested over Agatha’s. “Oh, sweetheart,” she said, her voice thick with emotion, a softness Agatha hadn’t expected but desperately needed. “I’m so sorry you went through that. No one—especially not a child—should ever be made to feel like that. No one should have that kind of darkness thrust upon them.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked rapidly, her throat tight as tears welled up in her eyes. The dam she had held together for so long began to crack, and she let out a shaky breath. “I try so hard not to let it affect me, but some days…” She trailed off, her voice faltering. “Some days, it’s like she’s still here, still reminding me of all the ways I’m not enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia gave Agatha’s hand a firm squeeze, her voice unwavering as she spoke. “You are enough, Agatha. More than enough. You’ve built a life filled with love—real, genuine love—with Rio, with Nicky. That takes strength. That takes resilience. That takes so much heart. Your mother may have tried to dim your light, but she failed. Look at you now—you’re a wonderful partner. A loving mother. Someone Rio trusts with her whole heart. Someone she loves more than anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s breath caught, and the tears she had been holding back spilled over, tracing a slow path down her cheeks. She looked up at Lilia, her heart aching with both gratitude and sorrow. “I don’t know how to let it go,” she whispered, her voice cracking under the weight of it all. “I don’t know how to stop hearing her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia moved to sit beside Agatha on the sofa, her presence steady and grounding as she gently wrapped an arm around Agatha’s shoulders. She pulled her close, enveloping her in the kind of embrace she had offered Rio countless times before—warm, unconditional, filled with the quiet assurance that everything would be okay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t need to have all the answers right now,” Lilia murmured, her voice soft but firm, carrying the wisdom of someone who had known both love and loss. “Healing isn’t a straight line, Agatha. It’s messy and unpredictable. But you don’t have to carry it alone, either.” Her words wrapped around Agatha like a blanket, soothing the raw, exposed parts of her that had been left too long without comfort. “Rio is with you. I’m with you. You’re a remarkable woman, Agatha, and an extraordinary mother. Don’t you ever forget that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A quiet sob caught in Agatha’s throat, but she swallowed it down, her eyes closing as she let herself sink deeper into Lilia’s embrace. She had never known this kind of tenderness, the kind that didn’t come with strings attached, the kind that simply existed to offer warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You have a family now, Agatha,” Lilia continued, her words laced with an unwavering conviction. “A real family. One that sees you, that cherishes you for everything you are. One that will remind you every single day that you are so much more than what she made you believe. So much more.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest tightened, her breath shaky as she let the weight of those words settle into her bones. She had spent so many years trying to convince herself she didn’t need anything more, but here, in this moment, the truth of Lilia’s words began to crack the walls she had built around her heart. For the first time in years, she allowed herself to hope.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She rested her head against Lilia’s shoulder, her body trembling slightly as she exhaled a shaky breath. The weight of everything she had been carrying felt a little lighter, just enough to let her breathe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Agatha whispered, her voice small but thick with emotion, the words barely more than a breath.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia pressed a soft kiss to the top of Agatha’s head, her hand stroking the back of her hair in a gesture of quiet affection. “Always, my dear,” she said, her voice thick with emotion, carrying the comfort of someone who truly understood what it meant to offer love without hesitation. “Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pulled away slightly, dabbing at her eyes with the tissue Lilia had handed her, her hands trembling as they held it. Her voice wavered, raw and fragile, as she allowed herself a vulnerability she had long kept hidden.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know how to tell Rio,” she whispered, her gaze fixed on her lap, as if the weight of the confession were too much to bear. “About everything. About Evanora… about what she did to me. I’ve shared pieces, but not the whole truth. I don’t know if I can bring myself to say it all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s brow furrowed, her hand still resting on Agatha’s shoulder with a quiet steadiness that spoke of years of knowing how to hold space for someone in pain. “Why do you think you can’t?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha swallowed, a sob catching in her throat. She took a shaky breath, her words struggling to surface. “Because… because I’m terrified it’ll scare her away,” she admitted, her voice cracking. “What if it’s too much for her? What if she sees how broken I am and decides I’m not worth it? She doesn’t deserve that. She deserves someone whole, someone… someone who isn’t this mess.” Her hands twisted together in her lap, betraying just how deep the fear ran—fear of rejection, fear of failure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s expression softened, her heart aching for Agatha. “Agatha,” she said gently, her tone firm but warm, “Rio loves you. She loves you with a depth that most people spend their entire lives searching for. Nothing about your past will change that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, the words not fully reaching her. “You say that, but—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No buts,” Lilia interrupted, her voice resolute. “Listen to me. I’ve seen the way Rio looks at you. You’re her person, her heart, her home. She would walk through fire for you, just as you would for her. Sharing your truth won’t scare her away; it’ll only bring you closer. Do you know why?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, tears threatening to spill again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Because Rio doesn’t love you in spite of your struggles,” Lilia continued, her voice soft yet unwavering. “She loves you because of them. All of you. She knows the pain you’ve carried, the weight of the years you’ve spent fighting alone. She admires your strength, even when you don’t see it yourself. And the truth? It’s not a burden to her—it’s an honor to be the person you trust enough to share it with.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips trembled, her eyes glistening as she whispered, “But what if I’m too much?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia reached out, taking both of Agatha’s hands in hers. “You are not too much, Agatha. You are exactly enough. Rio isn’t going anywhere, no matter what you tell her. And if you need more time to feel ready, that’s okay too. But don’t let fear rob you of the chance to let her love you fully.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded slowly, her chest feeling both heavy and a little lighter at the same time. “You really think she won’t… look at me differently?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I raised that girl, I know she won’t,” Lilia said confidently. “She looks at you like you hung the moon, Agatha. And that’s not going to change.” She paused, as if weighing something important, before adding, “And you know, if there’s anyone who might understand what it feels like to be an unloved child, it’s Rio. She might know more than you think. Don’t underestimate her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a shaky breath, a small, tentative smile breaking through her tears. “Thank you, Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sweetheart,” Lilia said, squeezing her hands. “You’re part of this family now, too. And we take care of our own.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Lilia refilled the cup of tea in front of Agatha, she gently said, “You know, you don’t have to do this alone.  If you’re ready, we could call Rio, have this conversation together. Sometimes, sharing the burden makes it a little lighter.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, her fingers tracing the edge of the cup. The thought of opening up to Rio fully was overwhelming, but Lilia’s presence gave her a sense of safety she hadn’t felt in a long time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you think… she’d want to hear all of this now?” Agatha asked, her voice barely above a whisper, tinged with doubt and fear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled warmly. “Agatha, she would drop everything if it meant being there for you. You just need to let her know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a long breath, her fingers tightening slightly around the cup. “Okay,” she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. “Let’s call her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, giving her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. “Good. I’ll be right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With hands that shook despite her best efforts, Agatha reached for her phone. She dialed Rio’s number, the sound of the ring reverberating in her chest. It rang twice before Rio answered, her voice soft and sweet as ever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, love. Everything okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a slow, steadying breath, glancing at Lilia, who gave her an encouraging nod. “Rio, I… I need you. Could you come to Lilia’s house? There’s something important I need to talk to you about.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s tone turned even softer, laced with love and determination. “Of course, Agatha. Let me just drop Nicky off at Wanda’s, and I’ll be right there. Are you okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m… trying to be,” Agatha admitted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s all that matters,” Rio said gently. “I’ll be there soon, okay? Just hold on.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Agatha whispered, her voice breaking slightly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After they hung up, Lilia gave her a reassuring smile. “She’s on her way. You’re going to be okay, Agatha. I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, swallowing hard as she tried to steady herself. The weight of the impending conversation loomed large, but with Lilia’s unwavering support and the knowledge that Rio was coming, she felt just a little less alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio arrived at Lilia’s house, she didn’t even bother knocking. She knew where the spare key was hidden and let herself in, her heart racing with worry. Lilia met her in the entryway, her expression calm but tinged with concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s in the living room,” Lilia said softly, resting a reassuring hand on Rio’s shoulder. “Take your time with her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded and hurried into the room. She found Agatha sitting on the couch, her posture rigid, as if she were holding herself together by sheer force of will. Her hands gripped the cold, forgotten cup of tea, and her face was drawn, eyes red and tired.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sight of her like that broke something deep inside Rio, and without a word, she crossed the room, kneeling in front of Agatha. She reached for her hands, gently prying them from the mug, holding them with a tenderness that spoke volumes. “Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice soft yet steady. “I’m here. Whatever it is, talk to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips trembled as she looked down at Rio. “I’m sorry,” she whispered. “I didn’t want to bother you. I didn’t want to… burden you with this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, her gaze unwavering as she cupped Agatha’s hands in both of hers, holding them close to her chest. “Love,” she said firmly, her tone soothing yet resolute, “You are never a burden. You never have been, not to me. Whatever this is, we’ll carry it together. Let me in, Agatha. Please.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, her gaze flickering to Lilia, who sat quietly in the armchair nearby. Lilia gave her a soft, encouraging nod, her presence a steady reminder that she wasn’t alone. Agatha took a shaky breath, her chest rising and falling as she began to speak.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For what felt like an eternity, Agatha shared the depth of her pain—of Evanora’s cruelty, the relentless emotional manipulation, and the scars that had never fully healed. She spoke of the weight of her mother’s expectations, of the fear and pain she had carried for years, of the nights spent in cupboards or the rod that had met her fingers on multiple occasions, and the complicated, tangled emotions she still wrestled with, even after Evanora’s death.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Throughout it all, Rio remained silent, her expression a mix of heartbreak and fierce love. She listened with a quiet intensity, her heart aching for the woman in front of her. When Agatha faltered, her voice catching on the words that were too hard to say, Rio reached out to touch her, her fingers soft on Agatha’s arm or cheek, grounding her with every gentle, tender touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t have to keep going if it’s too much,” Rio whispered when Agatha paused, her voice full of both compassion and strength. “I’m right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha swallowed hard, nodding, and though her pain was raw and heavy, she could feel the weight of it just a little less when Rio’s presence enveloped her. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the story unfolded, Agatha’s composure began to unravel. Her voice quivered, and then cracked, the weight of the words too much to bear. Tears welled up and spilled over her cheeks as she choked on the confession. “I didn’t want you to know this,” she whispered through sobs, her chest heaving. “I didn’t want you to think less of me… to be afraid of what I come from.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart shattered at the sight, and without hesitation, she surged forward, wrapping her arms around Agatha in a fierce, protective embrace. “Agatha Harkness,” she said, her voice fierce with love, her own tears falling now, “There is nothing in this world that could ever make me think less of you. You are the strongest, most incredible woman I’ve ever known. And I love you—every single part of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the sound of those words, Agatha broke completely, her body shaking as she buried her face in Rio’s shoulder. The flood of emotions she’d kept locked away for so long poured out in a torrent of grief. Rio held her tightly, whispering softly into her hair, over and over, words of reassurance—<em>you’re safe</em>… <em>you’re loved</em>… <em>you don’t have to carry this alone anymore</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From her spot in the armchair, Lilia watched them in quiet understanding, her heart aching for Agatha, but swelling with pride for Rio’s unwavering, unconditional support.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Time seemed to slow as Agatha’s sobs eventually began to subside. She pulled back slightly, her tear-streaked face lifting to meet Rio’s gaze. A faint, trembling smile played on her lips, and she whispered, “Thank you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gently brushed a strand of hair from Agatha’s face, her touch soft and tender. She leaned in and kissed Agatha, her lips lingering as if to seal her promise. “My love,” Rio whispered against her lips, her voice steady with conviction. “We’ll get through this together. You, me, Nicky… and Lilia. Forever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, a deep, shaky breath escaping her. For the first time in what felt like ages, she allowed herself to simply breathe, to feel the weight lift ever so slightly, knowing that she no longer had to carry it alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha and Rio prepared to leave Lilia’s house, Lilia walked them to the door, her warm smile chasing away the remnants of the heaviness that had hung in the air earlier. She pulled Agatha into a tight hug first, holding her close.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Lilia said softly, her voice full of warmth and conviction, “I want you to know something. When you made the choice to love my daughter like you do—you became <em>my</em> daughter, too. And I love you and I am so proud of both of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s breath hitched as she returned the embrace, overwhelmed by the sincerity in Lilia’s words. “Thank you,” she managed, her voice thick with emotion. “I… I don’t even know what to say.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t have to say anything,” Lilia said, pulling back just enough to look Agatha in the eyes. “Just remember that I’m here. For both of you. Always. If you ever need to talk, or even if you just need a mother’s presence, my door is always open.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her heart full. A quiet tear slid down her cheek, but this time, it was a tear of relief, of love. “I’ll remember,” she promised, her voice filled with the same sincerity that had colored Lilia’s words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then Lilia turned to Rio, pulling her into a similarly tight hug, her arms wrapping around Rio with the same warmth and protection she’d offered for years. “I love you so much, my sweet girl,” Lilia said softly, her voice tender but unwavering. “You’ve made me so proud every single day since the moment I met you. And seeing the way you love and care for Agatha? That makes me even prouder. You’ve given me more joy than I ever expected.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes welled with tears, and she sniffled, blinking rapidly to keep them from spilling. She hugged Lilia back just as fiercely, her voice trembling as she whispered, “I love you too, Mom. Thank you for… for everything you’ve done for me. I don’t know how I would have gotten here without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia kissed the top of Rio’s head, a gesture of reassurance, before pulling back just enough to gaze into her daughter’s eyes. The sheen of unshed tears reflected the depth of her love and pride. “Take care of each other, okay? Life isn’t always easy, but as long as you have each other, you’ve got everything you need.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Rio nodded in unison, their hands automatically finding each other as they stepped out the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We will,” Rio said, her fingers intertwining with Agatha’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And don’t hesitate to come back,” Lilia added with a light, knowing smile, though her eyes were soft with emotion. “Whether it’s for a talk, a hug, or just a good meal. You’re always welcome here, no matter what.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned back for a moment, offering Lilia a small but heartfelt smile. “Thank you, Lilia. For everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia waved them off with the same warmth in her smile, a promise lingering in her gaze. “You’re welcome, my dear. You’re always welcome.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha and Rio stepped out the door and made their way to the car, Rio glanced over at Agatha, still holding her hand firmly. “You okay?” Rio asked gently, her voice low, though her concern was evident.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her gaze drifting out the window as she gathered herself. She took a steadying breath before answering, her voice calm but sincere. “I think I will be,” she replied, a slight, fragile smile curling at the corners of her lips. She turned her head slightly to look at Rio, a soft warmth in her eyes. “Thanks to you and your… Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, the expression full of affection. “You can say ‘my mom,’ love,” she teased, her voice light yet meaningful, “especially now that she’s made it crystal clear that she’s yours too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned over to kiss her cheek at a red light, her heart full. They might have a long journey ahead, but they had each other—and that was enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After the emotionally charged conversation with Lilia, Agatha and Rio made their way to Wanda’s house, the weight of the day lingering between them. The quiet was comfortable, though, a soft hum of shared understanding in the air. When they arrived, they found Nicky already dozing off in Wanda’s arms, his small face relaxed in peaceful slumber, his head nestled gently against her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart softened at the sight, and without a word, she crossed the room, her arms already open. With a quiet, grateful smile, Wanda carefully passed Nicky into Agatha’s embrace. Agatha cradled him with the tenderness of a mother, her heart swelling as she held him close. His tiny breaths were slow and steady, warm against her neck, as if in his sleep, he was offering her the comfort she’d been yearning for all day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The drive back home was silent but serene, the gentle hum of the car and the soft murmur of the world outside filling the space. Rio’s left hand was on the wheel and the right rested on Agatha’s thigh, warm and steady, offering a silent reassurance that no words could match. They didn’t need to speak; the quiet comfort of their presence was enough. Agatha kept her gaze on the road, her mind wandering through the conversation with Lilia and the overwhelming kindness Rio had shown her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For the first time in a long while, Agatha felt like she was slowly coming to terms with the weight of her past. The way Rio had supported her—no questions asked, no hesitation—was a balm to her soul. She could feel herself beginning to breathe again, a deep, cleansing breath that came from a place of acceptance. Rio understood her in ways that no one else ever had. She wasn’t just her girlfriend; she was her partner in every sense, carrying the burden of Agatha’s pain with grace and love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once at home, Agatha gently carried Nicky inside and into his room. She placed him carefully in his bed, tucking him in with the same tenderness that had become second nature to her. As she stood there for a moment, watching him sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It wasn’t long before Rio entered the room, her presence as comforting as always. She stood quietly by the doorway, watching Agatha with a knowing smile, her gentle energy filling the space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned to her, her heart full, her voice soft in the stillness of the night. “We’re getting the bunny.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, a look of surprise quickly spreading across her face. “What? Really?” Her eyes shone with excitement, and Agatha couldn’t help but smile at the unexpected joy that lit up Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, savoring the moment. “Yes. I know it’s something you and Nicky have both wanted for a while, and… after everything today, I think it’s time. We’ll get the bunny.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face lit up like a child on Christmas morning, her excitement bubbling over as she rushed to Agatha and enveloped her in a tight hug. “Thank you, Agatha. Seriously, thank you. Nicky’s going to be over the moon when he hears this!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, squeezing Rio back with equal affection. “I know he will. But don’t forget—we’re the ones who’ll be taking care of it, not just Nicky. And no turning our house into a zoo. And please, no names like ‘Fluffykins’ or ‘Bubbles,’ alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled back slightly, her grin widening. “I promise, no ‘Fluffykins,’ I swear. But this is going to be so much fun! I can already picture how the house is going to feel with a new little furry friend running around.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her eyes twinkling with warmth as she watched Rio’s excitement. “I’m glad you’re excited. We’ll tell Nicky tomorrow, but tonight, I think we should focus on getting some rest. It’s been an emotional day for all of us, and we all need a good night’s sleep.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, a content smile on her face. “You’re right. But this… it feels like a good start to a new chapter, doesn’t it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her heart lighter than it had been all day. “It really does. We’re building something special. For all of us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, they both stood for a moment, gazing at Nicky, who was peacefully asleep in his bed. And even though there was still healing to be done, Agatha felt a sense of peace wash over her, knowing they were all moving forward, together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once they settled into bed, the room dim and quiet, a gentle calm settled over them. Agatha nestled into Rio’s side, her body instinctively seeking the comfort of the woman who had become her safe harbor. The familiar warmth of Rio enveloped her, and Agatha let out a soft sigh of relief as she felt the weight of the day begin to lift. Rio wrapped her arm around Agatha, pulling her closer, their bodies aligned as their faces drew near, their breathing in sync, slow and steady, filling the quiet of the night with a peaceful rhythm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, her voice soft but filled with emotion, whispered, “Thank you, Rio. For being here… for everything. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her hand gently trailing across Agatha’s back. “There’s no need to thank me. I’m right here, Agatha. Always will be. This… us… it’s what we do. We’re in this together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The simplicity of Rio’s words, the certainty and unconditional love that filled them, made Agatha’s heart swell with emotion. “I’m just… so grateful. You make everything feel right, even on the hardest days. I don’t know how you do it, but you do. You just make everything feel like it’s going to be okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s forehead, holding her a little tighter. “I’m yours, Agatha. You don’t ever have to carry anything alone, not with me by your side. You’re my heart, and my home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a contented sigh, burying her face into the crook of Rio’s neck, feeling the steady rhythm of her pulse beneath her cheek. “I love you so much. I don’t say it enough, but I do. More than I can express.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, the sound low and comforting, and Agatha’s heart melted at the sound of it. “You don’t have to say it every second, love. I know. And I love you too, more than anything, just as much as that boy in the other room. More than you could ever know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They held each other quietly for a while, the weight of their shared love making everything feel right in the world. It was in these moments, in the stillness of their connection, that Agatha found a kind of peace she had never known before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p align="justify">                  (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Saturday morning dawned bright and clear, the perfect day for an outing. Agatha and Rio moved through the kitchen with practiced ease, each of them immersed in the rhythm of preparing breakfast. The sound of eggs sizzling in the pan and the soft clink of utensils filled the air, creating a cozy, familiar atmosphere. Nicky, in his usual lively manner, chattered away, completely oblivious to the plan that had been set into motion for the day. He eagerly described his imagined adventures, his excitement building as he spoke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced over at Rio, a small, amused smile tugging at her lips. Their eyes met across the counter, a shared understanding passing between them—a silent acknowledgment of the surprise they were about to spring on Nicky. They had this little secret, this small act of joy they were about to share, and it felt like the perfect way to end a week that had been full of emotion and healing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once breakfast was ready, they bundled up in coats and scarves, the crisp air outside beckoning them. Nicky, in his usual excitement, practically bounced around the kitchen as they finished tidying up, still blissfully unaware of what was coming. Agatha couldn’t help but smile as she watched him, her heart full. There was something about Nicky’s boundless energy, his unfiltered joy, that made everything feel a little brighter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They made their way to the car, and today, it was Rio who took the wheel. Agatha slid into the passenger seat, a contented sigh escaping her as she settled in, the comfort of their shared space still fresh in her mind. Nicky climbed into the backseat, his little legs swinging as he buckled up, still talking nonstop about what he imagined they were going to do. But what he didn’t know was that today, he was in for a surprise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Where are we going?” Nicky asked, his bright eyes shifting between Agatha and Rio, his curiosity piqued. He was always full of questions, his mind racing with possibilities.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot a playful glance at Agatha, her smile wide and conspiratorial. “We’re taking a little detour today, buddy. But I think you’re going to like it,” she said, her voice light but with a hint of excitement in it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tilted his head, his brow furrowing in confusion. “A detour? What’s that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, reaching back to ruffle his hair. “You’ll see soon enough,” she said, her tone warm, but there was a playful edge to it that made Nicky squirm with anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The car hummed along the road, the familiar scenery of their town giving way to something a little more out of the ordinary. Rio’s hands on the steering wheel were steady, her gaze flicking back and forth between the road and Agatha, whose eyes sparkled with the quiet joy of sharing this moment with her. For a moment, there was nothing but the peaceful hum of the car and the shared excitement between the three of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes darted back and forth between them, clearly trying to piece together what was going on. “Okay, you two are being sneaky. Tell me, tell me!” he demanded, a giggle bubbling up in his chest as he glanced between his moms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exchanged a quick, knowing glance with Rio, the playful tension making the moment feel like a secret between them all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll tell you when we get there,” Agatha said, her voice low and teasing, enjoying the suspense. Nicky groaned, clearly desperate for the reveal, but Agatha could tell it was only making him more excited.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze flicked to the rearview mirror, her excitement practically bubbling over, though she kept her eyes on the road. Her smile was wide, and she couldn’t contain the thrill in her voice. “We thought it was time to add a new member to our family,” she said, her tone playful yet filled with an underlying warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a brief moment, Nicky furrowed his brow, trying to make sense of the hint in her words. His little mind was racing, connecting dots in his own way. Then, with a sudden gasp, his eyes widened in surprise, his voice tinged with innocent hope. “Am I getting a little sister?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes snapped wide, her grip tightening on the wheel as she nearly swerved, and Agatha let out a strangled breath at the question. The unexpected thought had caught them both off guard. Agatha cleared her throat, still recovering from the shock, her voice soft but firm. She sneaked a glace towards Rio, who was staring straight ahead, and Agatha couldn’t tell if she had paled or blushed. Probably both.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, sweetheart. No little sister,” she said, her tone weak from the surprise. “We were thinking more in terms of… a little furry friend.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes widened. “Are we getting my bunny? Really? A bunny?!” he exclaimed, his voice a mix of disbelief and pure joy, the panic his innocent earlier question has caused completely overlooked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but laugh softly at the sheer joy lighting up his face, deciding to table the little sister conversation for later. Much later. She turned in her seat, her heart warmed by his excitement. “We’re going to the pet shelter to look for one,” she confirmed, her voice calm but with an edge of amusement at his reaction. “But only if we find the right one,” she added, a small smile curving her lips as she glanced at Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s excitement was almost too much to contain, his body practically vibrating with enthusiasm. “Oh, I promise, Mama, I’ll find the best bunny ever!” he declared with such earnestness that it was impossible not to laugh. “And I’ll take care of it, and—” He paused, as if the excitement was too big for words to hold, and then finally burst out, “Thank you, thank you, thank you!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s laughter joined his, now that she had recovered, a rich, soothing sound that filled the car with a sense of shared joy. Without taking her eyes off the road, she reached her hand back and patted Nicky’s knees gently. “Don’t thank us yet,” she teased, her tone lighthearted but sincere. “You’ll have a lot of responsibility with a bunny, mister.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I will!” Nicky responded with all the seriousness of a child making a grand promise. His nod was so earnest, his face so full of determination, that even Agatha couldn’t hold back a smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll see if we find the right one,” Agatha added softly, her eyes meeting Rio’s briefly, her heart full as she took in the moment. “But I think we’ll be okay. We’ll find the perfect bunny for our perfect family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the car continued down the road, Nicky’s excited chatter filled the air, a perfect soundtrack to the journey ahead. He talked about all the ways he would take care of the bunny, from giving it food and water to making sure it had the comfiest little bed. His words spilled out so fast, full of plans and promises that were as big as his heart. And for a moment, Agatha and Rio could only listen, their hearts full of love and anticipation for the new chapter they were about to open together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The pet shelter was a lively, bustling place, filled with the soft sounds of animals moving in their enclosures and the gentle hum of conversations. Volunteers moved about, tending to the animals and assisting families, while the air was thick with the warmth of both the shelter and the sense of purpose that came with the mission of helping these animals find homes. Nicky’s grip on Rio’s hand was firm, his small fingers wrapped around hers as they walked down the rows of enclosures. His eyes were wide with wonder, taking in every sight, every sound, and every excited animal that caught his attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sight of so many animals, their little faces filled with longing and curiosity, tugged at Rio’s heart. She could already feel the connection forming, knowing this trip was going to mean so much more than simply getting a pet for Nicky. It was a step forward in their journey as a family, and it felt like an opportunity to share a deeper bond, one that transcended just adopting an animal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The shelter was teeming with life. The soft rustle of hay in some of the cages mixed with some soft barks and purring and the faint sound of families chatting excitedly about their future pets. Nicky’s excitement was palpable, and he tugged at Rio’s hand with each step, practically bouncing with joy. He had his eyes trained on every animal they passed, and though they hadn’t even reached the rabbit section yet, his energy was like a live wire, ready to explode at any moment. Agatha, walking beside them, followed with a calm but affectionate gaze. She watched the way Nicky’s eyes lit up, her heart softened by his enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they continued, a cheerful woman with a clipboard approached them, her warm smile instantly reassuring. She knelt slightly to meet Nicky at his level, her eyes twinkling with kindness. “Hi there! What brings you to the shelter today, little guy?” she asked, her tone friendly and welcoming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed up at her, the excitement practically vibrating through him. “I’m getting a bunny!” he declared loudly, his voice filled with pure joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The woman laughed softly, her smile widening. “That’s so exciting! And who are you here with today?” she asked, clearly charmed by Nicky’s enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without a moment’s hesitation, Nicky looked over at Rio and Agatha with a proud grin, his voice loud and clear. “I’m here with my moms!” he said, his words ringing out with confidence and an innocent joy that made Rio’s heart skip a beat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hit Rio like a wave, and for a split second, the world seemed to fade away. <em>My moms.</em> She barely caught herself from gasping, her breath hitching in her chest as the weight of those words settled inside her. It felt new, like something raw and beautiful, the kind of moment that took your breath away. To hear Nicky say it out loud, in front of another person, filled her with an overwhelming warmth. She had always known that this was her family, that they had found something special together, but hearing it spoken so plainly felt like a seal on the bond they were all building.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her heart fluttered, full of a tender love that still caught her off guard. The feeling was both powerful and overwhelming, yet it felt so undeniably right. It was the first time Nicky had said it so openly, and in the presence of strangers, no less. The joy that radiated from him made everything feel like it was falling into place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The woman stood up, her smile widening even more as she looked up at Rio and Agatha. “That’s wonderful,” she said warmly. “Welcome, all of you! Let’s see if we can find the perfect bunny for your family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the shelter manager led them deeper into the rows of animals, Agatha glanced over at Rio. She noticed the faint pink tint coloring her cheeks, and the corner of her mouth curved upward in a knowing smirk. She leaned in slightly, her voice soft but teasing. “You okay, Mom?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes widened for a moment, caught off guard by Agatha’s teasing. She shot her a flustered look, the heat in her cheeks deepening as she whispered back, “Stop it.” But despite the fluster, the soft, glowing smile that followed couldn’t hide the warmth she was feeling inside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hand in hand with Nicky, Rio squeezed his fingers gently, marveling at how something so small could feel so big, the butterflies still fluttering as she silently marveled at how a single word could feel like the greatest honor in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha trailed behind, her arms crossed loosely as she walked, but her eyes never left the two of them. Her gaze was warm and affectionate, a soft smile tugging at her lips as she watched Nicky’s boundless enthusiasm. The way his energy could make even the smallest thing seem like an adventure was contagious. Rio, beside him, mirrored his excitement as they ventured deeper into the shelter, each new animal discovery sparking a fresh wave of joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Look at this one!” Nicky exclaimed, his small hands pressing eagerly against the glass of a guinea pig enclosure. The little creature inside, with its round, fuzzy body, blinked up at him, oblivious to the adoration being poured upon it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned closer, her smile widening at the sight. “It’s adorable, Nicky. You think they’re all this fuzzy?” she asked, genuinely intrigued by the tiny creature’s charm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Probably!” Nicky answered, turning back to her with his face aglow, his eyes brighter than ever. His enthusiasm was a breath of fresh air, so pure and filled with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They moved on, their footsteps echoing softly in the shelter, until they reached the kitten enclosures. The moment Nicky saw a tiny gray tabby pawing eagerly at the glass, his eyes went wide, and he squealed in delight. “Mom! Look!” he exclaimed, tugging at Rio’s sleeve urgently, as though he were trying to share the joy of the moment with her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled, and a gentle laugh escaped her as she looked at the little kitten. “She likes you already, doesn’t she?” Rio said softly, tapping the glass in sync with the kitten’s pawing. Her heart melted as the small creature seemed to reach out for Nicky, creating a moment of quiet, sweet connection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes filled with longing as he looked up at Rio. “Can we—” he began, his voice hopeful, his fingers still pressed to the glass.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Agatha, who had been watching the exchange with a fond but knowing smile, stepped forward with a raised brow. Her voice was light but carried the weight of a gentle reminder. “One pet, remember?” she said, her tone playful yet firm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, momentarily caught in his excitement, glanced at Agatha and nodded, his face reddening a little with a sheepish smile. “Right. Just one.” His voice had a hint of both reluctance and understanding, realizing the importance of the decision. Though his heart still ached for that adorable kitten, he respected the rule Agatha had set.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, giving Nicky a reassuring squeeze. “We’ll find the perfect one, don’t worry,” she said, her voice soft and encouraging. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They moved through the shelter at a leisurely pace, pausing by each enclosure as they explored. Rio gasped in delight over the kittens, her voice soft and full of admiration, her hands pressed to the glass as she cooed at the tiny furballs. She smiled at the puppies, too, her heart melting at their puppy-dog eyes and clumsy, playful antics. Even the birds caught her attention, their vibrant colors and fluttering wings captivating her for a moment. Nicky being the the enthusiastic mimic he was, mirrored her gestures, exaggerating her expressions, which had Agatha stifling a laugh. His energy was infectious, and Rio couldn’t help but share in his joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they reached the rabbit section, their excitement was palpable. Rio practically bounced on her feet, eyes wide with wonder as she pointed at a small grey bunny with perky ears. “Oh, look at this one!” she exclaimed, her voice filled with awe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, unable to contain himself, leaned forward, his face pressed against the glass. “It’s so cute!” he whispered, his voice barely audible but full of affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood beside them, hands on her hips as she watched her two favorite people fawn over the animals. “You two are going to fall for every single rabbit, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned her face up to her, eyes sparkling. “Can you blame us?” she teased.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft sigh, but the smile tugging at her lips betrayed her true feelings. She crouched down beside them, her gaze softening as she took in the sight of the grey bunny. “It <em>is</em> cute,” she admitted begrudgingly, her words filled with reluctant affection, which made Nicky gasp dramatically.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You like it too, Mama?” Nicky asked, his eyes widening with a mixture of surprise and excitement as he turned to look up at Agatha, his voice a pitch higher with the thrill of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, her hand brushing against his back. “I like seeing you happy,” she said simply.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled, and she couldn’t resist leaning into Agatha. “You’re softening,” she teased.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t push your luck,” Agatha replied with a mock glare, but her tone was warm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky continued to press his nose to the glass, Rio and Agatha exchanged a glance, their silent conversation clear: this was going to be a moment to remember.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha straightened up from where she had been leaning against the enclosure, her hands clasped firmly behind her back as she surveyed the scene before her. Rio and Nicky were darting between rabbit pens with the energy of two people who had never seen a more adorable creature in their lives, their enthusiasm practically vibrating the air around them. Their joy was palpable, infectious—and admittedly, completely adorable. But as they bounced from one enclosure to the next, it was also starting to feel a little like chaos.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She watched them with a mixture of affection and bemusement. She couldn’t help but marvel at how much energy they both had, how their shared excitement lit up the room, but it was quickly getting out of hand. Clearing her throat dramatically, she took a step forward, her voice carrying with teasing authority.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, you two,” Agatha called, raising an eyebrow in mock seriousness. “Let me remind you that we are here for one rabbit. One. Not a rabbit, two kittens, and a guinea pig. I’m talking to you, Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned from where she had been crouched by one of the pens, her face the picture of exaggerated innocence. “I wasn’t saying we should get the guinea pig,” she said, her voice light and airy. “I was just—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“—getting carried away,” Agatha finished for her, folding her arms and tilting her head slightly, her gaze pointed but affectionate. “You do realize you’re supposed to be the adult in this equation, don’t you, dear?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s mouth fell open, a theatrical gasp escaping her as she pointed an accusing finger at Nicky, who was still hopping eagerly between the enclosures. “He started it!” she protested, a playful grin tugging at her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did not!” Nicky interjected with a giggle, running over to another pen with a bounce in his step. “Mom! Come look at this one!” he called, his eyes wide with wonder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave Agatha a look of mock exasperation, holding her hands up. “See? It’s not just me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, though a smile tugged at her lips despite her best effort to remain firm. Pinching the bridge of her nose in mock frustration, she muttered loud enough for Rio to hear, “This is why I’m the voice of reason in this family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And we love you for it,” Rio said brightly, flashing her a grin before turning back to Nicky, her excitement undeterred.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shaking her head but unable to suppress a smile, Agatha trailed after them. She wasn’t even sure if they were picking a rabbit anymore or just admiring each and every one they passed. And yet, the sight of their excitement and shared joy filled her chest with warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Even if they were terrible at sticking to plans.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they moved through the rows of rabbit enclosures, Nicky and Rio’s chatter filled the air, their excitement bubbling over. Agatha trailed behind, content to watch them bond as they cooed at the animals. She was ready to step in when needed—whether to reel them in or facilitate their inevitable decision-making struggles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But then, as they neared a corner pen, something unexpected happened. A small, fluffy bunny with velvety white fur and beige spots hopped forward with surprising enthusiasm. It paused right at the edge of its enclosure, its floppy ears twitching as it tilted its head up, seemingly studying them—or rather, studying Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, surprised by the bunny’s sudden approach. “Well, hello there,” she murmured, crouching down without thinking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio and Nicky turned at the sound of Agatha’s voice, their attention immediately drawn to the little bunny. Nicky’s eyes widened in astonishment. “Mama, it likes you!” he gasped, his voice filled with wonder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bunny twitched its nose, then stretched up on its hind legs, as though it was trying to reach out to her. Agatha slowly extended her hand, and the bunny nuzzled her fingers gently through the bars of the pen, its soft fur brushing against her skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, kneeling beside Agatha. “Well, isn’t this a twist? Looks like the bunny picked you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shot her a dry look, though it was softened by a small smile as she turned back to the bunny, whose calm gaze seemed to hold a kind of quiet understanding. She couldn’t deny the strange, unexpected sense of connection she felt with the little creature. “I suppose we don’t have much of a choice now, do we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, clearly delighted, knelt on Agatha’s other side, his eyes wide and sparkling with hope. “Can we get this one? Please? I think it’s perfect!” he pleaded, his voice practically dancing with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, but there was no real exasperation in it—just a quiet acceptance of the inevitable. “I have a feeling saying no would make me the villain in this story,” she said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Absolutely,” Rio teased, nudging Agatha’s shoulder with a grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stroked the bunny gently through the bars, her expression softening as she watched it nuzzle her hand again. “Alright then,” she said, her voice quiet and almost affectionate. “It looks like we’ve found our bunny.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky threw his arms around her in delight, and Rio leaned into her with a radiant grin. Even as Agatha straightened up to speak with the shelter staff about finalizing the adoption, she could feel the bunny’s calm, curious gaze following her every move, as if silently acknowledging the new bond they had formed. The moment felt significant, a quiet affirmation that sometimes, the perfect connection came when least expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the counter, the shelter manager crouched down to Nicky’s level, her warm smile radiating kindness as she spoke. “Alright, young man,” she said, gesturing toward the bunny now nestled comfortably in a carrier. “This little one’s going to need a few things to settle into his new home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes sparkled with eager curiosity, and he leaned forward, gripping the edge of the counter with both hands. “What does the bunny need?” he asked, his voice filled with a seriousness that made both Agatha and Rio exchange amused but proud glances.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“First,” the manager said, holding up a checklist, “you’ll need a cozy enclosure—something safe and secure where your bunny can sleep and relax. It should be big enough for her to hop around comfortably. And bedding, of course! Soft bedding will make him feel at ease.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded again, his brow furrowing in concentration as if committing the list to memory. “Okay, a big home and soft stuff,” he echoed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, leaning over the counter. “Don’t worry, bud. We’ll make sure it’s the comfiest bunny palace ever,” she teased, ruffling Nicky’s hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The manager chuckled and continued, “Next, your bunny will need fresh hay every day. It’s the main part of its diet, along with some leafy greens and special pellets. Oh, and always fresh water—very important.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky glanced back at the carrier. “I’ll make sure you have lots of yummy food, bunny,” he whispered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, chiming in with mock seriousness, “And who’s going to make sure <em>you</em> remember all this, hm?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned sheepishly. “You and Rio will help, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio put a hand to her chest in mock offense. “Look at you, already delegating responsibility.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The manager smiled, clearly charmed by the dynamic. “There’s also grooming to think about—bunnies like to keep clean, but brushing them occasionally helps. And toys! They love to chew and play, so toys are great for keeping them entertained.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky was wide-eyed. “Toys? Like mine but for bunnies? That’s so cool!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Very cool,” Rio agreed, nudging Nicky with her elbow. “I think we should pick some out together, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they moved toward the shelves to gather the supplies, Agatha lingered behind for a moment with the manager. “Thank you for taking the time to explain all this,” she said, her voice soft but sincere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The manager waved a hand. “Of course. It’s clear you all care a lot about this bunny—and about each other. It’s going to be a very lucky rabbit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a small, genuine smile. “Thank you. That means a lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they left the store, their car was loaded with a new enclosure, bedding, hay, pellets, toys, and a few extra treats. Nicky was practically vibrating with excitement, and even Rio looked as giddy as a child. The carrier was safely put in the backseat, next to Nicky and he couldn’t stop leaning over to look at it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, watching them from the driver’s seat as they discussed names for their new family member, felt a warmth bloom in her chest. Maybe she hadn’t been completely sold on the idea at first, but seeing the joy it brought to her family, she knew they had made the right decision.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At home, the three of them set to work creating a cozy space for their newest family member. The enclosure was assembled in a sunny corner of the living room, complete with fresh bedding, a little hideaway house, and a bowl of water and pellets. Nicky carefully scattered hay in the enclosure as Rio adjusted the placement of a chew toy shaped like a carrot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, bunny,” Rio said as she placed the carrier on the floor and gently opened it, “welcome to your new palace.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bunny hopped out slowly, twitching its nose as it took in the surroundings. Its soft fur practically shimmered in the light, and it moved with a curious grace. Nicky clapped his hands in delight, sitting cross-legged on the floor to watch. “He’s exploring!” he whispered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the bunny ventured further into its new home, Rio glanced nervously at her array of plants scattered throughout the room. She leaned toward Agatha and muttered, “What if he decides my plants are his new snack bar?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, already amused, raised an eyebrow. “You’ll just have to share custody of your precious greenery.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a faux-glare, but her attention quickly shifted when the bunny sniffed at the base of Fernando, the potted fern. She held her breath, watching as the little creature gave a twitch of its nose and then, almost dismissively, hopped in the opposite direction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hah!” Agatha smirked, folding her arms. “Clearly, we’ve adopted a very intelligent bunny. He already knows what’s off-limits.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a relieved laugh. “Smart and polite. We really hit the jackpot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled. “He’s the best bunny ever!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They spent the next hour watching the bunny get comfortable in its new environment. It hopped in and out of its little hideaway, nibbled contentedly on a piece of hay, and even flopped onto its side in a gesture of complete relaxation. Nicky was fascinated by every movement, his laughter bubbling up every time the bunny twitched its ears or wiggled its nose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, sitting on the couch with a cup of tea, observed the scene with quiet contentment. She watched as Rio joined Nicky on the floor, showing him how to gently pet the bunny. The sight of her partner and son bonding with their new pet filled her heart with a warmth she hadn’t expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the bunny eventually curled up in its hideaway for a nap, Nicky sat back with a satisfied sigh. “I think he likes it here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha reached over to ruffle his hair. “I think you’re right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced at her plants one more time, then at the peacefully sleeping bunny. She shook her head with a grin. “Alright, and I guess I don’t need to worry about bunny teeth in my monstera after all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked. “Told you he’s smart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back against the couch, her hands settling on Agatha’s shoulders from behind as she leaned over to look at Agatha upside down. “Yeah, well, he’s part of the family now. Of course, he’s smart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">An hour later, the three of them sat around the living room, brainstorming names for the bunny as it snoozed peacefully in its new hideaway. Nicky was brimming with ideas, his excitement bubbling over as he rattled off suggestions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How about Mr. Fluffytail?” Nicky suggested, his eyes wide with anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into an amused smirk. “A bit on the nose, don’t you think?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, okay, what about… Sir Hopsalot?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft laugh, shaking her head. “I’m not addressing a rabbit as ‘Sir’ every time we call for him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, watching the back-and-forth with a grin, decided to jump in. “Hey, I think it’s cute. Sir Hopsalot sounds like he has class.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed. “Right? Classy bunny!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha groaned dramatically, placing a hand on her forehead. “I cannot believe I’m outnumbered on this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, fine, what about… Captain Nibbles?” Nicky offered next, practically bouncing in place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Absolutely not,” Agatha deadpanned, but her lips twitched, betraying her amusement. “We’re not giving him a title of command.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, nudging Agatha lightly with her elbow. “Oh, come on, Agatha. Let the kid have fun. Captain Nibbles is… imaginative.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ridiculous, you mean,” Agatha replied, her tone teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky leaned over, now completely invested in winning this game. “Okay, what if we call him… Carrot Crusher?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked at him, then turned to Rio, exasperation in her expression but a twinkle in her eye. “Please tell me you’re not endorsing this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, trying and failing to stifle a laugh, shrugged. “I mean, he <em>does</em> eat carrots. It’s accurate.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s laughter echoed through the room, and Agatha let out a sigh of mock defeat. “You two are going to name this bunny something absurd, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe,” Rio said with a mischievous smile. “But only because you’re making it so fun to tease you about it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Fine,” Agatha said, folding her arms but unable to suppress her own laughter. “But if we’re going to be absurd, I demand veto power. There’s no way I’m calling him ‘Carrot Crusher’.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, now giggling uncontrollably, threw his arms up before reaching for his little white board that had been set in the living room for the occasion. “Okay, back to the drawing board!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the banter continued, the bunny remained blissfully unaware, now curled up in its hideaway, scratching the walls of his little bunny hut, already loved beyond measure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After what felt like an eternity of playful debates and increasingly silly suggestions, Nicky suddenly gasped, his face lighting up as if struck by a brilliant idea. He leaned over to Rio, cupping his hands around his mouth to whisper, his tone conspiratorial.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, how do you say ‘Sir’ in Spanish?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow, amused by his secretive demeanor. “We say ‘Señor,’” she whispered back with a grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “Perfect,” he declared, before straightening up and announcing proudly, “I think we should call the bunny ‘Señor Scratchy!’”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, pretending to give the suggestion serious thought. “Señor Scratchy?” she repeated. “That’s… actually kind of adorable. But why ‘Señor Scratchy’?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned, his pride evident. “Well, your name is Spanish, right, Rio? So ‘Señor’ makes sense!” He paused, leaning closer to whisper again, “And this way, Mama won’t know that we’re still calling him ‘sir.’”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio burst out laughing, shaking her head. “Alright, kiddo, that can be our little secret,” she said, her tone just as low. But she was perfectly aware that Agatha, sitting just a few feet away, could hear every word—and knew enough Spanish to understand the joke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky continued his explanation. “And… and Mama said that when I was little, I loved scratchy sounds from my sneakers! Remember, Mama? You said it was my nickname!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha froze for a moment, her face softening as she smiled, the memory washing over her. “I did call you Scratchy,” she said, her voice laced with warmth. “You were obsessed with the velcro on your shoes. You’d sit for hours opening and closing it, just to hear the sound.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned proudly and turned back to the bunny. “And look! He is already scratching his house! So it’s perfect! Señor Scratchy!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, her heart melting. “That’s honestly so clever, Nicky. I love it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her smirk giving way to a genuine smile. “Alright, I admit it. That’s a great name. Good job, buddy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky clapped his hands together, thrilled at the unanimous approval. “Yay! Señor Scratchy it is!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio crouched down to gently pet the bunny, who twitched his nose in response. “Welcome home, Señor Scratchy. You’ve officially joined the family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back into the couch, watching her partner and son with a quiet sense of pride and contentment. “Well, Señor Scratchy,” she said dryly, “I hope you know you’ve got some very persistent people looking out for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled and snuggled into Agatha’s side. “And the best moms ever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At that, Rio felt a familiar flutter in her chest. Their little family—and their new furry addition—felt just right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the hours passed, Señor Scratchy settled into his new home. His little bunny house was in a cozy corner of the living room, but wherever Agatha went, he was sure to follow. He’d hop up to her feet, nudge at her legs with his tiny nose, or even curl up on the couch beside her if she was sitting down.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At first, Agatha tried to maintain an air of indifference about all the attention she was getting from the bunny. She’d playfully push him away, making exaggerated noises about how he was a “spoiled little bunny” and “way too demanding.” But despite her attempts at feigned annoyance, it didn’t take long for her to fall completely under his spell. He had a way of looking at her with those big, innocent eyes, tilting his head as if he was the most endearing creature on the planet. </p><p align="justify">Soon enough though, she was petting him and giving him soft belly rubs, allowing him to settle comfortably in her lap as she read or worked on her papers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, who had been watching all of this from the doorway with a teasing grin, couldn’t resist making a comment. “Uh-oh, darling,” she said, her voice full of playful mischief, “I think Señor Scratchy’s going to replace me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shot Rio a sly look, one eyebrow cocked, as she gently scratched the bunny’s head. “Oh yes, darling, you’ll have to fight for your spot in my bed now,” she teased, her fingers tracing patterns in the soft fur. “I didn’t realize he was so needy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, who had been gleefully observing the exchange, jumped in with a dramatic gasp. “Are you jealous, Mom? Señor Scratchy loves Mama more than you and me!” He giggled at his own playful accusation, his eyes shining with amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, gently nudging the bunny away to give Nicky a hug. “Don’t be silly. You’re my number one,” she said, pulling him close. But as she glanced down at the bunny, she couldn’t suppress a smile. “But it looks like we’ve got competition for my attention now, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow and grinned. “Oh I’m definitely jealous. I can already see it. Señor Scratchy’s stealing your heart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes, but the warmth in her expression was undeniable. “Fine. Maybe just a little. He’s awfully cute,” she admitted, glancing down at the bunny, who was now nestled comfortably in her lap again. “But you,” she added with a teasing wink towards Rio, “are still my favorite.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled and leaned in to kiss Agatha’s cheek, her heart swelling. “I’m glad I’m not being replaced.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart fluttered, and she pulled Rio closer for a soft kiss. “You’re the love of my life,” she whispered. “No bunny could ever replace you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Eww, you’re gross” They heard from the side, where Nicky was scrunching his little nose, in a very good imitation of the bunny now curled up on his lap. But, still beaming with joy from the whole situation, he added, “I’m just glad I have the best moms, and Señor Scratchy too!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It felt like the perfect moment—quiet, content, and full of love. The trio—along with their new bunny companion—had officially become a little family. And even though it might get a bit chaotic with their new furry friend, Agatha knew, deep down, that nothing could change the bond they shared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T.S. Eliot. “Burnt Norton.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">Friday arrived with a buzz of anticipation that seemed to ripple through the house. Agatha and Rio had been looking forward to their first proper date night since bringing Señor Scratchy home for days now. Between work, Nicky’s endless energy, and the process of settling into their dynamic as a family, moments just for the two of them had become rare. Tonight, though, was theirs, and both were determined to make it special.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, ever meticulous, had claimed the bathroom first, locking the door with a determined air. She took her time, savoring the quiet. The mirror fogged slightly as she carefully applied her makeup—subtle yet refined, with smoky eyes that added a touch of drama. She spent extra minutes taming her long, dark brown hair, sweeping it into a sleek low bun that accentuated her sharp cheekbones. Sliding into a fitted black dress that clung perfectly to her elegant figure, she added gold jewelry: a simple necklace, a delicate bracelet, and earrings that shimmered faintly under the light. The final touch was her favorite pair of black heels, polished to perfection. Giving herself one last appraising glance in the mirror, she allowed a small, confident smile. “Good enough to make her jaw drop,” she murmured to herself with a chuckle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Rio was in the bedroom, a storm of movement and energy as she rifled through her side of the closet. Clothes were draped across the bed, each rejected outfit a step closer to the perfect one. Finally, her fingers landed on a classy emerald green jumpsuit with a cinched waist and a high neckline that elegantly bared her shoulders. “Perfect,” she whispered, holding it up. The color brought out the warmth of her skin and the dark shiny undertones in her hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her hair was styled loosely, soft waves falling to frame her face, and her makeup was bolder than usual—winged eyeliner, a touch of gold shimmer on her lids, and a deep berry lip color that added just the right amount of flair. She finished the look with statement earrings, geometric and gold, that swung gently as she moved. A pair of sleek black heels completed the ensemble, and as Rio caught her reflection in the full-length mirror, she struck a pose. “Looking sharp, Vidal,” she quipped to herself, satisfied with how her outfit accentuated her figure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as Rio was spritzing on a light floral perfume, the soft scent filling the room, Agatha emerged from the bathroom and stepped into the bedroom. The moment her eyes landed on Rio, she froze, caught in the breathtaking sight of her. Rio was now adjusting one of her earrings in front of the mirror, her movements graceful, but it was the way the light caught the soft contours of her figure that took Agatha’s breath away. The reflection in the mirror barely registered—what mattered was the woman in front of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wow,” Agatha murmured, her voice quiet but thick with admiration, as though she couldn’t quite grasp the words to describe the feeling surging inside her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, hearing the soft exhale of wonder in Agatha’s voice, turned toward her. Her eyes widened, her mouth parting slightly in surprise. Her gaze softened as it met Agatha’s, a swell of emotion rising in her chest. “You look…” Rio trailed off, unable to find the right words at first. She swallowed hard, her voice steadying as she continued, “You’re breathtaking.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The raw sincerity in Rio’s voice tugged at Agatha’s heart, and she took a small step forward, her usual confidence replaced with something warmer, more vulnerable. A smirk tugged at the corner of her lips. “You’re one to talk,” she said, her eyes raking over Rio’s ensemble. “That outfit… My God, Rio. You’re going to make it impossible to focus on anything else tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, the sound a little nervous, a little shy under the intensity of Agatha’s gaze. She glanced down at herself, her cheeks flushing ever so slightly. “You’re going to make me blush before we even leave the house,” she said, her voice carrying the quiet thrill of being so thoroughly admired.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened, the teasing smirk fading into something more tender as she closed the distance between them. Her hands found Rio’s waist, the touch light but firm, grounding them in the moment. Her voice dropped into a low, husky whisper. “Good,” she murmured, leaning in just a fraction closer. “I like when you blush.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught in her chest, her heart fluttering. She leaned into Agatha’s touch, her arms slipping up to rest loosely around Agatha’s neck, as though drawn to her gravity. “How do you do this to me every time?” she asked, her voice soft but full of wonder. “Every time I see you, it’s like falling all over again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, her lips parting slightly as the weight of Rio’s words sank in. She closed the remaining gap between them, her forehead pressing gently against Rio’s, her hands drifting up to cup Rio’s face. “Maybe because I feel the same way,” Agatha confessed, her voice trembling ever so slightly with the depth of the emotion she was letting out. “Every time, Rio. It’s always like falling in love all over again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The world outside their little bubble seemed to pause, leaving only the sound of their breathing and the steady thrum of their hearts. In that stillness, Agatha saw Rio, truly saw her—the woman who had become her home, her heartbeat. And Rio saw the same in Agatha. The quiet acknowledgment that tonight, and every night, they were always falling deeper into each other.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound of Nicky’s laughter drifted up from downstairs, a sound that pulled Agatha and Rio back to reality. They had set up a cartoon for him to enjoy while they finished getting ready for their much-needed night out, and now, hearing his joy-filled giggles, it was a reminder of the world they had temporarily set aside for a little while.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio pulled back slightly, her smile widening as she caught Agatha’s gaze. “We should probably go before I decide I don’t want to share you with the world tonight,” she said, her voice teasing but soft.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, her expression softening with affection as she stepped back reluctantly, her fingers lingering on Rio’s for just a moment longer. “Good idea. Let’s go before I change my mind about leaving the house at all,” she agreed, her voice tinged with humor but also a bit of that all-consuming warmth she felt whenever she was with Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hand in hand, they descended the stairs, their footsteps light as they found Nicky sprawled out on the couch, his wide-eyed attention fixed on the cartoon playing before him. Señor Scratchy was curled up contentedly on Nicky’s chest, his little nose twitching in his sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sight of the two of them together—Nicky and the bunny, so peaceful in their little bubble—stirred something soft and tender in Agatha’s chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they made their way into the living room, Rio couldn’t help but smile at the picture they made, before leaning down to give Nicky a quick kiss on the forehead. “Having fun, kiddo?” she asked gently.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes flickered up from the TV, his face lighting up instantly. “I’m having the best time!” he declared with the enthusiasm only a child could muster. “And Señor Scratchy’s so comfy. He likes cartoons, too!” He gave the bunny a little pat, causing the small creature to stir but not quite wake up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Rio exchanged a quiet, knowing glance. They had arranged for Alice and Jen to babysit Nicky, a decision that had thrilled him to no end. He’d been counting down the minutes all day, eager for the promise of fun with the two women who had a special way of making every moment feel like an adventure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They’re so much fun!” Nicky had squealed earlier that day when Rio told him about the babysitting plan. “They play all the games!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha had arched a brow at that, her lips quirking into a playful smirk. “Don’t get too excited, little man. Remember, they’re in charge tonight,” she had warned, the words light-hearted but with a knowing edge.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Nicky hadn’t even blinked at the reminder. He had practically vibrated with excitement at the idea of Alice and Jen’s babysitting skills. In the end, nothing could dampen his enthusiasm. And when the doorbell rang, signaling their arrival, Nicky practically exploded from the couch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s Alice and Jen!” he squealed, his small frame shooting up from the couch like a rocket. He bolted toward the door, throwing it open with the energy of a child on Christmas morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice was the first to step through the door, her energy immediately filling the space as she carried a well-packed backpack brimming with games, snacks, and the promise of fun. “Wow, you two look amazing,” she said, her eyes taking in Rio and Agatha’s polished appearances. She turned to Nicky with a grin. “Ready for an epic night, kiddo?” she asked, crouching down to meet his eye level.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah!” Nicky cheered enthusiastically, throwing his arms around Alice’s neck in a spontaneous hug, the sheer joy on his face contagious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen followed right behind Alice, effortlessly balancing a guitar case in one hand and a tray of freshly baked cookies in the other. She made a grand show of presenting the tray, holding it out with a flourish. “We come bearing gifts,” she said dramatically, eyes twinkling with mischief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cookies?” Rio asked, raising a brow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“For after dinner,” Jen said, giving her a pointed look. “We’re fun, but we’re responsible fun.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Debatable,” Agatha muttered, though her lips twitched into a smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen paid her no mind and continued. “Thought I might play a song or two if that’s cool with you, boss.” She winked at Nicky, who beamed at being called “boss.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Rio exchanged a look—half amused, half resigned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You two realize you’re supposed to babysit, not throw a party, right?” Agatha teased, folding her arms but unable to suppress a smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Define ‘party,’” Jen shot back, grinning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, alright,” Rio interjected, placing a hand on Agatha’s shoulder to steer her toward the door. “Nicky’s in good hands. Let’s go before they recruit him into the band or something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha slipped on her coat, Nicky ran up and hugged both his moms tightly. “Have fun on your date!” he chirped.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We will,” Rio promised, bending down to kiss his cheek. “You be good, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m always good,” Nicky said with a cheeky grin, making them laugh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, Alice, Jen,” Agatha said, her voice playful but carrying an unmistakable edge of mock sternness as they stepped out the door. “Don’t let him stay up too late, and absolutely no drumming on the walls this time. I mean it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No promises!” Alice replied with a mischievous grin, already rubbing her hands together in glee as if plotting some future chaos.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped a little closer to Alice, lowering her voice just enough for the moment to feel more intimate. “Thanks again for doing this. He’s been looking forward to it all week, you know?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No problem at all,” Alice said, waving her off as though it was no big deal. “You two deserve a break, seriously. And Nicky’s a blast—he’s the best.” She gave Nicky a quick wave, and he grinned back at her, already pulling out a board game from his pile of toys.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shot the duo a mock-stern look, her arms crossed, her expression balancing somewhere between warning and fondness. “I can’t stress this enough: no drumming on the furniture, no teaching him any questionable song lyrics, and bedtime is eight-thirty. Got it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Got it,” Alice said with a wink, clearly unconcerned about the strict bedtime rule.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Totally,” Jen added with a smirk that suggested some of those rules might get bent, or at the very least, creatively interpreted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed with mock exasperation but couldn’t suppress a smile. “Alright, let’s go before I change my mind and decide to stay home to supervise instead.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, gently nudging Agatha toward the door. “I’m sure Nicky will be just fine. Now let’s go or we’ll be late.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Bye, Nicky!” Rio called as they moved toward the door, blowing him an exaggerated kiss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Bye, Moms!” Nicky shouted back, his attention already fully absorbed in whatever game he was setting up with Alice, his excitement bubbling over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha closed the door behind them, she paused for a moment, glancing back at the house. “We’re definitely coming back to chaos, aren’t we?” she said, the affectionate humor in her voice unmistakable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looped her arm through Agatha’s, her playful grin matching the spark in her eyes. “Probably. But at least he’ll have a great time. And so will we.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they walked out the door, the cool night air wrapping around them, Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s hand. “Ready for a night of making everyone else jealous of us?” she teased.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, leaning closer to Agatha, her own voice full of anticipation. “Always. No one else stands a chance tonight,” she said with a wink.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The restaurant was dimly lit and intimate, the perfect setting for Rio and Agatha to reconnect away from the bustle of their daily lives. They sat at a secluded corner table by the window, where snowflakes floated lazily down outside, blanketing the world in a soft, quiet glow that mirrored the peacefulness inside. The world beyond felt distant, leaving only the two of them in this moment.</p><p align="justify">Candles flickered between them, casting a soft glow on their faces.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This place is beautiful,” Rio said, looking around. “You always pick the best spots.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I like to keep you impressed,” Agatha replied with a wink, earning a laugh from Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, the sound full of affection. “You succeed,” she said, her gaze lingering on Agatha, who could never be anything but captivating in every way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening unfolded like a slow dance—perfectly paced and comfortably familiar. They started with appetizers, their plates arriving like small works of art: delicate seared scallops nestled beside small portions of artisanal bread and creamy whipped butter, and the conversation flowed just as easily, moving from lighthearted chatter about Nicky’s latest antics to deeper musings on how much their lives had changed since their paths first crossed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Rio began, her voice thoughtful as she swirled the wine in her glass, “do you ever think about how different everything could’ve been?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened, and for a brief moment, she considered the weight of the question. “Sometimes,” she admitted, her voice gentle, almost nostalgic. “But then I look at you, and I know this is exactly where I’m supposed to be. Right here. With you. With us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled, and she reached for Agatha’s hand across the table. “Me too. Every day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their main courses arrived, and the rhythm of the evening continued effortlessly. Rio’s mushroom risotto was creamy and rich, while Agatha’s white fish, delicate and perfectly cooked, was accompanied by roasted vegetables that melted in the mouth. They traded bites, savoring each other’s choices with smiles that spoke volumes. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When dessert came—a molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream—they shared that too, Rio feeding Agatha a spoonful. Agatha caught her wrist playfully, kissing the back of her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re being awfully charming tonight,” Rio teased, though her cheeks were flushed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can you blame me?” Agatha countered, her smirk warm. “You’re stunning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart fluttered at the genuine admiration in Agatha’s eyes, the sincerity of her words. She smiled softly, feeling more in love than ever before. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They sipped on more wine, sharing stories, laughter, and occasional quiet moments where they simply gazed at one another.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, Señor Scratchy,” Rio started with a smirk, her eyes sparkling, “think he’s going to learn to open cabinets soon?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes with exaggerated exasperation, though the corner of her lips betrayed her amusement. “If he does, he can start paying rent,” she said, her voice dripping with mock seriousness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, her warm, melodic tone filling the small space. “Don’t act like you don’t already adore him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe I do,” Agatha admitted, her voice softening. “But only because he reminds me of a certain someone who made herself at home in my life and refused to leave.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, her smile turning tender. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It was meant as one,” Agatha said, reaching across the table to take her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After dinner, they decided to take a walk despite the cold. The streets were quiet, save for the soft crunch of snow under their shoes. The trees along the sidewalk were adorned with delicate fairy lights, casting a soft, magical glow that seemed to turn the night into something out of a dream.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looped her arm through Agatha’s, leaning in just a little closer. “This feels like one of those cheesy holiday movies,” she said with a playful grin, her breath visible in the crisp air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Except this isn’t scripted,” Agatha murmured, looking down at her with a fond smile. “This is real.” She squeezed Rio’s arm gently, as though to remind her that the magic of the moment was something they had created together, without the need for any camera or director.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They walked hand in hand, their laughter mingling with the crisp winter air, until the cold became too much. Rio shivered, and Agatha immediately wrapped her scarf around Rio’s neck, tucking it in securely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha, you’ll freeze,” Rio protested.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be fine,” Agatha said, brushing off her concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t let it go, though. She tucked both of Agatha’s hands into her own coat pockets, pulling her close for warmth. “Let’s get to the car,” she said with a laugh, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s cheek. “Before we both turn into popsicles.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once inside, the car’s heater hummed to life, and they sat for a moment, soaking in the warmth. Agatha glanced at Rio, her gaze lingering a little longer than usual. There was something in the softness of her expression that made Rio pause, her heart skipping a beat at the intensity of the look.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What?” Rio asked, noticing the way Agatha was staring at her with that quiet affection that always made her feel like the center of Agatha’s universe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, a little shy now, though the tenderness in her eyes remained. “Nothing,” she said softly, her voice almost a whisper. “Just… I love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled at the simplicity and depth of those words. She leaned over, cupping Agatha’s cheek with gentle hands, her thumb brushing over her skin as she looked into her eyes. “I love you too,” she whispered back, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they drove home, their hearts were full, the memory of the night already etched deeply in their minds—a reminder of the unshakeable bond they shared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha and Rio walked into the house, the first thing they noticed was the warm glow of the living room light spilling into the entryway. They could hear the faint sound of a children’s cartoon, and as they stepped closer, the sight that greeted them made them both smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky was sprawled out on the couch, fast asleep, his little chest rising and falling steadily. Alice and Jen sat on either side of him, their eyes glued to the colorful cartoon playing on the TV. Alice was munching on popcorn, and Jen was sipping from a mug, both looking surprisingly invested in the antics of the animated characters.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha folded her arms, leaning against the doorway with an amused smirk. “Comfortable, are we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice looked up, her face lighting up with a grin. “Oh, hey! Welcome back. We thought you’d be later.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We could’ve been,” Rio teased, her voice soft as her eyes lingered on Nicky. “But this little scene is too good to miss.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen gestured to the TV with her mug. “Okay, but have you seen this show? It’s weirdly compelling.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice nodded. “And Nicky made us promise to finish the episode for him when he passed out. We couldn’t let the kid down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled and stepped over to the couch, gently brushing Nicky’s hair out of his face. “Thank you both for keeping him company.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Anytime,” Alice said, her tone genuine. She leaned closer to Nicky, lowering her voice dramatically. “He’s a riot. You two are raising a very cool kid.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened as she watched Rio bend down to stroke Nicky’s cheek. The boy didn’t even stir. “He’s got good role models,” Agatha said quietly, her gaze flickering between Rio and the two women.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice leaned against the wall, grinning. “Before we go, we need to debrief you two on our night of adventures with Nicky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh?” Rio raised an eyebrow, settling on the armrest of the couch while Agatha leaned casually against the wall.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen laughed, holding up a hand. “First off, Nicky decided we were officially Auntie Alice and Auntie Jen. He insisted. So, you’re looking at two very proud honorary aunts.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked. “He promoted you already, huh? That’s quick work.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice nodded enthusiastically. “We earned it! We built a fort out of cushions and blankets, had a battle of who could make the silliest face, and we may or may not have eaten ice cream after dinner.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“After dinner?” Agatha’s eyebrow arched, her tone teasingly stern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry!” Alice waved her hands. “We also made him eat his broccoli, which he grudgingly did because I told him superheroes eat their greens.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Clever.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Very clever,” Jen said, mockingly impressed. “But then Señor Scratchy decided he didn’t like me, and poof, he disappeared. Gone without a trace.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice burst out laughing, clutching her stomach. “You should’ve seen her face. She tried to win him over with a carrot, and the bunny just turned his back and hopped away. Cold-blooded.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but giggle, while Agatha chuckled, trying to keep her usual composure. “Well, he has his preferences,” Agatha said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As if on cue, a soft rustling sound came from the corner of the room. Señor Scratchy emerged, hopping toward them with a slow, deliberate gait. His little nose twitched as he approached Agatha, who crouched down to scoop him up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Alice said, throwing her hands up in mock defeat. “The bunny likes you best.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He has good taste,” Agatha said smugly, scratching behind Señor Scratchy’s ears.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen crossed her arms, grinning. “You’re his favorite, no question. But I’ll have you know, I was very charming.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Uh-huh,” Alice teased, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “He’s a tough crowd, but maybe you’ll win him over next time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood, still laughing. “Thank you both for tonight. Nicky clearly had the best time—and so did we.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen and Alice hugged them both, still laughing about the bunny debacle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We should get going,” Jen said, setting her mug down. She stood and stretched, glancing at the empty popcorn bowl on the coffee table. “Thanks for the snacks, by the way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, and for trusting us with your little dude,” Alice added. “We had a blast.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled. “We’ll have to do this again sometime—maybe when we need another date night.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice grinned. “You know where to find us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they both stood to leave, Alice grinned widely. “Remember, anytime you need Auntie Alice and Auntie Jen, just call. We’ve got this babysitting thing down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh we know, don’t worry we really like not having to pay you guys!” Rio replied, patting Alice on the head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Alice and Jen grabbed their coats and bags, Alice stopped at the door and turned back with a mischievous grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Before we go,” she began, eyes glinting with mischief, “please, for the love of all things sacred, wait until we’re gone before you two get all steamy and scandalous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, catching on, immediately doubled over laughing. “Yeah, seriously. We do not need any mental images of…that. Spare us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes widened in mortification, her cheeks flushing a deep crimson. “Alice!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice simply smirked, clearly unfazed by Rio’s reaction. “What? Am I wrong?” she said innocently, batting her lashes. “It’s a valid request. You two are practically radiating ‘we just came back from a romantic date and couldn't wait to get home’ energy. Honestly, I’m just trying to protect myself from needing therapy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, on the other hand, remained perfectly composed, a mischievous glint in her eyes. She raised an eyebrow and leaned against the doorframe with a smirk. “Oh, don’t worry, Alice. I am planning to wait until <em>at least</em> the door clicked shut to take her clothes off. I do have manners. Though, I can’t promise anything beyond that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s jaw dropped. “Agatha!”</p><p align="justify">en doubled over again, gasping for air between her fits of laughter. “I knew it. I knew you’d say something even worse!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, pretending to be horrified, clapped both hands over her ears. “Nope! Nope! I am DONE. Forget I said anything. I’ll be in therapy for years because of this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She made a show of stumbling backward toward the door, still covering her ears. “Bye, Nicky’s moms! May your night be as sinful as I’m trying very hard NOT to picture it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen barely managed to drag herself out behind Alice, still wheezing from laughter. She yanked the door shut, leaving only the sound of their fading giggles and Rio’s deep, exasperated groan in their wake.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as the door clicked shut, Rio turned to Agatha, still red-faced but unable to hide the smile tugging at her lips. “You’re terrible, you know that?” she said, trying to sound stern but failing miserably.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, ever smug, shrugged nonchalantly, a playful smirk tugging at her lips. “You love it,” she teased, her eyes twinkling with mischief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the smile that followed. She leaned in, cupping Agatha’s face and planting a gentle kiss on her lips. “Unfortunately for me,” Rio murmured, her voice softening with affection, “yes, I do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good, because I’m not planning on changing anytime soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they separated, Rio knelt beside Nixky, her fingertips brushing a stray lock of hair from his forehead. Her eyes softened as she looked at him, the affection in her gaze palpable. “He had so much fun,” she murmured, her voice tender, as though speaking too loudly might disturb the fragile tranquility of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded in agreement, a small smile tugging at her lips. “He deserves it,” she said quietly, her gaze lingering on the peaceful little boy before meeting Rio’s eyes. “Come on, let’s get him to bed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With practiced ease, Agatha bent down and gently scooped Nicky into her arms, her movements slow and deliberate, mindful of his weight and the way his small body remained heavy with sleep. He stirred only slightly, his little fingers curling into the fabric of her dress before he nuzzled into her shoulder with a soft sigh, melting back into his dreams.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio followed closely behind, her gaze lingering on Agatha—not just as a mother, but as something else entirely. There was something breathtaking about the way Agatha held their boy, something that sent warmth curling in Rio’s chest and, admittedly, a different kind of heat spreading lower. It was the tenderness, the quiet protectiveness, the ease with which Agatha carried the weight of their world in her arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they reached Nicky’s room, Rio was half-dazed, lost in the quiet intimacy of the moment. Agatha lowered him onto the bed with the same steady, unshakable care, tucking the blankets around him like a practiced ritual. She lingered, pressing a gentle kiss to his forehead, her lips barely ghosting over his skin before she straightened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, leaning against the doorway, smiled warmly, though there was an undeniable flicker of something else beneath it. Watching Agatha like this—soft, affectionate, endlessly strong—made her heart clench in a way she wasn’t sure she’d ever get used to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned off the light, stepping back into the dim glow of the hallway. As she quietly closed the door behind them, her posture shifted, that playful glint creeping back into her eyes. “One down,” she murmured, voice low, teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow, amused but wary. “One what?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she tilted her head, letting her gaze flicker down, lingering on Rio’s lips before dragging back up to her eyes. A smirk curled at the edges of her mouth, slow and deliberate. “One person I need to carry to bed tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio barely had time to react before she was suddenly lifted off her feet, her breath catching in a startled squeal. “Agatha—!” she gasped, instinctively clutching at Agatha’s shoulders, her fingers digging into firm muscle as laughter bubbled out of her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s grip was sure, her steps steady as she carried Rio down the hallway as if she weighed nothing at all. “What?” she purred, voice thick with amusement and something else entirely. “I’m just being thorough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s laughter faltered, replaced by a quick intake of breath when Agatha shifted her grip just enough to let one hand slip down, fingers pressing dangerously close to the hem of her shorts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Careful,” Rio murmured, her voice dipping into something dangerously close to a challenge. “You keep that up, and I might start thinking you have ulterior motives.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hummed, her lips brushing just beneath Rio’s ear as she whispered, “Oh, darling… I don’t think I’ve ever been subtle about my motives.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shivered. “Not fair.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Never claimed to play fair.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached their bedroom, Agatha kicked the door shut behind them with a deliberate flick of her foot, the soft <em>click</em> of the lock sealing them in their own private world. The air inside was different—thicker, charged, humming with anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With effortless grace, Agatha carried Rio to the bed, her touch both reverent and possessive as she lowered her onto the plush mattress. But she didn’t step away—her hands remained, fingertips grazing the soft fabric of Rio’s jumpsuit, skimming over the curves they concealed as if memorizing the feeling through the layers. Her thumbs stroked lazy circles at Rio’s hips, grounding, teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked up at her, breath already coming a little faster, and met the intensity of Agatha’s gaze. It was searing, unyielding, and yet so full of something deeper—something that made Rio’s stomach flip in a way that had nothing to do with nerves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The playful energy that had filled the night twisted into something else, something heavier, richer, something that had been building since the moment they’d stepped through the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned down, her lips brushing the shell of Rio’s ear, her breath warm against her skin as she murmured, low and full of promise, “Now, it’s time to celebrate us properly<em>.”</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, her fingers tightening where they rested against Agatha’s forearms. A slow, delicious heat coiled in her belly, spreading outward, making her pulse hammer against her ribs. A rosy flush crept up her neck, but it wasn’t from shyness—it was from the way Agatha’s voice alone could undo her, from the way every syllable felt like a deliberate caress.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her arms wound around Agatha’s neck, pulling her closer, eliminating what little space remained between them. “Then stop talking,” she whispered, her voice dipping into something softer, needier. “And kiss me already.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked—lazy, knowing—but obeyed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her response was immediate, the playful smirk on her face replaced by a look of deep affection and desire. She leaned down, capturing Rio’s lips in a slow, passionate kiss that seemed to stretch time itself. The kiss deepened, soft at first, then more urgent, as if their lips had been craving the connection for far longer than either of them had realized.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed into it, her fingers threading into Agatha’s thick, brown hair, tugging just enough to earn a quiet groan from Rio’s lips. The sound sent a shiver racing down Rio’s spine, pooling heat in places she was quickly becoming desperate to soothe. It was a kiss that spoke of shared love, of desire, devotion, of quiet moments like this, of all the things they didn’t need to say because they had already said them in every glance, every touch, every soft word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands moved to the back of Rio’s jumpsuit, blindly finding the zip and pulling it down, without breaking the kiss. Her fingers caressed the naked skin it uncovered, the fabric sliding against her fingertips, the tension between them growing stronger with every passing second. Their connection, so real and raw, filled the room with an undeniable heat that had little to do with their physical closeness, but everything to do with the love they shared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the kiss finally broke, both of them were left breathless, foreheads resting against each other, their eyes closed for a moment as they simply breathed in the shared intimacy of the night. It was a moment just for them—away from the chaos of the world, away from everything that wasn’t theirs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you,” Agatha murmured, her voice thick with emotion as she brushed a strand of hair from Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you too.” Rio smiled, her heart full as she leaned in again, this time for a gentle, lingering kiss. “Now get the rest of that off me, so I can reciprocate.” She said, shimmying her shoulder to let the top of her green suit fall down to her waist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha obliged, her eyes a shade darker as she took in the newly exposed skin and soon the jumpsuit was nothing but a green silky pool on the floor of their bedroom, promptly followed by the black sleek material that used to be Agatha’s dress.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In no time, Rio found herself pressed against the pillows, her hair all over them as Agatha’s brown mane joined it as she leaned in for another searing kiss, her hands travelling further and further, making Rio’s head fall back, giving Agatha perfect access to her neck and everything that came below.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio arched into her, fingers skating down Agatha’s back, tracing the ridges of her spine, nails biting just enough to make Agatha <em>feel</em> it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha responded in kind, her hands wandering lower, bolder, pressing into soft curves, coaxing gasps and sighs and desperate little sounds from Rio’s lips—sounds that made Agatha feel drunk with need, with love, with the sheer <em>rightness</em> of it all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night unfolded as a testament to their love, their connection deepening with every touch, every whispered word, every moan and meeting of naked skins. Names were murmured, chanted and welcomed, accompanying declarations of desire, worship and devotion. They didn’t just <em>take</em> from each other; they <em>gave</em>—love, pleasure, adoration. They <em>offered</em> themselves, wholly, completely, with nothing held back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the heat finally ebbed into something slower, softer, and limbs tangled beneath the sheets, they lay in the dimly lit hush of their bedroom, skin still warm, hearts still pounding, bodies still pressed close.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha traced idle patterns along Rio’s bare shoulder, her fingers featherlight, absentminded. Her other hand rested over Rio’s heart, feeling the steady beat beneath her palm, as if grounding herself in the reality of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you,” she murmured, her voice quieter now, but no less intense.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned her head just enough to meet Agatha’s gaze, a lazy, satisfied smile curving her lips. “I love you too,” she murmured, her fingers brushing over Agatha’s cheek before tangling in her hair, pulling her in for another slow, lingering kiss.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, voice teasing but heavy with affection, she whispered, “Now, go get me some water before I die of dehydration.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, rolling onto her back, one arm still draped over Rio’s waist. “You really know how to kill a moment, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, stretching like a satisfied cat, unbothered. “You’ll recover.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, dramatic but indulgent, and with one last lingering kiss to Rio’s shoulder, she finally rolled out of bed, muttering something about how <em>this</em> was the price of dating an insatiable little menace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio only laughed, watching her go, knowing full well they both wouldn’t be getting much sleep tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. « East Coker.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat at the kitchen table, her fingers drumming a soft, rhythmic beat against the smooth surface. The invitation lay in front of her, a sleek, expensive card that practically screamed pretension. It was the kind of invite that belonged in the world of the wealthy, polished, and well-connected—a world she’d once inhabited with a sense of purpose but now viewed with a mix of disdain and obligation. The dinner party was being hosted by one of her college friends—or, rather, the people she had once called friends—an event she had been dreading since it arrived.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stared at the card, her lips pressed into a thin line, the weight of its significance settling heavily in her chest. It wasn’t just an invitation; it was a reminder of a world she had distanced herself from, a world she no longer belonged to, and a part of herself that she didn’t want to revisit. But in her current position—still navigating the politics of academia, still protecting her reputation—it felt impossible to ignore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio walked in, a mug of tea in her hands. She paused when she saw Agatha’s expression. “What’s got you looking like that? Did Señor Scratchy eat one of your books?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced up at her, her smirk tugging at the corners of her mouth despite the tension knotting her insides. “No, though that would be a more pleasant situation than this,” she replied dryly, pushing the invitation toward Rio with an exaggerated sigh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow but set her tea down before picking up the card, her fingers brushing over the elegant lettering with a soft curiosity. “Oh. Fancy dinner party with some old friends, huh?” She scanned the details, her expression unreadable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not friends,” Agatha corrected, her voice cool and steady as she leaned back in her chair. “Acquaintances. Connections. People I tolerated because it was beneficial back then. Now? I’d rather spend an evening cleaning out the garage.” Her voice softened as she leaned forward again, her fingers tapping out a nervous rhythm on the table. “The last time I saw them was… years ago. And even then, I only tolerated them because they were useful.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head slightly, watching Agatha with a blend of amusement and understanding. “So don’t go. You’re not obligated to spend time with people you don’t like.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut for a moment as she let out a long, frustrated sigh. “I know, but they’re… valuable. They’re well-connected, Rio. They can open doors, get me in the rooms where decisions are made, introduce me to the right people. It’s not just about liking them. It’s about keeping those doors open, making sure I’m not forgotten when it matters most.” She pressed her fingers to her temples, as if massaging away the headache forming behind her eyes. “Especially when I’m finishing build a name for myself in academia and publishing. I can’t afford to cut myself off from opportunities like this. It’s a game, and if I don’t play, I risk losing everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned forward, her brows furrowed in thought, her hands folded in front of her as she met Agatha’s gaze. “But at what cost, Agatha? If being around them makes you miserable, is it really worth it? You’re not a pawn to be moved around for someone else’s benefit. You don’t have to sacrifice your happiness for a seat at their table.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was quiet for a long moment, her fingers now tracing the rim of her coffee mug. She studied the swirling dark liquid, as if searching for an answer in its depths. The warmth of Rio’s words—their gentle insistence—settled over her like a soft blanket, and for a second, she allowed herself to relax in the comfort of Rio’s unwavering support.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She looked up then, her expression softening. “It’s not that simple, my love,” Agatha said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper. “Sometimes, you have to play the game. It’s not about liking them or even being true to yourself all the time. It’s about surviving in a world that demands you adapt, to fit into a mold that isn’t always comfortable.” She shook her head slightly, as if the words didn’t sit well with her, but they were the reality of her circumstances. “It’s not a matter of principle—it’s about staying in the game long enough to make your own rules.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes softened, her heart aching for the woman she loved. She could see the conflict warring inside Agatha, the part of her that resented the need for these pretentious gatherings and shallow connections, and the part that knew they were necessary if Agatha wanted to protect her career, her reputation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a long, slow breath, her fingers resting lightly on the edge of the table as she looked down at her hands. For a moment, she seemed lost in thought, her brow furrowing slightly as she weighed her words carefully. Finally, she met Ria’s eyes, her gaze soft but resolute.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I was thinking… maybe you could come with me,” Agatha began, her voice calm but filled with an undertone of something deeper, something she couldn’t quite put into words just yet. “As my date.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, clearly caught off guard by the request. Her brow furrowed in confusion. “Your… date?” she asked, her voice a mixture of surprise and curiosity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, taking a small step closer to Rio, her voice steady and deliberate as she explained. “Yes. I know these kinds of events can be overwhelming, and I don’t blame you if you’d rather not. But the truth is, I don’t want to go alone. I thought… I thought it might be a good opportunity to introduce you to them.” She hesitated for a brief moment, her fingers gently brushing over the surface of the invitation she had discarded on the counter. “To show you off, honestly. You’re such an incredible part of my life, Rio. And I want them to see that. To know that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused, her heart fluttering with a mixture of excitement and uncertainty. She wasn’t sure why it had taken her this long to ask, but she knew, deep down, that the thought of having Rio by her side—of showing the world who she truly loved—was something she had to do. It was time to stop hiding the woman who meant everything to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, however, didn’t respond immediately. Instead, she paced across the living room, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her lips moving soundlessly as she processed Agatha’s words. The tension in the room thickened, and Agatha could feel it, could feel the whirl of thoughts running through Rio’s mind as she muttered to herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I just don’t think this is a good idea,” Rio finally said, her voice tight, and she spun on her heel, meeting Agatha’s gaze with a mix of concern and hesitation. “These people… they’re not your friends. You said it yourself. What if they’re judgmental or rude? What if—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped forward, closing the distance between them with a gentle but firm motion. She reached out, her hands settling on Rio’s shoulders, grounding her in the moment. “Love,” Agatha said softly, her voice warm and steady. “Breathe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze, her wide, uncertain eyes locking onto Agatha’s. For a moment, the room fell silent, save for the soft hum of the air conditioning and the distant sound of the city outside. Rio’s lips parted, her chest rising and falling with the weight of her emotions. “I’m serious, Agatha. What if I embarrass you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A tender smile touched Agatha’s lips as she stepped closer, her hands now cupping Rio’s face. “You could never embarrass me,” she replied firmly, her words quenching Rio’s worries. “Rio, you’re brilliant, funny, and breathtakingly beautiful. If anyone has a problem with you, that says far more about them than it does about you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s tense shoulders relaxed under Agatha’s touch, but the apprehension still lingered in her eyes. “But what if—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No ‘what ifs,’” Agatha interrupted, her tone gentle but firm. “I’ve been thinking about it for a while now, and I don’t want to keep you hidden anymore. I want to introduce you as my girlfriend, my partner, my love. You’re such an important part of my life, and if I’m going to spend an evening with these people, I want you there with me. By my side.” Her voice softened, the vulnerability in her words clear as she gazed into Rio’s eyes, searching for understanding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood still for a moment, her expression conflicted as she considered Agatha’s plea. The uncertainty clouded her face, but there was something else there too—a flicker of hope, of wanting to believe in the possibility of acceptance. “Agatha, I don’t know… What if I don’t fit in? What if they don’t like me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached at the vulnerability in Rio’s voice. She stepped even closer, her fingers brushing softly against Rio’s arms as she gently took her hands in her own, squeezing them with reassuring tenderness. “Rio, listen to me,” Agatha said, her voice dropping to a more intimate, gentle tone. “I’m not worried about them liking you. I’m not worried about you fitting in, because, sweetheart, you’re not the one who has to fit in. They do. You’re smart, you’re radiant, and you’re mine. That’s all that matters. They can take it or leave it, but they’ll see you for exactly who you are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed, the hint of a smile tugging at the corners of her lips, but it was uncertain, as though she wasn’t quite ready to let go of her doubt. “You make it sound so simple,” she said, her voice laced with a mixture of awe and hesitation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It <em>is</em> simple,” Agatha replied softly, her eyes full of affection. “You’re my love. And I want to share that with the world, not hide it away. If you’re not comfortable with it, I’ll go alone, no problem. But if you come, I’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll face this together. As a team.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip, her mind still turning over the possibility of stepping into that world, but the weight of Agatha’s words began to settle in her heart. “You really want me there?” she asked quietly, her voice soft and vulnerable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened even further, her thumbs gently tracing the backs of Rio’s hands as she looked at her with unmasked affection. “More than anything,” she said, her voice full of sincerity, her heart laid bare before Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, the sound a mixture of resignation and acceptance as she leaned forward, pressing her forehead gently against Agatha’s. “Okay,” she murmured after a long pause, her voice barely above a whisper. “I’ll go. But don’t be mad if I cling to you like a koala all night.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, the sound rich and full of warmth, and she pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s temple, her hands caressing her back in a comforting gesture. “I wouldn’t have it any other way,” she replied, her smile genuine and loving.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And if I do end up embarrassing myself, it’s on you,” Rio added, her voice laced with a teasing edge as her lips curled into a small but mischievous grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Deal,” Agatha said with a laugh, leaning in to kiss Rio gently, sealing the promise between them. </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening of the dinner arrived, and Rio stood frozen in front of her closet, her mind whirling as she stared blankly at the rows of hanging clothes. She was surrounded by her usual wardrobe—comfortable, practical, and undeniably her—but tonight, none of it felt right. Her eyes flicked from one piece to another, her brain refusing to settle on anything. Nothing seemed to fit the occasion, and the pressure to look a certain way only made the task feel more daunting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a frustrated sigh, she dropped her shoulders and groaned softly, burying her face in her hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Why is it so hard to dress for a bunch of people I don’t even want to meet?” she muttered to herself, her voice muffled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From across the room, Agatha, seated on the edge of their bed, delicately fastened the last earring in place. She glanced up, her lips curling into a knowing smile as she observed her turmoil.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Because you care more than you’re willing to admit,” Agatha teased lightly, her tone playful yet filled with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio huffed in response, turning to face Agatha with a frown tugging at her lips. “It’s not that I care what they think,” she said, her voice tinged with frustration. “I just… I want to look good. Like, I want them to see me and know I’m with you for a reason. I don’t want them to think I’m out of place, or that I don’t belong in that world.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened at the vulnerability in Rio’s voice. She stood up and crossed the room with a graceful ease, her presence filling the space with a quiet strength. She reached Rio’s side, gently placing her hands on her shoulders. Her touch was warm, grounding, and Rio couldn’t help but relax under it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You could wear sweatpants and a t-shirt,” Agatha said earnestly, her voice low and comforting, “and you’d still look better than anyone else in that room.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave her a doubtful look, arching an eyebrow. “Flattery won’t help you every time, you know?” she replied, though a small smile tugged at her lips despite herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled “Maybe not, but it is working right now.” She stepped back slightly, her eyes scanning the array of clothes before turning back to Rio. “Now, what’s the issue? Too many choices or not enough?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hands gestured helplessly at the closet, as if the answer was tangled in the fabric of the clothes themselves. “I don’t know how to dress for something like this,” she admitted, her voice quieter now, more vulnerable. “My usual stuff feels too casual, but anything fancier feels… like I’m pretending to be someone I’m not.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, her thumb gently brushing the back of Rio’s neck in a quiet act of comfort. She understood the struggle, the inner conflict Rio was facing. Agatha knew how much Rio valued authenticity—how uncomfortable it felt to wear a persona that didn’t fit, to try and blend into spaces where she didn’t feel she belonged.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I get it,” Agatha said quietly, her voice steady. “But you don’t have to change who you are to make a statement. You’re already perfect as you are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips parted, as if about to protest, but Agatha continued before she could speak.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re not pretending to be someone you’re not,” Agatha said, her voice gentle but firm. “You’re showing them who you are. Who <em>we</em> are. You don’t have to look like them to impress them. You’re already impressive. Just by being you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a long silence as Rio processed Agatha’s words, her gaze softening. A warmth spread in her chest, and for the first time in the past hour, she felt the tight knot of anxiety loosen, even if just a little.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head thoughtfully, her fingers tapping against her chin as if pondering a solution. “But if it bothers you that much,” she said, her voice soft with understanding, “why don’t you borrow something of mine?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, her confusion evident. “Really?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Agatha replied with a playful smile, already moving toward her wardrobe with a sense of purpose. “You’d look stunning in half my clothes anyway. Let’s see…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She began thumbing through her well-organized collection, pulling out items one by one. Each piece was carefully examined against Rio’s frame, Agatha holding them up with an expert eye, as if imagining them already on her. She was thorough, deliberate, searching for something that would give Rio the confidence she needed while still allowing her to stay true to herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few moments of this, Agatha’s fingers stopped on a sleek, burgundy blouse with a delicate gold accent along the collar. She held it up with a satisfied nod. “This,” she declared with a confident smile. “This will bring out your eyes. It’s classy without being too over the top. And most importantly, it’s comfortable. You’ll still feel like yourself in it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached back into the closet, pulling out a pair of black slacks and a belt that would complement the blouse perfectly. She handed them to Rio, who was still inspecting the blouse in her hands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment, running her fingers over the soft fabric of the blouse. “Are you sure? This looks… expensive.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk was mischievous, but her eyes softened with affection. “It is. But it’s worth every penny if it means you’ll feel good tonight. Trust me, you deserve to feel stunning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked uncertain for just a moment longer but nodded, surrendering to Agatha’s insistent confidence. She carefully slipped out of her current outfit, unbuttoning her shirt and replacing it with Agatha’s blouse. When she turned to face the mirror, she couldn’t help but smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The blouse fit perfectly, hugging her curves in all the right places without being constricting. It had an effortless elegance, and the deep burgundy color made her eyes sparkle in a way she hadn’t expected. The gold accents at the collar added a touch of warmth that made her skin glow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped up behind her, resting her hands lightly on Rio’s waist as she gazed at her reflection in the mirror. “See?” she said, her voice full of admiration. “You look amazing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio met Agatha’s gaze in the mirror, her cheeks flushing at the compliment. She smiled softly, her heart warming at the sincerity in Agatha’s eyes. “You really think so?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know so,” Agatha replied, her voice steady and unwavering. There was no doubt in her tone, no hesitation. “And just so you know, they’re going to be more intimidated by how gorgeous and confident you look than you could ever be of them.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh, a soft sound that filled the room with warmth. She leaned back into Agatha’s embrace, allowing herself to relax against her steady presence. “You’re too good to me, you know that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Agatha said with a smirk, brushing a kiss on Rio’s lips. “But you’re worth it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Rio stood at the ornate front door of Agatha’s old friend’s grand house, the soft hum of lively conversation and laughter drifting through the cracks in the wood. The house, towering and grand, seemed to gleam in the soft light of the evening. Rio felt a twinge of nervousness ripple through her as she adjusted the hem of the borrowed blouse, tugging at it in a subconscious attempt to make it feel more like her own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced up at Agatha, her gaze momentarily betraying her unease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Relax, love,” Agatha murmured with a soothing smile, gently taking Rio’s hand in hers. Her thumb traced tender, slow circles over Rio’s knuckles, grounding her in the moment. “We’re just here for dinner, not a trial.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a quiet, nervous breath, but the tension in her shoulders didn’t ease. “You say that now,” she replied, her voice tinged with a mix of humor and apprehension, “but you haven’t seen the way I spill wine under pressure. It’s like an art form.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, the sound rich and warm against the cool air. She leaned in close, her lips brushing Rio’s temple in a fleeting kiss. “If you spill, I’ll spill too. Solidarity.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The absurdity of the idea broke through Rio’s anxiety, and she couldn’t help but laugh—a soft, genuine laugh that echoed between them. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand in gratitude, the comfort of that simple gesture settling her nerves. “I’m glad you’re here,” she admitted quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t be anywhere else,” Agatha responded, her tone filled with quiet assurance. She leaned back slightly to look at Rio, her smile soft but confident. “Besides, I’m the one who’s supposed to be intimidating. You’re just here to look beautiful and make them jealous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the smile that tugged at her lips. “You’re a little too good at that whole ‘confidence thing.’”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk was teasing, but her eyes sparkled with warmth. “It’s not confidence, love. It’s just knowing you’re with the most captivating woman in the room.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed at the compliment, her nerves temporarily forgotten in the face of Agatha’s adoration. She gave Agatha a playful push, then turned to face the door, taking a deep breath. The laughter and chatter inside sounded inviting now—less intimidating and more like the beginning of an adventure with Agatha by her side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave her hand one last reassuring squeeze before she reached for the doorbell. “Ready?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her heart still fluttering, but more steady than it had been moments before. “Let’s go show them just how amazing we are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they stepped through the threshold, the room seemed to quiet for a brief moment, as if the atmosphere itself had shifted. The guests, men and women in finely tailored outfits, their drinks sparkling like jewels under the soft glow of the chandelier, sized them up with practiced ease. The laughter and murmur of conversation tapered off just enough to signal the entrance of the newcomers, making the couple’s arrival feel like a side spectacle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, as always, was unruffled. With a calm grace that made it look effortless, she guided Rio forward, her hand settling lightly on the small of her back, a reassuring touch that grounded Rio even as the eyes of the room lingered a fraction too long on them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Everyone,” Agatha’s voice rang out, smooth and commanding, but not loud—just the right tone to capture attention without effort. “I’d like you to meet Rio, my better half.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The polite chorus of “Oh, how lovely,” and “Nice to meet you” followed, as Agatha’s friends stepped forward to greet them with the cool politeness of people who had been trained in the art of social graces. Yet, despite the cordial responses, Rio could feel the subtle shift in energy—the flicker of surprise, the barely perceptible exchanges of glances, the slightest hesitations before each person spoke, as if they were reassessing Agatha’s choices through the lens of her younger, less traditionally polished partner.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wasn’t imagining it. The judgments were there, sharp and almost imperceptible, like cold fingers brushing against her skin. It was as though, in their eyes, she didn’t belong in this world of tailored suits and cocktail conversations, and in turn, she was forcing them to reconsider Agatha’s stature. They were measuring her against expectations she couldn’t meet, and for a fleeting moment, it felt as though they were questioning her worthiness, not just as a partner to Agatha but as a person.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha seemed to sense it, too. Her touch on Rio’s back grew firmer, more protective, a silent promise that nothing would come between them. Agatha leaned in slightly, her voice low and steady as she murmured, “Ignore them. They’re irrelevant.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The quiet conviction in Agatha’s words steadied Rio. She swallowed her discomfort, finding strength in the unwavering support Agatha offered. This was Agatha’s world, and Rio was her equal in it. They were a team, no matter what anyone else thought. With that thought anchoring her, Rio straightened her posture and faced the room, her smile turning from polite to genuine, grounded by Agatha’s presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Mark, the host, a tall man in his early fifties with a salt-and-pepper beard that was meticulously groomed, stepped forward with the air of someone accustomed to being in charge. His wife, Madeline, followed close behind, her platinum blonde hair gleaming like a halo against the soft lighting of the room. She had the air of someone who rarely left the spotlight, her smile practiced but warm, as though she was sizing up everyone in the room to ensure they fit her vision of perfection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha,” Mark said warmly, his voice rich with the sound of familiarity. His eyes briefly flicked to Rio, as if assessing her, before settling back on Agatha with a slight but unmistakable arch of his brow. “It’s been far too long.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It has,” Agatha replied smoothly, her voice cordial but distant, the right mix of politeness and control. “Thank you for having us, Mark. I trust you and Madeline have been well.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Madeline nodded, giving them a graceful smile, but Rio caught the way her eyes lingered for just a moment too long—her curiosity veiled behind the practiced smile of a woman who had seen it all. Agatha continued, her tone steady and unbothered, gesturing toward Rio with an air of quiet pride. “This is Rio, my partner.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Mark’s smile widened fractionally, but Rio could sense the way his expression shifted slightly, as if the introduction had triggered some recalculation in his mind. “Ah,” he said, his voice dipping with a trace of new interest. “Rio. Welcome.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio replied, meeting his handshake with practiced poise. Despite his neutral expression, Rio could feel the weight of his scrutiny, the subtle dissection of her worth beneath the veneer of civility. But she didn’t flinch. Instead, she held his gaze, steady and unfazed, the warmth of Agatha’s touch anchoring her as they moved on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they moved deeper into the room, the gentle hum of small talk resumed, wrapping itself around them like a soft, impenetrable veil. Agatha’s friends, or the epitome of politeness, exchanged pleasantries with the couple, but there was a distinct air of reservation—an undercurrent of something that Rio couldn’t quite place but was all too aware of. She caught snippets of conversations about travel, art, and politics, but it was the subtle glances and half-formed questions that drew her attention more. The way they looked at her when they thought she wasn’t looking. The subtle judgment that lingered in the air, quiet but unmistakable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that, to them, she was an anomaly—someone who didn’t quite belong in the world they had created with their tailored suits, elegant cocktails, and casual airs of superiority. She tried to breathe through it, but it wasn’t easy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound of champagne flutes clinking filled the air, and a woman in a navy cocktail dress—a striking figure with an air of practiced curiosity—leaned forward. Rio recalled her name as Julia, though she couldn’t be sure. Julia’s glass hovered just below her lips, her eyes gleaming with the kind of politeness that was just sharp enough to cut.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So,” Julia began, her tone light but edged with something Rio could not quite name, “how exactly did the two of you meet? It’s always fascinating to hear these stories.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question, as seemingly innocent as it was, felt like a trap, and Rio’s body stiffened before she could stop herself. Agatha, ever poised, met Rio’s gaze with a silent reassurance before reaching for her own glass, her posture as unflappable as always.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio is a PhD student,” Agatha replied smoothly, her voice carrying effortlessly over the murmurs of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The response hung in the air for a moment, the room stilling just slightly, as if a collective breath had been held. The woman’s eyebrows lifted just a fraction, a sharp gleam in her eyes as she processed the words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Your student?” another voice, a man’s, chimed in, his tone laced with disbelief, though he kept it under the surface just enough to maintain a façade of civility.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Indeed,” Agatha answered without missing a beat, her confidence unwavering. “She is pursuing her doctorate in English literature, and I have the privilege of supervising her thesis. It didn’t take long for me to recognize her brilliance, both academically and personally.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a flush creeping up her neck, the heat of the room suddenly more intense. Was it the champagne? The weight of their eyes on her? Or just the sudden spotlight that made her feel like she was standing on display? She swallowed hard, but before she could shrink back, Agatha’s steady presence beside her grounded her, offering a silent anchor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Our relationship is not a secret,” Rio said softly but firmly, her voice calm and even despite the racing of her heart. “It has been disclosed to all relevant authorities.” Her words were measured, but there was a small hitch in her throat. “It’s not—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Improper,” Agatha interjected smoothly, her voice slipping into that familiar, gentle authority that made everything sound so natural, so effortless. Her hand settled on Rio’s back, warm and comforting. “It was entirely above board. Rio’s brilliance was always professional first. The rest, well…” She let her voice trail off, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “The rest came after.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The woman in the navy dress nodded slowly, her smile faltering just slightly, as if she wasn’t quite sure how to navigate this new territory. “Well, that’s… unique,” she said, her tone soft but with a trace of doubt lingering in her words, as if she had tasted something unfamiliar and hadn’t quite decided whether she liked it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It is,” Agatha agreed, her smile sharpening just a little. She tilted her head slightly, an almost imperceptible challenge flashing in her eyes. “Unique and perfect for us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took in the room, her eyes scanning the faces of the other guests as they exchanged quick, sidelong glances. Their expressions were a mix of surprise, mild discomfort, and something else—something more insidious, like the cold sweep of judgment masked beneath thin layers of forced politeness. The heat in Rio’s chest seemed to spread outward, but just as quickly, Agatha leaned in closer, her lips brushing the shell of Rio’s ear as she whispered, her voice a soft balm to Rio’s nerves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Breathe, love,” Agatha murmured. “You’re dazzling them. They’re just too boring to admit it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A soft laugh slipped past Rio’s lips, and she gave Agatha a grateful, if somewhat shaky, glance. It was the kind of reassurance Rio needed—the gentle reminder that, in this world of sharp-edged opinions and veiled judgments, Agatha would always be there, unwavering and untouchable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before the tension could stretch any further, Mark, the host, sensing the growing discomfort in the air, chimed in with a good-natured laugh, trying to diffuse the tension. “Well, I must say,” he said, his voice carrying a touch of amusement, “it sounds like the beginning of a very compelling story. An academic romance! You should write a book about it, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened at the comment, her eyes flicking to Rio with a warmth that made Rio’s heart skip a beat. There was a depth in Agatha’s gaze, a shared secret that made everything else feel inconsequential.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“If I did,” Agatha said, her tone laced with affection and a touch of mischief, “it’d be the only thing I’ve ever written that doesn’t need a single embellishment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The guests laughed lightly at the quip, the tension in the room beginning to ease just slightly, though the lingering glances didn’t entirely fade.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the conversation flowed and glasses were refilled, Agatha’s old friends began catching up with her, exchanging updates on their careers, families, and travels. The tone was light, filled with polite laughter and occasional jabs about how much time had passed. Eventually, the topic turned back to Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, Rio,” one guest, a middle-aged man in a tweed blazer, leaned forward, offering her an encouraging smile. “We’ve heard so much about Agatha over the years, but tell us more about you. Where are you from?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question came out with the kind of ease that Rio knew she had to answer. She hesitated for only the briefest of seconds, her practiced polite smile never wavering as she thought through her response.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, I grew up in a lot of places,” Rio said casually, waving a hand as though the specifics were too trivial to concern herself with. She could feel the weight of the moment, but she tried to brush it off, deflecting attention from anything too personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really?” Another woman, her voice laced with genuine curiosity, leaned in. “That sounds fascinating. Were your parents in the military or something?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question, well-meaning as it was, made Rio pause for a moment longer. It was an easy assumption for someone like her—someone who had moved from place to place as a child—but it wasn’t quite right. Rio’s expression flickered, just for an instant, as she considered how to respond without getting too personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not exactly,” she replied, her voice still smooth but a little more guarded, the walls going up just a fraction. “I spent a lot of time moving around before I finally settled with Lilia—my adoptive mom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the mention of Lilia, a softening seemed to come over Rio. The name brought a warmth that contrasted sharply with the cool, measured tones she’d adopted. She smiled more genuinely now, her voice carrying a tenderness that was hard to hide. “She’s been everything to me,” she said, a note of true affection slipping into her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The man in the blazer blinked, his attention sharpening, clearly intrigued. “Adoptive mom?” His tone was curious, but something in his eyes betrayed a lack of tact. “So what about before that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question hung in the air, heavier than she anticipated. Rio felt her pulse quicken, the air around her seeming to grow thicker. For a split second, she froze, the weight of the moment pressing down on her. Her grip tightened around her flute of champagne as she sought to compose herself, her pulse quickening at the question she’d known might come up. Agatha’s hand subtly came to rest on her elbow, a silent gesture of support.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught in her chest. She didn’t want to answer that question. Not here. Not now. But she forced herself to speak, to push through the discomfort.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, you know,” she said with a small, dismissive laugh, trying to play it off as if it were no big deal. “I was in the foster care system. Moved around a lot, met a lot of interesting people.” She glanced down at her drink for a moment, then back up at Agatha, who gave her a reassuring nod—silent, but full of understanding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a deep breath, her gaze softening as she continued. “But Lilia took me in when I was a teenager, and she’s been the closest thing to home I’ve ever had.” Her voice grew quieter, more sincere, as the depth of the truth settled in her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, the room was silent. The guests, caught off guard, didn’t quite know how to respond. Rio could feel the shift in the air, the discomfort hanging like a thick fog that threatened to obscure the easy-flowing conversation from before. The man in the blazer seemed at a loss for words, his mouth opening as if he might say something—anything—but he quickly closed it again, unsure of what was appropriate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before the moment could stretch into something awkward, Agatha smoothly interjected, her voice as warm and composed as ever. “Lilia is wonderful,” she said, her tone light yet firm, guiding the conversation away from any lingering discomfort. “She’s not only been a mother to Rio but to me as well. I think we both hit the jackpot with her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s words, as always, were impeccably timed, and the conversation effortlessly shifted back to lighter topics. The tension in the room began to ease as the guests seemed to absorb the redirection, though the eyes still lingered on Rio for a beat longer than she would have liked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, feeling the weight lift just slightly, relaxed marginally. Her posture softened, and though her smile returned, it wasn’t quite as guarded as it had been moments before. She glanced at Agatha, whose hand remained steady on her arm, offering a silent, unwavering support. Rio’s pulse steadied as she let herself settle into the moment, finding comfort in the familiar warmth of Agatha’s touch. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

</div><hr /><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Just before dinner was served, Rio found herself wandering through the grand hallways of the house. She had slipped away from the lively crowd of guests under the pretense of needing something from her coat pocket, but in truth, she just needed a moment to breathe and escape the evening’s stress.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio walked slowly down a hallway, the soft click of her heels muffled by the thick Persian rug beneath her feet. The hallway was adorned with an array of ornate paintings, each frame capturing moments of history and beauty that contrasted sharply with the unsettling turbulence stirring within her. As she paused before each painting, her gaze lingered for a moment, drawing strength from their silent elegance. It was a brief respite, an attempt to steady herself before she rejoined the gathering in the dining room.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">But as she neared the kitchen, the faint sounds of voices—low and hushed—drifted out through the slightly ajar door. Rio froze in her tracks, her curiosity piqued by the mention of her name. She hadn’t intended to overhear anything, but the words reached her all the same, slipping through the crack in the door like an unwelcome whisper.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I just don’t get it,” a woman said, her tone biting and dismissive. “Agatha is brilliant—<em>brilliant</em>. She could have anyone, but instead, she’s… what? Dating her <em>student</em>? It’s not just inappropriate. It’s unprofessional. It’s pathetic.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The words cut through the air like a blade, and Rio felt her chest tighten. Her pulse quickened, her heart already racing in the thick silence of the hallway.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“And not just <em>any</em> student,” a man’s voice chimed in, mocking and disdainful. “Look at her. She’s a kid, for god’s sake. Barely out of whatever system she came from. A foster kid who’s probably been scrapping her way through life since she could walk. She sees someone like Agatha and thinks, ‘Here’s my ticket out.’ It’s not hard to figure out what’s going on here. Nothing but a broken past to fall back on.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, her hands trembling at her sides. She could feel the sting of their words all over again. The years of rejection, the countless times she’d been told by a family they couldn’t keep her, none of that was new, but hearing it now, about her relationship with Agatha, hit like a fist to the gut. A foster kid with nothing to offer. That was all they saw. <em>A foster kid.</em> They didn’t even say it with pity—just contempt, as if her childhood, her entire life before now, was some shameful blemish she’d never escape.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s stomach twisted in a painful knot, her breath catching in her throat. The words felt like a slap—each one leaving a bruise, even though she wasn’t sure why she let them hurt so much. But they did. The sting was real, sharper than she expected. She wasn’t some innocent, naïve girl. She was used to rejection, to being looked down on—but this felt like a fresh wound.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“And Agatha?” the woman continued, her voice low but filled with a bitter edge. “She’s smart, sure, but this is reckless. She’s a strong, independent woman who could have anyone, but instead she’s with some poor, confused little orphan who also happens to be her <em>student</em>. It’s honestly embarrassing, it looks like a charity case. And what kind of example is she setting for her son? Dating someone like that.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The man’s voice chimed in again, the disgust almost palpable. “Exactly. It’s wrong,” he said with a mocking laugh. “You’d think she’d know better. She’s <em>too good</em> for this kind of mess. Can you imagine what people would say if this got out? ‘Oh, look, Dr. Harkness, brilliant scholar, seduces her poor, vulnerable student.’ That’s what everyone will think. It’s gross. It’s unprofessional. It’s… trashy.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s breath quickened, her vision blurring with tears she refused to let fall. She couldn’t decide what hurt more—the way they spoke about Agatha, as though their relationship was some kind of sordid scandal, or the way they dismissed her, reducing her entire existence to her past.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Her body tensed as the words rattled around in her mind like poison. She stood frozen in place, every part of her wanting to push open the door, to confront them, to demand they take their words back. To tell them they didn’t know her, didn’t understand Agatha, didn’t understand the kind of bond they shared.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">But then, she could picture Agatha’s voice in her mind, soft but firm, urging her to stay calm. “<em>Take a breath, love. Let them talk. They don’t know us. It’s only two people’s opinion. They don’t understand what we have, and they never will.</em>”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">A slow, shaky breath escaped her lips. Rio closed her eyes for a moment, her pulse thudding in her ears as she fought to steady herself. It wasn’t worth the confrontation. Not now. Not when the evening was already so delicate.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">With a deep, deliberate breath, Rio took a step back, her heels barely making a sound on the polished wooden floor as she turned away from the kitchen. She moved quietly down the hallway, her face composed, but the storm in her chest still raging. Each step felt heavier than the last, her heart pounding in her chest like a drumbeat of defiance and hurt, but she held her head high.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">By the time she reached the dining room, the smile on her face was in place—calm, measured, carefully crafted—but her thoughts churned restlessly beneath the surface. The voices that had spoken so cruelly still echoed in her mind, and for a brief moment, she wondered if she was enough. If she truly belonged in Agatha’s world.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">But then, as she entered the room and saw Agatha across the space, her warm gaze instantly locking with hers, something shifted. Agatha’s quiet strength, her unwavering support, wrapped around Rio like a protective cloak, steadying her in ways that words never could.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Hey, love,” Agatha murmured softly as Rio sat down beside her, the warmth in her voice pulling Rio’s focus back to the present.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Hi,” Rio replied, her voice smooth and controlled, a stark contrast to the storm churning beneath the surface. She leaned in closer, as though sharing a secret, seeking the calm that always seemed to radiate from Agatha. The quiet strength in her touch, the unwavering certainty in her gaze, was enough to steady her for a moment.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Everything okay?” Agatha asked, her eyes narrowing slightly with concern, reading Rio like an open book despite the practiced calm Rio wore on her face.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s chest tightened, but she gave a quick nod, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Of course. Just needed a little breather,” she said, the words flowing easily despite the weight behind them.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha didn’t press. She knew Rio well enough by now to understand that sometimes, space was what was needed most. But that didn’t stop her from reaching out under the table, her hand finding Rio’s with quiet urgency. Her fingers interlaced with Rio’s in a gesture so simple yet profound—an unspoken promise of solidarity.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As the conversation flowed around them, Rio did her best to engage, her smile polite, her responses well-rehearsed. She nodded when appropriate, offering the occasional laugh, but her thoughts remained anchored elsewhere. The voices in the kitchen, sharp and cutting, continued to echo in her mind like a relentless drumbeat. The words stung, each one sharper than the last, swirling and twisting in her chest. They didn’t know her. They didn’t understand her, or Agatha, or the depth of what they shared. But still, the hurt lingered, like a shadow that wouldn’t quite lift.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">She gripped Agatha’s hand under the table a little tighter, grounding herself in the feel of her touch. She didn’t owe anyone here an explanation—she knew that, and yet, the weight of their stares, the quiet judgment hanging in the air, made her wonder if it was a truth they would ever accept.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The room hummed with the sounds of a well-to-do gathering: the soft clink of silverware against fine china, the quiet murmur of polite conversation, the flicker of candlelight casting dancing shadows over the immaculate table. The centerpiece of fresh flowers, their vibrant colors almost mocking in their innocence, stood proudly in the middle. The scent of roasted meats and delicate sauces filled the air, but it might as well have been distant, as if Rio were looking through a pane of glass at the whole scene, disconnected from it all.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha, however, couldn’t seem to focus on any of it.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Her gaze was locked on Rio, unwavering, as though trying to decipher the distance between them that had grown in the span of a few minutes. Rio, her back straight, her posture impeccable, moved through the motions of the dinner with practiced ease. She answered questions with the precision Agatha had come to expect from her—sharp, intelligent, thoughtful. But there was something in the air around her that Agatha couldn’t ignore, a shift, a subtle weight pulling her down.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha watched as Rio cut into her food, her movements almost too careful, as though each action was deliberate, controlled, as though she were trying to hold herself together piece by piece. Her gaze was often trained on her plate, her focus drifting inward, away from the conversation, away from the room. Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly as she watched Rio glance up, offering the polite smile she always wore in these situations, but it was a mask, and Agatha knew it. The smile didn’t reach her eyes; those eyes, usually so bright, were clouded with something Agatha couldn’t name but felt deeply.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">It pained her to see it. To see the woman she loved, so vibrant, so full of life, retreating into herself in a room full of people who could never understand.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Under the table, Agatha gave her hand another squeeze, a quiet gesture meant to remind Rio that she was there, that she always would be, even when the weight of the world felt too heavy. Even when the judgment of others felt unbearable.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s fingers twitched in response, a small but telling sign that she was still tethered to Agatha, still holding on.<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>But Agatha knew her well enough to recognize the strain in Rio’s movements. Rio was a fighter, a survivor, but tonight, the fight felt like it had been taken out of her, like she was simply enduring the evening, one moment at a time.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Then she saw it.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">A single tear, almost imperceptible, traced down the curve of Rio’s cheek, catching the candlelight before it fell silently to her chin. Her hand shot up in reflex, swiping it away quickly, as though trying to erase any evidence that it had ever been there. But the damage had been done. Agatha’s stomach tightened, an icy chill sweeping through her. The suddenness of it left her breathless. <em>What had caused that?</em></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s pulse quickened. She reached for her glass, her fingers shaking ever so slightly, the cool touch of the crystal against her skin doing nothing to quench that moment of panic. But she couldn’t let it take over. Not yet. Not in front of everyone.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">She leaned in closer, her body shifting toward Rio. Her voice was a soft murmur, meant only for Rio’s ears, her concern wrapped in gentle words. “Are you okay, my love?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio blinked rapidly, the faintest glimmer of surprise in her eyes before the practiced smile appeared on her lips, a mask so familiar it almost fooled Agatha. “I’m fine,” she murmured, her voice just a little too steady, a little too rehearsed.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s heart clenched. She knew better than to believe it. She saw past the words, the smile, the careful composure. Without missing a beat, she let her gaze sweep around the table. Most of the guests were caught up in a heated discussion about the merits of various wine pairings—thankfully, a topic so banal that no one seemed to notice the shift in the air. Lowering her voice further, Agatha pressed again, her tone gentle but unyielding. “Did something happen, darling?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s hand, cool and hesitant, brushed against Agatha’s under the table. It was the smallest of gestures, but to Agatha, it spoke volumes. Rio shook her head, a subtle movement, her eyes cast downward as if the simple act of meeting Agatha’s gaze might reveal too much. “Not here,” she whispered, her voice tight with a barely concealed plea for patience. “Please.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened, her pulse thudding in her ears, but she nodded without hesitation, biting back the instinct to push further. She could feel the weight of the room pressing in on them, but more than that, she could feel the weight of Rio’s discomfort, heavy and unspoken. It threatened to suffocate them both, but Agatha would hold it together. She would wait until they were alone, where Rio could unravel without anyone watching.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">For now, she could do something else.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Her fingers found Rio’s thigh beneath the table, a quiet promise that she wouldn’t let go. She let her hand rest there, not too tight but not too light, a steadying presence in the midst of everything that felt off-balance. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for the moment. Every time Rio shifted in her seat, Agatha’s hand subtly adjusted to keep contact, a silent anchor in the storm swirling inside Rio.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The rest of the meal passed in a blur, the voices around them fading into a distant hum. Agatha kept her focus on Rio, her attention razor-sharp, the quiet tension in her body palpable. Each time Rio responded to a question, her voice was perfectly controlled, but Agatha could see the cracks—the small, unspoken things that flickered in her eyes, the stiffness in her movements. She was here physically, but her heart was somewhere far away, locked up in a place Agatha couldn’t reach… yet.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s gaze never wavered, and though no one mentioned it, she could feel the others beginning to notice. Her intensity was unmistakable, her focus on Rio sharper than anything else in the room. But she didn’t care. She couldn’t afford to care. Not when she could feel the pain radiating off Rio in waves. Whatever had happened to cause that tear, whatever had triggered that raw vulnerability, Agatha would not allow her to face it alone. Not tonight. Not ever.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The evening dragged on, the noise of the room a distant echo in Agatha’s ears as she tried to piece together what was going on behind Rio’s walls. What had she seen? What had she heard? Why had it shaken her so deeply? There were too many unanswered questions, but Agatha knew one thing for sure: Rio wasn’t just sitting beside her—she was holding herself together with the same quiet strength she always did, but it was fraying at the edges.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As the dessert plates were cleared and the wine glasses refilled, Agatha’s concern for Rio deepened. The younger woman’s subdued demeanor hadn’t lifted, and though Rio kept up her polite facade, Agatha could see the tension in her shoulders and the way her hands fidgeted with the hem of her napkin. Rio was barely holding it together.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s chest tightened with an instinctual need to protect her, to get her out of this suffocating space. She didn’t know what had happened, what words or looks had pushed Rio to retreat into herself, but the evening had gone on long enough.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">She glanced at Rio again, her heart aching with every subtle shift in her posture, before Agatha made her decision. She couldn’t let this continue.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Raising a hand to her temple, Agatha feigned a wince, her fingers pressing lightly against the side of her head. She let out a soft, exaggerated groan that caught the attention of several guests. The room fell into a momentary silence, heads turning in concern.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Agatha, are you alright?” One of her old friends, a woman who had been too busy discussing her latest trip to Italy only moments before, now leaned forward with furrowed brows, concern etched across her face.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I think I’ve overdone it tonight,” Agatha replied, her voice laced with a balance of apology and resolve. She maintained an air of practiced grace even as her mind raced. “It’s been a long day, and I feel a migraine coming on. I’m so sorry to cut the evening short, but I don’t want to risk making it worse.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">She offered a weary smile, a touch of vulnerability seeping through despite her careful control. Then, under the table, her fingers found Rio’s hand, squeezing it gently but firmly. “We should head home.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The response was immediate, and Madeline – the good perfect hostesss - quickly stood and made her way over to them. “Of course, Agatha,” she said with a soft nod, her voice symapathetic. “Don’t worry about it. You’ve had a lot on your plate lately, I’m sure. Take care of yourself.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The words were kind, but they felt far too superficial for Agatha’s taste. She didn’t need their sympathy. What she needed was to get Rio out of here, away from all of this.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As they moved to gather their things and say their goodbyes, Agatha’s eyes remained focused on Rio, scanning her face for any signs of relief. The younger woman’s brow furrowed slightly at the sudden change in course, confusion flashing across her features. But Agatha didn’t give her the chance to question it. She caught her gaze and gave a subtle, reassuring look—<em>just go with it</em>.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment. The politeness was still there, of course, and Rio offered the expected smiles to those around them, but Agatha could feel the weight of her silence, her body language still tightly coiled, as though she was bracing herself against something she couldn’t control.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Once outside, the cold night air hit them like a wave, the sudden contrast between the warmth of the house and the crisp night drawing a small breath from Agatha. She waited until they reached the car, then stopped, her movements deliberate as she turned toward Rio.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Gently, Agatha cupped Rio’s cheek with one hand, her thumb brushing the soft skin beneath her eye. “Let’s get you home, okay?” she murmured, her voice a soothing whisper, meant only for Rio.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">For a moment, Rio just stood there, her eyes a little too wide, as though she was unsure of how to respond to the tenderness in Agatha’s touch. Then, Rio leaned into the palm resting against her cheek. It was a subtle movement, but to Agatha, it spoke volumes.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">When Rio finally nodded, it was almost imperceptible, but it was enough.<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha started the engine, the silence in the car feeling heavy but not uncomfortable. She reached over, resting a hand on Rio’s thigh as she drove. She didn’t want to push, not now—not when Rio was so clearly carrying something heavy, something that hadn’t yet found its way into words.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio turned her head slightly, her gaze meeting Agatha’s, and Agatha saw the shimmer in her eyes—the silent turmoil she was fighting to keep hidden. Her lips parted, but for a moment, no sound came. Agatha knew that Rio didn’t need to say anything just yet.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio’s voice came, small and fragile, barely above a whisper. The words hung in the air between them, a soft thread of gratitude that didn’t need to be said but was anyway. It was all Agatha needed to hear to understand that Rio was holding onto something, something difficult, something painful, but that Rio knew, without a doubt, she didn’t have to face it alone.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Her eyes never left the road, but her focus was on Rio, on the unspoken, the things that couldn’t be voiced just yet. Agatha didn’t need Rio to speak now; she needed to get her home, to a place where Rio could breathe again, where the weight of the world didn’t press so hard against her chest. A place where she could be herself, without fear of judgment, without any expectation but the comfort of Agatha’s presence.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">They drove in silence for a few more miles, the rhythm of the road beneath the tires soothing in its predictability. It was a kind of peace, the kind that came with knowing they were heading home. Agatha pulled the car into a quiet spot by the side of the road, away from the noise and lights of the city, and she let the engine die down. The sudden hush left the air thick with anticipation.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">She was still, watching Rio’s profile, waiting. Her gaze softened, no longer the commanding force she often wore in public, but something gentler, a quiet insistence, laced with concern. Her fingers gripped the steering wheel tightly, but she didn’t reach for Rio just yet. Not until Rio was ready.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice soft, but steady. It was more of an invitation than a demand. “What happened back there? Talk to me.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">For a long moment, Rio didn’t respond. Her eyes remained fixed on the dashboard, staring ahead into nothingness. Her fingers dug into the fabric of the seat as if grounding herself against something she couldn’t escape. Her lips were pressed tightly together, a small, almost imperceptible tremor passing through her.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha waited, patient, never pushing, but never looking away. She wanted to give Rio the time she needed to process, but she also wanted to make it clear that Agatha wouldn’t leave her alone in this. Not now. Not ever.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Minutes passed, and the silence in the car stretched between them, but Agatha’s hand remained on the wheel, steady, ready to move, ready to reach out when Rio was ready. She didn’t rush it. She couldn’t rush it. This wasn’t a battle for time; it was a battle for trust.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Finally, Rio let out a breath, deep and shaky, her hand leaving the seat as it slowly moved to her lap. She still didn’t meet Agatha’s gaze, but the tension in her body shifted, just a little. Agatha could feel it, that small change, the subtle relaxation that told her Rio was starting to let go. Slowly, cautiously, Rio finally spoke.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I—I overheard some of your friends,” Rio began, her voice trembling as the words started to come out. She pulled her knees up to her chest, hugging them tightly as though trying to make herself smaller, to disappear into the comfort of her own body. Her forehead rested against her knees, and the first tear slid down her cheek, the silent weight of it breaking through her composure. “In the kitchen… they were talking about us.” She paused, her breath shallow and jagged, struggling to find the right words, but they came too quickly, too harshly. “They were saying things about us… about me.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s heart lurched painfully in her chest. Every instinct in her wanted to pull Rio close, shield her from this hurt. But she stayed still, her grip on the steering wheel tightening, trying to keep her own composure so she could be the calm one, the steady one. Her heart was a whirlwind of protective fury, but she focused on Rio’s words.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“What kind of things, love?” Agatha asked, her voice now firm, a gentle edge of protectiveness creeping in. She couldn’t hide the concern that threaded through her tone—this was more than just overheard gossip. Rio was hurting, and that was something Agatha couldn’t stand.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“They… they said it was inappropriate,” Rio continued, the words coming out slower now, as though they were fighting their way through the rising tide of emotion. Her eyes, once so vibrant and full of life, were now glassy with tears, her voice barely above a whisper. “They… they said I’m just some street kid,” Rio continued, her voice cracking slightly. She didn’t meet Agatha’s eyes, staring instead at her own hands twisted together in her lap. “That I’m nothing. That I’m using you to… to climb out of where I came from. Like I’m some charity case you decided to take in. They said I’m… not good enough for you.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Her words came faster now, tumbling out as if she could outrun the weight of them. “And that you’re… ruining your reputation. That you should be embarrassed. That I’m… trashy. That you’re setting a bad example for Nicky by being with me. Because I’m your student. Because I’m…”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Her voice broke, and she sucked in a trembling breath, blinking back the tears that threatened to spill. “Because I’m nothing but some desperate, broken foster kid who doesn’t deserve to be here. That’s what they think, Agatha.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Finally, Rio looked up, her dark eyes brimming with unshed tears. “Is that what people are always going to think about me? About us?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s heart dropped into her stomach, the protective surge of anger rising up like a tidal wave. She could feel the heat in her chest, her hand clenching around the wheel so tightly her knuckles turned white. But she forced herself to take a deep breath, to hold back the flood of emotion threatening to spill over. She had to stay calm for Rio, for this moment. The last thing Rio needed was more anger, more tension. But inside, Agatha’s emotions were a tornado—rage, frustration, and an intense desire to lash out, to shield Rio from this cruel judgment.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify"><em> How dare they? How could they say these things? How could they make Rio feel this way? </em> Her mind screamed in disbelief, the injustice of it all burning inside her.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">But as she glanced over at Rio, her love—so small, so vulnerable in that moment, her face still trembling with uncertainty—Agatha’s fury started to dissipate, replaced by an overwhelming urge to comfort her. Rio’s body language screamed of the doubt and the pain that had been thrust upon her, and it crushed Agatha to see it. She knew Rio carried so much weight, so much of herself wrapped up in the opinions of others, and the last thing Agatha would ever allow was for those words to fester in her heart.</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <b>   </b>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">She didn’t want Rio to see her angry, didn’t want her to think it was her fault, but the protective instinct in Agatha was like a fire raging inside her. She wanted to tear down anyone who made Rio feel small, who made her question herself.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">But Agatha knew better than to let the anger take over. This wasn’t about fighting Rio’s battles for her; this was about reassuring Rio, showing her that she was not alone, that she was not defined by the cruel words of others.</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <b>   </b>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s voice was quieter now, almost fragile, as if the weight of her own thoughts were threatening to crush her. “I know I’m young,” she murmured, her words trembling. “I know I’m not… I’m not like you. I’m not as experienced, or mature, or… anything.” Her eyes flickered to Agatha, the vulnerability in them raw and open, as though she was standing on the edge of a cliff, unsure whether to jump or step back. “What if they’re right, Agatha? What if I’m not the right person for you? What if you need someone more than me?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The words hit Agatha like a physical blow, and her chest tightened painfully, the very thought of Rio doubting herself so deeply stirring a fierce protectiveness in her heart. She couldn’t stand it, couldn’t bear the sight of Rio questioning her worth when Agatha knew, deep in her soul, just how much she meant to her. Rio was <em>everything</em> to Agatha, more than enough in ways she couldn’t even put into words.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Seeing the anguish on Rio’s face, Agatha’s heart raced. She refused to let Rio spiral into this doubt, refused to let her carry the weight of those insecurities alone.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Without a word, Agatha shifted in her seat, moving closer to Rio. She didn’t wait for permission, didn’t hesitate. She gently pulled Rio into her lap, cradling her with the kind of tenderness that only she could offer.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Hey, look at me,” Agatha said, her voice steady but filled with all the conviction in the world. She tilted Rio’s chin up, forcing her to meet her gaze. “What they said, it’s not true. Not a word of it.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio looked at her, still vulnerable, but Agatha could see her searching her face for truth, for reassurance. Agatha leaned in close, her forehead gently resting against Rio’s as she spoke, her words full of force and determination.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Those people, my so-called ‘friends,’ they couldn’t be more wrong. You’re not just <em>good enough</em> for me, Rio. You are everything I need. You are more than enough—more than I ever could have dreamed of.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">She tightened her hold, her voice lowering, but no less intense. “And if they can’t see that, then they’re not the kind of people I want in my life anyway.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“But I’m not…” Rio started, her voice still trembling.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Shh,” Agatha interrupted, her thumb brushing the back of Rio’s hand in a calming motion. “I don’t care what they think, or what they say. You are everything to me. Don’t you dare believe anyone who tells you otherwise.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">She paused, allowing the weight of her words to settle between them. “As for being young…” Agatha trailed off, giving Rio a pointed look. “I don’t need someone with more experience, Rio. I don’t need someone older, or more ‘mature.’ I need <em>you</em>. I’ve never needed anyone more in my life than I need you.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s eyes welled up, her lips quivering. “I don’t want to hurt you or your life, Agatha,” she whispered, her voice breaking.<span class="apple-converted-space"> “Sometimes, </span>I just feel like I don’t fit in, like I don’t belong anywhere or with anyone,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Like I’m always going to be the one who doesn’t belong.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha pulled her even closer, her hands gently cupping Rio’s face to lift it so they were eye to eye. “Listen to me,” she said softly but firmly. “You belong with me, Rio. You belong in my life, in our life. I’m not going anywhere. I’m here. I’m not just your professor, I’m your partner, your family, whatever you want me to be. And no one—no one—can take that from us. Not them, not anyone. You belong <em>here.</em> Not because of where you came from or what you’ve been through, but because of who you are. You fought to get here. You earned every piece of the life you’re building. And you are more than enough.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio clung to her, her body shaking with the release of every insecurity, every fear she had been carrying, and Agatha held her tighter, wrapping her arms around her with a fierce tenderness.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I’m sorry,” Rio whispered, her voice breaking with the weight of her own vulnerability. “I’m sorry I’m so… insecure.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s heart twisted with affection and protectiveness as she gently brushed the hair from Rio’s face, her fingers trailing softly down her skin. “You’re mine,” Agatha whispered, her lips brushing lightly against Rio’s forehead, the tenderness of the gesture deepening the sincerity of her words. “And I’m yours. That’s all that matters. Don’t you dare apologize for being you.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio’s chest hitched in a breath, the sobs coming more freely now, but Agatha didn’t flinch. She held her close, letting Rio cry, letting her release all the pain and doubt she had been carrying. It wasn’t sadness—Agatha knew that. It was a mixture of relief and love, of finally being able to lean on someone who was strong enough to carry the weight, even for a little while.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha kissed her forehead again, slowly rocking her in her lap. “You’re perfect, Rio. You’ve always been perfect. And you don’t need to change a thing for anyone—least of all me.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio wrapped her arms tight around her, the distress in her expression slowly melting away, replaced by a peace that could only come from knowing she was truly loved, truly seen.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I love you too, Agatha,” she murmured, her voice steady but filled with emotion. “I’m sorry I doubted us.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, her heart full. “Don’t apologize, love. We’re in this together.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The silence settled over them, a quiet comfort in the wake of all that had been said. Agatha felt her protective instincts flare once more, the image of anyone making Rio feel less than she was igniting a fire deep within her. The thought of those people who had dared to make Rio question her worth made Agatha’s blood boil with a fierce protectiveness. “We can go back,” she offered, the anger evident in her voice. “I’ll set them straight—let them know what kind of person you are.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">But Rio shook her head, her voice steady but with a touch of vulnerability that tugged at Agatha’s heart. “No,” Rio said softly. “I’ve been humiliated enough for one night. I don’t want to go back there. Not tonight.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha immediately softened, her anger melting away at Rio’s words. She knew her love was strong, but she also knew when Rio needed to be protected from more than just the harsh words of others. “Of course,” Agatha said gently, her hand brushing over Rio’s cheek in a comforting gesture. “You’re right. We don’t need to go back. Let’s just go home. Just you, me, and Nicky.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio let out a breath, as if a weight had been lifted. “Thank you,” she whispered, her voice a little lighter now. “I just want to be with you, Agatha. I don’t need anything else.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled with tenderness, a wave of love crashing over her as she gazed at Rio. “And you will be with me, love,” she said softly, her words rich with promise. “ Let’s go home, get some rest, and just be together. You deserve it.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">With that, Agatha started the car again, the warmth of her presence and her love enveloping them both. The night had been difficult, but as they headed toward home, the promise of peace and comfort at the end of the day was all that mattered. They had each other—and nothing would change that.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">*</p><p class="p1">*</p><p class="p1">*</p>

Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat at her desk in the quiet solitude of her university office, the faint yellow glow of a single desk lamp illuminating the scattered papers before her. Outside the window, the campus lay draped in darkness, the occasional flicker of streetlights casting long, shifting shadows. The hum of the building’s heating system filled the stillness, a low, constant reminder of the late hour. She adjusted her glasses, her fingers absently brushing a loose strand of hair from her face as her sharp eyes scanned the finalized program for the poetry reading night—an annual tradition that had become a cornerstone of the English department’s culture.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The event, steeped in decades of tradition, was a celebration of creativity and vulnerability. It had been designed to foster camaraderie between students and faculty, giving them a rare opportunity to connect through the raw power of verse. Agatha had inherited the responsibility of organizing it around five years ago, and despite the logistical hurdles, it remained a task she took pride in. There was something magical about witnessing hesitant students find their voices, their emotions spilling out into words that filled the room with a quiet intensity. She always left the event feeling humbled and inspired.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her red pen hovered over the program’s schedule as she made a final note, double-checking the lineup to ensure no one had been inadvertently left out. The faculty readings were strategically placed between student performances, a decision she had learned over the years helped ease nerves and keep the energy steady. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tucked the program into her worn leather briefcase, its edges softened from years of use, and leaned back in her chair, the tension in her shoulders easing for the first time all day. She exhaled deeply, letting her head rest against the high back of the chair as her thoughts drifted from the intricacies of the event to the warm haven that awaited her at home. Tomorrow would be a long day of coordinating sound checks, arranging seating, and managing last-minute adjustments, but tonight, she had something far more precious waiting for her—a quiet evening with Nicky and Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her lips softened into a smile at the thought. Nicky would likely be sprawled out on the living room floor petting Señor Scratchy, his smile soft in adoration for his new best friend. And Rio—her vibrant, unpredictable Rio—would probably be experimenting with a new recipe in the kitchen, or floating around her plants, tending to them - her movements a dance of energy and grace. The image filled Agatha with a warmth that no event, no matter how prestigious, could replicate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The days following the debacle of the dinner party had been a whirlwind of emotions. Agatha had been left reeling, quietly devising ways to make them pay, while Rio had grown slightly more clingy than usual, seeking reassurance more frequently than before, and Agatha had been happy to provide. Now that things had gone back to normal, all Agatha could think of as she was about to make her way home was reuniting with her son and her lover—the only two anchors in her chaotic world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha gathered her belongings, her eyes landed on a small, framed photograph tucked neatly in the corner of her desk. It was a snapshot from last month, a moment she treasured more than she could put into words. The image showed Nicky perched securely on Rio’s hip, his little legs wrapped snugly around her waist. His head rested on her shoulder, the angle of his face soft and relaxed, exuding the quiet trust only a child could have. In one small hand, he clutched a juice box, the straw askew, adding a charming imperfection to the scene.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face wasn’t visible; the photo had been taken from behind by Agatha herself. But even so, she was unmistakable—the cascade of dark hair tumbling down her back, the way her posture effortlessly radiated strength and care. It perfectly captured who Rio was: someone who could carry the weight of the world on her shoulders—and <em>her</em> whole world in her arms at the same time, all with effortless grace. Agatha couldn’t help the small, tender smile that tugged at her lips as she looked at it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Standing, she slung her coat over her arm and grabbed her briefcase, her movements purposeful yet unhurried. The long day behind her dissolved into the promise of the evening ahead. As she flicked off the lamp and locked her office door, the quiet click echoed in the now empty hallway. She stepped out into the crisp night air, the campus quiet except for the distant rustle of leaves in the wind.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The poetry reading could wait until tomorrow. Tonight, the real poetry was waiting for her at home—in the laughter of her son, the steady love of her girlfriend, and the simple, quiet joy of being together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The warm, inviting aroma of garlic and rosemary greeted Agatha the moment she stepped through the door, making her stomach rumble. She shrugged off her coat, hanging it on the rack near the entryway, and followed the source of the heavenly smell into the kitchen. There stood Rio, stirring a pot on the stove, her back turned but radiating the returned easy confidence that always made Agatha’s heart ache in the best way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s dark hair was tied back in a loose bun, stray wisps framing her face, and she wore Agatha’s favorite apron —the one Nicky had made in school for Mother’s Day years ago. Its faded fabric, speckled with stains, told the story of countless shared meals and quick snacks. The sight of her, bathed in the golden light of their kitchen, made the stresses of Agatha’s long day melt away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re late,” Rio said, her voice teasing as she stirred the pot, not bothering to glance up. “Let me guess—you fell into another black hole of grading?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, setting her leather bag on the counter with a soft thud. “Not grading, for once. I was finalizing the program for next week’s poetry reading night. It’s practically a second job at this point.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned off the burner, reaching for plates to dish up their meal. “Ah, yes. The esteemed poetry night,” she said, her tone laced with playful sarcasm. “A time-honored tradition. Let me guess—endless enthusiasm from the undergrads and last-minute chaos from everyone else?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, reaching for two glasses and filling them with the leftover wine they had opened two days earlier to celebrate Agatha’s new grant approval. “You’re not entirely wrong. Though, surprisingly, even a few of the PhD students are stepping up this year.” She handed one of the glasses to Rio, who finally turned to face her with a smirk that softened into something fond.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Where’s Nicky?” Agatha asked, leaning against the counter as Rio set the plates on the table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He begged to go to Wanda’s,” Rio said with an affectionate roll of her eyes. “You know how Billy and Tommy are his new best friends. Wanda promised to drop him off later, so it’s just us for dinner.” She leaned down and kissed the top of Agatha’s head before settling into her chair. “What’s the lineup for the poetry night looking like?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat across from her, swirling the wine in her glass before taking a sip. “Surprisingly good. Some raw talent, some overconfidence, the usual mix. But you know,” she said, fixing Rio with a pointed look, “PhD students are encouraged to participate, you could always join in. I’ve read your work. You’d blow them all away.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze for half a second, her back to Agatha, before recovering smoothly. “I don’t know,” she said, turning around with a careful shrug. “Maybe. Depends on how busy I am. I’ll see if I’m in the mood.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha narrowed her eyes slightly, taking a sip of her wine. “You’re usually full of opinions about the department’s events. I expected either an immediate yes or a dramatic refusal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a small, nonchalant wave of her hand, as if brushing away Agatha’s scrutiny. “Well, it’s not like I have to, right? It’s optional for us PhD students.” She kept her voice breezy, but she could feel Agatha’s gaze linger, weighing her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“True,” Agatha replied slowly, leaning forward and resting her chin on her hand. “But you do like poetry, and I’d think you’d enjoy the chance to show off your brilliance in front of the department.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, stabbing at her food. “Who says I need a stage for that? You already know how brilliant I am.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “I do, indeed. But you’re avoiding the question.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, setting the plates on the table. “Maybe I’m trying something new. Keeping you on your toes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hmm,” Agatha hummed, her suspicion piqued. But she didn’t press the matter, instead taking her seat at the table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha studied her for a moment longer, clearly unconvinced but not willing to press further—for now. Instead, she gave a little shrug of her own, returning her attention to her plate. “Suit yourself,” she said. “But you’ll miss out on the fun.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll see,” Rio replied, her tone playful, though her heart raced a little under Agatha’s scrutiny. She quickly took another bite to avoid saying too much.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they ate, Rio steered the conversation toward safer territory—her dance classes, a funny story about a fellow student, and their plans for the weekend. But as the evening wore on, Agatha couldn’t shake the sense that Rio was hiding something.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they cleared the table and settled onto the couch with tea, Rio had already disappeared into the study with a small notebook tucked under her arm. Agatha’s curiosity simmered beneath the surface, but she knew better than to pry. Whatever Rio was working on, she’d reveal it when she was ready.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned against the doorframe of their shared study one evening, her arms crossed as she watched Rio hunched over the desk. The soft glow of the desk lamp illuminated her tousled hair and the steady motion of her pen across the page.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Burning the midnight oil again, are we?” Agatha teased, her voice light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio jumped slightly, her hand instinctively snapping the notebook shut before turning to face her. “Oh, you know how it is,” she replied with a casual shrug. “Thesis ideas. They come at the strangest times.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do they?” Agatha asked, arching an eyebrow. She stepped into the room, her gaze flicking to the notebook Rio had just hidden beneath her hand. “Because your actual thesis notebook is still sitting on the kitchen counter, exactly where you left it two days ago.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, momentarily caught off guard, before letting out a soft laugh. “Okay, so maybe I’m brainstorming. Not everything has to go into <em>that</em> notebook, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hummed thoughtfully, her lips quirking into a smirk. “Hmm. Brainstorming, you say. And yet, so secretive about it.” She leaned a little closer, her fingers brushing over the notebook’s cover, but Rio pulled it protectively closer to her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s nothing exciting,” Rio insisted, her tone light but firm. “Just… preliminary notes. A mess, really. Not ready to share.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha straightened, her curiosity piqued further. She wasn’t used to Rio being this evasive—not with her, at least. But she also knew better than to push. Rio was stubborn, and when she was ready, she’d share.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Fine,” Agatha said, stepping back with a playful sigh. “Keep your secrets. But you’re making me curious.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Curiosity killed the cat,” Rio shot back with a grin, and Agatha laughed softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good thing I’m a not a cat, then,” she replied, tapping her temple knowingly before turning toward the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she left the study, Agatha couldn’t help but glance back, catching Rio reopening the notebook and scribbling again with intense focus. Whatever Rio was working on, it wasn’t her thesis—that much was certain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And whatever it was, it had to be something important.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat at the kitchen table the next morning, her coffee steaming beside her as she flipped absentmindedly through a stack of papers. Her thoughts, however, weren’t on work—they kept drifting back to Rio’s mysterious behavior over the past few days.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She replayed the scene from the previous evening in her mind: Rio hunched over her notebook, that protective flash in her eyes when Agatha had tried to peek at it. It wasn’t like Rio to be so secretive, especially about her writing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sipped her coffee, staring at the untouched notebook still lying on the counter—Rio’s actual thesis notebook. It confirmed what she already knew: whatever Rio was working on had nothing to do with her research.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Could it be for the poetry night?” she wondered aloud, setting her mug down with a soft clink. The thought lingered for a moment, filling her with a spark of intrigue. Rio was certainly capable of it—she had a poetic soul, after all. And Agatha could imagine Rio wanting to surprise her with something special.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But as quickly as the idea formed, Agatha dismissed it with a shake of her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No,” she muttered. “If she were planning to read at the event, she would have told me by now.” Rio wasn’t shy about her talents, and she had never been one to keep something like that under wraps—at least not from Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet… Agatha couldn’t entirely shake the feeling that the answer was right in front of her, just out of reach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of Rio’s footsteps padding into the kitchen. She looked up to find her partner rubbing sleep from her eyes, her hair a wild mess that Agatha found endearing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning,” Rio mumbled, reaching for the coffee pot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning,” Agatha replied, watching her closely. She decided to test the waters again. “So, still hard at work on those ‘thesis notes’ of yours?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for just a fraction of a second—so brief that most people wouldn’t have noticed. But Agatha did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yep,” Rio said breezily, pouring herself a cup of coffee. “It’s been a productive week.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Over the next week, Rio’s behavior grew increasingly elusive, her every move laced with a secrecy that was both frustrating and endearing. She spent countless hours in their shared study, the door often left slightly ajar, as if daring Agatha to investigate. Yet every time Agatha ventured too close, Rio would snap her notebook shut with lightning speed, diverting her attention to something inconsequential—a stray pen, the edge of the desk, or her phone, which she tapped on with exaggerated concentration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a dance of distraction that Agatha found both amusing and exasperating. “I swear, love, it’s like living with a secret agent,” she remarked one evening, leaning casually against the doorway with her arms crossed. Her tone was light, but her curiosity had been piqued beyond reason.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t look up, her pencil moving swiftly across the page of a notebook that was unmistakably new. She had started carrying it everywhere, tucking it under her arm like a prized possession.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Top-secret thesis work,” Rio replied, her voice as airy as her demeanor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched a skeptical brow. “Is it? Because unless your thesis has suddenly veered into espionage, I’m finding that hard to believe. And may I remind you, Ms. Vidal, that I’m your supervisor? You’re contractually obligated to show me your work.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio finally glanced up, flashing her a mischievous grin. “Contractually obligated? That’s rich, Professor Harkness,” she said, her tone dripping with mock formality. “Patience is a virtue, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a long, exaggerated sigh, pushing off the doorway and stepping further into the room. “You know I hate when you’re this evasive. It’s maddening.” She gestured toward the notebook, now strategically tucked beneath a neat stack of blank paper. “Are you hiding a manifesto under there? Perhaps some groundbreaking theory you’re withholding from me? Are you going to change the literary field forever and not share your discovery with me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, a sound that was warm and teasing. She stood, crossing the room to where Agatha lingered, and planted a quick kiss on her cheek. “You’ll survive,” she said lightly, the corners of her lips quirking into a smirk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, narrowing her eyes as if trying to read the secrets hidden behind Rio’s calm demeanor. “Oh, I’ll survive. But will you, when I inevitably find out what you’re up to?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio only winked, slipping past her and heading toward the kitchen with a casual wave of her hand. “Tea, Professor? Maybe some chamomile to help with all that pent-up curiosity?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood in the study for a moment, staring at the abandoned desk and the neatly stacked papers. Her gaze lingered on the edge of the notebook peeking out, just enough to taunt her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, you’re enjoying this far too much,” she muttered, shaking her head as she followed Rio to the kitchen, her curiosity now firmly at war with her self-restraint.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Late that night, Agatha stirred from sleep to the soft, persistent sound of a pen gliding across paper. She blinked into the dim room, her eyes adjusting to the faint golden glow of the bedside lamp. Turning her head, she found Rio sitting upright in bed, her back pressed against the headboard, knees drawn up to support a notebook. Her dark hair spilled over one shoulder, slightly disheveled from sleep, though it was clear she hadn’t done much of that tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was completely absorbed, her pen moving furiously across the page as though the words might slip away if she didn’t capture them quickly enough. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, her lips slightly parted, occasionally murmuring inaudible fragments of thought to herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a fleeting moment, Agatha considered confronting her. She could demand to know what had consumed Rio’s attention so entirely, what had dragged her from sleep to work in the middle of the night with such obsessive focus. But as she lay there, watching Rio, listening to the rhythmic scratching of her pen, the thought dissolved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was something almost sacred about the scene. The energy Rio exuded was electric, raw, and deeply personal. It reminded Agatha of when they had first met—Rio had spoken with the same fiery intensity about her thesis topic, her fascination with the interplay of death, mortality, and timelessness in poetry. That passion had drawn Agatha in like a moth to a flame, leaving her captivated by the way Rio seemed to live and breathe her work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t seem to notice that Agatha had woken. Her pen continued its steady rhythm, her focus unbroken. Agatha watched her for a few moments longer, marveling at how beautiful Rio looked in the soft light, utterly consumed by her work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed quietly, sinking back into her pillow. She would let Rio have her secret, for now. The air in the room felt charged, as though disturbing Rio in this moment might shatter something fragile and profound. Agatha told herself she would wait. Rio would share her project when she was ready.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, as she closed her eyes, Agatha couldn’t quite banish the spark of curiosity flickering at the edges of her mind. The secrecy had gone on for almost a week now, and while she admired Rio’s dedication, a small part of her was beginning to feel left out of whatever had taken hold of her partner so completely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Whatever you’re up to, Rio Vidal,</em> Agatha thought as she pulled the blankets higher, <em>it had better be worth all this suspense.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eventually, Agatha drifted back into an uneasy sleep, her dreams peppered with flashes of Rio’s mysterious notebook and the tantalizing enigma of what it contained.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood in kitchen one lazy morning before her afternoon classes, arms loosely crossed, her posture relaxed but her gaze sharp. Rio bustled around the counter with a focused energy, her movements fluid yet purposeful. A soft hum escaped her lips, punctuated by barely audible murmurs that seemed to rise and fall with a rhythm only she understood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, straining to make out the words, but all she caught were fragmented phrases—snatches of sentences that didn’t make sense on their own. Her curiosity piqued, she lingered silently, letting Rio’s unguarded moment unfold before her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rhythm of Rio’s murmurs abruptly stopped as she reached for a notebook tucked haphazardly beside the toaster. She flipped it open with practiced ease, jotted something down in hurried strokes, and snapped it shut again, tucking it back into its hiding spot before returning to the vegetables on the cutting board.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Caught in the act,” Agatha quipped, her voice lilting with amusement, though her eyes gleamed with mischief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio startled, the knife she held clattering against the cutting board. She spun around, her hand instinctively sliding over the counter to shield the notebook from view, as though Agatha hadn’t already seen it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What act?” Rio asked, her voice pitched higher than usual, her attempt at innocence betrayed by the faint flush creeping up her neck.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, you know,” Agatha replied with an exaggerated wave of her hand as she stepped into the kitchen, closing the distance between them. “The one where you mutter things like a poet in a trance, then scribble furiously in your little notebook and act like it’s nothing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes widened slightly, but she quickly recovered, flashing a grin that didn’t quite meet her eyes. “You’re imagining things, Professor. It’s just… a habit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Habit?” Agatha echoed, leaning casually against the counter, one brow arched in skepticism. “Funny, I don’t recall you having this habit until recently. And that notebook… it seems to have become your constant companion. I’m starting to feel a little jealous.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s grin turned sheepish, and she ducked her head, focusing intently on the zucchini she was chopping. “It’s nothing serious,” she mumbled, her tone unconvincing. “Just… creative thoughts. Helps me clear my head.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha studied her closely, her sharp eyes catching the faint blush rising on Rio’s cheeks and the nervous way her hands moved as she resumed chopping, her rhythm slightly off. This wasn’t just playful evasion—there was something deeper at work here, something personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For the first time, Agatha found herself wondering if Rio’s secretive behavior was more than just a distraction or a quirky side project. There was a vulnerability in the way Rio guarded her notebook, an almost childlike protectiveness that softened Agatha’s initial frustration into something gentler.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I see,” Agatha said softly, her voice losing its teasing edge. She reached for a glass of water on the counter and leaned against the sink, her gaze never leaving Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, the kitchen was filled with the quiet sounds of the knife against the cutting board and the faint murmurs Rio let slip as she worked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a tug in her chest—a strange mixture of curiosity, tenderness, and pride. Whatever Rio was working on, it clearly mattered to her deeply. And though Agatha’s natural instinct was to uncover every mystery, she knew this wasn’t the time to unravel this one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She set her glass down and stepped closer, pressing a soft kiss to the crown of Rio’s head. “Whatever it is you’re working on, love, I hope it’s making you happy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio froze for half a beat, then leaned into the gesture, her shoulders relaxing. “It is,” she murmured, her voice quieter now, almost reverent. “Thanks for… letting me have this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her heart warming at the sincerity in Rio’s tone. “Of course,” she said simply, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she stepped back, Agatha resolved to be patient. Whatever secret Rio was guarding, she would share it when she was ready. For now, Agatha would content herself with the mystery, savoring the glimpse of Rio’s passion and the quiet beauty of this moment in their kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But her resolve was hard to hold on to. That evening, Agatha arrived home to the comforting hum of domestic chaos. The scent of basil and cooked tomatoes wafted from the kitchen, mingling with the soft rhythm of Rio’s humming. In the living room, Nicky was sprawled on the carpet, surrounded by a colorful sea of building blocks. Señor Scratchy hopped lazily around him, occasionally nudging a stray block with his nose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha set her bag down by the door and leaned against the living room entryway, her lips curling into a fond smile as she watched her son’s tiny fingers carefully construct what looked like an intricate tower. The focus on his face was adorable—his tongue poked out slightly, his brow furrowed in concentration. Agatha saw it as an opportunity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hello, my little architect,” Agatha called softly, a mischievous glint in her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t look up, too engrossed in balancing a precariously placed block at the top of his tower. “Hi, Mama,” he mumbled, his tone distracted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crouched down beside him, her presence finally breaking his concentration. “That’s quite the masterpiece,” she said, running her fingers lightly over Señor Scratchy’s soft fur, who had naturally drifted towards her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s a castle,” Nicky explained proudly. “For Señor Scratchy to live in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, Scratchy is a very lucky bunny,” Agatha replied with a smirk, her tone teasing. She picked up a stray block and added it to the base of the structure, earning an approving nod from Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a moment, she leaned closer, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial whisper. “I need your help with something important.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That got his attention. He turned his wide, curious eyes up to her, clutching a bright red block tightly in his small hands. “What kind of help?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha feigned seriousness, lowering her voice further. “It’s about Mom. She’s been acting… mysterious lately. Working on something she won’t tell me about. I thought maybe you’d know what it is.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes sparkled with intrigue, but the moment Agatha’s words sank in, he shook his head vigorously, his small hands now gripping two blocks as if to shield himself. “Nope! I don’t know any secrets.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, come on,” Agatha said, her tone mock pleading. “You’re six and almost seven! You must know something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tilted his head in thought, his expression caught between wanting to help and fiercely guarding his loyalty. Then, as if remembering an unspoken oath, he glanced toward the kitchen, where Rio’s voice still hummed softly in the background, and set his jaw with a determination that made Agatha chuckle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Even if I knew,” he said firmly, puffing out his little chest like a knight defending a treasure, “I wouldn’t tell you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha placed a hand over her heart in an exaggerated show of betrayal. “You wound me, Nicholas,” she said dramatically. “I thought we were a team!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned, clearly pleased with himself for holding his ground. “Mom says secrets are for keeping, but only the good kind of secrets,” he said, returning to his tower. “It’s a good secret, I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha ruffled his hair with a laugh, shaking her head at his stubbornness. “Well, it seems I’ve been outmaneuvered. I guess you’ll keep your secrets, but don’t get too comfortable—I’ll figure it out eventually.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not telling!” he insisted, his voice as serious as a six-year-old’s could be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Shaking her head, Agatha rose and made her way to the kitchen. She leaned against the doorframe, watching Rio stir something on the stove, her body moving in time with the tune she was humming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Agatha said with an exaggerated sigh, “it seems I won’t be getting any answers from the little spy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced up, her eyebrow arched in amusement. “Spy?” she asked, her voice laced with curiosity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Your son,” Agatha replied, walking over to stand beside her. “I tried to extract some information about whatever secret project you’re working on, but he’s like a vault. Loyal to the end.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “Good boy. He’s learning well.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned closer, her voice softening. “Come on, love. Can’t you give me just a hint? A tiny clue?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned off the burner and faced her, a playful smile curving her lips. She reached out, put both hands on Agatha's cheeks and planted a kiss right on he lips. “Some secrets are meant to stay that way,” she murmured, her voice warm and teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha groaned, throwing her head back in mock exasperation. “You’re no fun.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, planting her hands on her hips. “You’ll live.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio turned back to the stove, Agatha wrapped her arms loosely around her waist from behind, resting her chin on Rio’s shoulder. “You know,” she said softly, “whatever you’re working on—it had better be worth all this suspense.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced back at her, her smile softening. “It will be,” she promised, her tone so certain it made Agatha’s curiosity burn even brighter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed, releasing her and stepping back to grab three glasses from the cabinet to start setting the table. For now, she’d let it go. But she couldn’t help but wonder—what was Rio planning, and why was she going to such lengths to keep it hidden?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <em>That was a way of putting it—not very satisfactory: </em>
</p><p>
  <em>A periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Leaving one still with the intolerable wrestle<br />
</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With words and meanings. The poetry does not matter. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was not (to start again) what one had expected.<br />
</em>
</p><p>
  <em>What was to be the value of the long looked forward to, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Long hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity </em>

  <em>And the wisdom of age? </em>

</p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night of the poetry reading arrived with the usual bustle Agatha had come to associate with these events, a mixture of nervous energy and artistic anticipation. She strode briskly through the university halls, her heeled boots clicking against the polished floors, a clipboard in one hand and a stack of papers tucked securely under her arm. As she neared the English department’s main hall, the hum of activity greeted her like a familiar rhythm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Students darted about, their voices rising in a symphony of preparation. A group was adjusting the chairs and aligning them with laser precision, while another fussed over the microphone stand on the small, makeshift stage. Others huddled together, whispering snippets of poetry or rehearsing their introductions with nervous energy. The air buzzed with an electric mix of nerves and excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha entered the hall with her usual imposing presence, immediately drawing the room’s attention. She scanned the space with her sharp, discerning eyes, mentally noting what still needed adjusting. As she set down her stack of papers on the registration table, she rolled up her sleeves, ready to dive into the organizational chaos.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Who’s on lights?” she called, her voice carrying easily over the din.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“James is!” a voice piped up from the corner.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good. Make sure the dimmer’s ready for transitions between readers,” she instructed, already moving toward the stage to inspect the microphone. She crouched slightly to test it herself, her voice reverberating through the room. “Check, one, two… Perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She moved with purpose, offering a quick word of encouragement here, a slight adjustment to the seating arrangement there. Her presence seemed to calm the more jittery students, her confidence anchoring them. But no matter how much she immersed herself in these preparations, Agatha couldn’t shake the gnawing feeling that had settled in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Every few minutes, her eyes flicked toward the door. She wasn’t sure how conspicuous it was, but the compulsion was undeniable. She was waiting, hoping for a familiar figure to step through.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’ll come,” Agatha muttered under her breath, as if saying it aloud would solidify the belief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had mentioned she might not be able to attend. Between her demanding thesis schedule and the last-minute band rehearsal that might run late she had mentioned the night before, Agatha had tried to temper her expectations. Still, she’d seen the flicker of excitement in Rio’s eyes when Agatha first brought up the event weeks ago. She’d heard the warmth in her voice when she talked about poetry readings being a rare space where vulnerability and performance collided so beautifully. And she had the unshakable feeling that what Rio has been working on so furiously for the whole week was intimately tied to tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>It matters to her. I know it does</em>, Agatha thought, clutching the clipboard a little tighter as she walked over to the refreshment table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The minutes ticked by, and the hall began to fill with attendees. Students, professors, and a smattering of literary enthusiasts from outside the university claimed seats, creating a growing hum of anticipation. Agatha greeted them warmly, though her eyes still strayed to the entrance with every passing moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness, do you have a moment?” a student asked, pulling her back to the task at hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course,” Agatha replied smoothly, forcing her focus onto the nervous young woman clutching a folded sheet of paper. She listened patiently, offering reassurance and advice, but even as she spoke, the door remained in the corner of her vision, achingly empty of Rio’s presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha found herself standing at the podium, shuffling through the program – without ever taking the time or fucus to properly review anything that was in it - with a calm professionalism that belied the storm brewing inside her. The soft murmur of the gathering audience filled the room, a hum of excitement and pre-performance nerves. She adjusted the microphone, fiddled unnecessarily with her clipboard, and scanned the crowd, her eyes darting toward the entrance for what felt like the hundredth time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her attention was pulled back by a gentle tap on her shoulder. She turned to find Lily, one of her quieter students, standing there with her poem clutched tightly in trembling hands. Lily’s tall and lanky frame seemed to fold inward, her nervousness all but radiating off her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dr. Harkness,” Lily said softly, her voice almost drowned out by the background noise. “Do you think we’ll have enough time for everyone to read? I—I don’t want to take up too much space.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened instantly. She placed a reassuring hand on Lily’s shoulder and gave her a small, encouraging smile. “Lily, this is your space as much as anyone else’s. Don’t worry about the time—we’ll make it work. Just focus on your words. They’re why we’re here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily nodded hesitantly, her grip on her poem relaxing just a little. “Thank you,” she murmured before retreating toward the front row, where she took a seat among a cluster of other students.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched her go, her heart warmed by the student’s bravery but still weighed down by the gnawing absence she couldn’t shake. Her gaze flicked back to the door, her chest tightening at the emptiness beyond it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Where is she?</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but wonder, her thoughts momentarily distracted as she looked at the clock. It was nearly time for the event to begin. She checked her notes, adjusted her glasses, and tried to steady her nerves. But nothing could shake the tight feeling in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She made another round through the room, checking in with more students and making sure everyone was prepared. Still, no Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>She still has time.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just before stepping up to the podium to start the evening, Agatha lingered at the back of the room, scanning the sea of eager faces and the entrance beyond them. The program was in her hands, but her thoughts were elsewhere, her heart pulling in two directions—toward her students and toward the empty space Rio should have occupied.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The hum of voices quieted as Agatha made her way to the front. She adjusted the microphone again, her fingers brushing over the cool metal as she began her opening remarks, the script she had prepared flowing smoothly from her lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, just as she was preparing to introduce the first reader, she heard it—a soft rustling and the quiet creak of the door opening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s words faltered for the briefest moment as her eyes darted to the back of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There, standing in the doorway, was Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment Agatha’s eyes landed on her, everything else in the room seemed to blur, like the world had shifted into slow motion. Rio was wearing a deep purple dress—<em>that</em> dress. Agatha knew that Rio knew purple was Agatha’s color, and seeing her in it now sent a jolt of warmth straight to Agatha’s chest. The rich hue was doing wonders for her complexion, the flowing light skirt brushing her calves with every moves, and she had paired it with boots and a jacket.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her hair, styled just the way Agatha adored it, fell in soft waves down her back, the ends brushing against her shoulder blades. A few strands framed her face, giving her an effortless, ethereal quality, held back behind one of her ears by a single very small flower – an Aster, if Agatha was not mistaken. There was nothing extravagant about her look, but it was perfect—simple, graceful, stunning, exactly the way Agatha loved it. It wasn’t about the dress or the hair, though. It was about Rio, the way she carried herself, with a calm confidence that made every room feel like it was meant for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes scanned the room, a quiet assessment, and when her gaze finally met Agatha’s, something in Agatha’s chest tightened. The smile that tugged at Rio’s lips was soft, tender—a silent acknowledgement that she was here, for Agatha, even if only in this fleeting moment. The warmth in her expression made Agatha’s heart flutter in a way she could never quite predict. It was like Rio had the ability to calm the storm inside Agatha with just a look.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t make a grand entrance. She wasn’t one for theatrics, never one to demand attention, that was more Agatha’s territory. Instead, she moved with a kind of quiet assurance, walking with purpose toward an empty seat near the back. Her movements were graceful, almost as though she was dancing between the spaces, her presence made more significant by its subtlety. Agatha couldn’t help but be mesmerized, her gaze tracking Rio’s every step, even as the noise of the event hummed around her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio settled into her seat, Agatha felt the subtle but undeniable shift. Her chest loosened, and a quiet joy filled the space left in her heart by the absence of her worry. The evening would go on. It had to. But there was something different now. The chaos of the event didn’t seem nearly as overwhelming. Agatha could breathe a little easier. Rio was here, and in her stillness, Rio offered Agatha a silent support that couldn’t be put into words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>She’s here,</em> Agatha thought, a gentle smile tugging at her lips. <em>She’s really here.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze swept over the crowd once more before settling on the first reader, standing off to the side of the stage. He looked poised and ready, likely eager to present what he had undoubtedly poured time and effort into creating. She gave him a brief nod, signaling it was his time to take the stage. But even as she did, her mind kept returning to Rio, seated in the audience, her presence a comfort to Agatha, a reminder that no matter how hectic the world around her seemed, Rio would always be there, quietly supporting her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And now, with Rio seated comfortably in the crowd, there was a new sense of anticipation in the air, a shift in the atmosphere. The evening, which had started with uncertainty, suddenly seemed full of possibility. A spark of curiosity danced in Agatha’s chest—what would Rio surprise her with this time?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe this evening would unfold in ways Agatha hadn’t expected, with more than just poetry filling the room. But one thing was sure, Rio’s presence was already the most beautiful poem of all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening flowed seamlessly as Agatha moved through the program, her voice calm and assured as she introduced each student in turn. The soft hum of anticipation in the air mirrored her own excitement as the students took their turns at the podium, reading poems that varied in theme and style—some earnest, others abstract, but all heartfelt. Each performance was met with polite applause, the audience leaning in, captivated by the raw emotion and creativity spilling from the students’ words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s voice never wavered as she announced the names and managed the flow of the event. There was no hint of the nerves or anxiety that had plagued her earlier; she was in her element, doing what she did best. And yet, beneath the composed surface, something inside her stirred. Despite her attention being drawn to the students, there was a quiet, insistent tug on her focus that pulled her toward the back of the room. Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Why would she come if she’s not going to read?</em> Agatha couldn’t help but ask herself. She had known Rio long enough to recognize the signs. Rio was a perfectionist in everything she did, especially when it came to her writing. Agatha had seen her labor over words for hours, meticulously crafting each sentence, striving for the elusive perfect expression of thought. So why was she sitting there, silent and still, instead of sharing what she had undoubtedly written? Agatha had anticipated, hoped even, that Rio would step up to the podium at some point, like she always did in their private moments, sharing her thoughts with a quiet strength that always left Agatha in awe. But tonight, Rio was content to watch, her presence in the audience an enigma that made Agatha’s thoughts swirl.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>She’s always a mystery,</em> Agatha thought with a soft smile tugging at the corner of her lips. It was a fondness mixed with a touch of frustration, that paradox of knowing and not knowing Rio all at once. But that was part of why Agatha loved her so fiercely—the way she could surprise Agatha, challenge her understanding, and still remain a puzzle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stole another glance at Rio, seated in the audience, her posture perfectly poised, her gaze steady as she took in the event unfolding before her. There was an air of quiet calm about her, a tranquility that seemed almost too serene for a poetry reading. The way Rio’s eyes swept across the room—focused, but distant, like she was taking in the moment without fully engaging—only deepened the sense of mystery that surrounded her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As each student took their turn at the podium, Agatha tried to focus. She reminded herself that the evening was about them, the students, the poetry they had worked so hard to prepare. The applause was polite but sincere, and Agatha offered words of encouragement with a practiced smile, her voice steady, even as her thoughts kept drifting back to Rio. Why was she here if she wasn’t going to share her work? Agatha wondered, her heart tightening. Was there something wrong?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, silently chastising herself for worrying. She knew perfectly well that Rio wasn’t scheduled to read tonight—she had made the program herself, for heaven’s sake. And yet, despite knowing better, a part of her couldn’t help but hope for something unexpected to happen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced again at Rio, who seemed at ease, almost too calm. Rio wasn’t one for idle chatter, and her silences often spoke volumes, but this was different. Agatha couldn’t pinpoint why, but there was a strange stillness about her tonight. It wasn’t like Rio to simply observe without participating or at least engaging. Her absence from the stage felt like something missing that Agatha couldn’t quite explain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Next, we have Lily Harper, second-year literature student” Agatha announced, her voice carrying through the room, pulling her attention back to the task at hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily, her shy and soft-spoken student, made her way to the podium. Her poem was introspective, a quiet rumination on love and loss, but as she read, Agatha’s mind inevitably drifted back to Rio again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Come on, Rio, just get up there,</em> Agatha thought impatiently. <em>I know you’ve been writing. You can’t just be here to watch. There’s something more… I know it. I can feel it.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She cleared her throat and refocused on Lily, applauding her when the poem came to an end.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The event continued like this for a while, Agatha introducing one student after another, a part of her slowly becoming aware that she was awaiting something—something that hadn’t yet come to pass, and that might never come. Every time another student took their turn, Agatha would catch herself glancing at Rio, almost subconsciously.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>She’s not just going to sit there, is she?</em> Agatha’s thoughts were becoming more frantic, though her outward composure remained intact. She didn’t want to jump to conclusions, but it was becoming harder not to wonder what was going on. Was Rio upset with her? Was it a way to silently give her a message? Or was it something else entirely—something Agatha couldn’t yet understand?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But there was no room for these questions in the moment. Not here, not in front of everyone. Not when she was meant to be focused on the students, their work, and the event they had all worked so hard to put together. Agatha steeled herself, forcing the doubts back down as she called out the name of the next reader, her voice a little less certain this time, betraying the tightness she felt in her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she spoke, a voice in the back of her mind whispered softly, <em>She’s going to surprise you.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was the only explanation Agatha could come up with.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her eyes lingered on Rio just a moment longer before she turned her attention back to the program. Each moment that passed seemed to stretch on longer than the last, Agatha now feeling as if the event was crawling by. <em>Come on, Rio,</em> she thought, squeezing the edge of the podium. <em>I know you’re going to do it. Just get up there.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then—</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next reader finished, and Agatha, without thinking, glanced once more toward the back of the room. Her gaze immediately fixed on Rio, who had quietly stood up. It wasn’t the dramatic rise Agatha had imagined, no bold moment to announce her presence. Instead, Rio’s movements were fluid, effortless, her silhouette as sure and graceful as always. But it was the quiet intensity of her gaze that stopped Agatha in her tracks. Their eyes met across the room, and in that instant, an unspoken communication passed between them—a silent exchange that made Agatha’s heart skip a beat. There was no need for words. Rio was ready.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And indeed, as Agatha turned the page to her program, her fingers brushing the list of names, one jumped out at her. <em>Rio Vidal, PhD candidate.</em> She froze for a moment, her brow furrowing slightly in confusion. She could have sworn that name hadn’t been there when she had printed the program yesterday. The thought struck her with a smile that bordered on exasperated affection. <em>Sneaky,</em> she thought with a quiet chuckle to herself. <em>She must have swapped it this morning. </em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had always been full of surprises.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio moved toward the stage with a slow, deliberate confidence that Agatha couldn’t help but admire. There was nothing ostentatious about the way she walked, no exaggerated gesture. It was simply the certainty in each step, a quiet power in the way she carried herself. Every inch of her, from the way her deep purple dress swayed to the rhythm of her movement to the focused expression on her face, exuded a calm, unwavering confidence that Agatha found deeply compelling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>She’s really doing it.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio reached the podium, she stood for a moment, her eyes scanning the room briefly before landing on Agatha. It was only a brief glance, but it felt like a conversation in itself. There was a question in the way Rio looked at her, a quiet invitation. The room seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the next moment to unfold. Agatha’s pulse quickened, anticipation building in her chest. She knew Rio well—there was no turning back now. Agatha fought to steady her voice, trying to conceal the slight tremor as she announced the one name that had been lingering in her thoughts all evening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took the microphone in hand, her fingers gripping it gently, and then, after a long pause, she cleared her throat. It was a subtle sound, but it was enough to quiet the room, every person present holding their breath. Agatha couldn’t help but be drawn to Rio, her eyes locked on her as if nothing else in the world mattered. She felt a soft stirring inside her, a mix of pride, love, and the deepest admiration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s voice broke the silence, soft yet steady, with a warmth that filled the room like honey. As the words flowed from her lips, they seemed to vibrate in the air, weaving through the space between them, pulling at the hearts of everyone listening. Agatha’s breath hitched, and she found herself unable to tear her eyes away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“I’ve found the one who carries truth like flame,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>She moves through the world unburdened by shame.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>She steps into rooms with a quiet might,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Not out of pride, but from owning her light.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words came like a river, flowing with such ease and grace that Agatha felt as though she was drowning in them. Each line Rio spoke was an echo of Agatha’s very essence. The words, carefully crafted, felt as though they had been pulled directly from her heart—descriptions of the very person Agatha had worked so hard to become. She tried to steady her breathing, to hold herself together, but Rio’s voice, her unwavering confidence, was shaking Agatha’s resolve.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“With fire in her voice and stars in her gaze,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>A depth that draws those who dare to appraise.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>She challenges all, yet never must shout,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Her presence alone leaves the world no doubt.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt the warmth in her chest, the unspoken truth she had never said aloud, unfolding in the rhythm of Rio’s voice. The woman in the poem was her—every word, every line. The fire in Agatha’s spirit, the quiet authority she wielded, and the way Rio saw her—not just as a partner, but as someone worthy of admiration and love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“A circle of fate, our hearts entwine,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Unlocking gates, hidden and divine.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Like constellations that paint the night so wide,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Our hearts are woven, with spirit as our guide.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest tightened, and her vision blurred for a moment. She could feel the weight of Rio’s gaze, even though their eyes hadn’t yet met. It was as though Rio’s words were directed at her very soul, unraveling all the walls she’d carefully built around her heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“She’s the northern star in my endless skies,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Her glow unyielding, where uncertainty lies.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>She asks for nothing, yet gives me it all,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>A love so deep, it catches my fall.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could feel the tears welling up in her eyes, but she blinked them away, unwilling to let them fall. Rio’s love was so loud in this room, soothing her wounds, filling the spaces where doubt used to linger. She could barely comprehend the depth of the love Rio was laying bare for her, the promises woven into every line of the poem. Rio was giving her a part of herself—one Agatha would carry with her always.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“She feels what I cannot feel,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>And in her eyes, I find what makes me real.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Primal nights, where whispers shine,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>I hold Love’s hand in mine.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The entire room seemed to vanish in that moment. It was just Agatha and Rio, the quiet intensity between them undeniable. Agatha could barely hold herself together, every word pulling her closer to the truth Rio had been holding for so long. Rio hadn’t just written this poem—she had poured her heart into it, for Agatha, and Agatha could feel it with every beat of her heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Through many miles of trials and fears,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>I wander high and low, but love perseveres.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>When shadows fall, her light will show,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>The time has come for us to grow.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest swelled with pride, and for the first time in so long, she felt truly seen. Rio’s love was not just a fleeting thing—it was a steady, unbreakable force, something that had the power to carry them both through anything.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>« One day, I’ll marry her, not because I’m told,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>But because with her, I’ve found a home to hold.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>She makes me whole, with fire shining bright,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Her love, a galaxy, setting the stars alight.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha could hardly breathe. Rio was giving her the world in this poem—the truth, the depth of their bond, the promise of forever. Agatha felt a tear escape, tracing a path down her cheek. She couldn’t stop it, not now, so she silently blessed her position in the dark of the stage.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“In the strength of standing beside one so true,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>I find my purpose, my meaning, my view.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>There’s promise in her soul, certain as the sun,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>That one day I’ll be hers, as we become one. »</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, as Rio finished, their eyes met across the stage. Agatha’s heart leapt, her chest swelling with emotions she couldn’t quite name. The applause erupted around them, but Agatha’s hands didn’t join the others; instead, they remained pressed firmly against her chest, where her heart was still racing. Her gaze was fixed entirely on Rio, whose eyes had never left her. The look in them told Agatha everything—<em>This is all for you.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a small, graceful bow, acknowledging the audience with a quiet, humbled smile before returning to her seat. Agatha’s eyes followed her every movement, but it was when Rio met her gaze again, briefly but intensely, that her heart skipped a beat. It was a silent exchange, one so filled with meaning that Agatha couldn’t put it into words. Rio didn’t need to say anything more, she had already said it all. Agatha gave a slight nod in Rio’s direction—a simple, almost imperceptible gesture, but it meant everything. <em>I see you. I feel you. I love you.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, the applause, the noise of the event, everything else seemed to fade away. There was only Rio, sitting there, her heart bared for Agatha to see. Agatha could feel the weight of it, a warmth spreading through her chest, as though the entire room had suddenly shrunk, leaving only the two of them. She didn’t care about the rest of the program. All she could think about was Rio and the profound intimacy that had just been shared between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She tore her eyes away only when she realized the next student was ready, waiting by the stage, but her thoughts were still with Rio. She couldn’t help but feel a deep, quiet pride swelling inside her. Rio had done something so bold, so beautiful. And despite the vulnerability of it, Rio hadn’t flinched. She had stood there, so completely herself, and Agatha admired her even more for it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stole another glance at Rio, who was now sitting back in her seat, her posture relaxed, a quiet air of contentment radiating from her. Her gaze was no longer focused on the stage but was now somewhere else, lost in her own thoughts, perhaps reflecting on what she had just shared. Agatha couldn’t help but smile softly to herself, a warmth spreading through her chest as she watched Rio. There was something so breathtakingly honest about her, so effortlessly beautiful, and in that moment, Agatha felt like the luckiest woman in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the next student prepared onstage, arranging an impressive array of instruments to accompany his poem, Agatha’s mind began to wander. Lost in thought, she was jolted back to the present when Dr. Graham, one of her colleagues, approached her with a thoughtful expression.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That was a stunning poem,” he remarked, his voice filled with genuine admiration. “I didn’t know Miss Vidal had such a gift. She’s yours, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question caught Agatha off guard. Her heart stuttered for a beat, and she nearly choked on her own breath. She quickly regained her composure, forcing a neutral smile as her mind raced. <em>Mine?</em> The word felt too personal, too loaded, especially after what she had just witnessed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mine?” Agatha repeated, her voice a little too sharp, though she quickly masked her surprise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dr. Graham blinked, apparently unaware of Agatha’s internal turmoil. “Yes, she’s one of your students, isn’t she?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, yes. She is,” Agatha replied, gathering herself as she stood tall, her professional mask slipping back into place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dr. Graham’s eyebrows raised slightly in appreciation. “Lucky you. Had I known, I would’ve fought harder to get her when her old supervisor left.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart gave an involuntary leap at the words, but her face remained calm. She gave a subtle nod, a careful, measured response. “She’s a talented student,” she said, her voice steady, betraying none of the pride that had nearly overwhelmed her. “I’m glad she shared her work tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dr. Graham studied her for a moment longer, his gaze lingering as though trying to peel back the layers of Agatha’s composed exterior. There was a flicker of something in his eyes—perhaps curiosity, perhaps an inkling of something more—but it was gone before Agatha could analyze it too closely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You must be proud,” he said, his tone light, but there was something soft beneath it, an understanding that Agatha couldn’t quite place. It felt almost like a quiet acknowledgment, a recognition of the bond he suspected existed between them, even if neither of them spoke it aloud.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha forced a smile, the edges of her lips tugging up in a way that almost felt automatic. “Of course. She’s a brilliant individual.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Inside, however, the words <em>brilliant individual</em> didn’t feel like enough. Rio’s poem had been so much more than brilliance. It had been raw, unguarded, a vulnerable offering of herself in front of an entire room full of strangers. Agatha hadn’t expected that—didn’t know Rio had been capable of exposing that much of herself so openly. But Rio had stood tall, her voice steady, open for the world to see, and Agatha’s heart had swelled with admiration. It had been a declaration, a love letter wrapped in verse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Dr. Graham moved away to engage with his another colleague standing in the wings, Agatha felt her gaze drifting back toward the audience, toward Rio. There she was, sitting quietly, her posture relaxed, yet there was a glow about her that radiated quiet confidence—a confidence Agatha knew had been hard-earned. She was done for tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the last student finished reading and the applause began to die down, Agatha’s gaze swept over the room one more time. She spotted Rio standing near the exit, lingering in the crowd as people began to slowly make their way out. She knew she couldn’t embrace her or speak openly, not with all the eyes in the room, but the pull between them was undeniable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha moved through the dispersing crowd, her heart racing with a sense of urgency, eager to meet Rio. The moment their eyes met, a silent understanding passed between them, but Agatha knew the boundaries of the situation. Not here, not with everyone watching. The public persona they both maintained at school was still in place. But even so, the need to be near her, to close that distance, was overwhelming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Every step she took brought her closer, her pulse loud in her ears. She wasn’t sure what she felt more—anticipation or the desire to be near Rio, to be alone with her, away from the eyes of the world. It didn’t matter. All that mattered was the space between them closing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, she reached Rio, who was still standing there, her back slightly turned but her body language open, waiting. Agatha stood close, but not too close—just enough to maintain the pretense of normalcy, the illusion of distance. They both understood the rules, and yet, in the quiet hum of the room, it felt as though the world outside them had faded completely.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in, her breath warm against Rio’s ear, her voice soft and intimate, reiterating the promise she had already made. “I’ll marry you,” she whispered, the quiet intensity in her voice burning brighter than ever, a surge of emotion rising within her. “I’ll marry you, one day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile was slow but warm, her cheeks flushing as she met Agatha’s gaze. The joy in Rio’s gaze was undeniable, and Agatha felt her own heart swell with something akin to reverence. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her voice barely audible. “I know,” she simply whispered back, as though the words didn’t need to be said aloud for either of them to believe them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile was the answer Agatha had longed for, the unspoken promise between them shining brighter than the stars that had inspired Rio’s words. They didn’t need to say anything else. In that moment, they both knew. Their love was already written in the stars.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that night, after the event had ended and they had retreated to the privacy of their home, Agatha lingered in the doorway of their bedroom, her thoughts still swirling around Rio’s poem.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio entered the room, still wearing the purple dress she had chosen for the occasion, Agatha couldn’t stop herself. She crossed the space between them in a few quick strides, her arms reaching out to pull Rio into her embrace. The moment their bodies met, Agatha’s chest tightened in a mixture of relief and affection, the weight of the night lifting as she felt the familiar warmth of Rio against her. Rio’s soft exhale brushed against her ear, the sound grounding Agatha in a way nothing else could. She couldn’t help but smile, feeling an overwhelming sense of safety in the privacy of their shared space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You,” Agatha began, her voice light with teasing, though there was a deep affection woven into every word, “are such a mystery sometimes. You spend days hiding your notebook, sneaking off to write… and then you go and share <em>something like that</em> with an entire room full of people.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, still wrapped in the afterglow of the evening, felt her cheeks flush. She pulled back slightly, trying to hide the small smile that threatened to spread across her face, her eyes bright and a little embarrassed. “I didn’t want to say anything until it was ready,” she explained softly, her voice quieter now, edged with a nervousness that only made Agatha want to pull her closer. “I was… unsure about sharing something so personal. But… I couldn’t keep it to myself any longer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart softened at Rio’s words, and she pulled her in closer, her hand gently cupping the back of Rio’s head. “You were incredible tonight. The poem—” She paused, searching for the right words. “It was beautiful. I don’t think I’ve ever been moved by anything the way I was by what you shared. You captured something in it that… that I can’t even put into words. It was so much more than just words on a page.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes fluttered closed, the heat of Agatha’s praise making her heart race in the best way. She hadn’t expected Agatha to respond like this, so fully, so deeply. She’d been nervous about her vulnerability, about the way the words would be received in such a public setting. But hearing Agatha’s praise made all the uncertainty worthwhile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I wanted you to know,” Rio admitted, her voice barely above a whisper as she looked up at Agatha, “how much you mean to me. I wanted you to know that I’m not afraid of… of <em>us</em>, and that I see a future with you. I’m not just writing about someone. I’m writing about <em>you</em>—about <em>us</em>.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart skipped a beat. She kissed Rio’s forehead gently, her lips lingering for a moment, her hands brushing tenderly over Rio’s back. “I know, my love,” Agatha murmured, her voice thick with emotion. “I know. You don’t have to tell me for me to feel it. But hearing you say it… it means more than you could ever know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the night deepened, Agatha and Rio laid together in their bed, the soft glow of the bedside lamp casting a gentle light across the room. The events of the evening had left them both feeling a quiet euphoria, a feeling of connection that lingered in the air between them. The poem, the words that Rio had shared so bravely, rested between them on the covers, the open notebook lying on the bed, the pages soft under Agatha’s touch, as if it held a part of Rio’s soul within it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took the notebook into her hands again, her fingers tracing the edges of the pages as if she couldn’t quite get enough of the poem. Her gaze shifted to Rio, lying on her stomach beside her, propped up on her elbows, still flushedwith the joy and nervousness of the evening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let me read it again,” Agatha murmured softly, her voice steady and warm, as she flipped to the page where Rio had written the poem. Rio nodded, her eyes soft, the kind of look that only Agatha could ever bring out in her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha cleared her throat softly, the words already familiar but no less beautiful. As she read, her voice low and full of emotion, she let each line sink in, savoring the meaning behind every word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha read, Rio’s gaze never wavered from her, her eyes locked on Agatha’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha finished the last line, she found herself silent for a moment, her voice thick with emotion that she hadn’t quite been able to express before. The words were so powerful, so raw, and hearing them out loud again even if in her own voice, from Rio’s own heart, felt like a gift—one she would cherish forever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, watching Agatha’s reaction, felt a twinge of vulnerability, but the warmth in Agatha’s eyes soothed her, calming her fears.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a small, shy smile, Rio reached over, her fingers trembling ever so slightly as she gently took the page from her notebook. She handled it with care, as if it were a delicate treasure, something too precious to rush. Slowly, deliberately, she tore it out, the sound of the paper releasing from the binding almost too loud in the quiet room. She folded it gently, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s, before extending it to her, the original handwritten version of the poem.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I want you to have it,” Rio said softly, her voice barely above a whisper, the words rich with meaning. “I want you to <em>keep</em>it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes widened slightly, her heart swelling as she took the page from Rio’s hands. The weight of the gesture was not lost on her—it was more than just words on paper. It was a piece of Rio’s heart, and now, Agatha was entrusted with it, to keep it forever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha kissed Rio’s forehead, her voice barely above a whisper. “Thank you,” Agatha whispered, her voice thick with emotion, barely above a breath. “I’ll keep this forever, Rio. I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, they simply held each other, the world outside completely irrelevant in the presence of their shared warmth. Agatha’s hands rested over the page, still held close to her heart, as she let the quiet settle between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio lifted her head slightly to meet Agatha’s gaze, her expression soft but intense. “Do you think we’re ready? Ready to make all of this real? I mean, we’re already real—this, us—but… I guess I’m asking if you think we can make this permanent.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened even more, her fingers gently cupping Rio’s face as she looked at her with absolute certainty. “We already are real, Rio. In every possible way. And yes, I think we’re ready. I think we’ve been ready for a long time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes shimmered as she leaned into Agatha’s touch, her lips parting just slightly. “I love you,” she whispered, the words feeling like the most natural thing in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s response was immediate, her voice warm, steady, and full of affection. “I love you too, Rio.” She ran her thumb gently over Rio’s cheek, her gaze softening with the unspoken understanding that this was real, this was them—unshakable, undeniable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know what to do then,” Rio said, her voice dropping lower, playful and teasing. The cheeky grin tugging at her lips only deepened the affectionate warmth that swelled between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help the small chuckle that escaped her, the sound filled with tenderness and a knowing fondness. She leaned in just a little closer, her lips hovering near Rio’s ear as her fingers continued to gently trace the curve of Rio’s jaw. “Oh, I do, love,” Agatha said softly, her breath warm against Rio’s skin. “I’m just waiting for the right time.” Her voice held a hint of mischief, a gentle promise of things to come. “Those things take time, you know. If you want them to be perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shivered slightly at the closeness, the weight of Agatha’s words settling comfortably in her chest. The teasing, the playful push and pull, only made her want Agatha more. But she also understood the weight behind Agatha’s words—the idea that some moments, the most important ones, deserved to be savored, to be nurtured until they were as flawless as their love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Perfect, huh?” Rio murmured, her voice low but full of longing. “Well, I guess we do deserve the perfect moment, don’t we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened at Rio’s words, her heart fluttering with affection. “We deserve all of it, Rio. All the time, all the moments… all the perfection in the world. But what we have right now? This is already more than I ever dreamed of.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, the two of them settled back into the soft covers of the bed, the poem now resting safely between them. Rio nestled close, her head on Agatha’s chest as the room grew darker, the only sound the quiet rhythm of their breathing. Agatha held the page close to her, childishly putting it under her pillow for now, knowing that it wasn’t just the poem that made this moment so precious—it was the love between them, something that could never be captured in words alone, but something she would treasure forever, just like the woman falling asleep in her arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The sound of Agatha’s heels was sharp and deliberate, echoing through the tiled corridor as she exited the lecture theater. The hum of her second-year students’ chatter faded into the distance, and she allowed herself a brief moment to feel satisfied. The lecture had gone well, her thoughts were still on their evolving grasp of literary theory, and she was already mentally cataloging how she’d tweak certain sections for the next class. But as she reached for her phone in the inner pocket of her blazer, she noticed the missed call notification flashing ominously.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her brow furrowed. Missed calls in the middle of the day were never a good sign. She tapped the voicemail icon, pausing in a quiet alcove by the window. The recorded message was short but effective at spiking her stress.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is Westview Elementary calling to inform you that there’s been an electricity issue, and we’re asking all parents to come and pick up their children as soon as possible. We apologize for the inconvenience.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a long, slow breath, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Perfect,” she muttered, sarcasm dripping from the word. It wasn’t as if she had an entire afternoon of lectures to manage, or meetings to attend, or office hours to be present for. But, of course, parenting didn’t wait for convenient moments.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sliding her phone back into her pocket, she adjusted the strap of her leather bag and set off for the parking lot. Her footsteps quickened as she walked, the familiar rhythm of her heels on tile helping her focus. She tried to work out the logistics in her head: pick Nicky up, keep him entertained in her office until her next class, and then…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her thoughts faltered as she realized there was no ideal solution. Normally, Rio would step in, but Rio was one of her students today. And there was no way she was leaving Nicky unsupervised in her office for an hour-long lecture. That only left one option, and it wasn’t one she was thrilled about.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha climbed into her car, the cool leather seat creaking as she settled in and buckled up. Her hands tightened on the steering wheel as she started the engine, her mind still ticking through potential complications. Bringing Nicky to class meant keeping him occupied and making sure he didn’t accidentally reveal their carefully guarded “secret”. It wasn’t that Agatha didn’t trust him—he was a remarkably clever six-year-old—but six-year-olds weren’t exactly renowned for their subtlety.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her lips quirked into a reluctant smile as she imagined the look on Rio’s face when she would see Nicky in class. The two of them adored each other, but keeping up the pretense of a casual babysitter relationship in front of the other students would be… interesting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha arrived at Westview Elementary, the parking lot was already bustling with parents picking up their children. Agatha stepped out of her car, her gaze immediately sweeping the scene, her sharp eyes scanning the crowd until they landed on her son.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky was perched on a bench near the school entrance, his small backpack resting next to him, the fabric worn in the corners from weeks of use. He was swinging his legs with abandon, the lightness of his mood contagious even from a distance. The moment his eyes found her, his face broke into an enormous grin, and without a second of hesitation, he jumped up from the bench, waving both arms above his head as though he feared she might not see him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama!” His voice rang out, a bright, clear call that cut through the busy hum of the crowd.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a smile despite the mild chaos around her. She made her way over to him, her pace quick but steady. “Hello, sweetheart,” she greeted, as he came barreling into her legs. “Were you waiting long?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shook his head, his curls bouncing with the motion. “Nope! Mrs. Clarke let us color while we waited. But she said we have to go home ‘cause the lights don’t work anymore.” He grabbed his backpack and slung it over one shoulder, clearly unbothered by the unexpected schedule change.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, lucky for you, you’re coming to the university with me today,” Agatha said, brushing a stray curl out of his face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His eyes widened with excitement. “Really? I get to spend the day at your work?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s right,” she confirmed, straightening up and holding out her hand for him to take. “But remember, you’ll need to be on your best behavior. I still have a class to teach.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded enthusiastically, his small hand slipping into hers. “Can I sit in the big chairs in your office?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You can, but only for a little while. I have to take you to class with me later,” she explained as they walked toward the car.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“To your class?” Nicky asked, his voice tinged with curiosity and excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Agatha replied, glancing down at him as they walked. “Promise you’ll be a big boy today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up with pride at the question, and he puffed out his chest dramatically, making a show of being as serious as a six-year-old could be. “I’ll be the best boy!” he declared, his voice high with the excitement of the adventure ahead. “I can’t wait to tell Señor Scratchy all about my day!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t suppress a soft laugh as she helped him into his car seat, her fingers brushing through his unruly curls. “I’m sure Señor Scratchy will be thrilled to hear all about it.” She fastened the straps securely, her eyes soft with affection as she lingered for a moment, looking at her son.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they drove back to the university, Nicky chattered excitedly about all the things he’d seen on his previous visits to the campus. Agatha listened with half an ear, her focus split between the road and mentally preparing for the balancing act of bringing her son into a lecture with a room full of students—one of whom happened to be his other mother.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Today’s going to be interesting,” she muttered under her breath, glancing at Nicky in the rearview mirror. He was practically vibrating with excitement, his cheeks flushed and his eyes bright.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha pulled into the faculty parking lot, she could clearly see Nicky’s grin getting wider and wider. He was craning his neck toward the window, his wide eyes fixed on the campus in front of them. His excitement was almost palpable, and Agatha smiled softly as she parked the car, hearing him let out an excited giggle as she shifted the gear into park.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment the car came to a stop, Nicky was practically bouncing in his seat, his small hands grasping the seatbelt as he unbuckled himself with a burst of energy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama, can I carry my own backpack?” he asked, his voice full of anticipation. His tiny fingers fumbled at the straps, gripping them tightly with an eagerness that made Agatha’s heart warm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, you can,” Agatha replied with a small smile, helping him out of the car and smoothing down his hair. “But remember, stay close to me, alright? Campus isn’t like your school.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll stay right by you, Mama!” Nicky chirped, his eyes shining with a mixture of excitement and determination. With an exaggerated flourish, he swung his backpack over his shoulders like a tiny explorer ready for an adventure, the straps barely fitting over his small frame.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Together, they made their way toward the entrance of the building. The hustle of campus life surrounded them—students chatting, professors carrying stacks of papers, and the sound of footsteps echoing on the paved paths. Agatha kept a protective hand on Nicky’s shoulder, guiding him through the crowd with practiced ease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they approached the main entrance, a familiar voice called out, “Agatha!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Turning with a smile, Agatha saw Dr. Juliet Price, a youngish professor in the English department, walking toward them. Dr. Price was a woman of precise movements and sharp intellect, always with a stack of papers in her hands and her ever-present reading glasses perched just so on the bridge of her nose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good afternoon, Juliet,” Agatha greeted, her tone polite but brisk, her posture shifting slightly to create a protective barrier around Nicky. It wasn’t out of distrust— Juliet was nice - it was more a reflexive instinct to protect her son in unfamiliar surroundings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And who is this little gentleman?” Juliet asked, raising an eyebrow as her sharp eyes moved from Agatha to Nicky, who was standing a bit shyly beside her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is my son, Nicky,” Agatha replied smoothly, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, raised to be a very polite child, tilted his head up at the sound of his name and waved shyly. “Hi.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, aren’t you charming?” Juliet said, her tone softening as she looked at Nicky with a smile that showed her usual no-nonsense exterior was momentarily melted by the sight of the little boy. “What brings you to campus today, young man?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky glanced up at Agatha, his eyes wide, suddenly shy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There was an issue at his school,” Agatha explained, stepping in with ease. “They had to send the kids home early, so he’ll be spending the day with me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How delightful,” Juliet said with a warm chuckle, clearly taken by the idea of a child spending a day on campus. “I’m sure he’ll be the most popular guest we’ve had on campus in a while.” She turned her gaze back to Agatha. “Well, I won’t keep you. Good luck juggling your responsibilities today. And, Nicky, it was a pleasure meeting you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Nicky said politely, flashing her a shy, but genuine smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Juliet walked away, Agatha gave Nicky an approving look, her voice filled with quiet pride. “Good job, sweetheart. You were very polite.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up at the praise, and he beamed up at her. “I’m always polite, Mama,” he said, a confident glint in his eyes. He slipped his hand back into hers, his grip tight and trusting as they continued into the building.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is she your friend, Mama?” Nicky asked, his voice full of curiosity as he looked up at her with wide, innocent eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips twitched with amusement, as she held the building’s door open for Nicky to walk through. “She’s my colleague, Nicky,” she replied, the smile softening her features. “That’s a little different from being friends.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh,” Nicky said, his expression one of understanding. He nodded as though the distinction made perfect sense, clearly satisfied with the answer, even if the difference was still a little fuzzy to him. “So she’s like a teacher?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, just like me,” Agatha said, chuckling softly at his thoughtful expression. “And we work together. We help each other out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded sagely, the seriousness of his nod disproportionate to his tiny size. “I think I could be a teacher too,” he said matter-of-factly. “I could teach about dragons and superheroes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughedl. “I think you’d make a wonderful teacher, sweetheart. I’m sure the students would learn a lot from you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, they continued down the corridor, Nicky’s small feet tapping lightly against the floor, his enthusiasm infectious. Agatha smiled, feeling the warmth of his little presence at her side. Despite the rush of responsibilities awaiting her, this moment—this quiet, tender exchange between them—felt like a perfect little bubble of peace in the chaos of the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once back in her office, Agatha guided Nicky to the small seating area near her desk. She pulled out his favorite dinosaur-themed coloring book and a neatly packed bag of snacks and placed them on the table in front of him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Here you go, sweetheart,” she said, kneeling down to his eye level and meeting his gaze with a soft smile. “I’ve got some notes to prepare for my next lecture, so I’ll need you to keep busy for a little while, alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up with eager enthusiasm as he nodded, already reaching for his crayons with both hands. “Okay, Mama!” he chirped, his voice filled with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She ruffled his hair affectionately before standing and returning to her desk. As she opened her notebook and flipped through the pages, the sound of crayons scratching against paper filled the room. Nicky hummed quietly to himself as he worked, occasionally pausing to sip his juice or inspect his progress.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced up every so often, her gaze softening at the sight of her son happily coloring. She couldn’t help but marvel at how easily he adapted to new situations. Even in a university office surrounded by towering shelves of books and stacks of academic papers, Nicky seemed perfectly content.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A few minutes passed before Nicky’s voice broke the silence. “Look, Mama!” he exclaimed, his voice full of pride. He held up his latest masterpiece, the crayon strokes bright and bold on the page—a vivid green dinosaur surrounded by a swirling rainbow sky. “He’s happy because he has so many friends!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes softened at the sight of the drawing. The rainbow sky, the exuberant dinosaur, the wild creativity—there was something so pure in it. She leaned forward, examining the page with a genuine smile that reached her eyes. “That’s wonderful, darling. You’re so creative. I love it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, his chest puffing out just a little at the praise. “Do you think Mom would like it?” His voice was hopeful, filled with the kind of innocence that only a child could have when it came to showing off their work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart skipped a beat at the mention of Rio. It was such a casual comment, one that felt as natural as any other, but it still hit her in a way she hadn’t anticipated. Rio—her love, her partner, the other half of their little family. The way Nicky mentioned her so freely was both a comfort and a reminder of their carefully guarded secret, at least in this environment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She would love it, baby,” Agatha replied softly, her voice thick with affection. She walked over and crouched down next to him, her hand resting on his tiny shoulder, her tone becoming gentle but firm. “But remember, sweetheart, we have to keep our secret while we’re here. You can’t talk about Rio being anything more than a friend who babysits sometimes, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s expression faltered slightly, his brow furrowing in confusion, but he nodded obediently, his small face falling just a little. “Okay, Mama. I won’t tell.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha kissed his forehead, her lips lingering for a moment, feeling the warmth of his skin against hers. “Thank you. You’re being very brave,” she said quietly, a wave of tenderness washing over her. She held him for a moment, her heart swelling with love and a quiet pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Satisfied that Nicky was settled, Agatha returned to her desk to finalize her lecture notes. As she wrote, the faint sound of Nicky humming filled the room, a comforting background melody to her thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a while, Agatha glanced at the clock on her desk and realized with a start that it was almost time for her next class. She closed her notebook with a soft snap, her fingers briefly brushing her desk as she stood. Straightening her pants with a smooth motion, she turned to Nicky, who had been busy flipping through his coloring book, completely absorbed in his own world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, Nicky,” she said, her voice soft yet purposeful, “we’ve got to head to my lecture now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s head shot up at the sound of her voice, and his eyes widened in excitement, his face lighting up as though he had forgotten their earlier conversation. “I get to go to your class?” he asked, his voice brimming with wonder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her heart warming at his enthusiasm. “Yes, you’ll be my student today,” she said, crouching down to his level and helping him gather his things. She took extra care as she slid his dinosaur-themed coloring book back into his bag.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded solemnly, his small face set in the serious expression he always wore when he was determined to follow through on something. “I’ll be good, Mama. Promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave him a soft pat on the head, then glanced around to make sure she had everything she needed. She grabbed her bag and Nicky’s belongings, her movements swift and practiced. She paused for a moment, the mischievous spark in her eye giving her away as she reached for her phone. Her fingers hovered over the screen as she typed a quick message to Rio, savoring the anticipation of what she knew would be a fun little surprise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Agatha: </strong> <em>Heads up, there will be a surprise guest in today’s class.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She didn’t add any more details, letting the mystery of the message linger for a moment. A playful grin tugged at her lips as she imagined Rio trying to decipher the cryptic message, the curiosity already likely gnawing at her. The reply came swiftly, as expected.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Rio: </strong> <em>What kind of surprise? Should I be nervous? </em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, pocketing her phone without replying. Let her wonder, she thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Turning back to Nicky, Agatha knelt down to adjust the straps on his backpack, making sure they sat just right on his small shoulders. She met his gaze and smiled, her voice soft but firm. “Alright, little one, remember what we talked about?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded enthusiastically but then paused, his brow furrowing slightly as he seemed to think for a moment. “No talking about Mom, even if she’s here. It’s our secret,” he recited, his little voice serious but filled with pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave him an approving smile. “Exactly. And what else?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He counted off the points on his small fingers, his face scrunching in concentration as he made sure to cover every rule. “Be quiet, sit still, and don’t interrupt,” he said, his tone matching hers in seriousness, as if he were preparing for a big mission.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good boy,” Agatha said with a soft kiss to his forehead, the tenderness in her gesture contrasting with the playful light in her eyes. She straightened up, smoothing out her skirt once more and taking his hand in hers. “Now let’s go impress a room full of college students, shall we?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face broke into a wide, gleeful grin. His excitement bubbled over, and he nearly skipped in place as they headed for the door. “I can’t wait, Mama! I’m going to be the best student ever!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but chuckle at his enthusiasm. The idea of Nicky, small and wide-eyed, walking into a lecture hall full of college students, was a source of quiet amusement for her. But more than that, it was a reminder of how special these little moments with him were—how even in the midst of her busy academic life, she could share a piece of her world with him. Nicky was thrilled, and so was she, in her own way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha and Nicky made their way through the university hallways, the bustle of student life seemed to slow around them. Colleagues and students alike couldn’t help but cast curious glances in their direction. Some wore expressions of surprise, others amusement, but most simply smiled warmly, offering friendly waves to Nicky as he walked alongside his mother. Nicky, a little shy in this new environment, returned the gestures with small, hesitant waves, his cheeks flushed with the attention but clearly enjoying the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they neared the lecture hall, Nicky tugged gently on Agatha’s hand, his voice soft and full of curiosity. “Mama, do you think Rio will like my surprise?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced down at him, her lips curving into a secretive smile that only Nicky could see. She took a moment before responding, savoring the playful tension in the air. “Oh, I think she’ll be <em>very</em> surprised,” she said, her voice low and teasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes sparkled with excitement at the thought of his surprise reaching his mom, a mixture of anticipation and eagerness settling on his small face. He bounced slightly on his toes, the energy from being in such a new and exciting place still evident in his every movement. “I can’t wait for her to see me, Mama,” he said, his tone almost conspiratorial as though sharing a secret mission.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pushed open the door to the lecture hall, her hand gently guiding Nicky into the room. The moment the door swung wide, a wave of murmurs rippled through the students who were already seated. Eyes flicked toward the entrance, some surprised, others curious. The sight of their usually composed professor—calm, controlled, and unfailingly professional—now accompanied by a small child in tow, was an unexpected sight. Some students exchanged amused glances, eyebrows raised in silent questions, while others couldn’t help but break into broad grins, clearly intrigued by the sudden change in their typical classroom dynamic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, ever poised, strode confidently to the front of the room, the rhythmic clicking of her heels punctuating the otherwise hushed atmosphere. Her posture was as impeccable as ever, exuding an air of authority that seemed to say, <em>This is still my classroom, and nothing has changed,</em> even with the new addition at her side. Once at the podium, she turned to face the class, her hand still resting lightly but protectively on Nicky’s small shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She cleared her throat, a small smile playing at the corner of her lips, before speaking with her usual steady, commanding voice. “Class,” she began, the words clear and confident, but there was a faint undertone of dry humor in her tone. “This is Nicholas, our very special helper for the day. Due to unforeseen circumstances, he’ll be joining us for today’s lecture.” She paused for effect, letting the class’s curiosity simmer. “So, I expect you all to be on your best behavior. Be nice to him, or he’ll have no trouble telling me all your secrets.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A ripple of laughter swept through the room as the students caught the humor in Agatha’s words, the tension of surprise easing into a more relaxed atmosphere. Even Agatha allowed herself a small smirk, a rare moment of lightness amidst the usual academic rigor. Nicky, standing proudly beside her, surveyed the room full of adults with wide, unblinking eyes, clearly basking in the attention, and looking for one specific pair of dark eyes. His chest puffed out slightly, as if he, too, was suddenly aware of how important this moment was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the room settled, Rio, seated a few rows back, had frozen for just a split second. The words had registered, and in that brief pause, her eyes widened ever so slightly. <em>Nicky</em>. She blinked in surprise, her mind quickly processing the unexpected revelation. A smile tugged at the corners of her lips, a soft, knowing curve that spoke volumes of her quiet amusement. So, this was the surprise guest Agatha had been teasing her with. Nicky, their son, was here—right here—in the middle of a university lecture.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without missing a beat, Rio subtly switched her seat, moving to an open spot near the aisle with an empty chair beside her. She knew Agatha well enough to anticipate where she would want Nicky to sit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes flickered briefly to Rio, her expression unreadable but her gaze lingering just long enough to confirm Rio’s silent gesture. She turned to Nicky, bending slightly to murmur something to him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, buddy. You’re going to sit right over there, next to…” She hesitated for just a fraction of a second before saying, “Miss Vidal. She’ll help you out if you need anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up with excitement at the mention of her name. “Okay, Mama!” His enthusiasm was palpable, and before Agatha could even offer a reply, Nicky was already darting toward Rio with an energy that almost made him seem too small for his own eagerness. Agatha watched him go, her eyes rolling in mild exasperation at his uninhibited joy. It was both endearing and a little overwhelming at times, but Agatha wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As expected, Nicky slid into the seat next to Rio, his movements quick but carefully measured. He immediately leaned in toward her, his small hand brushing against hers with a sense of quiet familiarity, as though the touch was a shared secret between them. A sly, conspiratorial smile curled on his mouths as he brought a finger to his lips, the universal gesture for silence, but in their shared language, it meant so much more. It wasn’t just about keeping quiet in class—it was a promise. A promise to guard what mattered most, to hold tightly to their little world, and, more than anything, to protect her. To keep Rio safe, in his own small but fierce way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, the sound a mix of amusement and tenderness. To anyone else, it might have seemed like an innocent gesture, a playful nod to the need for silence. But she knew better. That finger to his lips wasn’t just about quieting a classroom or respecting the moment. It was his promise to keep them—to keep her—their bond, their love, their family, safe and sacred.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She leaned in just enough to brush her lips against his temple, her voice low and warm. “Our secret,” she murmured, matching his smile. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi, Miss Rio,” Nicky said, his voice a hushed whisper, almost as if speaking too loudly might break the magic of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi, Nicky,” Rio replied, her tone equally soft, but there was no hiding the affection that colored her words. She resisted the strong urge to ruffle his hair or scoop him up into a hug, instead, she turned her attention to the front of the room, giving Agatha the space to begin the lecture.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The murmurs had died down, but a few students still cast curious glances at Nicky, clearly charmed by his presence. Agatha ignored them entirely and launched seamlessly into the day’s material.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the lecture began, Nicky stayed remarkably well-behaved.  Every so often, he would glance up at Rio, his face breaking into a shy grin as if to check in, just for reassurance, or he would quietly whisper a question about what Agatha was saying. To the casual observer, it seemed entirely normal for a child to gravitate toward a kind, familiar face, even if said familiar was in fact his other mom - the one person they had to keep hidden, the one person who was more than just a name, a whisper in the background.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood tall behind the podium, her gaze sweeping over the class before she began her lecture. She could see Nicky sitting quietly next to Rio, his legs swinging under his chair, watching his Mama with wide-eyed curiosity. Every now and then, his attention would flicker to the students around him, who offered small smiles and amused glances.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Now,” Agatha said, her voice steady, yet strangely gentle, “before we dive into today’s topic, I think it’s time we put our special helper to good use.” She turned to Nicky with a smile that softened her usual sharp expression, the motherly affection in her eyes only visible to those who knew her best. “Mr. Harkness, would you be so kind as to help me out for a moment?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes lit up at the sound of his name, and he sat up straighter in his chair, excitement palpable. “What do you need, Mama?” he asked, his voice full of eager enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile widened just slightly as she handed him a small stack of papers. “Take these,” she instructed, “and pass them down each row, okay? Start over here.” She gestured to the row nearest her, where students were already leaning forward in anticipation of the unexpected spectacle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Got it!” Nicky said confidently, hopping down from his seat with an unrestrained bounce. He carried the papers with the careful attention of someone who took his new responsibility seriously, moving down the first row and handing them out one by one. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re doing great, Nicky,” Rio whispered as he passed her. Her voice was warm, full of affection, and Nicky flashed her a grin, the same lighthearted joy radiating from him. He handed her a paper with a quiet “Thanks” before continuing on his way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched from the podium, her professional mask slipping just enough to reveal a flicker of pride in her son. As Nicky finished his task and returned to his seat beside Rio, she gave him a small nod of approval.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky returned to his seat, his eyes bright with accomplishment, Agatha gave him a small, approving nod. “Excellent work,” she said, her tone returning to its usual authority, though there was a hint of warmth beneath it. “Now, let’s get back to business.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turned her attention back to the class, and with a deep breath, she seamlessly dove into the day’s material. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha continued her lecture, the students remained engaged with her words, but it was clear that the presence of her son added a new, unexpected layer to the classroom dynamic. Agatha was really professional, but she couldn’t resist involving Nicky in small, playful ways to keep him engaged and make him feel included in the learning environment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At one point, her voice broke the steady rhythm of the lecture with a warm but purposeful command. “Nicholas,” she called, turning her gaze toward him, “can you help me count how many students are in each row? Start from the back and work your way forward.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without hesitation, Nicky sprang into action, his small legs carrying him energetically through the aisles between desks. His eyes narrowed in concentration as he wove through the rows, counting heads with the meticulous care of a little professional. His brows furrowed, his tiny lips murmuring numbers under his breath as he worked. The students, already charmed by his presence, couldn’t help but chuckle softly at his earnest expression. Even Agatha’s usually sharp, commanding demeanor seemed softened in the face of her son’s unwavering determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When he finally returned to the front, his little chest puffed with pride, Nicky looked up at Agatha, his voice bright with accomplishment. “There are eleven rows, Mama!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile was faint but genuine as she gave him a nod of approval. “Excellent observation,” she praised, her tone affectionate yet measured. “See? You’ve just demonstrated the importance of precision and attention to detail. A lesson for all of you,” she added, her voice shifting back to its usual authoritative cadence as she swept her gaze across the room, her eyes sharp with that familiar intensity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The students couldn’t help but chuckle at the way Agatha had seamlessly tied a child’s simple task into an academic point. For a moment, the room felt lighter, the heavy atmosphere of academic seriousness momentarily tempered by the warmth of motherly pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From her seat, Rio couldn’t suppress a small smile as she watched Nicky bask in the praise. His face glowed with the satisfaction of being seen and heard by his mother, and it was clear that every bit of recognition made him feel more important in this world of academia. Though the room buzzed with quiet curiosity about the dynamic between Dr. Harkness, her son, and the oddly familiar way he interacted with Rio, no one dared to question it outright.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Except one student, sensing the opportunity for more, who leaned forward and asked, “He seems really comfortable with you, Rio. How come you know him so well?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, who had now been quietly guiding Nicky through a maze of intricate coloring pages, heard the question out of the corner of her ear and stiffened just for a second. The casual nature of the inquiry masked a more probing curiosity, and she knew she had to handle it with care. She kept her focus on Nicky for a moment longer, then turned her head slightly to meet the student’s gaze with a calm, composed expression.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a soft chuckle, she replied, “Oh, I babysit for them sometimes. You know, just helping out when they need a hand.” Her smile was warm, even if a little forced, as she hoped the casual tone would be enough to quell any further digging into their personal lives. She leaned closer to Nicky, redirecting her focus back to him, hoping the student would let the matter rest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Thankfully, Nicky, in his innocent world, seemed oblivious to the subtle tension in the air. His attention was entirely consumed by his coloring book as he worked diligently, shading in an image with quiet concentration. Rio silently sent a prayer into the air, hoping he wouldn’t say anything else that could expose more than what was necessary.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As if on cue, Nicky glanced up at Rio, offering a bright, conspiratorial smile. “I’m doing good, right, Mo… Miss Rio?” he asked, his voice a little too loud in the quiet room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, offering a quick, subtle pat to his head as she whispered, “You’re doing great, buddy.” She shot a quick glance at the students around them, relieved to see no one else seemed to have caught the slight slip.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky returned to his quiet work, occasionally flashing Rio a smile as she leaned over to help him with a particularly tricky part of his picture. Her gentle touch on his head and the occasional whisper of encouragement made it clear how much care and affection they shared, but the other students only saw what they wanted to see—a friendly, slightly protective relationship between the two.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the final minutes of the lecture ticked away, Agatha watched from the podium, her professional demeanor never faltering, even though a part of her was deeply content with how well everything was going. Rio’s ability to keep Nicky engaged while maintaining her composure in such a public space and still taking her own notes only deepened Agatha’s admiration for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the bell rang, signaling the end of the class, the students began to pack up their things, their eyes occasionally drifting toward Nicky as he sat quietly by Rio’s side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, that was a nice change,” one of the students remarked, packing away her notebook. “Dr. Harkness’s son is adorable. Looks like Rio is really good with kids.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Another student, nodding thoughtfully as he adjusted his bag, added, “Yeah, she’s so chill. It’s kind of cute, actually. I mean, seeing Rio like that… you wouldn’t expect it, you know?” His eyes softened as he glanced at Nicky and then back at Rio, clearly noting the calm and almost maternal energy she exuded around the child.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, hearing the comments but choosing to stay silent, smiled warmly at Nicky, her heart swelling with an unspoken affection. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once the last student had filed out of the classroom, Agatha called for Nicky and Rio to follow her back to her office. As the door clicked shut behind them, Nicky wasted no time—his little feet thudding against the floor as he bolted toward Rio. His face was alight with excitement, and there was a glimmer of mischief in his eyes, as if he couldn’t wait any longer for the moment he had been holding in all through the class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without hesitation, he threw his arms around her, practically jumping into her embrace. His smile was wide and uncontainable, and he whispered in a conspiratorial tone, “Do I have to keep pretending now?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a soft laugh, her heart swelling at the sight of him so eager. “Not here, buddy,” she whispered back, lifting him effortlessly onto her hip. “Here, we’re safe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, leaning against her desk, couldn’t help but smile at the moment. The office was quieter now, the usual buzz of papers and lectures replaced by the warmth of this small, private exchange. Rio was gentle with Nicky, her hand resting on his back as she steadied him on her hip, and Agatha couldn’t quite hide the pride that swelled in her chest at the sight. It was a rare privilege, these small windows into their life together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, still nestled in the comfort of Rio’s embrace, seemed content with the arrangement. He nuzzled into her shoulder, his tiny hands curling around the fabric of her shirt. “I was really good in class, huh?” he asked, his voice muffled against her skin, a hint of childlike pride in his words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled down at him, her gaze soft and full of affection. “You were perfect, sweetheart,” she replied, her voice a quiet, loving reassurance. “Best little helper ever.” Nicky beamed up at her, his trust in her as evident as his joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, still standing by her desk, glanced over at the two of them with a knowing smile. She walked over, her gaze softening. “He was, wasn’t he?” she said, leaning over to give Nicky a quick kiss on the top of his head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> “Alright, you two,” she said, her voice light but firm. “We’ll be picking up your things and heading out to the dance center soon. But first, I need a little bit of quiet to get my work done.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, still holding Nicky, raised an eyebrow with a playful smile. “We’ll give you all the quiet you need, love. Don’t worry,” she said, giving Agatha a wink. “We’ll be out of your hair soon enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Turning to Nicky, Rio continued with a grin, “What do you say we go get a snack while Mama’s working?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up immediately, his eyes sparkling with excitement. “I want a chocolate bar, you know the kind I like!” he cheered, his little hands clasped together in enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, the sound a musical and full expression of her amusement. “You got it, dude. Maybe we’ll even bring something back for Mama!” she teased, her voice warm with affection. Nicky bounced in her arms, his small legs kicking with barely contained excitement, and Rio couldn’t help but feel a rush of tenderness toward him. This was the simple joy she had come to cherish—these moments of unspoken happiness, shared between the three of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio adjusted Nicky on her hip and turned toward the door, Agatha couldn’t resist teasing them both. She smirked and gave them a sideways glance. “Well, I must say, you both did an excellent job today. I might even hire Rio as a permanent babysitter at this rate,” she said with a raised eyebrow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, who had been happily resting his head on Rio’s shoulder, immediately shot back, as if he’d been affronted. “Rio’s not a babysitter!” he declared, his little face scrunching up in determination a small puff of air escaping from his mouth as though the idea was absolutely absurd. “She’s my mom!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk deepened, and her heart softened at the sound of Nicky’s voice. It was so sincere, so matter-of-fact, that it struck her straight in the chest. She chuckled, the sound warm and affectionate. “Right, right,” she agreed, raising her hands in mock surrender. “Rio’s your mom, not a babysitter. My mistake.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, still holding Nicky with ease, shot Agatha a playful look over her shoulder. Her lips curled into a soft, knowing smile, one that was full of affection. “Careful, love,” she teased, her voice light and teasing. “You wouldn’t want to upset the little guy. He’s got a very clear opinion on the matter.” She gently adjusted Nicky, her touch as tender as ever, making sure he was comfortable on her hip.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, clearly pleased with the attention he was receiving, puffed out his chest proudly, as if the declaration of his status as Rio’s son was the most important thing in the world. His eyes sparkled with certainty as he flashed a wide, proud grin. “I do!” he said emphatically, his voice filled with such joy. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, the sound full of warmth, echoing around the room and making the air feel lighter than it had all day. It was a beautiful sound—one that always seemed to come more easily when Rio and Nicky were around. “Well, we all love her, don’t we?” Agatha said, her voice softening as she gazed at Rio. Her gaze lingered for just a moment longer than usual, the quiet intensity of her love for the woman standing before her coming through clearly in the silence that followed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio winked at Agatha, her smile tender and affectionate as she shifted Nicky in her arms. “Of course, you do,” Rio said, her voice playful but filled with warmth. “Good thing she loves you too, then!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, in the meantime, was practically bursting with excitement, his small frame bouncing with energy at the thought of their upcoming snack break. “Chocolate bar!” he cheered, his words full of pure, unrestrained joy. His little legs kicked in the air, and his grin could have lit up the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, though she tried to mask the fondness she felt for the little scene unfolding before her. “Go now,” she said with a smile, trying to refocus on the work scattered in front of her. “I’ll be fine here. Take your time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot Agatha a wink before putting Nicky down, who bounced eagerly at the idea of a little treat. “We’ll be back before you know it,” Rio said, her voice light as she led Nicky down the hall.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once they were outside the office, Rio leaned down and whispered to Nicky, “What should we get Mama? Something sweet, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes sparkled as he grinned. “Something chocolate! Mama loves chocolate.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled at his enthusiasm, her heart full. “Chocolate it is, then.” They made their way to a small café in the building where Rio had seen Agatha grab coffee before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The café was quiet, almost serene, tucked away in a corner of the building with soft lighting and a few small tables scattered around. It was the kind of place that felt like an oasis in the middle of a busy day. Rio and Nicky made their way to the counter, where they picked out a selection of pastries—some filled with rich, dark chocolate, others drizzled with melted chocolate or dusted with powdered sugar. They couldn’t go wrong with a mix of treats, and Rio could already imagine Agatha’s smile when she’d see them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With their pastries carefully put in a small box, Rio and Nicky sat down at a cozy table in the corner, the aroma of chocolate and coffee hanging in the air. Nicky practically bounced in his seat, eager to dive into his treat, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh at his infectious energy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, already halfway through his chocolate croissant, looked up at Rio with wide eyes of delight. “This is so good, Mom! You have to try one!” he exclaimed, his words muffled by the flaky pastry in his mouth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled. She took a sip of her coffee, then reached for one of the pastries she’d picked out for herself. “It’s pretty good, huh?” she said, watching Nicky’s face light up with each bite.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah! It’s the best! Can we get some more next time?” Nicky asked, his face lighting up with joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, nodding. “Of course, sweetheart. We can get more whenever you want.” She watched him devour the last bite of his pastry, crumbs dotting his face, and her heart swelled with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After maybe half an hour, they returned to Agatha’s office with the box of pastries, the smell of chocolate filling the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached Agatha’s office, Nicky couldn’t contain his excitement. He knocked once on the door, then swung it open, his small voice ringing out with glee. “Mama!” he called, his face glowing with pride. “We got you something!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked up from her papers, smiling softly at the sight of them. “You did? What did you bring me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hopped over to Agatha’s desk, eagerly placing the box of chocolate pastries in front of her. “Here! It’s for you!” he said proudly, then glanced at Rio, his face lighting up with a mixture of mischief and affection. “Mom says chocolate makes everything better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, her heart lightening at the sight of Nicky’s excitement. She reached for one of the pastries, breaking it into pieces before taking a small bite. “Well, I can’t argue with that,” she said, savoring the sweet treat. “Thank you both. This is exactly what I needed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood back and watched the two of them for a moment, her eyes softening with affection. “Thought you could use a little break. You’ve been working hard.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve got the best team,” Agatha said, reaching for Nicky’s hand and pulling him gently into her lap, brushing his hair back from his face. “I’m lucky to have both of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Nicky couldn’t sit still any longer. His energy seemed to be bubbling over as he bounced on his heels, his wide eyes filled with eager anticipation. “Is it time to go to dance class yet?” he asked, his voice nearly vibrating with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, who had just settled back into her seat, smiled at his uncontainable enthusiasm. She’d always admired Nicky’s zest for life. “Not yet, buddy. We’ve still got a little time before class starts,” she said, her voice soft and reassuring. “But don’t worry, we’ll be there soon enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky stared up at Rio, clearly unwilling to wait any longer. “Are you teaching today?” he asked, his eyes wide with hopeful expectation, as if the entire class hinged on her presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yep, I’ll be teaching your class today,” Rio replied, her voice full of warmth. She glanced down at him with affection. “You know I’m always happy to teach you and your friends.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed up at her, his smile wide and proud. “You’re the best teacher ever, Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt her heart swell at the praise, but she kept her voice light and teasing. “Thank you, little man. I’m glad you think so.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky continued to fidget in his chair, Rio took a deep breath, savoring the small moments before they headed to the dance center.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her gaze drifted across the room to Agatha, who was seated at her desk, her focus completely absorbed in the glow of her laptop screen. The faint clicking of keys was a soothing counterpoint to Nicky’s energetic bouncing. Rio studied her for a moment, noting the faint crease of concentration between her brows and the way her lips pressed together ever so slightly as she typed. She looked beautiful, as she always did, but there was something extra endearing about her intensity when she was lost in her work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Unable to resist, Rio leaned over, catching Agatha’s attention with the lightest brush of her fingers on her arm. Before Agatha could fully look up, Rio closed the gap between them and kissed her squarely on the lips. The kiss was soft but deliberate, quick but filled with affection and mischief. Agatha blinked in surprise, her eyes wide for just a heartbeat before they softened, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, hello,” Agatha murmured, her voice tinged with amusement as she tilted her head to look at Rio more closely. “What was that for?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, her eyes sparkling with playful warmth. “Just reminding you how much I love you,” she said lightly, but her voice held an unmistakable depth of sincerity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head as she returned her attention to her work, though the smile lingered on her lips. Rio leaned back in her seat, her heart lighter than it had been all day, when—</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Moooom, can we go now? I’m ready to dance!” Nicky’s voice rang out, cutting through the moment with all the subtlety of a firecracker. He was practically bouncing out of his chair, his excitement impossible to contain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, the sound warm and affectionate. She reached out to ruffle Nicky’s hair, her smile widening at his eagerness. “Alright, alright, hold your horses, little man,” she teased. “Let me grab our stuff, and we’ll head out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t wait for further confirmation. He jumped out of his chair, his small fists pumping in the air as he exclaimed, “Yes! It’s time to dance!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio finally stood up, holding her hand out to him. “Alright, sweet boy. Let’s go. It’s time for you to show off those dance moves.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky jumped out of his chair, his energy practically radiating from him. “Yay!” he shouted, before running over to kiss his Mama good bye.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky and Rio were about to head out the door, Agatha looked up from her desk and caught their attention. With a warm smile, she reminded them, “I’ll pick you both up later to go home, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky gave a thumbs-up, his face lighting up with the excitement of his upcoming class. “Okay, Mama! See you later!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled at Agatha, grateful for the small but meaningful gesture. “Thanks, love,” she said softly, her voice filled with affection. “We’ll see you soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her expression tender. “You two have fun. I’ll be waiting to take you home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, Rio and Nicky waved as they left the office, the door snapping shut behind them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">                  (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio parked the car outside the dance center, glancing in the rearview mirror at Nicky, who was practically bouncing in his seat. His little sneakers tapped against the floor as he swung his legs, his energy spilling over after a day full of adventure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And did you see how Mama asked me to hand out the papers, and everyone was looking at me like I was so important?” Nicky beamed, his small hands gesturing wildly. “I think they thought I was a professor too!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, unbuckling her seatbelt. “I’m sure they did, Professor Nicholas. You certainly looked the part.” She winked at him before stepping out and opening the car door for him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they walked into the dance center, Nicky clutched his little bag with his dance shoes, still chattering away. “Do you think I could teach a class someday? Like you with dance and Mama with books?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced down at him with a warm smile. “I think you’d be a natural. But first, you’ve got to master those moves in your own class. Deal?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Deal!” Nicky exclaimed enthusiastically, his energy never waning as he skipped a few steps ahead of her, the small bag swinging from his hand. He paused just before the glass doors of the dance center, turning to look back at her with a wide grin on his face. “I’m gonna be the best dancer ever, just wait!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The hum of activity greeted them as they stepped inside, the sound of kids laughing and feet tapping on the hardwood floors filling the air. Parents lingered near the reception desk, exchanging pleasantries with instructors, while groups of children darted through the space, their energy and excitement palpable. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio!” one of the older kids called, waving enthusiastically from across the room. Rio waved back, her presence immediately commanding attention in the bustling space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they reached the little changing room tucked away in the back, Rio knelt down beside Nicky, who was practically bursting with excitement. He hopped from one foot to the other, barely able to contain himself as Rio carefully helped him slip into his tiny dance shoes. His feet wiggled impatiently as she tied the laces, her nimble fingers moving with practiced ease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, champ,” she said, tightening the last bow. “You’re all set. Go show them what you’ve got.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned, his cheeks flushed with excitement. “Do you think I can do the spin thing today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile widened. “I know you can. Just remember what we practiced—stay balanced, and don’t forget to have fun.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tugged on her hand. “Can we go to my studio now? I want to show you my new moves before class starts!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio knelt beside him, adjusting his bag strap. “How about you get warmed up with your friends first? I’ll be there in a few minutes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He nodded, practically vibrating with anticipation. “Okay, but only if you promise to watch me!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll always watch you,” Rio said with a laugh, ruffling his hair as she stood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As he bounded toward his group, Rio couldn’t help but feel a wave of pride wash over her. She had a front-row seat to his growth, both as a dancer and as a little human discovering the world with a fierce enthusiasm. This was their little world, this space filled with music, laughter, and the energy of children finding their rhythm. It was where they both found joy, where Nicky was given the freedom to explore and grow, and where Rio could witness his progress in real-time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a moment to glance at the clock, noting that the class would begin soon. With a soft exhale, she turned toward the staff room, her mind already beginning to focus on the lesson plan she’d prepared earlier that morning. As she made her way down the hallway, her thoughts shifted toward the choreography and movements she’d designed to challenge her students that day, but even as she mentally slipped into instructor mode, she couldn’t help but carry that warmth with her. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grabbed her CD and made her way back to the studio, where the energy inside was already buzzing. The children were scattered throughout the space—some leaning against the barre, others sitting cross-legged on the floor, and a few already animatedly chatting amongst themselves, their voices high-pitched with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as one of the kids spotted her, they jumped up, unable to contain their enthusiasm. “Miss Rio!” she called out, her voice filled with an eagerness that made Rio’s heart warm. “Are you teaching us today?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face lit up with a bright smile. “I sure am!” she called back, her voice carrying across the room with the promise of something exciting. She clapped her hands lightly, an attention-grabbing gesture that immediately silenced the room. “So you’d better get ready, because we’ve got some fun stuff planned!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At her words, the kids erupted into cheers, their energy practically vibrating through the floor as their little slippers squeaked on the polished wood. The room filled with a palpable excitement, each child eager for the class to begin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio, are we doing leaps today?” one of the boys asked, practically bouncing on his toes, his eyes wide with anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can we practice the recital dance?” another voice piped up from across the room, its owner clutching a dance shoe like it was a prized possession.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, holding up her hands to bring the room back to order. “One thing at a time, everyone!” she said, her tone light but firm, as she enjoyed the collective energy that filled the space. “First, we’ll warm up, and then we’ll see how much energy you’ve got left for some leaps and recital practice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A collective groan of playful disappointment rose from the group, but it was all in good fun. The kids knew that Rio would make every minute worth their while. Without further prompting, they all scrambled into their usual positions, eager to get started. Rio noticed that Nicky had taken his spot front and center, his posture already straight, and a grin plastered across his face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio began to organize them, she heard a few hushed whispers coming from the group. One of the other kids leaned toward Nicky, his voice just loud enough for Rio to hear. “We’re so lucky Miss Rio’s our teacher,” he said, not even trying to lower his voice. “She’s so fun and so pretty.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s chest puffed up with pride at the compliment, and he shot a quick, conspiratorial glance toward Rio. His smile was a mixture of sweetness and a little bit of mischief, a sign of the deep connection the two shared. “She’s the best,” Nicky responded matter-of-factly, his eyes sparkling with admiration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled at the simple honesty in his voice. She shook her head with a fond smile, her eyes softening as she took in the group. “Alright, enough flattery, everyone,” she said, her voice teasing but warm. “Let’s get moving before you all talk your way out of warm-ups!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The kids erupted into laughter, some of them playfully groaning as they knew all too well that Rio’s warm-up sessions were no joke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, dancers,” she called out, clapping her hands to grab their attention. “Let’s get started! Everyone spread out—remember, no bumping into your neighbors unless you want to owe me ten jumping jacks!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The kids giggled as they scrambled into their spots, a few glancing nervously at their spacing to avoid the dreaded penalty.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took her place at the front of the room, her presence attracting attention without a single word of force. The kids quieted down instantly, their eyes focused on her as she exuded an energy that was both authoritative and playful. It was a balance she had perfected over the years—able to encourage, inspire, and make her students feel like they were capable of achieving more than they ever thought possible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She led them through their stretches with a light-hearted ease, cracking jokes and offering little bursts of encouragement along the way, and guiding them through each movement with clear, gentle instructions. “Reach for the sky! Higher! Pretend you’re grabbing the biggest star you can find!” She exaggerated the motion, her arms sweeping upward, and the kids mimicked her with giggles and determination.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they stretched, she gave praise to their form, her eyes catching each of them in turn as she moved through the room, making sure no one was left out or overlooked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Great job, Sarah,” she called out, her voice warm. “That’s the kind of reach we need. Keep that energy up, team!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When it came time to work on splits, Rio noticed little Sophie scooting closer, her face scrunched up in determination. “Miss Rio,” she said, her voice tinged with a mix of frustration and persistence, “can you help me? I’m almost there, but it feels stuck!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio helped Sophie, a few of the other kids leaned forward, their eyes bright with curiosity. “Miss Rio, can you check mine next?” one of them asked eagerly, a grin already forming on his face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mine too!” another child chimed in, practically bouncing on the spot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, raising a hand for attention. “One at a time, everyone!” she called, her voice playful yet firm. Turning back to Sophie, she gave the little girl a gentle pat on the shoulder. “You’re all set, Sophie. Keep practicing, and you’ll get there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sophie beamed at her, a quiet sense of accomplishment blooming on her face. Rio moved on to the next child with a seamless flow, checking postures, adjusting stances, and offering words of encouragement that made the process feel less like work and more like a collaborative effort. The kids hung on every word, watching intently as she moved from one to the next.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With each adjustment, Rio continued to weave through the room, a dynamic presence—part instructor, part cheerleader, and always ready with a teasing remark to keep the mood light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the time came to move on to footwork drills, Rio demonstrated each step with exaggerated flair, drawing delighted giggles from the kids as she danced across the floor with exaggerated precision.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Now, watch closely,” Rio said, her tone playful as she skipped through the sequence. “It’s toe-heel-toe-heel, not stomp-stomp-stomp-stomp.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She paused dramatically mid-step, her feet stomping with such exaggerated force that the sound echoed through the room, sending the children into peals of laughter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You mean like this?” Nicky teased, taking a few stomping steps of his own, the sound of his tiny feet against the floor filling the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot him a mock stern look, one eyebrow raised in playful disapproval. “Exactly like that, troublemaker. And if you keep it up, I’ll make you do it as a solo in the recital!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room erupted into laughter, the kids’ excitement ringing through the space as Nicky flashed a grin, clearly delighted to be at the center of attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they worked through the steps, Rio’s balance between fun and structure became more apparent. She had a knack for knowing when to let the kids be silly and when to pull them back on track. Her instructions were firm but never harsh, her playful demeanor making even corrections feel like encouragement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Remember, it’s not about being perfect,” Rio said, addressing the group as they practiced the steps. “It’s about trying your best and having fun. If you mess up, just keep going! Dancing is about movement, not about nailing every single step. Got it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, Miss Rio!” they chorused, their enthusiasm palpable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, as usual, gravitated toward her throughout the class, looking to her for reassurance or a quick thumbs-up. Rio always responded, whether it was a whispered “Good job” or a brief touch on his shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they moved on to leaps, the atmosphere in the room was electric. The kids were fully immersed in the lesson, their faces flushed with concentration and excitement. The air buzzed with energy as they cheered each other on, their small voices a chorus of encouragement. Rio, standing at the side of the room, clapped her hands enthusiastically after each successful jump, offering tips and words of praise that made every child feel like a star in their own right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She moved with effortless grace as she demonstrated a perfect grand jeté, her body soaring through the air in a smooth, controlled arc. The kids watched, captivated by the fluidity of the movement, eyes wide with admiration. Rio landed with precision, the soft sound of her feet connecting with the floor barely breaking the silence as she smiled at the class, waiting for the next attempt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as she prepared to give her next instruction, a loud, clear voice rang out, cutting through the murmur of the class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wow, Mom! That’s so cool!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room fell silent as if someone had pressed pause on a movie. All the kids froze in place, their wide eyes darting between Nicky and Rio, trying to process what they’d just heard.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio paused slightly, a flicker of surprise crossing her face. Quickly, she replaced it with a warm, reassuring smile, locking eyes with Nicky. “Thank you, bud. You’re cool too,” she said calmly, her voice steady and encouraging.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The quiet didn’t last long. A hand shot up from the back of the room. “Miss Rio, is Nicky really your son?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly. She took a moment to brush her hands down her leggings as she straightened, looking out over the sea of inquisitive faces. The tension melted away, replaced by curiosity, and she offered them all a smile that was equal parts sincere and playful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, he is,” Rio said, her tone light and casual, as though it were the most natural thing in the world. “But today, he’s just another one of my amazing students, just like all of you!” She gave them a wink, making the whole room feel like part of the secret.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her easy, open response worked like magic. The children’s expressions shifted from surprise to awe, their initial shock transforming into fascination. They leaned in closer to one another, eager to hear more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s so cool!” one of the older girls exclaimed, bouncing slightly on the balls of her feet, her eyes sparkling with excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re so lucky, Nicky,” another child said, her voice full of admiration. “Miss Rio is the best!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s chest puffed out with pride, his cheeks pink from the attention, but his smile only widened. “I know!” he said, his voice full of joy and mischief, earning a chorus of giggles from his classmates. His innocence, his absolute pride in his mom, was contagious, and Rio couldn’t help but smile at how effortlessly he stole the spotlight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, everyone, let’s get back to practicing,” Rio said, clapping her hands to refocus the group. “And if anyone has any questions, save them for after class. For now, let’s see those leaps!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The class quickly resumed its lively energy, the kids pouring their excitement into their dancing. Despite the unexpected moment, Rio maintained her composure, her effortless blend of warmth and authority guiding them back to the lesson.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the children practiced, Nicky caught Rio’s eye from across the room, giving her a toothy grin that made her heart swell. She smiled back, a silent reassurance that everything was just as it should be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rest of the class flowed with a new, almost electric energy. The kids, already fond of Rio, seemed even more determined to impress her now. They lined up eagerly for their turns to try new moves, their faces glowing with excitement whenever Rio offered praise or corrections.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re all doing amazing today,” Rio said, her voice full of warmth as she clapped for a particularly well-executed plié. “I can see so much improvement already!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, of course, thrived under the spotlight. Every time it was his turn, he looked up at Rio for approval, his grin widening when she gave him a thumbs-up or a proud, “That’s it, Nicky!” The other kids didn’t seem to mind; if anything, they admired him more now, whispering amongst themselves about how cool it must be to have <em>Miss Rio</em> as his mom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio moved through the class, demonstrating steps and offering guidance, her mind occasionally drifted to Nicky’s slip-up earlier. The way he’d called her “Mom” in front of everyone had been so casual, so effortless. For a moment, she’d felt the air leave the room, but as soon as she’d seen his beaming face, everything had fallen into place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It felt natural, she realized, <em>right</em>. Being his mom wasn’t just a role she’d stepped into; it was who she was now. Nicky didn’t hesitate to claim her as his, even if he hadn’t meant to share that part of their lives so openly. And the way the kids had reacted—with awe, admiration, and not a hint of judgment—made her heart swell.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio, am I doing this right?” one of the kids called, breaking her train of thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re so close!” Rio said, immediately refocusing. She stepped closer to demonstrate, adjusting the child’s posture with a gentle hand. “Try bending your knees just a little more. Perfect—there you go!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she moved to help another student, her gaze flicked to Nicky, who was busy showing a friend his version of the steps. His joy was infectious, and Rio found herself smiling again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the class ended, the kids were buzzing with excitement, chattering about their progress and eagerly planning to practice at home. Rio gathered them in a circle for their usual closing routine, clapping for their hard work and reminding them to stretch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You all did fantastic today,” she said, her voice full of genuine pride. “I can’t wait to see what you’ll show me next time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hung back as the other kids filtered out, bouncing on his toes as he waited for Rio to gather her things. She glanced at him, her heart swelling with affection. Being his mom wasn’t just a title. It was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After class, the studio buzzed with the usual post-lesson chaos—kids chatting excitedly, stuffing their shoes into their bags, and comparing notes on the day’s moves. Nicky stood by the cubbies, carefully tucking his dance shoes into his bag, his face still glowing from the class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio moved around the studio, carefully collecting the scattered water bottles and stray shoes, a small voice called out from the side of the room. She turned to find one of her younger students, a little girl with curly pigtails and a curious gleam in her eyes, lingering by the doorway. Rio’s gaze softened as she noticed the child hesitating, her small fingers nervously twisting the hem of her shirt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Everything okay, sweetheart?” Rio asked, her tone gentle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The girl bit her lower lip, her cheeks flushing pink as she shifted her weight from one foot to the other, unsure of how to ask what was clearly on her mind. Finally, with a small but determined breath, she clasped her hands behind her back and looked up at Rio, her eyes wide and full of innocent curiosity. “Miss Rio… does Nicky call you Mom at home too?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart skipped at the question, but she smiled softly, keeping her voice calm and warm. ““He sure does,” Rio replied, her tone light, but there was an undeniable tenderness behind the words. She paused for a second, her smile widening. “But you know what? That’s our little secret, okay? Can you keep it safe?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The girl’s eyes widened in surprise, and for a moment, Rio saw that quiet spark of mischief, that same curiosity that often led the little one to ask questions no one else would think of. A soft giggle escaped her lips, and she nodded enthusiastically, her face lighting up as if she had just been entrusted with the most important of secrets. “I promise! But… can I tell my mom?” she asked, her voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper, as if they were about to share something thrilling and significant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio winked at her, giving her shoulder a gentle pat. “You can tell your mom. You’re officially part of the secret club now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The girl beamed, her shyness melting away, and skipped off to rejoin the other kids. Rio straightened, watching her go with a small chuckle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nearby, Nicky was waiting patiently, his backpack slung over one shoulder. When Rio caught his eye, he gave her a knowing smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“All set, buddy?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yep!” Nicky chirped, taking her hand as they walked toward the door of the studio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Outside, the evening air felt cool and crisp, a stark contrast to the warmth of the studio. The sound of children’s laughter and the low murmur of parents’ conversations filled the air, creating a cozy, bustling atmosphere as the little ones ran to greet their families. Rio and Nicky stood near the curb, waiting for the familiar sight of Agatha’s car to appear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, it did.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A sleek black car pulled up smoothly to the lot, its polished surface gleaming under the fading light of day. Rio’s eyes caught the movement as Agatha stepped out, looking effortlessly composed in a tailored coat that draped perfectly over her frame, her heels clicking softly on the pavement. She carried herself with a quiet elegance, her presence alone commanding attention, yet there was a softness to her expression when she spotted Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama!” Nicky shouted, his face lighting up with pure joy. Without missing a beat, he bolted toward her, arms outstretched, his little legs moving quickly in his excitement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crouched just in time to catch him, her lips curving into a warm smile as she scooped him up. “There’s my little star! Did you have fun in class?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Nicky could respond, one of the other children, still lingering nearby with their parents, tilted their head curiously at the sight of the trio. “Is that your other mom?” the child asked, their tone innocent yet tinged with wonder as they stared at Agatha and Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha froze for a brief moment, her gaze flickering between the child and Rio, uncertainty flickering in her eyes. It was just a split second, but Rio caught it and was already stepping forward, her expression light and relaxed, her demeanor as easygoing as always.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, that’s Nicky’s Mama,” Rio said with a breezy smile, her tone cheerful and casual. “And she’s here to take us all home. Isn’t that sweet of her?” Her words flowed smoothly, putting everyone at ease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, still cradled in Agatha’s arms, blinked curiously at the child who had asked the question, and then glanced up at Agatha. In that moment, Agatha’s understanding kicked in, and she gave him a knowing smile, her eyes softening as she held him closer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, that’s Mama,” Nicky said with complete innocence, snuggling deeper into Agatha’s arms. “And she loves my Mom.” His voice was light, matter-of-fact, as though this was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The child seemed satisfied with this simple explanation, nodding with a casual shrug before scampering back to their parent.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a quiet breath of relief as she approached Agatha, who had a mischievous glint in her eye. “New official title?” Agatha asked softly, her lips twitching with amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes good-naturedly, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips. “Nicky thought it was time to make it official.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled. “And wasn’t he so right!.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He was,” Rio said, shooting her a knowing grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they made their way through the parking lot, Nicky perched on Agatha’s hip, the evening air was filled with the excited chatter of kids recounting their class to their parents. Rio walked slightly ahead, carrying her dance bag and Nicky’s belongings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as they neared Agatha’s car, the sound of footsteps behind them caught Rio’s attention. She turned to see Sophie’s mom, the ever-friendly and bubbly woman, walking toward them with Sophie at her side, her curly hair bouncing as she skipped along, her face flushed with the energy of the class.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Miss Rio,” Sophie’s mom called out, her voice warm and inviting, “I just wanted to say how wonderful you are with the kids.” She beamed at Rio, her smile sincere and appreciative. “My daughter absolutely adores your class. She’s been practicing her moves all week, and I think it’s because of how encouraging you are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked in pleasant surprise, a rush of warmth flooding her chest at the compliment. Her cheeks colored just a hint, and she smiled widely, grateful for the kind words. “Oh, thank you so much! That really means a lot to hear,” she replied, her tone sincere and touched. “Sophie’s a joy to teach—she’s always so eager to learn, and she brings such a positive energy to the class.” Her eyes softened as she glanced over at the little girl, who was now standing quietly by her mother’s side, eyes wide with admiration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The parent beamed, clearly pleased. “Well, it shows how much she looks up to you. Honestly, it’s rare to see someone handle a group of kids so well—firm but fun. You’ve got a real gift.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly, glancing back at Agatha, who was observing the interaction with a quiet, proud smile. “I try my best. They make it easy, though—they’re such a great group.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Sophie’s mom could respond, Nicky piped up from Agatha’s arms, “She is the best teacher ever!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot him a playful look, though her eyes sparkled. “Thank you, little love,” she said with a laugh, ruffling his hair. “I’m lucky to have such a sweet assistant.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sophie’s mom smiled warmly at the exchange. She observed the subtle but undeniable connection they shared, the effortless camaraderie between the three. After a moment, she hesitated, her tone shifting to one of curiosity, though still friendly. “Sorry to ask, but—” she began, her words measured but not unkind, “I couldn’t help but notice how close you all seem. Are you… related in some way?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt the question linger in the air, and for a brief second, she glanced at Agatha, the quiet understanding between them palpable. She met Sophie’s mom’s gaze with a calm, open expression. “We’re all family,” she said, her voice steady yet full of affection. “Nicky’s Agatha’s son, and now he is mine too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sophie’s mom blinked, taken aback by the unexpected honesty, her eyes widening for a fraction of a second. She quickly masked her surprise with a soft, approving smile, clearly warmed by the revelation. “Ah, I see,” she said, nodding thoughtfully. “That’s wonderful! It’s so nice to see a family like this. You all seem very close-knit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, still holding Nicky securely in her arms, nodded in agreement. Her gaze softened as she tightened her grip on her son, pulling him closer. There was something unspoken in that moment, a sense of deep, unwavering connection that spoke volumes. “We are,” Agatha replied, her voice rich with quiet love. “Nicky is everything to us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The warmth in Sophie’s mom’s smile deepened, her eyes reflecting a genuine appreciation. “That’s lovely,” she said, her voice filled with admiration. “It’s nice to see kids surrounded by so much love. You’re doing a great job with him. You’re a lucky woman, Miss Rio.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a surge of emotion swell in her chest at the kind words, but she held her composure with ease, a soft smile playing on her lips. “We’re just trying to make sure he knows he’s always loved,” she replied, her voice steady but tinged with gratitude.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sophie’s mom gave one last smile, a warm, heartfelt expression of support, before turning to walk away, Sophie skipping happily by her side. As they headed toward their car, Rio, Agatha, and Nicky stood together for a moment, basking in the peaceful, almost sacred atmosphere that enveloped them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they climbed into the car, Agatha gave Rio a knowing look. “Not exactly the most subtle way to reveal our family dynamic, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed lightly, her tone playful but full of affection. “After today, I think we’re well past subtle, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned up at them both from the backseat. “I like it when people know we’re a family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We do, too, buddy,” Agatha said softly, pressing a gentle kiss to his forehead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio settled into her seat and buckled her seatbelt, Agatha turned to her, her smirk resurfacing. “Firm but fun, huh? I think they’ve nailed your teaching style.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes in mock exasperation, laughing as she did so. “Oh, hush. You’re just jealous you didn’t get a compliment too,” she teased, her tone light but affectionate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled as she slid into the driver’s seat, her hands gripping the steering wheel with practiced ease. “Touché,” she said, glancing at Rio with a sly smile before starting the car.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The car pulled smoothly out of the parking lot, and as the evening sky deepened, Nicky leaned forward in his seat, his curiosity piqued by the conversation. “Mama, did you hear what the lady said about Mom?” he asked, his voice filled with excitement as he bounced slightly in his seat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I did,” Agatha replied with a grin, her eyes twinkling as she glanced at Rio, who was smiling softly, gazing out the window at the dimming sky. “And you know what? She were absolutely right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head gently, her smile softening. She gazed out at the world passing by, her thoughts turning inward. It had been a good day.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air was still thick with the energy of their performance as Rio, Alice, and Jen made their way out of the venue. The applause still echoed in their minds, a sweet reverberation that made their hearts race with adrenaline. Rio could feel the buzz from the crowd, the rush of every beat she’d hit on her drum set, every chord Alice and Jen had strummed. It had been a perfect night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did you see their faces when I hit that solo?” Alice grinned, still riding the high of the performance. “They were <em>loving</em> it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen chuckled, her guitar case slung over her shoulder and her hand firmly clasped in Alice’s. “They couldn’t get enough. It’s like we <em>became</em> the show instead of providing it.” Her wide smile spoke to the pride she felt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, walking a few paces ahead, turned back to them with a satisfied grin, walking backwards. “The crowd was <em>on fire</em>tonight. We were unstoppable. I swear, every time I looked up, it was like the entire room was <em>vibrating</em> with the music.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their footsteps echoed on the sidewalk as they headed for a small bar around the corner, their favorite place to unwind after a show. The neon lights of the bar flickered in the distance, a familiar beacon calling them to relax, celebrate, and maybe do a little bragging, too.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Drinks on me,” Rio declared, throwing a playful glance over her shoulder. She could already taste the sweet relief of a cold drink, something to quiet the buzz of the stage and soothe the energy that had been running through her veins.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen cheered in agreement, their laughter filling the night air. Rio wasn’t sure how many drinks it would take before they were all so tipsy they could barely stand, but tonight, she wasn’t thinking about limits. She was thinking about <em>fun</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they stepped inside the bar, the low murmur of conversation and clinking glasses welcomed them. The cozy, dimly lit space was already buzzing with energy. There was something comforting about the familiar scent of spilled beer and the hum of conversation after a night of giving everything on stage. Rio slid onto a stool at the bar, the others quickly following suit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Three beers, please,” Rio said with a grin, waving a hand. “Actually, make it four. I’m celebrating.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bartender shot them a curious look, but didn’t question it. He set four bottles in front of them, and Rio grabbed hers with a flourish. She toasted with Alice and Jen, the three of them clinking bottles together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“To being unstoppable,” Rio said, her grin wide and wild.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“To <em>Three of Swords</em>,” Alice added, tapping her bottle against Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen raised her bottle last. “To the best damn band in the world.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They all took a long, satisfying sip. The night was just beginning, and as Rio leaned back in her seat, the weight of the performance still thrumming in her chest, she knew this was exactly where she was meant to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The conversation flowed easily, like the music they’d just played, smooth and in sync. Rio leaned back, feeling the warmth of the alcohol spreading through her, and exchanged playful glances with Alice and Jen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice took the first shot. “Alright, <em>seriously</em>—I think we need to talk about how Rio basically <em>owned</em> the drums tonight. You were a beast up there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked and took another sip of her drink, pretending to be modest. “I’m just doing my part, y’know? Someone’s gotta keep the tempo, and it’s clearly a tough job.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice shot Jen a teasing glance. “Yeah, someone’s gotta keep us all <em>on time</em> since <em>someone</em> can’t seem to make it through a set without almost missing their cue.” She burst into laughter. “I still can’t believe you almost missed your cue on the last song. The entire crowd was waiting for you to play that solo!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, traying to be a good sport, simply raised her glass. “Hey, in my defense, Rio was <em>so</em> distracting with her insane drumming, I got a little lost in the rhythm. But don’t worry, I made up for it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice teased her, tapping Jen’s shoulder with a playful look. “Made up for it? You barely caught the cue at all, babe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen smiled, clearly unbothered by Alice’s playful teasing. “It was <em>theatrics</em>, alright? A bit of suspense before the big finale.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled at the banter between them, a warmth spreading in her chest. The two had always been a couple of banter queens, but tonight, their dynamic felt even more infectious. The energy in the room mirrored the chemistry on stage—effortless, playful, and totally in sync. Rio felt herself drawn into their easy camaraderie, her laughter spilling out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, Jen,” Rio said, wiping a tear from her eye after laughing so hard. “You just <em>barely</em> made it, but we all know you were just giving the crowd the drama they didn’t know they needed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Drama’s my middle name,” Jen quipped, grinning and clinking her bottle with Rio’s. “But <em>seriously</em>—did you <em>see</em> the way the crowd went wild after Rio’s solo?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, enjoying the praise. “Well, I do aim to please.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please? Honey, you <em>wrecked</em> the drums,” Alice said with mock seriousness. “It was like the entire room was vibrating with every beat you hit. You could’ve set the stage on fire, and the crowd would’ve been too busy cheering to notice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen raised an eyebrow, a teasing smirk playing on her lips. “Let’s be real, though. There’s one thing we need to talk about.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s that?” Rio asked, leaning forward.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The fact that you literally <em>stole</em> the spotlight tonight,” Jen said with a wink, as if Rio hadn’t already noticed. “I think you’re the reason half the people in the crowd didn’t even notice Alice and I out there. I’m starting to think <em>we’re</em> just the side act, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice joined in, nodding dramatically. “You know, Rio, you’ve <em>got</em> to start sharing the stage a little. It’s only fair. I’m starting to think you’re jealous because your girlfriend is at home while mine is right here.” Alice continued, draping an arm around Jen and pulling her closer to kiss her square on the lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, pretending to look scandalized. “Oh, I’m sorry. Should I step back and let <em>you</em> have your moment? And my girlfriend and I are doing very well, thank you very much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen and Alice erupted into giggles at Rio’s mock-serious tone. It was moments like this that made everything feel so easy. The drinks flowed, the conversation flowed, and there was no pressure, no stress—just the shared joy of their friendship and the excitement of the night they’d just had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The laughter grew louder, a few drinks too many fueling their carefree antics. Rio felt the warmth of the alcohol spread through her limbs, her laughter coming a little too easily. Normally, she prided herself on being able to handle her liquor, but tonight, it felt like her head was spinning just a little more than usual.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, with her usual mischievous grin, raised her glass. “Come on, you two. One more round for the road. It’s <em>celebration time</em>, remember?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice laughed, her cheeks flushed. “Oh, I’m in. Let’s go! We’re unstoppable tonight, what’s one more drink between friends?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, still smiling, was tempted by the suggestion, the fun of the night bubbling up inside her. She didn’t even need much encouragement—she was already feeling loose, the buzz settling into a pleasant, fuzzy warmth. “Alright, alright, one more,” she said, lifting her glass to meet theirs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They clinked their glasses together, and the trio downed their drinks almost in unison, each of them feeling the effects in their own way. Jen, as usual, was the first to giggle, leaning into Alice as if they were sharing an inside joke. Alice wasn’t far behind, the tipsiness turning her teasing into something more affectionate. “I <em>swear</em> this night is way too much fun.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned, nodding in agreement but finding that the room had started to feel just a little… wobbly. She shook her head, trying to shake off the dizziness, but the world still spun slightly around her. “Okay, okay, we’re done now, right? I’m feeling like the floor’s moving under me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, her tipsy energy magnified by the alcohol, suddenly stood up on her chair with a dramatic flourish. Her eyes sparkled with mischievous excitement as she raised her glass high above her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ladies and gentlemen!” Alice announced, her voice a little louder than necessary. “I’d like to make a speech! About something <em>important</em>!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, already swaying slightly in her seat, raised an eyebrow but smiled. “Oh no,” she muttered, as she watched her girlfriend make a spectacle of herself with fondness in her eye.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, equally tipsy, grinned and leaned back in her seat. “Here we go,” she laughed, her words a little slurred but no less amused.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The few patrons still in the bar turned toward Alice, their curiosity piqued. Alice, completely undeterred by the attention, began to speak with a dramatic, theatrical flair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We are <em>Three of Swords</em>,” she declared, holding her glass up like a trophy, “and we are <em>undefeated</em>! The best band to ever grace this town! You’ve seen our gigs, you know the magic we create when we get on stage! We—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“<em>We</em> are legends in the making!” Jen added from her seat, slurring slightly but grinning wide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice shot her a playful look before continuing. “Exactly! The best! We’re unstoppable, and <em>no one</em> can ever forget what they saw when we took the stage tonight! Because let’s face it, we’re <em>freaking awesome</em>!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bar patrons, a few of whom had been watching the band earlier that night, couldn’t help but laugh and cheer. A few claps started, then more followed, until the entire bar was giving Alice a round of applause, some even cheering. Rio, thoroughly amused, clapped along with them, her laughter bubbling up with the crowd’s infectious energy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you! Thank you!” Alice called, taking a dramatic bow. “We’ll be here all week! No, really, we will. But seriously, keep an eye on us, because we’re just getting started!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen stood up, leaning into Alice as if ready to join her in some impromptu victory dance, though she wasn’t quite steady on her feet. “We might be legends already, but you all haven’t seen <em>anything</em> yet,” she said with a grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The trio’s carefree joy only grew as the night wore on. The atmosphere in the bar shifted from a laid-back post-gig vibe to a full-blown party, with Rio, Alice, and Jen at the center of it all. The music pulsed through the speakers, and without any hesitation, they all found themselves on the dance floor, moving in time with the rhythm, their laughter and shouts blending with the beat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio spun in circles, her body moving more freely than it ever did on the stage. She was completely caught up in the moment, her hair flying around her as she giggled and twirled, her hands raised high in the air. “This is the best night ever!” she shouted, her words slurring just a bit as she tried to catch her breath between bursts of laughter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, slightly less coordinated but no less enthusiastic, grabbed Alice’s hand and pulled her toward the center of the floor. The two of them giggled and stumbled around, their laughter contagious as they bumped into other patrons. It wasn’t long before their playful energy turned into something more affectionate, as they began making out right there on the dance floor. The crowd cheered them on, egging them on with cheers and whistles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio watched them for a moment, her face a mix of amusement and excitement. She stumbled toward them, her own giggles spilling out.  “I want Agatha to come here and make out with me, too! Right now!” she slurred, flailing her arms dramatically. Jen and Alice, equally intoxicated, laughed at Rio’s outburst, spurring her on with more ridiculous comments of their own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed even harder at their antics, not quite able to form coherent sentences, but clearly having the time of her life. “Agatha will have a heart attack when she finds out about this!” she shouted, raising her glass for a toast she couldn’t quite finish. Drinks splashed over the edge, spilling onto the floor, adding to the growing mess around them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At home, Agatha stood by the vanity, slipping into her silk robe as the quiet of the house settled around her. Nicky was with Lilia for the weekend, leaving the house eerily peaceful. The soft ticking of the clock filled the silence as Agatha brushed out her long hair, a small smile playing at her lips. It had been a good day—just the kind of quit evening she had been looking forward to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced at the clock, her fingers pausing mid-stroke as she noticed the time. Rio was still not home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A wave of concern washed over her. She knew how easily time could slip away when Rio got caught up in things, but it was already late. Too late for Rio to still be out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha set down her brush and reached for her phone, her fingers hovering over the screen for a moment before she dialed Rio’s number. She needed to check in, just in case.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The phone rang twice before Rio picked up. Agatha could hear the muffled sounds of music and laughter in the background—an indication that Rio was at least in good company, but the slurring in her voice made her frown instantly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, love,” Rio greeted, her tone a little too loud, the words tumbling out in a slurred, uneven rhythm. “You wouldn’t <em>believe</em> what just happened!” She broke into a fit of giggles, the sound bubbling through the phone like champagne poured too fast.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s frown deepened, the corners of her mouth tightening as she listened. Rio’s voice carried the unmistakable telltale signs of intoxication—the exaggerated pitch, the disjointed cadence, the way her laughter seemed to tumble into itself like she couldn’t keep her balance even in conversation. Agatha’s sharp intuition filled in the rest of the picture: the sway in Rio’s movements, the glass in her hand, the unsteady steps.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, is that so?” Agatha said, her voice carefully even, though there was no hiding the edge of concern beneath her words. “How are you, darling?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine!” Rio replied, dragging out the word as though it was a definitive statement. “I’m more than fine, actually!” She punctuated the declaration with another bout of laughter, the sound spilling through the phone like a too-bright neon sign flashing <em>everything’s fine</em> when it clearly wasn’t.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaling deeply to steady herself before responding. “You’re not fine,” she said, her voice a blend of firmness and gentle insistence. “Where are you, love?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m…” Rio hesitated, giggling softly, the pause long enough for Agatha’s concern to deepen. “I’m still at the bar! We were… dancing, having fun, and then I—oh, I’m fine, really!” The hiccup that followed only added to the unraveling picture. “Just having a blast.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha said, her tone softening but no less resolute. “I’m glad you’re having fun, but I need you to tell me exactly where you are. Can you do that for me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a long pause on the other end, the music and chatter in the background suddenly feeling louder as Rio’s drunken mind tried to process the request. “It’s, uh… that place, you know, the one with the… lights? And the… music?” She giggled again, clearly struggling to focus. “Oh, come on, you know it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, exhaling slowly. She recognized the bar Rio was describing—it was one Rio had mentioned before, a favorite spot among her friends. The mental image of Rio, likely unsteady on her feet and surrounded by chaos, made Agatha’s chest tighten further.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Stay right where you are,” Agatha said, her voice calm but carrying an undeniable sense of authority. “I’m coming to get you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What? Nooo, you don’t have to do that!” Rio protested, though the slurring in her words dulled any sense of conviction. “I’m good, I promise! I can—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re not fine, Rio,” Agatha interrupted gently, her tone unwavering. “And I’m not letting you stumble home alone or stay there like this. Just stay put, love. I’ll be there soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a brief silence on the line, broken only by the faint hum of background noise. Then, Rio sighed, a small, defeated sound. “Okay, okay. I guess you could pick me up than. But don’t yell at me when you get here,” she mumbled, the faintest hint of a pout in her voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha allowed herself a small smile, though the worry still lingered. “I won’t yell,” she promised, already grabbing her keys and coat. “Just hold tight, darling. I’ll be there soon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, Agatha ended the call, the soft beep echoing in the quiet of the room. Her mind was already racing, calculating the fastest route to the bar. There was no use debating—she knew Rio too well. When Rio had one too many, reasoning with her became a futile exercise, and Agatha wasn’t about to leave her to navigate the chaos of late-night revelry alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tossing her phone onto the bed, Agatha quickly shrugged off her robe and reached for her jacket. The cool leather slid over her shoulders as she zipped it up with practiced efficiency. Her usual grace was laced with urgency, her movements sharp and purposeful. Her thoughts weren’t just on the drive—they were on Rio. On the laugh that had been too loose, the words that had been too jumbled, and the vulnerability she could hear in the spaces between.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused by the door, her hand resting on the frame for a brief moment as she exhaled slowly. She loved Rio’s fiery energy, her boundless enthusiasm, the way she could light up any room she entered. But that same spark, unchecked, had a way of burning too brightly, leaving Rio vulnerable in ways she would never admit. Agatha’s chest tightened as she thought of her lover out there, carried by the tide of music and strangers, unguarded and unaware.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’ll laugh this off tomorrow,” Agatha murmured to herself, slipping her phone into her pocket. A small, wry smile tugged at the corner of her mouth. “But that’s tomorrow’s problem.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As she locked the door behind her and stepped into the crisp night air, her resolve solidified. It didn’t matter if Rio was having the time of her life right now—Agatha couldn’t ignore the gnawing worry that came with knowing her partner was too intoxicated to take care of herself. Rio might be spirited and independent, but Agatha loved her too much to let her wander too far, too recklessly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sliding into the driver’s seat, Agatha started the engine, her fingers gripping the wheel a little tighter than usual. Her thoughts were already at the bar, already picturing Rio’s bright, tipsy smile and the way her eyes would light up when she spotted Agatha. She couldn’t stay frustrated, not when it came to Rio. Protecting her, caring for her—it wasn’t a burden. It was love, and Agatha would always choose it, no matter the time or place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a steadying breath, she pulled out of the driveway, her mind focused on one thing: getting Rio home safe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pushed open the door to the bar, the chaotic energy spilling out to meet her in a rush of music, laughter, and clinking glasses. The noise was disorienting for a moment, but her sharp eyes immediately began scanning the room. It didn’t take long to spot Rio—she was the center of a scene that was both endearing and slightly concerning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stood near the bar, leaning heavily on Alice and Jen, who had positioned themselves as makeshift supports on either side of her. Both women had their arms wrapped around her to keep her steady, though their own tipsy grins suggested they weren’t entirely grounded themselves. Rio’s face was flushed, her head thrown back in laughter that was too loud, too unsteady, and too uncoordinated to be entirely natural. She swayed with every giggle, stumbling slightly as Alice and Jen adjusted to keep her upright.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused, her gaze softening despite the growing knot of concern in her chest. There was something undeniably sweet about the way Rio was surrounded by her friends, their obvious affection for her written in the way they shielded her from knocking into tables or other patrons. But that sweetness was tinged with a discomfort Agatha couldn’t shake. Rio’s vibrant energy was unmistakable, but this wasn’t the joy she cherished in her lover. This was the hazy, reckless kind, dulled by alcohol and poor decisions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha stepped further into the room, the scene in front of her became clearer. Rio was mid-story—something that clearly amused her as much as her companions—her arms waving dramatically to punctuate whatever punchline she was trying to get out. Alice was laughing so hard she was leaning into Jen, while Jen shook her head with a bemused smile, clearly entertained despite herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s vibrant, chaotic presence was undeniable, and for a fleeting moment, Agatha felt a pang of affection. This was Rio in all her messy, unapologetic glory—unfiltered, unpredictable, and entirely herself. But beneath that affection, there was worry. Rio’s happiness, in this moment, was hollow, buoyed by the temporary euphoria of too many drinks and the false invincibility that came with them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled, her lips pressing into a thin line as she made her way toward them. She couldn’t deny the warmth she felt seeing Rio so loved and supported, but she also couldn’t ignore the protective instinct that surged in her chest. Rio wasn’t herself like this—her spark was still there, but it was flickering, dampened by the haze of alcohol. This wasn’t the Rio who lit up Agatha’s world with her sharp wit and boundless enthusiasm. This was a vulnerable version of her, and as much as Agatha loved every part of Rio, it was her job to step in now—to make sure she didn’t stumble too far.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha stepped closer, Alice and Jen noticed her arrival. Almost instantly, the atmosphere around their little trio shifted. The playful, carefree laughter between the two friends quieted, and their expressions changed. It was as if they instinctively understood the dynamic—Rio’s fun-loving, tipsy antics had reached their limit, and her steadfast anchor had arrived to reel her back in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice shot Jen a knowing glance, a smirk tugging at the corner of her lips before they both turned back to Rio with a mixture of affection and teasing mischief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, Rio,” Alice began, her tone light but warm, a hint of a grin playing on her face. “Looks like your night of freedom is officially over.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen chuckled softly, nudging Rio’s shoulder with her own. “Agatha’s here to rescue you from yourself. Or maybe us, depending on how you look at it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, completely oblivious to the shift in the air, swayed on her feet, her bright, unfocused grin lighting up her flushed face. Spotting Agatha, she practically lit up like a firework. “Agatha!” she exclaimed, her voice carrying across the bar in a cheerful, slurred tone. She lifted her arms toward her lover, making clumsy grabby hands. “You really <em>are</em> the prettiest woman I’ve ever seen,” she declared dramatically, like an actor delivering a line to an audience, her words slightly tangled by the alcohol.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help the small sigh that escaped her lips, though it was tinged with a fond smile. She took another step forward, her sharp eyes scanning Rio’s face and posture. It was clear Rio wasn’t entirely steady on her feet, and her attempt to straighten up only made her wobble more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine, I swear! Look, see?” Rio announced, giving Agatha the brightest, most hopeful smile she could muster. She took a deliberate step forward to demonstrate her stability—and nearly toppled over in the process. Alice caught her just in time, stifling a laugh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, sweetheart,” Agatha murmured, her voice soft and laced with quiet amusement as she reached Rio. Her hand moved to cup Rio’s face briefly, brushing her thumb against her cheek. “You’re far from fine, love. It’s time to go home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out another giggle, her pout deepening as she swayed slightly, reaching out to grab Agatha’s arm for balance. “But I don’t wanna go yet,” she whined, her voice petulant and slurred, though her grin betrayed the playfulness behind her words. She clung to Agatha with a childlike insistence that might have been endearing if it wasn’t so concerning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen exchanged a glance, their attempts to stifle their laughter failing miserably. They knew better than to intervene when Agatha had taken the reins, but that didn’t stop them from teasing Rio one last time. “Agatha’s right,” Jen said with a smirk, her voice light but knowing. “You’ve hit your fun limit for tonight. Time to let your better half take care of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, propping herself up against Jen, added with a laugh, “Yeah, Rio, your party’s officially over. Agatha’s here to shut it down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, though her eyes remained fixed on Rio, her concern evident in the way she gently steadied her. “You’ve definitely had enough for one night,” she said, her tone firm but laced with affection as she began to guide Rio toward the exit. “Come on, love. Let’s get you home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head up, her eyes glassy but filled with adoration as she leaned into Agatha’s side. Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper, though it was still loud enough for everyone nearby to hear. “You know, I’m <em>really</em> glad you came, Agatha. I love you.” The words were slurred but so tender that they made Agatha’s heart ache in the best way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha softened, her hand brushing against Rio’s arm in a reassuring gesture. “I love you too, darling,” she murmured, her voice low and warm. “But loving you doesn’t mean I’m letting you stay here any longer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced up at Alice and Jen, who were now leaning into each other for support, their tipsy grins making it clear they weren’t taking the situation too seriously. “And what about you two?” Agatha asked, arching an eyebrow. Her tone was calm but carried a quiet authority that was impossible to ignore. “Do you have a way to get home, or do I need to take responsibility for you as well?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, still wobbling slightly but clearly amused, raised her hand in mock reassurance. “We’ve got a ride, promise,” she said, her words slurring just enough to undermine her credibility. “No need to worry about us, Agatha. Just focus on getting Rio home before she starts serenading you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, grinning like a Cheshire cat, leaned closer to Jen and added, “Yeah, she’s in good hands. But, Agatha—make sure you keep her in <em>one</em> piece, okay?” There was a playful twinkle in her eyes, though the affection behind her words was unmistakable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a small laugh, shaking her head at their antics. “I’ll make sure she’s safe,” she replied, her gaze returning to Rio, who was now gazing up at her like she was the only person in the world. “But you two had better do the same for yourselves.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice gave a playful salute, her balance wavering slightly as she leaned into Jen for support. “Good luck, Agatha,” she teased with a wink. “She’s all yours now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks for that,” Agatha said dryly, though her smile betrayed her amusement. She adjusted her grip on Rio, who was now resting her head against Agatha’s shoulder, a contented smile on her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they headed toward the door, Rio let out another soft giggle, her voice barely above a whisper. “You’re the best, you know that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked down at her, her expression softening further. “I know, love. I know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t waste another second. With one last glance at Alice and Jen, who were still grinning like mischievous accomplices, she turned her full attention to Rio. Her girlfriend’s cheeks were flushed, her eyes glassy and far too bright, the telltale signs of a night that had gone a little too far. The sight of her like this tugged at Agatha’s heart—not with anger, but with the quiet, aching tenderness of someone who knew and loved every part of Rio, even the messy ones.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, darling,” Agatha said gently, reaching out to take Rio’s arm. Her voice was soft, steady, and coaxing, the way one might speak to a child who had played too hard and needed to be guided to bed. “Let’s get you settled.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned into her instantly, her weight pressing warmly against Agatha’s side as she giggled again. The sound was loose and carefree, her movements just as unsteady. “I’m fine,” she slurred, her attempt at a reassuring smile wobbling on her lips. “Really. Just… having fun.” She hiccupped at the end, which only made her giggle harder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips twitched into a soft, knowing smile as she slipped an arm securely around Rio’s waist. She could feel the faint tremor in Rio’s frame, the way her steps faltered with every other movement. “I know, darling,” Agatha murmured, her tone warm but laced with quiet insistence. “But how about we take the fun somewhere quieter? You’ve had enough excitement for one night, my love. Let’s get you home, where it’s safe and warm.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha carefully guided Rio out of the bar, her arm around her waist to steady her as they made their way toward the car. Rio was still giggling, her steps wobbly, leaning heavily on Agatha for support. Her head rested on Agatha’s shoulder as they walked, the soft sound of Rio’s laughter echoing in the quiet night air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced down at her, her features softening further. Even in this state—tipsy, flushed, and utterly vulnerable—Rio was so achingly hers. “You’re a handful, you know that?” Agatha said quietly, her tone more affectionate than scolding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio lifted her head slightly, her eyes half-lidded but shining with unmistakable fondness. “Yeah,” she mumbled, her voice soft and slurred. “But I’m <em>your</em> handful.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A small laugh escaped Agatha as she pressed a kiss to the top of Rio’s head. “That you are, my love. That you are. You really went all out tonight, didn’t you?” Agatha’s voice was low and soothing, a hint of playful exasperation in her tone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s response came in a drunken giggle. “I’m just having fun… like you always tell me… to let go and have fun,” she slurred, her words drawn out as she gazed up at Agatha with a dazed, fond look. “I missed you, though,” she added with a soft pout. “Alice and Jen started making out, and I wanted to do it too, but only with you, Agatha… Only with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help the faint smirk tugging at her lips, though her tone carried a teasing edge. “Well, I’m glad to hear I wasn’t replaced by the nearest available option, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, her hazy eyes raking over Agatha with unfiltered admiration. “Replace you?” she murmured, her voice thick with affection. “Never. Have you seen yourself?” She grinned, her words coated in the kind of drunken sincerity that melted Agatha’s heart, even as she sighed inwardly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a fond smile, her fingers brushing against Rio’s arm as they reached the car. “I’m glad you had your fun, darling,” she said softly, her tone steady and patient. “But letting Alice and Jen drag you into their chaos wasn’t your brightest idea.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio just giggled again, a light, carefree sound that made Agatha’s chest tighten with affection. She helped Rio into the passenger seat of the car, making sure she was safely buckled in before closing the door behind her. Rio’s eyes were still glazed with alcohol, her hands trying—unsuccessfully—to tame her disheveled hair as she looked up at Agatha with a dopey grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re so pretty, you know that?” Rio murmured as Agatha slid into the driver’s seat, her voice thick with affection and amusement. Her eyes were glassy, but the way she looked at Agatha was undeniably adoring.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head. “You’re one to talk, my love,” she replied, her tone affectionate as she climbed into the driver’s seat and adjusted the mirrors. “You look like you’ve been dancing in a tornado.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a delighted laugh, swaying slightly in her seat before trying once again to smooth her unruly hair. “I just wanna look nice for you,” she said, her words tinged with tipsy sincerity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, a soft laugh escaping her lips. “You always look nice, Rio,” she said gently, her voice tinged with fondness. “Tornado or not.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She started the car, but not before reaching over to briefly touch Rio’s hand, her thumb brushing lightly over her knuckles. “Now, let’s get out of here. You need to sleep off your wild night.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back against the seat, her head resting against the window, a lazy smile stretching across her face. “Okay, Agatha,” she whispered, her tone soft and dreamy. “Thank you… for coming to get me. I’m glad I have you. I missed you tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest tightened at the tender vulnerability in those words, and she reached over again, her fingers lightly grazing Rio’s. Her gaze remained on the road, but her voice softened, full of love. “I missed you too, love. Let’s get you home.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the car moved through the quiet night, Rio’s breathing evened out, her head still leaning against the window. Agatha glanced at her briefly, her heart full, and her mind already running through ways to ease Rio’s inevitable hangover tomorrow. But for now, she focused on the warmth of Rio’s hand in hers and the quiet hum of the road beneath the tires.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha finally pulled into the driveway, she turned off the engine and glanced at Rio, who was slumped slightly in the passenger seat, her head resting against the window with a lazy, blissful smile. “Come on, love,” Agatha murmured as she stepped out and rounded the car, opening Rio’s door. She slid an arm around Rio’s waist, steadying her as they made their way to the front door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned heavily against Agatha, her steps wobbly and slow, but her trust in Agatha was evident in the way she let herself be guided. The cool night air brushed against them, a soothing contrast to the stuffy warmth of the bar. It was quiet now, the world around them still, as though the night had been waiting for them to return.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once inside, Agatha didn’t waste a moment. She flicked on the soft hallway light and led Rio to their bedroom, her movements careful but efficient. “Let’s get you settled, darling,” Agatha said gently, easing Rio down onto the edge of the bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio flopped onto the mattress with an uncoordinated giggle, her arms splayed out as if she didn’t have a care in the world. “You’re so good to me,” she slurred, her voice filled with drunken affection. Her head tilted back to look at Agatha, her gaze full of adoration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, crouching in front of her to slip off her shoes. “That’s because I love you, even when you’re a handful,” she teased, her voice warm with affection. She stood and moved to the dresser, pulling out a set of cozy pajamas. “Alright, love, let’s get you into something a little more comfortable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out another giggle, her arms flopping lazily as she made a halfhearted attempt to help. “You’re the best,” she mumbled, her words slurring as she allowed Agatha to guide her through the motions of changing. “The prettiest, the smartest… my Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart softened at the words, even as she rolled her eyes with playful exasperation. “Flattery will only get you so far,” she said lightly, helping Rio slip into her pajamas. “But I’ll take it for tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I had so much fun, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice still light with laughter, though it was clear she was starting to wind down from the chaos of the night. “You should’ve seen Jen and Alice, they were… they were so funny!” Rio’s voice trailed off as she turned toward Agatha, her eyes soft and unfocused, but filled with a warmth that only Agatha could pull from her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha helped Rio settle beneath the covers before slipping into bed beside her, drawing her close. Rio immediately curled into Agatha, arms wrapping around her like she never wanted to be anywhere else. Agatha tucked the blanket around them both, her touch tender as she brushed a stray lock of hair from Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You definitely had a great time tonight, my love,” Agatha murmured, her voice calm yet laced with a playful edge. “But next time, you’ve got to be a little more careful. If Alice and Jen are going to turn you into a giggling mess, I might just have to ban them from girls’ night.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a soft giggle, her breath warm against Agatha’s collarbone as her eyelids grew heavier. “But I love them,” she mumbled, her words slurred and lazy but brimming with affection. “They’re so much fun. You should come out with us more often, you know. You’d love it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a tender smile as she kissed Rio’s forehead, her fingers gently smoothing Rio’s hair back from her face. “I did come out last time, remember?” she teased softly, her voice filled with affection. “You were so busy having fun, you didn’t even notice me until all of a sudden, you decided I was the main event and practically devoured my face in front of everyone.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s brows furrowed briefly, a sleepy pout forming as she tightened her hold around Agatha. “It was the best part. I just wanted you to have fun, too,” she murmured, her voice soft and drenched in affection, like she was apologizing and confessing all at once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled quietly, the sound low and soothing as her fingers traced slow, calming patterns along Rio’s arm. “I do have fun, darling,” she said, her voice full of quiet sincerity. “But I have the most fun when I’m watching you, all smiles and laughter. Even if it ends with you draped all over me, trying to eat my face.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a small, contented laugh, nuzzling deeper into Agatha’s embrace. “Well, you’re just too irresistible,” she sighed, her words drowsy but filled with love. Agatha’s heart warmed, her smile deepening as she held Rio close, savoring the quiet, comfortable intimacy of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, now fully relaxed, sighed contentedly and settled into the comfort of Agatha’s embrace. “I’m glad you’re here,” she whispered before her breathing deepened, signaling that she was falling asleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha held her close, feeling the gentle rise and fall of Rio’s chest. For a moment, everything felt still and perfect. As she lay there beside Rio, Agatha’s fingers gently combed through her hair, and her heart swelled with the quiet love they shared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The house was peaceful, the world outside quiet. Agatha let herself close her eyes, the warmth of Rio’s body against hers a comfort she never took for granted. Despite the chaos of the night and the mischief Rio had gotten into, Agatha felt a deep, grounding sense of contentment. She didn’t mind being the one to care for Rio when things went sideways, because there was nowhere else she’d rather be than right here, with her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As her own breathing slowed to match Rio’s, Agatha felt a deep sense of contentment settle over her. Wrapped in each other’s warmth, they both drifted into a peaceful sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hangovers could wait.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, Agatha woke up to the sound of Rio groaning beside her. She turned to find Rio’s head buried deep in the pillow, her movements slow and sluggish with the weight of last night’s drinking. Agatha couldn’t help but smile softly to herself. She knew exactly how Rio would be feeling—last night had been fun for her, but the hangover was now hitting hard.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha quietly rolled out of bed, careful not to disturb Rio’s rest. She headed to the kitchen, filled a glass with water, and added a couple of aspirin. She knew from experience that this would help ease some of Rio’s discomfort, but only time would handle the rest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she returned to the bedroom, she found Rio struggling to lift her head from the pillow, squinting at the sunlight coming through the window. Agatha sat down on the edge of the bed and gently placed the glass of water and aspirin on the nightstand beside Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning, love,” Agatha said softly, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s face. “How are we feeling?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio winced at the sound of Agatha’s voice, her hand slowly reaching for the water. She took a long sip before managing a half-smile, her eyes still half-lidded. “Like I got hit by a freight train,” she mumbled with a groan. “And then danced on top of it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, sitting next to her. “Well, you were a bit of a tornado last night,” she teased, gently smoothing Rio’s messy hair back. “I think the whole bar saw just how much fun you were having. And tornado is an understatement, darling. You were having way too much fun.” She reached out and gently pushed a lock of hair from Rio’s forehead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a slow sip of the water, her eyes still half-closed as she tried to find some semblance of composure. “I don’t remember much after the third drink,” she muttered, her voice still rough. “Everything’s a blur after that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, you certainly left an impression.” Agatha smirked, her tone teasing. “You and Alice and Jen—quite the trio.” She raised an eyebrow with a playful grin. “The bartender probably needed a drink after you three, if you ask me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, rubbing her temples. “I’m sorry. I know I got a little out of hand.” She looked up at Agatha, her gaze soft. “But I had a really good time, and you’re right. I probably overdid it a bit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her expression softening. “I’m glad you had fun, but you do have to remember your limits, Rio.” She picked up the aspirin and handed it to Rio, who took them gratefully with another sip of water. “I don’t mind taking care of you, but next time, maybe pace yourself a bit, hm?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a slow nod, letting out a long sigh. “I know, I know. I just… I really needed to let go for a bit. Work, the band, everything… sometimes it feels like it’s all too much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile faded slightly, her hand gently resting on Rio’s arm. “I get it, love. You do so much already, it’s okay to take a break and unwind. Just don’t overdo it next time.” She kissed the top of Rio’s head softly. “I’m here for you, no matter what.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile widened, a playful glint dancing in her eyes. “So, do you want to know when the next gig is? You know, in case you want to join in on the fun?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head with a fond smirk. “That’s still up for debate.” She paused, her gaze softening. “But you can count on me to keep you in line.” Leaning back against the headboard, she welcomed Rio as she nestled closer. “For now, though, we can just enjoy a quiet morning. You’ve earned some rest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed contentedly, her body relaxing into Agatha’s. “That sounds perfect,” she murmured, her eyes fluttering closed. “You’re right. I really do need the rest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room grew quiet again, the only sounds the soft rustling of sheets as they both settled in. Agatha held Rio close, content to just be with her in the quiet warmth of the morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha spent the morning quietly caring for Rio, making her breakfast with gentle movements and an air of calm. She set the table with a cup of coffee, a plate of toast, and some eggs, keeping everything simple and light. The atmosphere was soft, with no rush or noise—just the comforting hum of the morning, a contrast to the chaos of the night before. Agatha knew how Rio’s head would be spinning, and she didn’t want to add any pressure. Sometimes, just being there was enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sat at the table, wrapped in a blanket, her hands cupping the warm coffee as she sipped slowly. She glanced up at Agatha with a sheepish grin, her hair still messy from sleep, and a hint of embarrassment in her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I promise I won’t get so drunk next time…” Rio mumbled, her voice low, as she looked down at her coffee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, her heart swelling with affection. She moved to sit across from Rio, taking a moment to brush her thumb over Rio’s hand. “I don’t mind taking care of you, love,” she said, her voice tender. “You’re young, and a college student—you’re allowed to have fun. But maybe just a little bit less drunk next time, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave her a small, sheepish nod. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. I definitely had too much fun last night.” She paused, then added with a small laugh, “I think Alice and Jen might’ve been a bad influence.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly. “It’s hard to resist them when they get going, isn’t it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a slow nod, her eyes twinkling despite the lingering headache. “Maybe next time, I’ll stick with just one drink…or two… or five…” she teased, her smile playful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled back, shaking her head affectionately. “Five drinks, huh? I’ll hold you to that,” she said with a smirk, her tone light but her eyes full of love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let a soft sigh slipping from her lips. “You’re too good to me, you know that?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched an eyebrow, her smirk softening into a warm smile. “It’s part of the job description, love. Someone has to keep you in line.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a raspy laugh, genuine and light. “Good luck with that. I know I’m a handful. I think you even reminded me of that yesterday.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms with mock seriousness. “Ah, so you <em>do</em> remember some things. Good to know. And don’t worry, I’m more than up for the challenge.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They fell into a comfortable silence, the hum of the morning still wrapping around them like a blanket. Rio finished her coffee, setting the empty mug on the table with a satisfied sigh. “You make the best coffee,” she murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, standing to clear the dishes. “Too much flattery will get to my head, darling.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha moved to the sink, Rio watched her with a fond smile, feeling a wave of gratitude wash over her. She might’ve felt like a train wreck physically, but being here with Agatha, cared for and loved, made everything feel right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time the dishes were done, Rio had made her way to the couch, curling up with a throw blanket. Agatha joined her, sitting close enough for Rio to rest her head on her shoulder. They didn’t need to speak; the simple act of being together was enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the sunlight streamed through the windows, painting the room in soft, golden hues, Rio whispered, “I love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her head slightly, pressing a kiss to Rio’s temple. “I love you too, my tornado.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And with that, the morning drifted on, peaceful and serene, their bond unshaken by the chaos of the night before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker.” <em>Four Quartets.)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify">The soft hum of the refrigerator filled the quiet kitchen, a constant backdrop to the early morning stillness that still lingered over the house. Rio sat at the table, her laptop glowing faintly in front of her. She hunched over the keyboard, her fingers flying with frantic determination. Around her, a fortress of books, notebooks, and loose papers formed a chaotic barrier between her and the rest of the world. A cold mug of coffee sat untouched to her right, forgotten in her singular focus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s soft giggles broke through the quiet hum of her laptop. He was sprawled on the living room rug in his dinosaur pajamas, his favorite toys scattered around him. A plastic dragon soared through the air in his small hands as he narrated a battle in excited whispers, as Señor Scratchy looked weirdly interested by what was happening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped into the kitchen, her hair pulled back, an empty mug of tea in her hand. Her eyes immediately fell on Rio, who hadn’t even noticed her entrance. The exhaustion on Rio’s face was painfully clear—the dark circles under her eyes, her pale complexion, and the tension in her hunched shoulders spoke volumes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s laughter caught Agatha’s attention, and she smiled softly. “Good morning, sweetheart,” she said to him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning!” Nicky beamed up at her, his dragon mid-flight. “Look, Mama! The dragon’s winning!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled and crouched beside him, giving the dragon an approving nod. “Of course it is. That dragon looks unstoppable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah!” Nicky cheered, lifting it higher. Then, his gaze shifted to the kitchen table. “Mom’s still working?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile faltered slightly as she glanced at Rio, still typing furiously, oblivious to the world around her. “She is,” Agatha said gently. “She’s working on something really important right now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But as Agatha stood, her eyes lingered on Rio. Her heart ached at the sight of her partner pushing herself so hard, neglecting everything else, even her own well-being. For now, she said nothing, choosing instead to place her hand on Nicky’s shoulder, grounding herself in the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She resolved to let Rio handle things her way—at least for now. But deep down, she knew this couldn’t go on much longer. It had been days since Rio had entered this spiral of work, as the fourth chapter of her thesis was due soon.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stood quietly in the kitchen, her still empty mug of tea cradled in her hands. Her gaze drifted between Rio and Nicky, the contrast between them sharp. Nicky, bright-eyed and full of energy, bounced his dragon through imaginary battles, his laughter light and carefree. Rio, on the other hand, was a picture of exhaustion—her dark circles deeper than ever, her movements jittery as she reached for her mug of coffee with a slightly trembling hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She still hadn’t noticed Agatha standing there.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed softly, stepping further into the room. Her voice was calm, careful not to disrupt the fragile balance of Rio’s concentration. “Have you eaten yet?” she asked gently, her tone more suggestion than demand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s response was immediate but dismissive. Without looking up, she waved a hand in Agatha’s direction. “I’ll eat later,” she mumbled, her eyes fixed on the screen, her fingers continuing to type at a rapid pace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line as she considered saying more but decided against it. Pushing Rio now would only cause her to retreat further into her work, or move to the library, where Agatha wouldn’t be able to keep an eye on her. Instead, she moved quietly to the counter, pouring herself another cup of tea while keeping one eye on Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her heart ached as she watched Rio, so consumed by the weight of her deadline that she hadn’t even noticed the way Nicky kept glancing at her, as though waiting for her to look up and notice him. It wasn’t like Rio to be so disconnected from him—or from herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, Agatha didn’t push. Not yet. Instead, she leaned against the counter, sipping her tea, her presence a quiet reassurance in the background of Rio’s chaos.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky padded over to Rio, his small feet making soft sounds against the hardwood floor. His face was lit up with excitement as he held out a drawing in his tiny hands—a vibrant sketch of a dragon in bold reds and greens. Tugging gently on Rio’s sleeve, he beamed up at her. “Look, Mom! I drew a dragon!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s fingers froze over the keyboard for just a moment before resuming their hurried typing. She glanced briefly at the paper, her eyes unfocused, and muttered, “That’s great, kiddo. Show Mama, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The brightness in Nicky’s expression dimmed slightly, his little shoulders drooping as he clutched the drawing tighter. He hesitated for a moment, glancing back at her as though hoping she might change her mind. But Rio was already engrossed in her laptop again, the screen’s glow reflecting off her weary face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky turned and shuffled over to Agatha, his steps slower now. “Mama, look at my dragon,” he said softly, holding up the paper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crouched down to his level immediately, setting her mug aside to give him her full attention. “Wow, Nicky! This is amazing,” she said, her voice warm and genuine. She traced a finger over the dragon’s wings. “Look at those scales! Did you add all these little details yourself?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up again, and he nodded eagerly. “Yeah! And see? He’s breathing fire!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha ruffled his hair with a soft chuckle. “He’s a fierce one. You did such a great job, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her gaze flickered over to Rio as she stood, her concern growing. Rio wasn’t usually like this—detached, dismissive. Normally, she would have scooped Nicky into her lap, showering him with praise and excitement for his artwork. But now, she barely seemed to register his presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a quiet sigh, placing a hand on Nicky’s shoulder as he returned to his toys. She didn’t say anything to Rio, but her worry deepened. Something had to give soon, and Agatha could only hope it wouldn’t take too much of a toll on the woman she loved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Over the next few days, Rio’s exhaustion became more apparent. She went to bed later than Agatha and woke up earlier, her usual energy, the spark that defined her, started to fade. She snapped at small things—Agatha’s gentle suggestions, Nicky’s harmless questions—her temper flaring with surprising intensity. Agatha noticed it, but she held back, giving Rio the space she thought she needed. After all, Rio had always been fiercely independent, pushing through challenges in her own way. But this felt different.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">One evening, Agatha observed Rio from across the room, her focus clearly slipping. Rio sat hunched over her notes, rubbing her eyes in frustration as her once meticulous handwriting became increasingly erratic. Her mind was in overdrive, but it seemed out of sync with her body, each thought slipping through her fingers just as quickly as it came. She muttered to herself under her breath, rereading the same sentence over and over, but her eyes seemed unable to grasp the meaning of the words anymore. It was clear she was struggling, but she wouldn’t admit it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, it happened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A faint but unmistakable trickle of blood began to run from Rio’s nose, barely visible at first, but enough to catch Agatha’s attention. It was slow, a thin line of red at the edge of her nostril that quickly began to darken the tissue Rio had hastily pressed against her face. Agatha’s stomach dropped. She had never seen this before—the way Rio’s body would give way under the pressure of stress, the way exhaustion manifested in her withering health.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tried to mask it, of course. She grabbed a tissue from the desk, wiping the blood away as if it were a minor inconvenience. But Agatha could see it—the slight tremble in Rio’s hand as she pressed the tissue against her nose, the way she tried to avoid eye contact, hoping the problem would just vanish if she ignored it long enough. It was the same pattern every time: deny, push through, ignore the signs. But Agatha wasn’t fooled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her heart sank, and she took a slow, steadying breath, pushing aside her own worry to focus on Rio. “You’re working too hard, love,” Agatha said, her voice soft but carrying the weight of concern. She stepped closer, resting a hand on Rio’s shoulder, feeling the tightness in her muscles. Rio didn’t meet her gaze. Her eyes were clouded with fatigue, glassy and distant as she wiped the blood away, forcing a small smile in an attempt to brush it off.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s nothing,” Rio muttered, her voice thick with exhaustion. “Just a little nosebleed. Happens sometimes.” She turned back to her laptop, pushing through the discomfort as if it were just another obstacle to be ignored.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers clenched in silent frustration. The way Rio always downplayed her own struggles made Agatha’s heart ache. She had never seen Rio fall so deep into this cycle before, and it hurt to watch her avoid the help she so desperately needed. Agatha leaned in closer, her touch a comforting pressure on Rio’s back as she bent down to speak softly, yet firmly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, love,” she said, her words gentle but unyielding. “This is more than just a nosebleed. You’ve been pushing yourself too hard. You need to stop.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked slowly, her glazed expression reluctant to meet Agatha’s eyes. For a moment, there was a long silence between them, only the soft rustle of paper and the distant hum of the city outside filling the space. Rio’s hand trembled slightly as she reached for another tissue, pressing it to her nose in an attempt to staunch the bleeding, but it was clear that her efforts weren’t enough. The blood still flowed, slow but steady, staining the tissue and making Rio’s face pale.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s really nothing, it always stops after a while,” Rio insisted weakly, her voice now laced with a tired resignation. “I just need to focus. I’ll be fine.” She wiped at her nose again, her movements slow, too slow, and Agatha could feel the frustration rising in her chest. This wasn’t Rio—this wasn’t the woman who was vibrant, full of life, and unstoppable. This was a woman on the verge of collapse, pretending that everything was okay when it wasn’t.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know you’ll be fine,” Agatha said finally, her voice tender and calm, like she was letting Rio off the hook for just a moment. “But you’re not fine right now, are you, love? I can see that.” She let her words linger in the air, allowing them to settle between them, without pressing any further.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t respond right away. She just kept wiping at her nose, her movements sluggish and exhausted. Agatha could feel the weight of the silence stretching, but she didn’t mind. She had learned that sometimes, saying less was far more effective. The last thing Rio needed right now was more forceful insistence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe you’re right,” Rio finally muttered after what felt like an eternity of hesitation. She didn’t meet Agatha’s eyes, her voice barely above a whisper, as if admitting it aloud would somehow make the reality too real. “But I can’t stop now. There’s too much to do. I need to finish this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t argue, although she wanted to. Instead, she gave Rio a soft, understanding smile, her thumb lightly brushing against her back. “I know, love,” she murmured, her voice full of compassion. “But we both know you can’t keep going at this pace. Not forever.” She leaned down, pressing a kiss to the top of Rio’s head. “But I’ll wait. I’ll wait until you’re ready to listen.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a few steps back, sensing that Rio needed the time to come to terms with it on her own. She wasn’t going to force the issue. Not now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead, she simply walked to the kitchen to prepare a cup of tea for them both, the comforting sound of the kettle starting to whistle filling the quiet space between them. She knew that sometimes, love wasn’t about forcing the issue. It was about showing up when needed and giving the other person the room to decide when they were ready.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next day, the pattern continued. Rio’s movements were sluggish, and her shortness of breath had become more frequent. Still, she brushed it off, telling Agatha not to worry. “I’m fine. Just need to finish this one thing,” she insisted, but her voice cracked slightly, betraying her fatigue.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, every time Agatha reached out—offering tea, a meal, or simply a quiet moment together—Rio shut it down. “I’m not a child,” she snapped one afternoon when Agatha insisted she take a break. “I can handle this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But it was clear she couldn’t.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky had always been perceptive, his young eyes catching details that others might miss. One morning, as they sat at the breakfast table, Nicky stared up at Agatha with a puzzled frown. Rio, as usual by now, was hunched over her laptop, her fingers dancing across the keys as if the world outside her screen didn’t exist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama, why is Mom always on the computer?” Nicky asked innocently, his small voice breaking the silence that had settled over the room. “Do she not wanna play with me anymore?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart tightened at the question, and she turned to give Nicky a warm, reassuring smile. She could tell he was confused and a little hurt, sensing that something wasn’t quite right. She ruffled his hair gently and leaned down to his level.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, sweetie,” she said softly, her tone calming, “Mom is just working on something really important. But don’t worry, she’ll have time to play with you soon, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky seemed to accept this, but there was a lingering look of uncertainty in his eyes. He didn’t say anything more, but Agatha could tell he wasn’t entirely convinced by her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha set a plate of food by Rio’s side, she couldn’t help but watch the way Rio barely acknowledged it. Her attention was still entirely focused on the glowing screen in front of her. She didn’t even reach for her coffee, let alone the breakfast Agatha had taken the time to prepare.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a moment, Agatha quietly placed a glass of water next to Rio’s laptop. She knew Rio hadn’t been drinking enough lately. Still, the pattern remained: Rio barely touched either, lost in her own world of deadlines and work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s worry deepened as the days passed. She tried subtly encouraging Rio to eat, drink, take breaks, but Rio always dismissed her with a half-hearted smile and the same reassurance, “I’m fine, Agatha. Just a little tired.” Yet Agatha could see the fatigue in her eyes, the way Rio’s movements had become sluggish, like she was operating on autopilot. The stubbornness Rio usually had was now a defense against the reality she didn’t want to confront.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Later that afternoon, Agatha walked back into the kitchen, a quiet sigh escaping her as she noticed Rio still sitting in the same spot she’d been in hours ago. The kitchen was dimmer now, with the sun beginning to sink lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the room. Rio’s posture was slumped, her face pale, and her hands trembled slightly as she typed furiously, her focus locked on the screen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart sank at the sight. She had hoped Rio might have taken a break, gotten some rest, but it seemed that wasn’t the case. She glanced at the counter, where Nicky was sitting, holding his stuffed dragon with a hopeful look on his face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom?” Nicky asked, his little voice filled with longing as he padded over to Rio. “Can you help me fix the tear in my dragon’s wing?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t even look up, her eyes glued to the screen. Her fingers stilled for a moment as she took in the request, but instead of the usual warmth in her response, she sighed—too loudly, too harshly—and muttered, “Not now, Nicky. It’s not the time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her tone came out sharper than she intended, and Agatha could see the way Nicky flinched, his bottom lip trembling. It was as if a weight had settled on his tiny shoulders, and in that moment, he didn’t understand why his mom wasn’t engaging with him, why she was so distant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes welled up with tears, and before Agatha could say anything, he turned and fled to her side, collapsing into her arms with a small, heartbroken sob. Agatha immediately wrapped him in a tight, soothing hug, her own worry for him increasing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s not your fault, sweetheart,” she whispered, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “Rio’s just really tired right now. She doesn’t mean to upset you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky sniffled, his tears soaking into Agatha’s shirt as he clung to her. “But she doesn’t want to play with me anymore,” he said, his voice small and vulnerable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha held him close, rubbing his back in slow, comforting circles. “She’ll come around, baby. She’s just been working really hard, okay? It’s not you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced over at Rio again, her heart breaking as she saw how absorbed Rio was in her work. She had been pushing herself too hard, and now it was starting to show—not just in how she looked, but in the way she was neglecting her son, the one person who needed her most. The guilt weighed heavily on Agatha, but she knew something had to be done. Rio needed to rest, to reconnect with her family—before it was too late.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, Nicky sat quietly on the living room floor, his crayons scattered around him as he focused intently on coloring in his drawing. The soft hum of the TV was the only background noise, a contrast to the silence that had settled over the house. Agatha moved around the kitchen, preparing dinner, but her attention kept drifting back to Rio. She couldn’t ignore the way Rio’s fingers flew across the keyboard, her face pale and tired, eyes never leaving the screen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, sensing the atmosphere in the room, timidly looked up from his drawing and shuffled over to Rio once again. He tugged on her sleeve, his voice small and hopeful. “Mom, do you wanna see my new dance move? I made it up all by myself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio barely glanced up, her expression distant and sharp. “Not now, Nicky. I’m busy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her tone was quick and dismissive, and the sharpness of it made Agatha’s stomach tighten. She had been avoiding this confrontation, hoping Rio would come to her senses, but she couldn’t let it go on any longer. This wasn’t just about work anymore—it was about Rio’s health, and the way she was disconnecting from everything around her, and about how it was hurting Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha finished what she was doing and walked over to Rio, her footsteps soft but determined. She stood next to the table, her voice calm yet firm as she spoke. “Rio, you need to stop. You’re pushing yourself too hard. This can’t keep going.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t even look up. Her fingers continued to type furiously, her posture hunched and tense. “I’m fine, Agatha,” she snapped, her voice laced with frustration. “I don’t need to stop. I’ve got to finish this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart sank as she saw the walls go up—again. This wasn’t the Rio she knew. The one who listened, the one who cared. This was a woman who was running on fumes and refusing to acknowledge how much she needed help.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From the couch, Nicky had stopped coloring. He watched the exchange with wide, confused eyes. His small brow furrowed in worry as he whispered to Agatha, “Is Mom okay? Why is she being so…mean?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crouched down beside him, squeezing his little hand gently. She forced a smile, trying to keep things calm for his sake. “She’s just really tired, sweetie. You know, sometimes grown-ups get really tired when they’re working hard. But we’ll take care of her, okay? She’s going to be fine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t look convinced, his eyes still darting to Rio, who remained engrossed in her work. Agatha wanted to soothe him more, but a part of her knew this situation couldn’t stay the way it was. They couldn’t let Rio push herself to the breaking point, especially when she was shutting out the people who loved her most.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This stopped now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha knelt beside Rio’s chair, her posture firm as she gazed at her, her voice low but unmistakably hard. “Stop, Rio,” she said, her words deliberate and unwavering. “You’re making yourself sick. <em>This</em> isn’t sustainable. You can’t keep pushing yourself like this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, there was silence, only the soft hum of the fridge filling the space. Then, without warning, Rio slammed her laptop shut, the sound jarring in the quiet room. She snapped, her exhaustion and frustration mixing into a sharp edge. “Why are you doing this, Agatha?” she demanded, her voice rising. “I’m not a child! You can’t just boss me around!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words stung, cutting deeper than Rio intended. Agatha’s heart clenched, but she didn’t flinch. She understood. The tension between them had been building for days, and it had finally erupted. Rio was beyond her breaking point, and she was lashing out. Agatha knew it wasn’t about her—it was about everything Rio was carrying, about the pressure she was placing on herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Agatha could respond, she heard the shuffle of small feet and saw Nicky’s wide eyes staring at them both from across the room. He had stopped coloring, his face etched with confusion and concern, unsure of what was happening. Agatha’s heart softened for him, and without hesitation, she turned toward him, her tone immediately shifting to calm and reassuring.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nicky, it’s okay, sweetie,” she said gently. “Why don’t you go play in your room for a little while? Mom and I need to talk for a second.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hesitated, glancing nervously between Agatha and Rio, who was now visibly upset. He opened his mouth to say something, but Agatha gave him a soft nudge, a reassuring smile that he trusted. With a small, reluctant nod, he grabbed his stuffed dragon and walked slowly toward his room, casting one last glance at Rio before disappearing down the hallway.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched him go, her chest tightening with a pang of guilt. She turned back to Rio, her expression softening, but her resolve remained firm. This couldn’t go on any longer. She couldn’t let Rio continue to burn herself out while she stayed on the sidelines, waiting for her to snap out of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once Nicky was out of earshot, Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. She turned back to Rio, her tone shifting slightly, but the firmness in her voice remained.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I never said you were a child, Rio,” Agatha replied, her words measured. “But you’re ignoring your health, and I can’t just stand by and do nothing while you destroy yourself. You’re pushing yourself too hard. You’re not invincible, and it’s my job to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face flushed, her eyes narrowing as she shot back, her voice sharp with frustration. “Your <em>job</em>?” Rio repeated, her tone biting. “I don’t need a babysitter, I don’t need you to take care of me, Agatha. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own life. You’re always treating me like I’m fragile, like I can’t handle things. It’s exhausting!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s not what I’m doing,” Agatha said, her frustration starting to seep into her words. “But you’re young, Rio. You think you can handle everything at once, but you don’t see what it’s doing to you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s cheeks flushed, her voice rising. “Oh, so this is about the age thing again, huh? Because I’m younger, I don’t know how to take care of myself? Because I’m younger, I can’t make my own decisions?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words hit Agatha like a slap. Her chest tightened, her throat going dry as Rio’s words landed. She had known the age gap between them could be an issue, but hearing Rio say it like that—so pointedly, so harshly—made the difference between them feel insurmountable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a step back, her arms falling to her sides. “That’s not what I meant,” she said quietly, but the damage was done. Agatha’s heart clenched, but she didn’t back down. “I’m not treating you like you’re fragile. I’m worried about you. I’m trying to help, but you keep shutting me out, acting like everything is fine when clearly it’s not. You’re exhausted, Rio. You’re running on empty, and I can see it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio threw her hands up in exasperation, her frustration turning into something else—something deeper, something raw. “I don’t need your help, Agatha! I’ve been doing this on my own for years, and I’m fine. I don’t need you playing the overprotective partner all the time. Just because you’re older than me doesn’t mean you have to micromanage my life! I get it, okay? You’ve been through more, you’re wiser, but that doesn’t mean I don’t know how to handle my own life.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a deep breath, trying to steady herself, but her voice came out unsteady, edged with hurt. “This isn’t about your age, Rio. It’s about you being so caught up in everything that you’re letting yourself fall apart. I can’t just sit back and watch it happen. I love you too much to do that. You’re working yourself to exhaustion, and it’s not healthy. I’ve seen this before. I’ve <em>done</em> this before. I practically invented that move. And trust me, it never ends well.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a bitter laugh, a laugh that felt too heavy for someone so young. “Yeah, well, sometimes I feel like you’re not seeing <em>me</em> anymore. You’re so focused on trying to protect me and take care of me that you forget I’m not some helpless kid. I’m not your little project to fix, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words stung, sharper than anything Rio had said before. Agatha’s eyes flashed with a mix of hurt and disbelief. “That’s not what this is, Rio. I’m not trying to fix you. I’m trying to be there for you. And I’m trying to protect you because I love you. But you keep pushing me away.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s voice cracked, the frustration and exhaustion finally catching up with her. “I just don’t want to feel like I’m being treated differently because I’m younger. It’s like you don’t think I can handle things the way you do. I don’t need someone to constantly remind me of the gap between us. I just want you to see <em>me</em>—not the age difference, not the worry. Just… me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached. She stepped closer, but she wasn’t sure if Rio wanted the comfort right now. Her hands trembled slightly as she spoke, her voice a whisper. “I do see you, Rio. I see everything about you. But I can’t just watch you do this to yourself, pretending everything’s okay when it’s not.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stared at her, her eyes full of tears now, but still defiant. “I know what I’m doing, Agatha,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “But I can’t stop. I can’t just… let go. I can’t. I’m scared.” Rio’s voice, her face flushed with the effort of holding everything in. “I need to do this, Agatha,” she whispered, her voice wavering with exhaustion. “You don’t get it. I can’t stop now. I’m so close… I can’t fail now.” The words felt like they were tearing her apart, and yet she kept pushing them out, desperate to hold on to the only thing she felt she had control over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart broke as she watched Rio unravel, her strong facade crumbling before her eyes. She stepped closer, her hands trembling as she cupped Rio’s face gently, her touch soft but insistent. “You don’t have to do this alone, love,” Agatha murmured, her voice soothing and low. “You need a break. This chapter—this paper—it’s not worth destroying yourself over.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened her mouth to argue, but her words faltered on her lips. She felt the weight of her exhaustion settling in, the adrenaline that had kept her going for so long finally giving out. Her breath hitched as the tears began to spill over, her chest tightening as the burden she had been carrying became too much.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a choked sob, Rio buried her face in her folded arms on the table, unable to keep the dam from breaking any longer. The tears came in waves, loud and broken, as the exhaustion, the frustration, the fear, and the pressure all came crashing down at once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha immediately moved to her side, her arms wrapping around Rio, pulling her into her embrace, from her chair to the floor where Agatha was still kneeling. She whispered soothingly into her hair, her voice low and steady. “It’s okay, love. I’ve got you. You don’t have to hold it all in anymore. Let it out, darling. Let it all out.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s sobs echoed through the room as she finally allowed herself to let go, the tension in her body easing just a little as Agatha held her close. Agatha stroked her hair gently, murmuring soft words of comfort, feeling Rio’s body shudder with each sob.  “I’m so tired, Agatha. I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha held her tighter, pressing a kiss to the top of Rio’s head. “You don’t have to. You don’t have to keep going like this. Let me help. Let me in.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m so sorry,” Rio gasped between tears, her voice muffled against Agatha’s chest. “I didn’t mean to… I didn’t want to make you worry, or to be so mean. I just… I can’t keep doing this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tightened her hold on her, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. “You don’t have to do anything right now, Rio. You’re human. And it’s okay to rest.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio’s sobs were the only thing they could hear in the room, Nicky’s small face peeked around the corner of the stairs, his big blue eyes wide with concern as he watched the exchange between the two adults. He had heard the raised voices and seen the tears, and now, with his heart full of worry, he hovered in the doorway, unsure whether to approach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha noticed him immediately, her gaze softening. She gave him a gentle wave, her voice calm and reassuring. “It’s okay, sweetheart,” she said, her tone soothing. “Mom just needs a little love and hugs right now. Why don’t you come give her some?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hesitated for a moment, his small feet shuffling as if unsure whether to cross the distance, but Agatha’s warm smile and gentle encouragement gave him the courage he needed. Slowly, he padded over, his tiny hand reaching out toward Rio, who was still holding herself together with Agatha’s comfort.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With careful steps, Nicky reached them and knelt beside Rio, hesitating just for a moment before he wrapped his arms around her. His embrace was tentative, but his words were full of love and sincerity. “I love you, Mom,” he whispered, his voice soft and sweet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The simplicity of his words, the pure, unconditional love from her little boy, broke the last of Rio’s defenses. The dam that had held her emotions back cracked completely. Her sobs came harder now, her chest heaving with the release of everything she had been holding in for so long. She clung to both Agatha and Nicky, her arms folding over her chest as if trying to hold onto the love that she so desperately needed but had been too afraid to accept.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, feeling the weight of the moment, wrapped her arms around both of them, pulling them into a tight embrace. She pressed a kiss to the top of Nicky’s head and then to Rio’s, her voice soft as she whispered, “You’re not alone, love. You have us. Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s sobs quieted, though her tears continued to fall freely as she held on to them. She felt so incredibly small, so utterly vulnerable, yet for the first time in a long while, she didn’t feel like she had to carry the weight of everything on her own.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the quiet moments passed, the weight of the tension in the room began to ease. Agatha continued to hold Rio and Nicky, offering her steady warmth and comfort. Nicky, still hugging Rio with all the love his little heart could muster, looked up at Agatha, sensing the shift in the room but unable to understand it fully.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s voice was soft but caring when she spoke, a question laced with concern. “Do you need Lilia, love?” she asked, knowing how much Rio respected and cherished her adoptive mother. “She can come over if you want.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head slowly, her face still buried in Agatha’s shoulder as her sobs slowly quieted. She pulled away just enough to look into Agatha’s eyes, her gaze clouded with exhaustion and vulnerability. “No, I’m fine,” she murmured, her voice cracking slightly from the emotional release. “I just… I just need you. I need to take care of this on my own.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t push her further, understanding the unspoken truth behind Rio’s words. Lilia was a constant source of strength for Rio, but sometimes, all Rio needed was to know she wasn’t alone in the fight—<em>that</em> was what Agatha offered her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha cupped Rio’s cheek gently, her thumb brushing away the lingering tears. “You are doing this, love,” she said softly, her voice low and comforting. “You’re not doing it alone, though. You don’t have to carry it all by yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, closing her eyes as she let out a shaky breath. “I know,” she whispered. “I’m just so… tired.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached as she pulled Rio closer once more, rubbing her back in slow, soothing circles. “I know,” she said again. “But you don’t have to be strong all the time. You can rest now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The quiet of the moment, with Nicky nestled beside them, filled the space. In that moment, Rio wasn’t the overworked, overwhelmed PhD student pushing herself too hard—she was simply <em>Rio</em>, and she was allowed to rest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a while, Rio’s sobs quieted completely, leaving her with a soft, exhausted breath. Agatha, feeling the gentle pulse of Rio’s body in her arms, guided her slowly toward the couch. She helped her sit, draping a soft blanket over her shoulders as Rio sank into the cushions. The room felt warm and still, the chaos of the argument now just a memory, replaced by a peaceful kind of silence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky climbed onto the couch beside Rio. His little hand gently rested on her arm as if offering what comfort he could. Agatha, sensing the need for both space and tenderness, moved to the kitchen and returned with a glass of water and some crackers. She handed the water to Rio, encouraging her gently, “Take a sip, love. You need to stay hydrated.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took the glass, her hands still trembling a little, but she did as Agatha asked, taking a small, steady drink. Agatha smiled softly, sitting next to her and brushing a hand through Rio’s hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But it was Nicky who spoke next, his voice quiet but full of sincerity. “I can share my dragon with you, Mom,” he said shyly, his little voice carrying a weight of understanding far beyond his years. “He always helps me when I’m sad. I think he’ll help you too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked up at him, her gaze softening, and for a brief moment, the exhaustion and sadness in her eyes seemed to lift. She watched as Nicky handed her his stuffed dragon, his small hands trembling just a little, as though he knew the importance of the gesture. Rio hesitated for just a moment, and then, with a small, shaky breath, she accepted the dragon into her arms. She clutched it tightly to her chest, and before she could stop it, a fresh wave of tears spilled down her cheeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, my little love,” she whispered, her voice raw. “I needed this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky smiled up at her, his eyes wide with love and concern. “You’re welcome, Mom. I’m glad I can help,” he said, before hugging her gently.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched the moment unfold, her heart full as she saw the bond between mother and son so clearly. The way Nicky, even at his young age, instinctively knew how to bring comfort to his mother was nothing short of beautiful. Agatha’s throat tightened as she saw Rio holding the stuffed dragon, her small comfort in a world that often felt too heavy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached for Rio’s hand, giving it a soft squeeze. “We’ve got you, love. It’s okay to lean on us,” Agatha murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, sniffling, but her eyes began to clear as she settled deeper into the warmth of the blanket, the steady presence of Agatha and Nicky surrounding her like a protective cocoon. As she held the dragon close, her body seemed to relax, the storm of emotions slowly ebbing away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, her heart full of tenderness and relief, leaned in and gently kissed the top of Rio’s head. The kiss was soft and lingering, the quiet reassurance of someone who had always been there. “Everything will be alright,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “I’ve got you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyelids fluttered, and for a moment, she seemed to nod off, the weight of exhaustion finally catching up with her. Her body slowly relaxed into the couch, the stuffed dragon still clutched tightly to her chest, as though it were the one thing she could hold onto in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, now seated beside her, watched over her with an unspoken protectiveness. His little hand brushed gently over Rio’s arm, and he snuggled closer to her, curling up beside her on the couch. The warmth of the room and the steady presence of his Mom and his Mama seemed to bring him a sense of comfort too.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, her gaze never leaving Rio, gently ran her fingers through her hair. She could feel the tension in Rio’s body finally easing, the exhaustion taking over. She didn’t try to move her. It was clear that Rio needed rest more than anything else right now. Agatha adjusted the blanket around her, making sure she was comfortable, and sat back against the arm of the couch, still keeping a close eye on both Rio and Nicky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few minutes, the steady rhythm of Rio’s breathing was the only sound in the room. She had fallen into a deep, much-needed sleep, the stuffed dragon still pressed tightly against her. Agatha smiled softly, her heart swelling with love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, watching Rio rest, gave Agatha a small, contented smile. “She’s sleeping now,” he said quietly, as if he was proud to have helped.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her voice gentle. “She is, love. And you helped her so much. You’re such a good boy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, his small face lighting up with a joy that made Agatha’s heart swell. They sat there together, in the quiet of their home, the soft sounds of Rio’s breathing the only thing filling the space, surrounded by the love they shared. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio slept peacefully on the couch, Agatha turned her attention to Nicky, who was sitting beside her, quietly watching his mom with concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gently nudged him closer, her voice soft and reassuring. “Hey, buddy,” she said, her tone calm and warm, “Do you know why Mom was so upset?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shook his head, his brow furrowing as he glanced at Rio. “She was sad. And she wouldn’t play with me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her eyes drifting to Rio for a moment before she turned her attention back to Nicky. “That’s right, sweetheart. She’s been really tired lately, and sometimes when people don’t take care of themselves, they get very worn out, and it makes them feel a little sad or frustrated.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes widened a bit, processing her words. “Because she was working. A lot.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly at how perceptive he was. “Yes, she was working a lot, and sometimes when you work too hard, you forget to take care of yourself. And that can make your body feel sick, just like what happened with Mom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked back at his mom, his small fingers tracing the edge of a cushion. “But she didn’t want to stop.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, she didn’t,” Agatha agreed, her voice gentle. “Sometimes people think they have to keep going and that resting is a sign of weakness. But it’s not. Taking a break is really important, even when you don’t want to. And sometimes, when they don’t listen to their body, like Mom didn’t, it’s hard for them to realize they need help.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded slowly, his young face thoughtful. “But I helped her, right? I gave her my dragon.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled, and she reached over to ruffle Nicky’s hair. “You did, sweetheart. You helped her so much. You gave her love and comfort, and that means more than anything. You’re very brave to be there for her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He beamed at the praise, his earlier concern easing away. “I just want her to feel better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know, love,” Agatha said softly, “And you’re doing just that. You’re helping her heal in ways even she might not realize.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky leaned back against the couch, still watching Rio sleep, Agatha felt a deep sense of gratitude. This little family, in all their moments of struggle, always found ways to come together. She couldn’t ask for anything more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p>

  <em>So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years— </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Twenty years largely wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Trying to use words, and every attempt<br /></em>
</p><p>
  <em>Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure<br /></em>
</p><p>
  <em>Because one has only learnt to get the better of words<br /></em>
</p><p>
  <em>For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which </em>
</p><p>
  <em>One is no longer disposed to say it.</em>

</p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker.” <em>Four Quartets.)</em></p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The morning light filtered through the curtains of their bedroom, painting the walls and furniture in soft hues of gold and amber. The quiet warmth of the sun’s rays caressed Rio’s skin, drawing her out of the heavy embrace of sleep. She stirred slowly beneath the covers, stretching lazily as the weight of the previous day’s exhaustion began to lift, leaving behind a peaceful stillness she hadn’t felt in what seemed like forever. Her eyelids fluttered open, adjusting to the soft light that filled the room.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Across the room, Agatha sat in the armchair by the window, a steaming mug of tea in one hand and a well-worn book in the other. Her hair was pulled back into a loose braid, strands escaping to frame her face in a way that made Rio’s heart skip, and her expression was calm but watchful.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The moment she noticed Rio moving, she set her book aside and placed her tea on the small table beside her.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Good morning, love,” Agatha said softly, her voice a blend of relief and affection. She stood, crossing the room to sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“How are you feeling?” Agatha asked, her voice low and soothing, but laced with a note of concern she couldn’t quite hide. Her sharp blue eyes softened as they searched Rio’s face, taking in every detail—the faint crease between her brows, the lingering flush of sleep on her cheeks, the way her lashes cast delicate shadows on her skin. There was a quiet intensity in Agatha’s gaze, a focus that felt almost protective, as though she were willing her lover to be well just by looking at her. “I was starting to get concerned - fourteen hours of sleep isn’t what you’re usually used to.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio blinked up at her, her own hazel eyes still heavy with sleep, but there was a faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips. She stretched slightly, her arms brushing against the soft sheets as she tried to shake off the remnants of her dreams. “Fourteen hours?” she croaked, her voice rough from disuse but carrying a touch of disbelief.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s lips quirked into a wry smile, though the concern in her expression didn’t waver. “Fourteen,” she confirmed, brushing a strand of Rio’s dark hair away from her face. Her fingers lingered for a moment, grazing Rio’s temple with a tenderness that spoke volumes. “Not exactly your norm, and you had me a little worried,” she admitted, her thumb absently tracing small, soothing circles on the back of Rio’s hand.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio let out a soft chuckle, her voice still tinged with sleepiness but warm and familiar. “Guess I needed it,” she said, her tone light, though she could see the worry etched into Agatha’s features. She shifted slightly under the blankets, trying to sit up, but Agatha’s hand on her shoulder stopped her with a gentle but firm pressure.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Easy,” Agatha murmured, her tone as much a command as it was a plea. “You don’t have to rush. Just… take a moment. Please.” Her eyes met Rio’s, and for a moment, there was nothing but the quiet understanding that passed between them—a silent acknowledgment of how deeply Agatha cared, and how much Rio appreciated it, even when she didn’t always know how to say it.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio sighed, her body sinking back into the plush pillows as she nodded. “You really do worry too much, you know,” she teased softly, though her smile was tinged with gratitude.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“And you give me plenty of reasons to,” Agatha shot back, her tone light but her gaze unwavering. She reached for the glass of water on the bedside table, handing it to Rio with the kind of care one might use to handle something fragile. “Drink,” she said gently, but firmly, and Rio couldn’t help but comply, her lips curling into a faint smirk as she took the glass.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Bossy,” Rio muttered, though there was no heat in her words, only affection.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha arched a brow, her lips twitching in amusement. “And don’t you forget it, darling.” But her hand lingered on Rio’s for a moment longer than necessary, her thumb brushing across Rio’s knuckles as if grounding herself in the simple fact that Rio was here, awake, and okay.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio blinked a few times, her gaze focusing on Agatha. Her throat felt dry, the feeling of dehydration making every swallow an effort, but the concern in Agatha’s eyes—the way she looked at Rio, as if she were the only thing that mattered in that moment—made something inside Rio loosen. The constant weight of anxiety she’d been carrying for days began to feel just a little bit lighter. She brought the glass up to her mouth and sipped softly.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I… I’m still tired,” Rio admitted, her voice still a little raspy with sleep despite the water, as if she had to clear her throat just to speak.<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>She pushed herself up to sit against the headboard, the blankets pooling in her lap. The warmth of the bed and the quietness of the morning seemed to hold her in place, and for a moment, she didn’t feel like she had to run, to keep moving, to keep pretending everything was fine. “But…” She paused, her gaze drifting down to her hands, which rested loosely on top of the blankets. “I think I’m less overwhelmed. Like my brain isn’t racing a mile a minute anymore.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha’s sharp eyes didn’t miss a thing. She studied Rio with a closeness that bordered on intimate, her gaze moving over Rio’s face, noting the faint shadows under her eyes, the subtle tremor in her hands as she adjusted the blankets. Agatha’s expression softened, the edges of her concern giving way to something warmer, something almost like relief. She reached out, her fingers gentle as they tucked a disheveled strand of Rio’s hair behind her ear, the touch so tender it made Rio’s chest ache.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“That’s good,” Agatha murmured, her thumb brushing lightly against Rio’s cheek. “You scared me a little yesterday. You’ve been pushing yourself way too hard, love.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I know,” Rio murmured, her voice a little thicker now, as though the guilt was making it harder to speak. “I just…” She hesitated, the words caught in her throat like something fragile, something she wasn’t sure she was ready to say. Her voice faltered, and the silence stretched between them, thick with the weight of unspoken things.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Agatha didn’t push, letting the silence settle between them, a safe space for Rio to breathe, to gather her thoughts, and maybe let the walls she’d built around herself start to crumble. Instead, she reached for the glass of water in Rio’s hand and nudged it higher, encouraging Rio to drink some more.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Here,” Agatha said softly, her voice full of the quiet affection that Rio craved, as if the simple act of reminding her to drink her water was an unspoken promise to take care of her. “Drink some more first. We’ll talk when you’re ready.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Rio raised the glass, the coolness of the water soothing the dryness in her throat, the sensation of liquid slipping down her parched throat comforting in its simplicity. She sipped slowly, as if savoring the moment of calm, letting the water settle some of the tension in her chest that had been building for days, maybe even weeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio whispered, her voice barely above a breath. The words were simple, but there was an ocean of meaning behind them. <em>Thank you for seeing me, for giving me space, for understanding me when I can’t even understand myself.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for a moment, as if deciding whether or not to say something. Finally, she sighed, brushing her fingers along the edge of the blanket.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There’s something you should know,” Agatha began gently, her voice quiet but steady, like the calm before a storm. “Last night… you had a bit of a nightmare.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked in confusion, her sleep-dulled mind slow to catch up. “A nightmare?” </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her gaze fixed on Rio with an intensity that was soft but unwavering. “It wasn’t anything extreme, but you started mumbling in your sleep… about needing to work on your thesis again. You sounded so panicked, like you were ready to get out of bed and start working right then and there, as if everything else just faded away.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s brow furrowed, and a slight blush crept into her cheeks, the embarrassment rising up like a wave she didn’t know how to avoid. “I… don’t remember that at all,” she admitted, her voice small and vulnerable, as if admitting that she didn’t recall it somehow made the whole situation worse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave a soft, understanding smile, her fingers still brushing the blanket, the fabric offering her some kind of comfort. “You wouldn’t, ”Agatha said, her voice soft but firm. ““You were so exhausted you could barely keep your eyes open. I wasn’t going to let you get up and push yourself any further. I just got you to lie back down, and you were out again in seconds.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, the shame and vulnerability she’d felt the day before bubbling back up. She set the water glass down on the bedside table, her fingers trembling slightly, feeling suddenly exposed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I didn’t even realize I was that far gone,” Rio muttered, the words thick with guilt. Her voice was small, the shame rising in her like an uninvited guest that she couldn’t shake. The idea of having let herself reach that point, of letting her exhaustion spill over into something as fragile as a nightmare, made her heart ache.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened even further, her heart aching for the woman beside her. She reached out, her hand finding Rio’s with a tenderness that was both grounding and reassuring. She squeezed gently, offering comfort that Rio so desperately needed but couldn’t seem to ask for. “Love,” Agatha said, her voice warm and steady, “you’ve been running on empty for too long, it’s no wonder your body started pushing back. You’ve been carrying so much, not just physically but mentally and emotionally. Last night wasn’t your fault—it was your exhaustion talking, not you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked down at their joined hands, her chest tightening. “I didn’t mean to make you worry,” she murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, her expression soft as she brushed her thumb across Rio’s knuckles. “I’m not worried because of you, Rio. I’m worried because I see how much you’re shouldering, and I just want you to be okay. That’s what I’m here for. And Nicky, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, the words settling in her chest like a stone. She felt a wave of guilt wash over her, pressing down so heavily she could barely catch her breath. She hadn’t realized how much of herself she’d been keeping locked away, how much of her burden she’d been silently carrying, shutting out the very people who loved her. The memory of Nicky’s concerned face flashed in her mind—his small, earnest eyes, the way he would check in with her, always so aware of her moods. Her heart ached, the guilt sinking deeper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve been shutting you both out, haven’t I?” she asked quietly, her voice rough with emotion. The words felt like a confession, like something that had been building for so long it could no longer be contained. It stung to admit it, but in a way, it was also a release.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile was sad but understanding. “A little, but we know you didn’t mean to. You’ve been running on fumes for too long, Rio. We get it. It’s just time to let us in now, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled shakily, her fingers tightening around Agatha’s. “Okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could say another word, the soft creak of the bedroom door echoed through the quiet space, and Nicky’s small figure appeared in the doorway. Tucked securely under one arm was his blue dragon, its bright colors almost glowing in the morning light. His eyes, the same shade of blue as Agatha’s, immediately brightened when he saw Rio awake. The corners of his mouth curled into a wide grin, and without hesitation, he scrambled onto the bed, making a beeline for her side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom!” Nicky exclaimed, his voice filled with a mix of excitement and gentleness, as if instinctively knowing that she needed peace more than anything. His words were light but soft, his small feet barely making a sound on the floor. “You’re awake! I told Mama you’d feel better after a good sleep.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled warmly, her arms opening to him. “Hey, little love. Come here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without hesitation, Nicky bounded into her embrace in her lap, dragging his dragon with him. He tucked himself close, squeezing into her chest, the stuffed animal squeezed awkwardly between them. Rio felt a warm rush of love as he nestled against her, his small arms wrapping around her waist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Me and Dragon protected you all night,” he announced proudly, his little voice carrying a sense of duty far beyond his years. He tilted his head back to meet her eyes, his face alight with determination. “We kept watch, just like we always do, even when we fell asleep.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, the sound lighter than it had been in days. She pressed a kiss to the top of his head, feeling the softness of his hair under her lips. “You’re the best little protector I could ever ask for. Thank you, my brave little hero.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed at her words, his chest puffing up with pride. “It’s our job to keep you safe,” he said matter-of-factly, nodding seriously. “Right, Dragon?” He glanced at the stuffed toy, holding it up with a little flourish as if expecting an answer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached over and ran her hand across the dragon’s soft, plush head, giving it a tender pat. “Right, Dragon,” she agreed with a grin, her voice soft with love. “I’m so lucky to have both of you on my team.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, watching the tender scene from the side of the bed, smiled softly. She sipped her tea, letting the moment unfold between Rio and Nicky, her heart swelling at the sight of her family coming back together, piece by piece.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha set her tea down on the bedside table, the sound a quiet but definite declaration that she was putting everything aside. Her tone was firm yet warm as she said, “Alright, love, here’s what’s going to happen today: no work, no stress. Just rest. Your thesis can wait another day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened her mouth to protest, but Agatha raised a hand to cut her off. “This isn’t negotiable—And I’m talking as you girlfriend <em>and</em> your supervisor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned softly, sinking back into her pillows. “She shot Agatha a look of mock exasperation. “You’re pulling rank on me now?” she mumbled, her voice thick with fatigue, though there was no true resistance in her words.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in close, brushing a strand of hair out of Rio’s face with a tenderness that made Rio’s heart flutter. “Absolutely,” she said, her voice softening just a touch, her hand lingering at the side of Rio’s face. “You need to take it easy, love. Let me take care of you, hmm?” There was a quiet certainty in her words, an understanding that Rio needed this—needed to be taken care of—for once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before Rio could respond, Nicky piped up from her side. “Yeah, Mom! You’re not allowed to do anything but rest today,” he said with a firm nod, his face scrunched up in earnest determination. “Mama’s the boss,” he added, lifting his chin in a way that was meant to emphasize the point, as though he were presenting the most indisputable of facts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked, surprised at the sudden burst of authority coming from her young son. Her lips quirked into a smile, and she couldn’t resist reaching over to ruffle his soft hair. “Guess I’m outnumbered, huh?” she asked, her tone teasing but warm, as if she were accepting defeat with grace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked. “You are, indeed. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure the world doesn’t fall apart without you for one day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave a small nod, rubbing her eyes as she tried to shake off the remnants of sleep. “Okay then,” she said, her voice still tinged with the haze of exhaustion, but she pushed herself to her feet. She swayed slightly, her balance not quite steady yet, the residual weakness from the previous day still lingering in her body.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes sharpened with concern, but before she could reach out, Nicky’s small hand was already gripping Rio’s tightly. “Even if you’re a little wobbly,” he said earnestly, his tone serious but his face full of a determined little smile. His grip was firm, a tiny but resolute anchor against Rio’s unsteady steps.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Especially if you’re a little wobbly,” Agatha added with a wink, her voice light but full of affection as she made her way to Rio’s other side, offering her a steadying arm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a little help, Rio made her way to the kitchen and Agatha pulled out a chair for her, and Nicky climbed into the chair beside her, his blue dragon clutched in his small hands, its soft fabric draped over his lap like a comforting companion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The table was set with a plate of toast, some fruit, and a mug of tea.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, her heart swelling at their quiet care. “Thanks, you two. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You mean you three, don’t forget Dragon!” Nicky piped up from beside her, holding his dragon up, before putting it down on the table, between Rio and him, as though the soft toy was an important part of their breakfast ritual.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh yes, sorry, you three, how could I forget Dragon”, Rio said, teasingly apologizing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned against the counter, her arms crossed on it as she watched them with a fond smile. “You’re definitely outnumbered,” she teased, her voice light but filled with love. “It’s us three now. No escaping.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After breakfast, Rio attempted to rise from the table, the steadying warmth of the food already beginning to wear off. She wobbled slightly as she grabbed her empty plate, her movements slow but determined. “Let me at least help with the dishes,” she said, reaching for Nicky’s plate as well.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arched an eyebrow, her expression both amused and firm. “No, love. You’re not doing anything today but resting.” Her tone was calm but unwavering as she moved swiftly to take the plates from Rio’s hands, gently placing them back on the table.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips curled into a faint pout, her stubbornness surfacing. “I’m fine. I feel better now. I can at least—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha interrupted, her voice soft but firm, a quiet authority that Rio knew she couldn’t easily dismiss. “You’re still swaying. You need to sit down and recover, not overdo it again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No buts,” Agatha said, cutting her off gently but decisively. She guided Rio back toward the couch with a steady hand on her back. “Sit. Rest. Read a book. Snuggle with Nicky. Whatever you want, but no chores, no work, and no meal prep. Doctor’s orders.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio huffed lightly, sinking back onto the couch, her arms crossed in quiet defiance. “You’re not a doctor.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, her gaze playful yet authoritative. “Technically, I am,” she quipped, draping a soft blanket over Rio’s lap as she settled beside her. “No, but I am the one who’s not letting you collapse again. So, I’m calling the shots.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh right, Dr. Harkness, silly me,” Rio mocked, though the amusement in her voice was clear as she settled deeper into the cushions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From his spot on the living room rug, Nicky looked up. “Yeah, Mom, you have to listen to Mama. She’s always right.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled despite herself, ruffling his hair. “You’re teaming up on me, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Someone has to keep you in line,” Agatha quipped, pressing a kiss to the top of Rio’s head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed, leaning back into the cushions as she finally relented. “Fine. But only because I’m too tired to argue.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good choice,” Agatha replied with a grin, heading back to the kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky scooted closer to Rio on the couch, holding his dragon out to her. “Wanna hold him again? He’s really good at making people feel better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled warmly, pulling Nicky into a hug. “I think I’ll take you up on that.” She took the dragon gave her, holding it close as Nicky snuggled against her side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio settled into the couch, Nicky’s energy shifted into full cheerleader mode. “Hold on, Mom! I’ve got something to show you!” He scurried over to the coffee table, rummaging through a colorful pile of papers. His little hands shuffled through the drawings until he triumphantly returned with a crayon masterpiece.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Look, Mom!” Nicky said, climbing back onto the couch and nearly shoving the paper in front of her face, his voice filled with excitement. “It’s you, me, and Mama! See? You’re holding a dragon too!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart melted as she gazed at the drawing. It was bright and full of chaos—wobbly stick figures, jagged lines, and a large green dragon filling the space. It wasn’t the most precise work of art, but the love and joy in it were unmistakable. “Wow, buddy,” she said softly, running a finger over the paper. “This is amazing. You’re a real artist.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You think so?” Nicky’s eyes sparkled with hope, his grin widening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know so,” Rio assured him, leaning down to give him a playful nudge. “You’ve got talent.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Encouraged by her praise, Nicky bounced off the couch again, this time grabbing a larger pile of drawings from the coffee table. With a flair for the dramatic, he spread them out like a miniature art gallery before Rio. “Okay, this one is a dragon flying over a castle!” He pointed to the first picture with enthusiasm, clearly proud of his work. “And this one is a dragon fighting a knight—don’t worry, the dragon wins. And this one—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, her exhaustion momentarily forgotten as she watched Nicky talk animatedly about his drawings. His small hands flitted over each page, pointing out details she could barely keep up with. “Wow, so many dragons,” Rio teased, her voice light with affection, perfectly knowing Nicky was in his dragons and dinosaurs phase.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They’re the best!” Nicky responded immediately, puffing out his chest as though defending his beloved dragons from any naysayers. “I wish I could have one,” he added wistfully, his little face full of longing. “And guess what!” he exclaimed suddenly, his eyes lighting up with excitement. “I made up a story about dragons too. Want to hear it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course I do,” Rio said, her heart a little lighter with each passing moment, the stuffed dragon still nestled comfortably in her lap. She leaned back, settling into the couch as Nicky prepared to tell his story.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky climbed back onto the couch, positioning himself next to her and holding up his blue dragon like a storyteller’s prop. “Okay, so one day, there was a dragon named Fluffy—he’s really brave and really nice, like you, Mom—and he had to save his friend Sparkle from an evil wizard!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky continued, weaving a tale of daring rescues and magical battles, Rio felt her heart lighten. His innocent enthusiasm and the way he looked at her, so full of love and admiration, made her realize how much she’d missed moments like these.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And then,” Nicky said, eyes wide with excitement, “Fluffy and Sparkle were best friends forever, and they made sure no one could ever hurt anyone again. The end!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, a soft laugh escaping her lips as she hugged him closer. “That was the best story, buddy. You’re a fantastic storyteller.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, basking in her praise. “Thanks, Mom! I can make up more stories whenever you want,” he said eagerly, his face glowing with joy at her approval.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha peeked out from the kitchen, watching the two of them with a smile. Seeing Nicky’s unrelenting efforts to cheer Rio up reassured her that, even in the middle of everything, they were still a team.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the soft glow of the afternoon, Rio and Agatha sat side by side on the couch, their legs stretched out comfortably. Rio rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder, the warm weight of her body pressing gently against her. Agatha’s hand was resting lightly on Rio’s knee, the subtle connection grounding them both in this moment of stillness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky the small whirlwind of imagination, was nearby on the living room rug, completely engrossed in a tiny world of his own making. He had scattered his toys around him, and the small scene he’d constructed was a flurry of action and excitement, even if only he could truly see it. Among the scattered figurines and toy animals, Señor Scratchy, their family bunny, sat as the unsuspecting center of Nicky’s latest tale.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rabbit, oblivious to the world of dragons and knights that Nicky had spun around him, sat lazily in the middle of the rug, munching on a leaf of lettuce. His long ears twitched every now and then, but his disinterest in the unfolding drama was clear. Undeterred, Nicky carefully placed a tiny knight figurine next to the rabbit, holding it out as though it were a life-or-death offering. He leaned in close, his voice a mix of excitement and seriousness as he announced, “Señor Scratchy, the bravest bunny of them all, prepare for battle against Fluffy, king of Dragonland!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh softly at the sight. The absurdity of it was endearing—Nicky, fully committed to his little world, with Señor Scratchy, who was definitely not about to slay any dragons or defend any kingdoms, as his unlikely hero. Agatha gave her a sideways glance, a small smile tugging at her lips as she watched Nicky’s animated antics.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled. “I think Señor Scratchy would rather nap through the whole battle. But I have to admit, Nicky’s commitment to his characters is impressive.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As if on cue, Nicky stood up suddenly, his arms raised dramatically, holding the knight and bunny figurines aloft like they were the stars of an epic showdown. “The battle is fierce!” he declared loudly, causing both Rio and Agatha to laugh. “Fluffy, king of Dragonland, breathes fire—rawr!” He growled, making an exaggerated noise as he moved the knight closer to the disinterested bunny. “But Señor Scratchy, the brave bunny, doesn’t back down! He charges with his sword!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky made a series of very serious swishing motions with the knight, his face scrunched in concentration. The tiny bunny, still largely oblivious, blinked slowly, his only action being the gentle twitching of his nose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha sat quietly, the weight of the book in her lap seemingly insignificant compared to the pull of Rio’s presence beside her. Her eyes flickered between the open pages and the woman resting next to her, noting how Rio’s posture remained slouched, her shoulders heavy with the exhaustion that had lingered for days. The stuffed dragon, Nicky’s most beloved companion, was still tucked under her arm like a lifeline.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened, and with a gentle sigh, she closed the book, setting it aside. She turned her attention fully to Rio, her voice quiet and tender. “You’re still tired, aren’t you?” she asked, her fingers brushing lightly against Rio’s hair, tucking a stray strand behind her ear. The question wasn’t so much an inquiry as it was an acknowledgment of the exhaustion she could see etched on Rio’s face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, stifling a yawn. “A little,” she admitted, though the truth was written all over her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s touch remained gentle, brushing over Rio’s hair with a soothing rhythm. “Why don’t you take a nap? Just a quick one, love,” she suggested softly, her voice warm with concern. There was no hurry in her words, only a strong invitation to rest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio started to protest, but Agatha cut her off with a small smile. “It’s actually not up for debate. You need rest, love. I’ll be right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her resistance crumbled almost immediately. The comfort of Agatha’s presence and the quiet atmosphere made it too easy to agree. “Okay,” Rio murmured, shifting slightly to get more comfortable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted with her, ensuring that Rio was settled against her shoulder, her body curling slightly to support her head. The moment Rio’s head found its resting place, something in her body seemed to give way—like a dam breaking, the exhaustion that had been slowly building up over the past few days flooding through her in waves. With a soft exhale, Rio’s body melted into the warmth of Agatha’s side, the tension draining from her muscles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s arm naturally draped around Rio, steady and warm, holding her close as she succumbed to the comfort of the space they shared. Within minutes, Rio’s breathing deepened, slow and steady, her body surrendering completely to sleep. Agatha watched her, a small smile tugging at her lips. She absently ran her hand through Rio’s hair, her touch tender and familiar. It was a quiet moment, a rare moment of stillness, and Agatha held onto it with everything she had.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From across the room, Nicky paused in his epic knight-and-bunny quest, eyes wide and curious as he looked up at his moms. His small face wrinkled with concern, clutching Señor Scratchy close to his chest as he asked softly, “Is Mom okay?” His voice was a whisper, as though even speaking too loudly might disturb the peace of the moment. “She’s sleeping again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s just tired, sweetheart,” Agatha replied, her voice low and soothing. “She needs lots of rest to feel better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded solemnly and looked at Señor Scratchy. “We can be extra quiet, right, Señor Scratchy?” he whispered, stroking the bunny’s soft fur. The rabbit twitched its nose in what Nicky decided was agreement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room settled back into a peaceful rhythm, the quiet broken only by the soft sound of Nicky’s whispered storytelling as he returned to his toy figures. Agatha stayed exactly where she was, her arm still wrapped around Rio, her gaze soft and watchful. Nicky, content in his own little world, continued his imaginative quest. Occasionally, Señor Scratchy would hop closer to one of the figurines, sniffing at them before hopping away again in search of more important things, like another leaf of lettuce or a cozy corner of the rug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio dozed peacefully against Agatha, her breathing soft and steady, Nicky climbed up onto the couch beside them. His eyes flickered over to Rio, checking that she was still sound asleep before his small fingers reached out, tugging gently at Agatha’s hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama,” he whispered, his voice barely more than a breath, his gaze drifting between Agatha and Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned down slightly, her face softening at the sight of her son. Her voice matched the softness of the room, a quiet murmur only for him. “What is it, sweetheart?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s brow furrowed in earnestness, and he shifted closer to Agatha, lowering his voice even further. “I need to go to the store,” he said seriously, his tiny hand gripping Agatha’s with surprising firmness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked in surprise, her eyebrows arching as she processed his words. “The store? Right now?” Her tone carried a mix of curiosity and gentle amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded firmly, his grip on her hand tightening, his determination shining in his eyes. “It’s a surprise for Mom. I need to get it myself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha studied him for a moment, her heart warmed by his determination. “What kind of surprise?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shook his head, his brown curls bouncing. “I can’t tell you. It’s secret. But it’s really important.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused for a moment, her mind momentarily torn. She glanced down at Rio, still nestled against her, lost in her peaceful slumber. The thought of leaving her alone, even for just a short time, caused a knot of unease to twist in Agatha’s stomach. But then she looked at Nicky—his wide eyes full of hope and excitement—and her heart softened. His earnestness was impossible to resist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Agatha relented with a small smile. “But we have to be quick. And quiet, so we don’t wake Mom, alright?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned, his excitement bubbling over. “I’ll be super quick, Mama. Promise!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha carefully shifted Rio’s weight, settling her more comfortably against the couch and draping the blanket over her. She placed a kiss on Rio’s forehead before standing, making sure she was still sound asleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let me grab my keys, and we’ll go,” Agatha whispered to Nicky, who nodded enthusiastically, already bounding toward the door to put on his little sneakers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With one last glance at Rio, Agatha followed Nicky out, her curiosity growing as she wondered what he had planned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the store, Nicky’s small hand clasped tightly in Agatha’s, he marched through the aisles with a determined look on his face. Agatha followed silently, her heart warmed by the little boy’s sense of purpose. “We have to hurry, Mama,” he said, glancing back at her with urgency in his big blue eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m right behind you, sweetheart,” Agatha assured, her tone gentle yet amused. She couldn’t help but feel warmth blossom in her chest at his earnestness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, they reached the stuffed animal section, shelves overflowing with plush creatures in every size and color. Nicky’s eyes widened as he took in the rainbow of soft textures and shapes. He released Agatha’s hand and darted toward the shelf like a tiny knight on a mission.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This one!” he declared, his voice bursting with excitement as he tugged a green and purple dragon from the display. Its soft wings fluttered slightly as he held it up, the stitched smile giving it a friendly, comforting expression.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crouched down to his level, her fingers brushing over the plush fabric. “That’s a wonderful choice,” she said, smiling at him. “Why this one, love?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hugged the dragon tightly to his chest, his curls bobbing as he nodded with certainty. “Because it matches mine! See, mine is blue, and this one is green and purple. Now Mom can have one too, for when she’s sad or tired—like now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a lump rise in her throat, her chest tightening with emotion. She reached out, brushing a hand over Nicky’s curls. “That’s so thoughtful of you, baby. Mom’s going to love it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed at her praise and clutched the dragon tighter. “I think it’ll help her. Dragons are really good at protecting and making you feel better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned forward to kiss his forehead, her voice soft with emotion. “You’re absolutely right, sweetheart. Mom’s going to feel so much better when she sees this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned, hugging the dragon closer as if it already carried the magic to heal. Agatha stood and offered him her hand, which he took eagerly. “Let’s get it wrapped up so we can take it home to her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the register, Nicky insisted on carrying the dragon himself, placing it carefully on the counter with both hands. “It’s for my mom,” he told the cashier earnestly, his little voice solemn. “She’s not feeling good, but this dragon will help her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The cashier, a kind-looking older woman, smiled warmly at Nicky. “That’s a very thoughtful gift. Your mom is lucky to have such a sweet boy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed under the praise, glancing at Agatha to make sure she’d heard too. She reached down to ruffle his hair, her heart swelling with pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once the dragon was paid for and carefully wrapped in bright tissue paper, they headed back to the car, Nicky clutching the package tightly as if it were the most precious treasure in the world. Agatha glanced down at him as they walked, the corners of her mouth lifting in a smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re something special, you know that?” she said softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky looked up at her, his grin widening. “Like a dragon?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, a quiet, affectionate sound. “Exactly like a dragon—brave, kind, and always protecting the ones you love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Back in the car, Nicky sat cradling the gift in his lap the entire way home, his eyes shining with anticipation. Agatha couldn’t wait to see Rio’s face when Nicky presented her with his perfect, thoughtful surprise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha and Nicky returned home, the house was wrapped in a tranquil stillness. The warm light of the setting sun filtered through the curtains, casting a soft glow over the living room. On the couch, Rio remained curled up, her body tucked under the cozy blanket Agatha had draped over her earlier. Her breathing was steady and rhythmic, the kind of deep sleep that spoke of much-needed rest. Agatha paused in the doorway, her gaze softening as she took in the peaceful scene.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her lips curled into a gentle smile, relief washing over her at the sight of Rio finally relaxing. She glanced down at Nicky, who clutched the gift bag tightly against his chest, his expression a mix of pride and purpose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha crouched to meet his eye level, her voice quiet to avoid disturbing Rio. “Hey, sweetheart,” she said softly. “I need to step out again for a little while. Can I count on you to stay here and keep an eye on Mom?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky nodded seriously, his little face set with determination as he looked at Rio. “I’ll take care of her, Mama, I promise.  She’s gonna be okay.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled with love for him. “I know you will, love. Just keep your dragon with her, alright? That way she’ll have some extra protection while she’s sleeping. You can give her the new one later tonight.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky smiled brightly and hugged the bag to his chest. “I’ll make sure she feels better,” he promised.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Satisfied, Agatha rose to her feet, casting one last fond glance at Rio. She leaned over, brushing a feather-light kiss against her lover's forehead, her voice barely above a whisper. “Rest well, my love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha slipped out the door, careful not to make a sound, Nicky climbed onto the couch beside Rio. He sat cross-legged, his small form barely taking up space, but his presence radiated purpose. He adjusted the blue dragon with careful precision, tucking it snugly beside her under the blanket, planning to give her the new one when Agatha came back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry, Mom,” he whispered, his tone conspiratorial as if sharing a secret with the sleeping Rio. “This dragon’s really strong. It’s gonna make sure you feel better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stirred slightly, her hand unconsciously brushing against the soft fabric of the plush toy. Nicky watched her closely, his brow furrowing in concentration. He stayed quiet, glancing between her and the door as if ensuring the house remained a sanctuary for her rest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Señor Scratchy hopped into the room, Nicky gestured for him to come closer. “Hey, Señor Scratchy,” he whispered. “You can help too. You’re really brave, remember? Just stay right here with Mom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The bunny, as if understanding the gravity of the moment, twitched his nose and settled on the rug near the couch. Nicky smiled to himself, reassured by his growing team of protectors. He leaned back against the couch cushions, one hand resting lightly on the blanket covering Rio, and the other reaching for his picture book.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I got this,” he murmured quietly, his voice filled with a determination far beyond his years. “You don’t have to worry, Mom. You’re safe.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha arrived at Lilia’s house as the evening sky deepened into shades of amber and indigo. A swirl of emotions churned within her—concern for Rio, guilt for leaving her behind, and a deep-seated need for answers. She trusted Nicky to keep watch over his mom, but the weight of responsibility lingered, as did the nagging thought that she hadn’t done enough to prevent Rio’s exhaustion from spiraling this far.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The porch light cast a warm glow over the doorway as Lilia opened the door, her smile radiating the kind of maternal comfort Agatha had come to rely on. She was dressed in a soft cardigan and linen pants, her posture as open and welcoming as ever, but her sharp, perceptive eyes quickly picked up on Agatha’s unease.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come in, dear,” Lilia said, stepping aside to let Agatha enter. Her voice was calm, steady—an anchor. “I can see something’s weighing on you. Let’s talk.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped inside, the familiar scent of lavender and freshly baked bread wrapping around her like a comforting blanket. The house was warm, cozy, filled with signs of Lilia’s life—a basket of yarn by the armchair, a few novels scattered on the coffee table, and a framed picture of Rio from her early twenties smiling on the mantle. Agatha’s gaze lingered on it for a moment, her chest tightening with emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia guided her to the kitchen, where a kettle was already steaming on the stove. She gestured for Agatha to sit at the table, setting out two mugs as if sensing they’d need the warmth of tea for this conversation. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated for a moment, then took the seat Lilia had gestured to. She clasped her hands together on the table, her fingers twisting nervously as she tried to put her swirling thoughts into words. “It’s about Rio,” she began, her voice quieter now, tinged with guilt. “She… she collapsed. Well, not exactly collapsed, but she broke down, really. She hasn’t been taking care of herself—working late into the night, not eating, barely sleeping. I should have noticed sooner, but I didn’t. And now I’m terrified that I didn’t intervene in time to stop it from getting this bad.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia listened intently, her steady presence a stark contrast to the whirlwind of emotions Agatha felt. She nodded slowly, her face calm but thoughtful. “Start from the beginning,” she said gently. “What led up to it? Were there signs you missed, or was it sudden?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha ran a hand through her hair, struggling to find the right words. “Her nose started bleeding, which is something I had never seen, really. She’s been jittery, too, like she’s running on fumes. I thought maybe it was just stress at first, but it became so much more.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She paused, her voice catching. “I tried to tell her to take a break, but she got defensive. Angry, even. And then… it spiraled. She lashed out, said something about her age, and it turned into a full-blown argument. And then it was like everything just collapsed. She went quiet, and all that fight drained out of her and she started sobbing. It broke my heart, Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s face softened with sympathy, but her eyes remained sharp as she processed Agatha’s words. “I see,” she said after a moment, leaning back in her chair. “That sounds like my Rio. She’s always been stubborn about pushing through her limits. She doesn’t want to show weakness, especially not to the people she loves. But you’re not to blame for missing the signs, Agatha. She’s been hiding them from herself as much as from you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a sharp pang of guilt twist in her chest, but before she could say anything, Lilia continued, her tone gentle but probing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Tell me—did she show any signs of being physically unwell? Fainting, dizziness, or anything more serious?” Lilia asked, her concern for her daughter evident as her brows knit together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, but the weight of her words made it clear how deep Rio’s exhaustion ran. “Not really. She didn’t faint, but she was definitely weaker. Her movements were sluggish and slow. She barely responded to Nicky when he tried to show her something, and that’s <em>never</em> like her. She was so… distant. Like she wasn’t even there. It really scared me, Lilia.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia reached across the table, her hand resting gently over Agatha’s, her touch warm and grounding. “You’re scared because you care. And that’s good, Agatha—it means you’re paying attention now. Rio is still Rio, but she might need your help to recognize her own limits, even when she fights you on it. That doesn’t mean you failed her before.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her words were calm yet firm, a mix of understanding and quiet strength. She leaned back slightly, her hands folding in her lap as she processed everything Agatha had shared. When she spoke again, her voice softened with a maternal warmth that Agatha had come to rely on. “You did the right thing by getting her to rest. And don’t blame yourself. It’s not easy to step in when someone is determined to push themselves to the edge, especially someone as stubborn as Rio. But this is why you’re here now. You’re doing everything you can, and she’s in good hands with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. The weight of Lilia’s reassurance was a relief, though it didn’t completely erase her guilt. “But what if it happens again?” Agatha’s voice wavered, her hands tightening into fists in her lap. “What if I miss the signs next time? I don’t want to be the one who lets her slip through the cracks again, Lilia. And what if she doesn’t listen? She’s so good at shutting people out when she’s overwhelmed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia leaned forward, her expression steady but compassionate as she met Agatha’s troubled gaze. “You’re not alone in this, Agatha. You have Nicky, and you have me. We’re both here for her—and for you. Rio trusts you, even when she fights you. She may resist, but she needs to hear that she can’t keep going at this pace. Start small. Help her balance her workload, you’re her supervisor after all. Keep reminding her to eat, to rest. Don’t let her bury herself under everything. She needs those reminders more than she’ll admit.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded slowly, her fingers unclenching as Lilia’s words settled into her mind like a roadmap. “I’ll do that. I just… I don’t want her to feel like I’m taking away her autonomy. She’s always been so fiercely independent, and I don’t want to make her feel like I’m trying to control her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re not taking anything away from her, Agatha. You’re helping her recognize her limits—helping her see that it’s okay to lean on you when she needs to. There’s a difference.” Lilia paused, her gaze thoughtful. “Independence doesn’t mean she has to carry everything on her own. She just hasn’t quite learned that yet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the conversation continued, Lilia leaned back in her chair, her expression distant yet thoughtful. Her fingers idly traced the edge of her mug as if grounding herself in the present while revisiting the past. “You know,” she began softly, her voice tinged with both fondness and melancholy, “Rio learned early on that nothing in life was handed to her. With the way she was bounced around when she was young, she figured out quickly that if she didn’t work hard, if she didn’t make herself stand out, she’d be overlooked.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia paused, her gaze shifting toward the window. For a moment, she seemed lost in memories, her eyes reflecting both pride and sorrow. “She had this fire in her even as a child—a drive to prove herself. She’d push beyond her limits, desperate to show that she wasn’t just another forgotten kid in the system. That she was worth something.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached as she listened, her chest tightening with every word. It explained so much—the relentless drive Rio carried, the way she pushed herself even when it hurt, and how she so often dismissed her own needs. It wasn’t just ambition—it was survival.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s voice softened further, her tone carrying the weight of someone who had seen the depths of Rio’s struggles. “I noticed it the moment she came to me. She was barely more than a teenager, but she was already so exhausted—physically, emotionally. She didn’t want to admit it, of course. She was so used to taking care of herself, to doing everything alone, that asking for help felt like weakness. She didn’t know how to let someone else carry even a fraction of her burdens.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha swallowed hard, her hands gripping her own mug as if it could steady the whirlwind of emotions stirring within her. “That sounds exactly like her,” she murmured. “She still does it sometimes—works late into the night, skips meals, barely sleeps. And if I try to step in, she just brushes it off like she’s fine. But she’s not fine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No,” Lilia agreed with a small, knowing nod. “She’s not. And she hasn’t been for a long time.” Her voice softened, and she met Agatha’s gaze with a mixture of sadness and warmth. “But you have to understand—it’s not just about the work. It’s deeper than that. It’s her way of proving, even to herself, that she’s capable. That she’s enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brows furrowed as she let the words sink in. “She’s always so hard on herself,” she said quietly. “I’ve seen it. If something isn’t perfect, or if she feels like she’s falling short, she gets frustrated. Almost like she’s afraid of failing—or of letting people down.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia offered a sad smile, her eyes glimmering with empathy. “That’s exactly it. It’s not just about achieving. It’s about proving her worth—to everyone, and to herself. She spent so many years feeling like she had to earn her place in the world. She never had anyone, not until me, to tell her that she was loved and valued just as she was—not for what she could do, but for who she is. And even now, I don’t think she fully believes it. It’s hard to unlearn that kind of thinking when it’s been a part of you for so long.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt a wave of understanding wash over her, tinged with guilt for not recognizing the depth of Rio’s struggles sooner. “I see it now,” she said softly, her voice laced with a mixture of regret and determination. “I always thought it was just her passion for her work, her drive to succeed. I didn’t realize it was… this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s expression remained gentle, but there was a firmness in her tone as she replied, “Rio might not say it outright, but she needs people to remind her that it’s okay to rest. That she doesn’t have to carry the weight of the world on her shoulders all the time. She’s spent so long equating rest with failure, but it’s not. She just needs someone who can help her see that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her grip on her mug loosening as a sense of clarity began to settle over her. “I want to be that for her, Lilia,” she said with quiet resolve. “I want her to know she doesn’t have to do everything alone, but I don’t know how to make her see it. She’s so stubborn. She’ll fight me every step of the way.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia leaned forward, her warm, knowing smile radiating reassurance. “She’ll fight, yes. That’s who Rio is. She’s fiercely independent like you said, always has been. But that’s also what makes her so incredible. And deep down, Agatha, she knows you’re there for her. You just need to meet her where she is—be patient, even when it’s hard. Gently remind her to slow down, to breathe, to take care of herself. She might resist at first, but you have to hold your ground. Let her know she’s worth more than her accomplishments. She’s not a thesis, a deadline, or a goal to be checked off. She’s Rio. And that’s enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha thought about Rio’s breakdown, the way she had collapsed into her arms, exhausted and vulnerable. It broke her heart, but it also made her more determined than ever to help Rio see that she didn’t have to do it all alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll do whatever it takes,” Agatha said, her voice steady. “I won’t let her burn out. I just need to know how to approach it the right way, without pushing her too far.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, her expression thoughtful. “You’re right to be mindful of that. She needs to feel like she’s still in control, even when she’s struggling. It’s a delicate balance, but you’re more than capable of handling it. The most important thing you can do is remind her—through your actions and your words—that she doesn’t have to prove anything to you. That you see her and love her, even when she’s not at her best. Even when she’s vulnerable or not able to do everything she wants to. She needs to hear that, Agatha, over and over again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest tightened with emotion. “I’ve tried to tell her, but sometimes it feels like it doesn’t sink in. Like she doesn’t believe me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She might not believe it right away,” Lilia said gently, “but keep telling her. Keep showing her. It’s not about convincing her in one big moment. It’s about the little things—checking in with her, noticing when she’s pushing herself too far, and being there when she finally lets herself rest. You’re already doing so much, Agatha. Don’t underestimate the power of just being consistent.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her mind already racing with ways she could support Rio better. “You’re right. I see how hard she tries, even when she doesn’t have to. She’s been fighting her whole life, and I want her to know she doesn’t have to fight so hard anymore. Not with me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyes softened with affection. “And that’s exactly why she’s lucky to have you. You’re not just her companion—you’re her safe place, her anchor. She may not always show it, but she trusts you more than anyone. That trust is your biggest strength in helping her through this. And don’t be afraid to ask for help, either. I’m always here if you need me. Sometimes, even the strongest people need a village.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The weight of Lilia’s words settled over Agatha, grounding her in a sense of purpose. “Thank you,” she said quietly, her voice filled with gratitude. “You’ve given me so much to think about.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia stood, placing a firm yet comforting hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “You’re doing a great job, Agatha. Don’t doubt yourself. You know Rio better than anyone else—her rhythms, her quirks, her strengths and weaknesses. Trust your instincts, and trust <em>her</em> too. She’ll get there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha left Lilia’s house feeling a little lighter, knowing that with time, patience, and unwavering love, Rio would learn to rest and recover. It wasn’t going to be easy, but Agatha was determined to help Rio find balance—whatever it took.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha stepped through the door, the familiar hum of their home wrapped around her, and her heart lifted at the sight before her. Rio was awake, sitting on the couch with Nicky nestled close by her side. The two of them were absorbed in a colorful cartoon playing on the TV, Nicky’s animated chatter filling the room as he pointed excitedly at the screen. His laughter rang out like a bell, light and carefree, while Rio smiled softly at his enthusiasm. Though a touch of weariness lingered in her posture, there was a peacefulness about her that made Agatha’s chest tighten with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled, seeing them together, so normal and peaceful after the chaos of the past few days. She made her way over to them, settling on the couch beside Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky turned to her with a big grin, his eyes sparkling with excitement. “Can I give my gift to Mom, now that she is awake?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her voice warm. “Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without hesitation, Nicky sprang off the couch and darted toward the kitchen, his little feet padding quickly across the floor. Agatha couldn’t help but chuckle softly, watching him disappear through the doorway. Rio glanced at her with a curious tilt of her head, her brows knitting slightly in question, but Agatha simply gave her a knowing smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Moments later, Nicky returned, clutching a brightly colored gift bag in his hands. His excitement was palpable as he hurried back to the couch and held it out to Rio. “This is for you, Mom!” he said, practically bouncing on his toes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blinked in surprise, her lips parting as she took the bag from him. She reached inside and pulled out the plush stuffed dragon, its soft fabric a vibrant purple with scales and accents of green.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s for you,” Nicky said with absolute certainty, his small hands holding up his own blue dragon for emphasis. “Now we both have dragons, so we can feel better when we’re sad. She’s green because it’s your favorite color, and purple because it’s Mama’s favorite color.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught, her fingers curling around the dragon’s plush body as her gaze flicked between it and Nicky. Her lips trembled slightly, and Agatha noticed the way her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. The weight of Nicky’s thoughtfulness was overwhelming in the most beautiful way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Rio seemed unable to speak. Then she hugged the dragon tightly to her chest, cradling it as though it were something fragile and precious. Her voice, when she finally spoke, was thick with emotion. “Thank you, Nicky,” she whispered, her words trembling with sincerity. “This is… this is the best gift I’ve ever gotten.” Her lips curved into a watery smile. “Nobody’s ever given me a stuffed animal before.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She reached out and pulled Nicky into her arms, holding him close as tears slid quietly down her cheeks. “You’re my little hero,” she murmured, pressing her cheek to his soft hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned, clearly pleased with himself, and held up his blue dragon, making it ‘wave’ at Rio’s new purple one. “Now they’re friends, too! They can help each other when they’re feeling lonely.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, wiping at her eyes with the back of her hand. “They’re already the best of friends, just like us,” she said, her voice still tinged with emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha watched the exchange, her own heart heavy with love for both of them. She reached out, her fingers brushing gently through Rio’s hair, a silent gesture of comfort and connection. When Rio looked up at her, her eyes were still glistening, but there was a warmth in them that seemed to make the entire room glow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio said softly, her gaze locked with Agatha’s. “I don’t know what I’d do without you two.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, leaning in to press a kiss to Rio’s forehead, her lips lingering there for a moment. “Well,” she teased gently, “for starters, you wouldn’t have your very own stuffed dragon…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, her laugh soft but genuine, and she held the dragon up to inspect it. “True. And honestly, I can’t believe I ever lived without one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, satisfied with his gift’s success, and snuggled back between them on the couch. Together, the three of them settled into the quiet comfort of the moment, the cartoon continuing to play in the background. For Agatha, there was no greater happiness than this—a home filled with love, laughter, and the promise of brighter days ahead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That night, as the quiet of the house settled around them, Agatha and Rio lay side by side in bed, the dim light from the lamp casting soft shadows across the room. Nicky was already sound asleep down the hall, tucked snugly under his blankets with his stuffed dragon resting beside him. Across the room, Rio’s new green-and-purple dragon sat proudly on the dresser, its round eyes seemingly fixed on them, a silent guardian of their peace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shifted beneath the covers, her movements still a little slow, but there was a softness to her, a calmness that hadn’t been there in days. Agatha turned toward her, propping herself up on one elbow to take her in fully—the soft slope of her shoulders, the relaxed curve of her lips, the subtle flicker of thought behind her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How are you feeling?” Agatha asked softly, her voice a gentle murmur in the quiet room. She reached out, tracing the curve of Rio’s arm with the lightest touch, offering a silent reassurance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a deep breath, her chest rising and falling as though she were still exhaling the tension of the past days. She turned her head to meet Agatha’s gaze, her expression open but vulnerable. “I’m better,” she admitted, though her voice carried the weight of lingering uncertainty. “I just… I think I’m scared of slipping again.” She paused, her fingers absently plucking at the edge of the blanket. “It feels like I’ve got this endless list of things to do. And if I don’t do them perfectly, it’s like I’m failing—not just myself, but everyone else, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart ached hearing the familiar insecurity in Rio’s voice. She reached out, cupping Rio’s face in her hands and making sure their gazes met. “You don’t have to be perfect, love,” Agatha said, her voice steady and filled with warmth. “You never have to be perfect. Not for me, not for Nicky, not for anyone.” Her lips curved into a tender smile. “Even though, for what it’s worth, you already are perfect to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips quirked upward in a faint, almost reluctant smile. She leaned into Agatha’s touch, her tension melting under the warmth of her girlfriend’s palms. “You always know exactly what to say,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s because I mean every word,” Agatha replied, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s forehead. She lingered there for a moment, letting the silence speak for her. When she pulled back, her hand slid down to rest against Rio’s chest, feeling the steady beat of her heart beneath her palm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let her eyes drift closed for a moment, breathing in the comfort of the moment. “I just… I don’t want to let you down. Or Nicky. You both deserve more than someone who’s constantly teetering on the edge of burnout.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head gently, her expression firm but kind. “You’re not letting anyone down, Rio. And you never will. You’ve already given us everything—your love, your care, your strength. Nicky adores you. I adore you. All we need is <em>you</em>, exactly as you are. Even on the hard days.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio opened her eyes, and they shimmered with a mixture of unshed tears and gratitude. “I’m trying,” she said softly. “I really am.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And that’s more than enough,” Agatha assured her, her voice a soothing balm. She kissed the tip of Rio’s nose, earning a soft laugh that warmed the space between them. “You’re enough, love. Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a shaky breath, her chest rising and falling as if the weight of her thoughts was too much to bear. She glanced away for a moment, staring at the wall as if searching for answers in the empty space, before finally meeting Agatha’s eyes again. The vulnerability in her gaze was almost palpable. “I don’t know how to balance it. Everything just feels so overwhelming, and if I stop for even a second, I feel like I’m falling behind. Like if I don’t keep moving, I’ll lose everything I’ve worked for.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart clenched with empathy, the familiar weight of Rio’s words sinking into her own chest. She understood it now—the way Rio threw herself into her work, her relentless drive to be the best at everything, as if stopping meant failing. Agatha had witnessed it from the beginning, but hearing Rio say it out loud made her realize just how deeply it had rooted itself in Rio’s heart. Her conversation with Lilia only reinforced it all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I get it,” Agatha said softly, her voice steady but filled with the weight of understanding. “You want to give everything your best, I see that every day. But you also have to listen to your body, Rio. You can’t pour from an empty cup, no matter how much you want to give. It’s not sustainable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes dropped to the covers, her fingers nervously tugging at the hem of her shirt as she processed Agatha’s words. She nodded slowly, but there was a distant look in her eyes, as if she were trapped in a cycle that had become too familiar to escape. “I know,” she murmured. “I’ve always been like this… pushing myself to the edge, never stopping. I guess I never really learned how to rest, or even <em>want</em> to. It feels like if I do, everything will fall apart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll figure it out together,” Agatha said softly, her tone reassuring. “It’s about finding the balance. You can still be passionate and driven without losing yourself in it. And I’m right here. We can set some small changes, baby steps.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio looked up, her eyes searching Agatha’s. “Like what?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha thought for a moment, her voice firm but caring. “Well, for one, let’s set some specific work hours, so you don’t feel like it’s never-ending. You need breaks, regular ones, and no skipping meals or water.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “That sounds doable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We also need to work on setting boundaries with your thesis and any other commitments,” Agatha continued, her voice gentle but firm. “If something’s too much, you need to speak up. Don’t try to handle everything on your own, especially when it’s overwhelming. If you’re struggling, you don’t have to keep it to yourself. It’s okay to ask for help.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio buried her face in Agatha’s chest, as she continued.  “I’m here. Nicky’s here. Lilia’s here. We’re all in this together. You’re loved. You’re supported. And you will always be enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, and her arms tightened around Agatha, clinging to her as if she were afraid of letting go. The tightness in her chest loosened just a fraction as Agatha’s words sank in, settling like a weight lifting off her heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know how I’m supposed to let go of all of that,” Rio murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. “But I’ll try. For us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha pressed a soft kiss to the top of her head, her arms tightening around her. “That’s all I’m asking you to do.” She tucked Rio back into her side, letting the silence settle between them, the comforting weight of their presence enough for now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as Rio drifted off to sleep in Agatha’s arms, she felt a small weight lift from her chest. Maybe she didn’t have to be perfect. Maybe, with Agatha by her side, she could learn to be enough just as she was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*<br /><br /></p>

</p><p align="justify">                  (T. S. Eliot. “East Coker.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The late afternoon sun streamed through the study window, creating golden patches of light across the dark wood desk where Rio sat. Her laptop screen glowed with the email draft containing what she had been agonizing over for days. The subject line read: <em>Submission of Fourth Chapter – Rio Vidal: “The Timeless Abyss of Death in Modernist Poetry.”</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart pounded as her fingers hovered over the trackpad. Her breath felt shallow, as if the weight of the entire document rested not on the hard drive but on her chest. After a deep inhale, she pressed <em>send</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A soft whoosh sound confirmed the email’s departure. Rio stared at the screen for a moment longer, as though waiting for some immediate response that she knew wouldn’t come. Relief crashed over her in a wave, but it was accompanied by the familiar undercurrent of doubt. Was it good enough? Would the board tear it apart?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sound of approaching footsteps snapped her from her thoughts. Agatha appeared in the doorway, her presence magnificent as always but softened by the warmth in her gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You did it, love,” Agatha said with a knowing smile. She crossed the room, her heels clicking softly against the floor, and stopped behind Rio. Her hands, always so steady, settled gently on Rio’s tense shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I did,” Rio murmured, her voice tinged with disbelief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned down, her long hair brushing against Rio’s cheek, and pressed a kiss to the top of her head. “And I couldn’t be prouder.” Her voice was quiet but firm, full of sincerity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head back to look up at her, her brown eyes searching Agatha’s face for reassurance. “You think it’s good enough?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good enough?” Agatha echoed, a playful glint in her eyes as she arched an eyebrow. “Darling, it’s <em>brilliant</em>. You poured your heart – and your health - into this chapter, and it shows.” She moved around to the side of the desk, perching gracefully on its edge so she could face Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“As your supervisor,” Agatha continued, slipping into a slightly teasing tone, “I can say with absolute confidence that the board is going to love it. But as your partner…” Her expression softened, and she reached out to brush a stray curl from Rio’s face. “I’m so proud of you—not just for this, but for how hard you’ve worked, how much you’ve pushed through, even if a little too much. It’s remarkable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s throat tightened, and she felt a surge of emotion rise in her chest. “You’re biased,” she whispered, though her lips curved into a small smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe,” Agatha admitted, her own smile widening. “But that doesn’t make me wrong.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a breathy laugh, leaning forward to rest her head against Agatha’s stomach. Agatha’s hand came to rest on the back of Rio’s head, her fingers threading gently through her hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Rio murmured, her voice muffled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“For what?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“For believing in me,” Rio said, sitting up to meet Agatha’s gaze again. “And for being… you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened, and she tilted her head. “Always, my love. Now,” she said, standing up and offering her hand, “let’s go pack. Nicky will never let us hear the end of it if we’re late getting on the road.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, her shoulders feeling lighter than they had in weeks. She took Agatha’s hand, letting herself be pulled to her feet. As they left the study together, the faintest trace of doubt lingered in Rio’s mind, but it was quickly overshadowed by something far stronger: a quiet sense of accomplishment and the unwavering support of the woman by her side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio and Agatha stepped out onto the porch, locking the door behind them, the sound of Nicky’s excited chatter filled the air. He bounced around the driveway, his little backpack jostling on his shoulders and his beloved stuffed dragon’s hand peeking out of his little bapack. “Mama! Mom! Do you think there’s gonna be a lake? Can we go swimming? What if there’s a bear? Do you think I’ll see a deer?!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, watching their son dart from one side of the car to the other like a whirlwind of energy. “Nicky, you’re going to tire yourself out before we even leave,” she teased, though the corners of her lips tugged upward in a fond smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Impossible!” Nicky declared, grinning wide. “I’ve got my dragon for energy!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, standing beside Rio with the house key in hand, shook her head with an amused sigh. “He’s going to talk the entire drive, isn’t he?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned at her. “Oh, absolutely. Better brace yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just then, a familiar car pulled into the driveway, and Lilia stepped out, waving warmly. She looked relaxed and radiant, as always, her presence instantly grounding. “Sorry I’m late, loves! Got caught in traffic,” she called out, her voice carrying easily over the sound of Nicky’s excited squeals.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Grandma!” Nicky shouted, running to her with open arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia crouched down just in time to catch him, laughing as he threw himself at her. “There’s my favorite little adventurer!” she said, planting a kiss on the top of his head. “Are you ready for our big weekend?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes!” Nicky practically vibrated with excitement, pulling back to look up at her. “There’s gonna be a lake and woods, and Mom said maybe we can see deer! Do you think there’s gonna be a bear, Grandma?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia shot Rio a raised eyebrow as she straightened up, her hands still resting on Nicky’s shoulders. “A bear? Really?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio held up her hands defensively. “I never said there’d be a bear. That’s all him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped in smoothly, slipping the key into her bag. “Don’t worry, Lilia. If there is a bear, I’m sure Nicky and his dragon will handle it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed, ruffling Nicky’s hair. “Well, I feel safer already.” She glanced toward the packed car and nodded approvingly. “Looks like we’re ready to go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s get this show on the road,” Rio said, opening the passenger door for Lilia as Agatha started guiding Nicky toward the back seat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha slid into the driver’s seat and glanced over her shoulder at her family, her smile softening. “Everyone buckled in?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ready!” Nicky declared, pumping his fist in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“All set,” Lilia confirmed, glancing at Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Then let’s go,” Agatha said, starting the car. As they pulled out of the driveway, Nicky immediately launched into an animated story about what his dragon would do if it saw a bear, and Rio leaned back against her seat next to Nicky, soaking in the laughter and warmth that filled the car.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The car ride was filled with a steady hum of chatter and laughter, the kind of warmth only a true family could create. Nicky, strapped into his booster seat, bounced along to the beat of the pop song playing on the radio, his high-pitched voice belting out lyrics he only half-knew. Rio smiled, her head resting against the cool glass of the window, the tension in her shoulders melting away as she listened to the lively conversation swirling around her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, seated comfortably in the passenger seat, was in the middle of recounting an embarrassing story from Rio’s teenage years. “And then,” she said, barely able to keep her laughter in check, “this one decided to sneak into the kitchen in the middle of the night to get to the cookie jar, only for the jar to come crashing down—cookies and all!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia!” Rio groaned from the backseat, her cheeks flushing pink. “You <em>promised</em> we weren’t bringing that one up again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, I never promised,” Lilia teased, her eyes twinkling with mischief as she glanced over her shoulder at Rio, musing over the moments Rio had finally felt safe enough in her house to disobey. “Besides, Nicky deserves to know what his mom was like as a teenager.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up as he turned to Rio. “Mom, you sneaked into the kitchen at night for cookies? That’s so <em>cool</em>! Did you get in trouble?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio buried her face in her hands, laughing despite herself. “Let’s just say there were no cookies after dinner in my future for <em>a while</em> after that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good,” Agatha chimed in from the driver’s seat, her voice smooth and playful. “I need to remind you to stop raiding the pantry sometimes, too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a mock glare, but her smile betrayed her. “You too, Agatha?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled uncontrollably, clutching his dragon to his chest. “Grandma, tell another story!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve got plenty,” Lilia said with a grin, earning an exaggerated groan from Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the miles rolled by, Nicky shifted gears, asking, “How much longer until we’re there?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced at the GPS. “About forty-five minutes, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Forty-five minutes?” Nicky cried, his jaw dropping in exaggerated disbelief. “That’s, like, forever!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, nudging him gently. “You said that fifteen minutes ago when it was an hour. We’re getting closer, I promise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe I should teach you patience this weekend, Nicky,” Lilia suggested with a mock-serious expression, turning in her seat to face him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes narrowed suspiciously. “How do you <em>teach</em> patience?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Lilia began, her tone thoughtful, “first, you have to sit very still and—”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Nope!” Nicky interrupted, throwing his hands up in mock horror. “Nope, nope, nope! I’m not doing it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The car burst into laughter, even Agatha letting out a rare snicker.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The lighthearted banter carried them through the rest of the drive, Nicky peppering everyone with random questions about the cottage, what kind of wildlife they might see, and whether dragons could survive in the woods. By the time they turned onto the gravel road leading to the cottage, Rio felt lighter than she had in weeks, the weight of her thesis temporarily forgotten amidst the love and chaos of her family.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The car rolled to a stop in front of the charming, rustic cottage, its silhouette bathed in soft moonlight. The structure was quaint, with ivy creeping up one side and a weathered wooden porch that creaked as the wind passed through. Nicky pressed his face to the car window, his eyes wide with wonder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Whoa,” he whispered, his voice full of awe. “It looks so cool and spooky! Like a haunted house!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled as she turned off the engine. “It’s not spooky, love. It’s just old,” she said, stepping out of the car. “And trust me, when you see it in the daylight, you’ll think it’s more enchanting than eerie.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t look convinced, clutching his stuffed dragon tightly as he hopped out of the car. Lilia was already at the trunk, pulling out bags, while Rio stretched, her muscles stiff from the long drive.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they made their way inside, the front door gave a low groan, as if greeting them. The cottage was cozy, the kind of place that invited you to curl up under a blanket with a good book. A stone fireplace dominated one wall, and the wooden beams overhead added a rustic charm. But the floorboards creaked with every step, and shadows danced oddly in the corners, thanks to the flickering light of the old sconces.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It smells like firewood,” Nicky remarked, wrinkling his nose but staying close to Rio’s side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s because of the fireplace,” Agatha said, setting their overnight bags on the floor. “And see? Not so spooky once you’re inside.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio grinned and leaned down to Nicky’s level. “She’s right, kiddo. It’s just a cozy old house that creaks a little. Nothing scary here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky didn’t look entirely convinced but nodded anyway. “I guess it’s kinda cool. Like an adventure house!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Rio agreed, ruffling his hair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The family spent a few minutes exploring the small cottage, peeking into its various nooks and crannies. The kitchen was quaint, with antique cabinets and a checkered tablecloth on a tiny dining table. The bedrooms were simple but inviting, with warm quilts draped over the beds.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached the room meant for Nicky, he paused at the doorway. It was a little smaller than he expected, with a single twin bed tucked into the corner and a wooden rocking chair near the window.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is your room, bud,” Rio said, placing his bag on the bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hesitated, clutching his dragon even tighter. “I don’t know… It’s kinda far from your room.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha knelt beside him, her hands resting gently on his small shoulders. “It’s just down the hall, love. And you have your dragon to protect you. Plus, your grandma and us are just a shout away if you need anything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky frowned, his lips pressing into a thin line. “Promise?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Promise,” Agatha said firmly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gave him an encouraging smile. “And if it’s too scary, you can always come snuggle with us. But I bet you’ll love having your own space by tomorrow morning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Nicky said reluctantly, climbing onto the bed to test it out. The springs squeaked, and he giggled nervously. “It’s kinda bouncy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s perfect for you,” Lilia teased, stepping into the room. “A bouncy bed for a bouncy boy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky smiled at that, his nervousness easing a little as the adults worked to make him feel at home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Soon, they were all settled, their belongings tucked away, and the night beckoned them to rest after the long drive. But as Rio climbed into bed with Agatha, she couldn’t shake the feeling that Nicky might end up joining them before morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night was still and quiet, save for the occasional creak of the old cottage settling into itself. Agatha stirred slightly, half-asleep, as the muffled sound of soft footsteps padded down the hall.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as Rio had predicted, Nicky appeared in the doorway, clutching his blue dragon tightly to his chest. The dim moonlight streaming through the window illuminated his nervous face, his wide eyes scanning the unfamiliar shadows in the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom? Mama?” he whispered, his voice trembling just enough to tug at Agatha’s heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked awake, her gaze shifting to the small figure standing hesitantly in the doorway. She nudged Rio gently, but Rio only shifted in her sleep, still lost in her dreams. Agatha smiled faintly, shaking her head before sitting up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s wrong, love?” Agatha asked softly, her voice soothing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The house makes weird noises,” Nicky said, his bottom lip quivering. “And… and my room feels really far away.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart squeezed. “Come here,” she said, holding out her hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky hesitated for only a moment before scurrying over, his dragon dragging slightly along the floor behind him. Agatha scooted to the edge of the bed and pulled him up into her lap. His small arms immediately wrapped around her neck as he buried his face in her shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can I stay with you and Mom?” he mumbled into her shirt, his voice barely audible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, you can,” Agatha whispered, pressing a kiss to his temple. “There’s plenty of room for all of us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With practiced care, Agatha gently untangled herself from Rio, who barely stirred, and scooted over to make room. She helped Nicky climb onto the bed and settle between her and Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as he nestled in, his little body relaxed, the tension from his fear melting away. He clutched his dragon tightly with one arm and reached out with the other to grab a handful of Rio’s shirt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom’s warm,” Nicky murmured sleepily, his eyes already drifting shut.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, brushing a hand through his hair. “She is. And so are you, my little furnace.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky let out a small giggle, his voice fading into a yawn as his breathing evened out, slipping into peaceful sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shifted slightly, her arm draping over both Nicky and Agatha in her sleep, as if instinctively pulling them closer. Agatha’s heart swelled at the sight of her little family, cocooned together in the quiet of the night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The cottage still creaked and groaned in the background, but to Agatha, it sounded almost comforting now, like a lullaby cradling her family in its arms. She rested her head against the pillow, one hand resting protectively on Nicky’s back, the other brushing against Rio’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sweet dreams, love,” she whispered, her words meant for both of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next morning, the weather announced itself to be perfect, and its light bathed the living room as everyone began to stir. Rio sat on the couch, cradling her morning coffee, still a bit groggy from the late-night cuddle session with Nicky. She watched as Agatha moved around the small kitchen, humming softly as she prepared tea, her movements as graceful as ever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky bounded in, already full of energy. “Good morning, Mama! Morning, Mom!” he chirped, climbing onto Rio’s lap and snuggling against her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, my little chef,” Lilia called from the kitchen doorway, a mischievous grin lighting her face. “Speaking of chefs, I’ve decided that today we’re having a very special cooking lesson.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes lit up instantly. “A cooking lesson? What are we making?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Something delicious,” Lilia replied with a wink, holding up a bag of ingredients she’d brought along. “But first, every chef needs the right equipment.” She pulled out a small, white chef’s hat from the bag and plopped it on Nicky’s head. It was a little too big and tilted to the side, but he beamed with pride anyway.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m the boss!” Nicky declared, puffing out his chest and adjusting the hat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia turned her teasing smile on Rio. “And I suppose the boss might need an assistant. Rio, what do you say? Ready to redeem yourself for all those kitchen disasters from back in the day?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, sinking back into the couch. “Oh, come on, Lilia! That was ages ago. I’ve gotten so much better.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Better?” Lilia arched an eyebrow, her grin widening. “You mean like that time you tried to make brownies and accidentally used salt instead of sugar?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face flushed. “I was sixteen!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That’s already too old for that! And the lasagna that turned into soup?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, that was one time!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been quietly sipping her tea, finally spoke up, her voice laced with amusement. “You have to admit, my love, you do have a bit of a history with… creative culinary experiments.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a mock glare, though her lips twitched with the threat of a smile. “You’re supposed to be on my side.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I am,” Agatha replied, setting her cup down and leaning against the counter. “But I also think you should join. For Nicky’s sake, of course.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Fine,” Rio said with a dramatic sigh, setting her coffee down and standing. “But if anything goes wrong, it’s not my fault.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Famous last words,” Lilia teased, ushering them all into the kitchen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tiny cottage kitchen quickly became a flurry of activity. Nicky stood on a step stool at the counter, his makeshift chef’s hat slightly askew, as he handed out tasks. “Mom, you chop the vegetables. Mama, you stir the sauce. Grandma, you… um…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Supervise?” Lilia suggested with a grin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes! Supervise!” Nicky agreed enthusiastically.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced over at Agatha, who was standing at the stove with a wooden spoon in hand, her expression one of pure amusement. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Immensely,” Agatha replied, her lips curling into a smirk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they worked, the kitchen filled with laughter and the sound of Nicky’s cheerful instructions. Lilia kept up a steady stream of commentary, offering tips and occasionally throwing playful jabs at Rio’s expense.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, that’s too much salt!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia, it’s a pinch!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“A pinch for who, a giant?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Even Agatha couldn’t hold back her laughter, and Rio eventually gave up trying to defend herself, focusing instead on not letting Nicky spill flour all over the floor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Of course, chaos ensued anyway. At one point, Nicky accidentally knocked over a bowl of chopped vegetables, sending them scattering across the counter. Rio, in her attempt to catch it, knocked over a jar of tomato sauce, which splattered across her shirt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha covered her mouth, trying - and failing - to suppress her laughter. “You really do make cooking an adventure, love.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a look, though she couldn’t help but laugh too as Nicky giggled uncontrollably.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha was now sitting at the table, observing fondly, her mug of tea cradled in her hands, as she watched the chaos unfold in the tiny cottage kitchen. Nicky was still proudly wearing his chef’s hat, issuing dramatic orders, while Rio was frantically wiping up the trail of spilled sauce that had somehow ended up on the counter, the floor, and her shirt. Lilia, for oncethe instigator, was tossing playful jabs at both of them, her laughter ringing warmly through the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha couldn’t help but smile fondly at the scene. Her family, chaotic as ever, brought a kind of joy that filled her chest and made her heart ache in the best way. She sipped her tea, savoring the warmth of the moment before setting her cup down with purpose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright,” she said, stepping into the fray and clapping her hands lightly. “That’s enough kitchen carnage for one morning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned, a streak of flour somehow smeared across her cheek, and gave Agatha a mock-offended look. “Kitchen carnage? I’ll have you know, we’re creating culinary magic here!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, gesturing at the mess around them. “If this is magic, love, I’d hate to see what a disaster looks like.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rude,” Rio muttered, though the smile on her face gave her away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on, Mom,” Nicky chimed in, grabbing Rio’s hand and tugging her toward the door. “Mama’s right—let her and Grandma fix it! We can go play while they finish lunch!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio threw her hands up in defeat, allowing Nicky to drag her out of the kitchen. “Fine, but when this meal is amazing, remember who the <em>real</em> chefs were.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll be sure to give you full credit for spilling half the ingredients,” Agatha teased, her tone light and affectionate.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Once they were gone, Agatha turned to Lilia, who was already wiping down the counter with a practiced efficiency.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, that was… spirited,” Agatha remarked, picking up the only jar of tomato sauce that had miraculously survived the chaos.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Spirited is a generous word,” Lilia replied with a grin, her tone warm as she began chopping the remaining scattered vegetables. “You’ve got your hands full with those two, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, believe me, I know,” Agatha said with a laugh, rolling up her sleeves. “Now, what’s the plan? Let’s salvage this meal before we’re subjected to Rio’s cooking experiments again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The two of them worked seamlessly, Lilia offering tips and sharing stories about her own adventures in the kitchen, many of which involved a younger, clumsier Rio. Agatha listened intently, enjoying the way Lilia’s love for her daughter shone through in every word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the time they finished, the kitchen was spotless, the food was plated, and the smell of something delicious filled the cottage. Agatha took a step back, wiping her hands on a towel and surveying their work with satisfaction.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“See? Peaceful, productive, and no sauce explosions,” she said with a smirk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Maybe I should give you the real chef’s hat,” Lilia teased, nudging Agatha playfully.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, picking up a plate to bring to the table. “No need. I’ll let Nicky keep that title—for now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they called Rio and Nicky back to the kitchen, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of contentment. These moments—messy, chaotic, and full of love—were what made life so beautifully worth it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The afternoon air was nice, the clear light filtered through the dense canopy of trees, lightening the forest floor. The crisp, cool air was filled with the earthy scent of leaves and moss, and the sound of crunching footsteps echoed as the family ventured deeper into the woods. Nicky skipped ahead with a small bag slung over his shoulder, his eyes scanning the ground for anything that might qualify as a “treasure.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Look, Mama!” he called out, holding up a particularly shiny acorn as though he’d just found a precious gem.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her hands tucked in her coat pockets. “A fine find, little explorer. Keep it safe—it might be magic.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes lit up at the word <em>magic,</em> and he carefully placed the acorn into his bag, zipping it up with a dramatic flair. “I’m going to find even cooler stuff! You’ll see!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, walking a few paces behind, raised an eyebrow at the challenge. “Oh, you think you’re the only treasure hunter here, kid? I’ve got skills, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Skills?” Agatha teased, glancing over her shoulder at her partner. “I seem to remember someone getting lost in the woods for <em>hours</em> during our last hike because they followed a squirrel.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Again, that was <em>one time,</em>” Rio defended, pointing a finger at Agatha. “And I found the coolest rock ever, thank you very much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Coolest rock, huh?” Nicky giggled, clearly enjoying his moms’ banter. “Bet you can’t find a cooler one than me today!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, it’s on,” Rio declared, crouching slightly as though ready to sprint off into the trees. “Prepare to be amazed, young one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With that, the treasure hunt officially turned into a competition. Nicky darted from tree to tree, picking up feathers, oddly shaped sticks, and colorful leaves, while Rio focused her efforts on finding something truly extraordinary. Every so often, she’d hold up a rock or a piece of bark, only for Nicky to shake his head dramatically and proclaim it “not cool enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha trailed behind them, content to watch the adventure  unfold with Lilia at her side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Should we tell them that this forest probably doesn’t have any buried treasure?” Agatha asked dryly, her lips quirking into a small smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Where’s the fun in that?” Lilia replied, slipping her arm through Agatha’s as they walked. “Besides, I’m enjoying seeing Rio get so competitive with a six-year-old. It’s good for her.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s going to end up climbing a tree, isn’t she?” Agatha muttered, shaking her head fondly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Rio had indeed spotted something shiny in a nearby bush and was half-kneeling, half-crawling to retrieve it. “What do we have here?” she murmured, emerging triumphantly with a smooth, round stone that glinted faintly in the sunlight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, kid,” she announced, holding it up for Nicky to see. “Top this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky inspected the stone carefully, his face serious as he considered. “It’s shiny,” he admitted, “but look at <em>this!</em>” He reached into his bag and pulled out a feather, its deep blue hue catching the light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s jaw dropped in mock disbelief. “A feather? That’s cheating! You didn’t even find that on the ground!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, I did!” Nicky insisted, clutching the feather protectively. “It was on the trail! Right, Mama?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, her arms crossed as she leaned casually against a tree. “I did see him pick it up. I’d say it’s fair game.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio threw her hands up in exaggerated defeat. “Fine. You win this round, kid. But I’m still the reigning champion of coolest rocks.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the competition wound down, they continued their walk deeper into the woods. The towering trees seemed to stretch endlessly into the sky, their branches swaying gently in the breeze. Nicky’s curiosity was boundless, and every few steps, he’d pause to ask questions about the plants, the animals, and the strange sounds they occasionally heard in the distance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom, what kind of flower is this?” he asked, pointing to a small patch of purple blossoms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned down beside him, inspecting the plant closely. “That’s wild violet,” she explained, brushing her fingers gently over the petals. “They grow in shady spots like this. See the heart-shaped leaves? That’s how you can tell.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tilted his head, his little brows furrowing in concentration. “Can we touch them?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wild violets are safe,” Lilia chimed in, crouching next to them. “But you should always ask first because some plants aren’t friendly to touch. Like poison ivy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s poison ivy look like?” Nicky asked, wide-eyed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Three leaves,” Rio replied, holding up three fingers for emphasis. “And if you see it, don’t touch it. Trust me on that one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled softly. “She learned that the hard way a few years back. Came running home with her hands covered in rashes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not my fault I fell into them, but, thanks for bringing that up, Lilia,” Rio said dryly, though her lips twitched with a faint smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they continued walking, Nicky’s questions poured out like water from a faucet. “Why are the leaves green? How do mushrooms grow? What’s moss for? Do animals live in that hole in the tree?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio and Lilia answered as best they could, their explanations a mix of science and playful storytelling that kept Nicky enthralled. Agatha hung back slightly, content to watch her girlfriend and mother-in-law field the rapid-fire inquiries. She sipped from her thermos of tea, her gaze soft as she observed the natural ease between the three of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How do you two know all this?” Nicky finally asked, glancing up at Rio and Lilia with a mixture of awe and suspicion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia placed a hand on her hip and gave him a mock-serious look. “How do you think your mom knows all this stuff? I taught her everything she knows.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the small, grateful smile that crept across her face. “Well, maybe not <em>everything,</em> but close enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky grinned. “Grandma, you’re like a plant professor!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I like the sound of that,” Lilia said, pretending to straighten an imaginary tie. “Professor Lilia, at your service.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, who was now poking at a pile of moss with a stick, looked up and smirked. “Yeah, yeah. You’re a walking encyclopedia. Don’t let it go to your head.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they ventured deeper into the woods, the rustling of the trees and the soft crunch of leaves beneath their feet were the only sounds filling the air. Nicky’s eyes were wide with wonder, scanning every nook and cranny for something new to explore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, they all froze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the distance, just beyond a cluster of trees, a small family of deer appeared—two adults and a fawn grazing peacefully in the clearing. Nicky gasped, his small voice dropping to an excited whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mama Deer, Mom Deer, and Baby Deer!” he exclaimed, pointing eagerly at the trio. His voice was barely a breath, but it held the purest joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled at Nicky’s enthusiasm, her heart swelling with affection as she watched him try to take in every detail of the scene. Agatha looked over at her with a soft, knowing smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky continued to watch the family of deer, his eyes wide with awe. Then, after a few seconds, he paused, a small furrow appearing on his brow.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But where’s Grandma Deer?” he asked, his voice suddenly serious as he turned his gaze toward Lilia, who was walking beside him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia laughed, her eyes twinkling with mischief. She placed a hand on Nicky’s head, ruffling his hair playfully. “Well, she’s just too cool to be spotted with other deers. She prefers to remain mysterious and elusive.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio snorted softly at the unexpected answer, and even Agatha couldn’t help but chuckle, her arms crossed as she leaned against a nearby tree, enjoying the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I see, Grandma’s a celebrity now,” Rio teased, her eyes sparkling with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia winked at her. “That’s right, darling. You can’t expect her to be out there with the common deer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky laughed, clearly satisfied with the explanation. “Okay! But when we see Grandma Deer, I’ll say hi for you!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Deal,” Lilia said with a grin, her voice filled with playfulness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the family of deer continued to graze in the distance, the moment held a quiet sense of connection. The gentle breeze rustled the leaves above them, and for a brief moment, it felt like everything was exactly as it should be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Look at them,” Rio murmured, gazing at the deer as they moved gracefully through the clearing. “They’re so peaceful. It’s like they belong here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“They do,” Agatha replied softly, her voice full of warmth. “Just like us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, still mesmerized by the deer, nodded solemnly, as though he fully understood the sentiment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the deer eventually disappeared into the trees, Nicky waved after them, his face glowing with excitement. “This is the best treasure ever,” he declared.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio wrapped an arm around him as they continued their walk. “I think you might be right, kid.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And for a moment, it truly felt like they all belonged to this quiet, beautiful world in the woods—a world where the magic of nature and family blended together in perfect harmony.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Back at the cottage, the cozy warmth of the living room filled the space as the afternoon settled out. The smell of Lilia’s cooking drifted from the kitchen, mingling with the crisp scent of wood burning in the nearby fireplace. The day had been full of adventure and laughter, and now, as the sun began to dip below the horizon, the house seemed to take on a soft, gentle hush.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha settled into the worn but comfortable couch, adjusting the cushions behind her to make herself more at ease. She had been looking forward to this moment all day—some quiet time with Nicky, something familiar and grounding amidst the whirlwind of activities.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky was a little worn out from the day’s exploration, his wide eyes now calm with the soft promise of a story to accompany nap time. He climbed up beside Agatha, clutching his beloved dragon tightly in one hand, curling into her side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Can we read the dinosaur story again, Mama?” he asked, his voice small and sweet, his little fingers tracing the dragon’s wings absentmindedly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled down at him, a soft warmth spreading through her chest. She knew which story he meant—it was one of their favorites, a tale of a brave dinosaur who protected a peaceful village. “Of course, sweetheart,” she replied, smoothing his hair back gently. “The dino’s ready for another adventure, huh?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah! He’s gonna fight the bad guys and save everyone!” Nicky said, his eyes lighting up as he leaned in closer, eager to hear the familiar tale.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha opened the book and began to read, her voice gentle and soothing, making sure to add emphasis on the most exciting parts of the story. Nicky snuggled in closer, his small body pressing against her as he listened intently, his dragon forgotten for the moment, the safety of his Mama’s side all he needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha read, she felt a rare moment of peace—a quiet, grounding presence that she cherished deeply. The crackling of the fire, the soft rustle of the pages turning, and Nicky’s steady breathing as he settled into the rhythm of the story all seemed to align in perfect harmony. This was their space, their time together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced down at Nicky, seeing the way his eyelids were fluttering, heavy with sleep as he sank further into her side, sliding onto her lap. Her heart swelled with affection as she slowed her pace, not wanting to finish just yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the story finally came to its conclusion, Agatha closed the book softly, her voice lowering to a whisper. “And the brave dinosaur lived happily ever after, surrounded by all of his friends, safe and sound.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, barely awake now, nodded sleepily. “He was the best dino, wasn’t he?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The best,” Agatha agreed, brushing a kiss to the top of his head. She gently shifted, adjusting his position so he could rest more comfortably, the soft sound of his breathing filling the quiet room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">While Agatha and Nicky were on the couch, having their quiet time, in the kitchen, the soft hum of conversation blended with the rhythmic sound of knives chopping and pans sizzling. The air was warm and fragrant with the aromas of dinner cooking, filling the cozy space with comfort. Rio stood at the counter, carefully slicing vegetables for the stew Lilia was preparing, the rhythm of the task grounding her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, standing at the stove, turned toward her with a teasing grin. “I couldn’t help but notice,” she said, her voice light with playful amusement, “you were quite the competitor during the treasure hunt this afternoon. I mean, did you really need to bring back an entire tree branch?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “I can’t help it! When I’m in the zone, I’m in the zone.” She smirked. “Nicky doesn’t know what hit him. I am the queen of treasure hunting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia raised an eyebrow, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “I know. I’ve never seen you so determined to win over something so… well, small and shiny.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed again, the sound easy and light. “I guess I just get into it. Plus, I was kind of hoping to show Nicky that I’m still ‘cool,’ you know?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, sweet girl,” Lilia said, her voice softening as she met Rio’s gaze. “You’ll always be cool in Nicky’s eyes. He already looks at you like you’re the world.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hands stilled for a moment, a lump rising in her throat at the unexpected tenderness in Lilia’s words. She turned her attention back to the vegetables she was slicing, hiding the way her chest tightened. The words lingered in her mind as she cut through the carrots with a little more force than necessary, trying to distract herself from the sudden vulnerability that crept up on her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia noticed the subtle change in Rio’s demeanor and, after a pause, she gently added, “You’ve come so far, you know. It brings me so much joy to see you so… happy, thriving with your little family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught in her throat, the weight of Lilia’s statement settling over her like a soft blanket, but in the most unexpected way. She looked over at Lilia, meeting her mother’s knowing, warm gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thrive?” Rio echoed, almost in disbelief. “I—” She trailed off, not sure how to put into words what she was feeling. Her hands began to move again, but slower now, as if she needed to take a moment to process Lilia’s words. She paused, realizing that the woman who had taken her in, loved her without question, had seen something in her that Rio often struggled to see in herself and had known so for even longer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I never really thought I’d get here, you know?” Rio admitted, her voice quieter, almost vulnerable. “I mean, from where I started, I didn’t think I would… be enough for anyone, except for you, let alone have a family. I was just… a kid in the system. Lost and forgotten. And now here I am, with Nicky, with Agatha.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her chest tightened at the thought of Agatha, and she allowed herself a small, fond smile. “I don’t even know how I got so lucky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s expression softened even further, her hands stilling on the stove as she regarded Rio with a knowing look. “It’s not luck, darling,” she said gently. “You’ve worked so hard. And it’s because of that—because of who you are—that you’ve built a life with Agatha and Nicky. You’ve become the woman you are now, the woman I always knew you could be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a warmth spreading through her chest, her heart fluttering with the unexpected weight of Lilia’s words. She was quiet for a moment, taking in the comforting presence of the woman who had been both her mother and her rock.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You have no idea how much I needed to hear that now,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “Thank you, Mom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled, her eyes softening with a deep, unconditional love. “I’ll always be here, Rio. You’re not alone ever, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, feeling the tightness in her chest ease just a little, the overwhelming gratitude for everything she had built and overcome flowing through her in a quiet rush. She thought about Agatha, about Nicky, about this life they had created together—and she couldn’t help but feel a quiet sense of pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She was a daughter. A lover. A mother.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening had settled in with a peaceful stillness, the last remnants of the sunset fading into the deep blue of the night sky. The cottage was quiet, the only sounds the occasional rustle of the leaves in the trees and the gentle hum of nature. They had all gathered outside after dinner, wrapped in blankets, the cool air pressing against their skin, but not in an uncomfortable way—more like a gentle embrace, comforting and familiar.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, his eyes wide with wonder, sat nestled between Lilia and Agatha, looking up at the stars like they were treasures just waiting to be discovered. Rio leaned into Agatha, their bodies naturally aligning as they sat back against the porch railing, their warmth a soft contrast to the cool night. The moment felt still, timeless even, as if the world had paused for just a little while to let them breathe and exist in this space together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky was the first to break the silence, his voice full of curiosity. “Mom, what’s that one?” He pointed up toward the sky, his small finger aimed at a bright cluster of stars.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, adjusting her position so she could better see what he was pointing at. “That’s Orion’s Belt,” she explained, her voice steady but full of a quiet excitement. “It’s a group of three stars that look like a belt. The whole constellation is shaped like a hunter with a bow, but those three stars are the most noticeable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Like a hunter?” Nicky asked, his eyes lighting up. “What does he hunt?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well,” Agatha started, her voice low as she leaned in closer to Nicky, “he’s a symbol of strength, so in stories, he hunts big animals. But in the sky, he’s hunting the monster called Scorpion, which is another constellation.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, nestled against Agatha, couldn’t help but smile at how patiently she answered Nicky’s endless questions. It was one of the things she loved about Agatha—the way she always seemed to have an answer, the way she didn’t rush or brush Nicky off, no matter how many questions he asked.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What about that one?” Nicky pointed again, this time toward a distant, hazy patch of sky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, who was lying back on her blanket, turned her head to look. “Ah, that’s the Milky Way,” she said with a twinkle in her eye. “It’s the galaxy we live in. It’s so big we can’t even see all of it from here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How big is it?” Nicky asked, his voice hushed as if the enormity of it all was almost too much to fathom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave him a soft, patient smile. “Well, it’s so big that it’s hard to even say. It’s made up of billions of stars, just like the ones we see in the sky, but there are so many more out there we can’t see with our eyes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wow,” Nicky whispered, clearly in awe. His voice held a note of wonder that made Rio’s heart swell, remembering how curious and bright he was, always wanting to learn, always asking questions. “What’s beyond the Milky Way? Is there another galaxy?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled, her hand resting on Nicky’s head, gently ruffling his hair. “Yes, sweetheart, there are billions of other galaxies. Just like how our stars are all part of the Milky Way, the galaxies are part of the universe, and that’s even bigger than we can imagine.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Like… a never-ending space?” Nicky’s face scrunched up, trying to understand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Exactly,” Agatha said softly. “It’s like an infinite ocean of stars and galaxies. We’ve only just begun to explore it, and there’s so much we still don’t know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a gentle squeeze of Agatha’s hand as she shifted slightly to get more comfortable, and she leaned her head against Agatha’s shoulder. The world felt so vast in this moment, and yet, sitting there, wrapped in warmth with her family, everything felt exactly right. It was a peaceful, quiet kind of awe—one that didn’t require answers, just presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled softly, her heart full of contentment as she watched her family. Agatha was answering Nicky’s questions with such care, and even though they were talking about far-off galaxies, black holes, and stars, Rio couldn’t help but feel like she was in the middle of her own little universe—a universe that was exactly where she wanted to be, right here with the people she loved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Nicky’s questions slowed down and his eyelids grew heavier, Lilia watched him with a soft smile, the evening’s magic lulling him into a drowsy state. His head began to tilt toward her shoulder, his small body sinking deeper into the blanket beneath him. The stars above seemed to dim, the world quieter now, as if the universe itself were waiting for Nicky to fall asleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia exchanged a glance with Agatha and Rio, her gaze filled with warmth. “I think he’s ready for bed,” she said, her voice low and gentle, not wanting to disturb the peaceful atmosphere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky blinked a few times, then yawned widely. “I’m sleepy, Grandma.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia chuckled softly, her heart swelling with affection as she gently stroked his hair. “I know, sweetheart. Let’s get you settled in for the night, hmm?” She carefully sat up and moved to gather him in her arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Rio, still sitting close together, exchanged a quiet, knowing glance. It wasn’t often that they had moments alone—moments where the world felt just a little bit smaller, where the busyness of their lives could pause, if only for a while.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks, Lilia,” Agatha said quietly, her voice filled with gratitude. “We’ll be here when you’re done.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded with a smile, cradling Nicky in her arms as she stood up. “I’ll make sure he gets to sleep. You two enjoy some quiet time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Lilia carried Nicky toward the cottage, Agatha leaned back against the railing, stretching out her legs in front of her. She sighed contentedly, the soft rustling of the trees the only sound for a few moments.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shifted beside her to lie down and rest her head on Agatha’s lap and her lover’s hand immediately found its place in Rio’s hair. There was a sense of calm settling between them, a rare kind of stillness that felt almost sacred. They both allowed themselves to sit in silence for a few minutes, soaking in the beauty of the night, the quiet comfort of each other’s presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love this,” Rio murmured, her voice quiet but full of feeling. “It’s like… everything is exactly as it should be. Perfect.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, her other hand finding Rio’s and squeezing it gently. “I feel that too,” she said, her voice just as soft. “Sometimes, it’s hard to believe we’ve made it here… all of us, together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio closed her eyes, the gentle warmth of Agatha’s hand grounding her. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt this… at peace. I mean, I’ve had moments before, but this is different. Being here, with you, with Nicky… with Lilia. It’s like… like this is what life’s meant to be.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s breath hitched softly, the weight of Rio’s words landing deep within her. “I couldn’t agree more,” she whispered. “There’s nowhere else I’d rather be. Nothing else I want more than this. Our little family.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head up just enough to catch Agatha’s gaze. Her eyes were soft, vulnerable, the weight of the world seemingly lifted just for the moment. “I want everything with you, Agatha. Every day, every step… even the hard ones. I want them all with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled in her chest, and she leaned down, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s forehead. “You have me, love,” she whispered. “Always.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They sat there, in the deepening night, the quiet of the world around them the perfect backdrop for their shared moment. The stars above seemed to shine a little brighter, as if affirming the truth of their words. In each other’s arms, they had found a home—something deeper than just a place to live. It was a love that wrapped itself around them, a quiet, unwavering presence in the vast, never-ending universe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few moments, Agatha stretched, a quiet groan escaping her as she stood. “I think we should get some rest. It’s been a long day, and I don’t think I can stay awake much longer without risking falling asleep right here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly and nodded, standing as well. “Yeah, I don’t think I’m far behind you. Let’s go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The two of them moved inside, the warmth of the cottage greeting them as they stepped through the door. The quiet creaks of the old wood and the soft crackling of the fireplace welcomed them in, and Rio felt her body relax in the familiar comfort of their little getaway.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They made their way to their bedroom, the coolness of the night air still lingering on their skin. Agatha slid into bed first, holding the covers open for Rio, who slipped in beside her. The bed was warm, a safe haven after the events of the day, and Rio let out a contented sigh as she settled against Agatha’s body.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha wrapped her arm around Rio, pulling her close, and Rio rested her head on her shoulder. She felt the weight of the day’s adventures slowly slip away, leaving only the soft sound of Agatha’s breathing and the faint rustling of the trees outside.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You okay?” Agatha asked softly, her fingers brushing through Rio’s hair in a comforting motion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. “Yeah, I’m perfect. Just… really glad to be here with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, pressing a gentle kiss to Rio’s forehead. “Me too, love. Me too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The two of them drifted into a peaceful sleep, the stars outside still watching over them, a quiet promise that they would never be alone in the vastness of the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The soft light of dawn was beginning to seep through the window when Rio stirred in the bed, her eyelids fluttering open, but something felt… off. The space beside her was empty. Agatha was gone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, a flutter of worry stirred in Rio’s chest, but she shook it off, knowing that Agatha was probably just up early, enjoying the quiet morning. She quietly slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb Nicky or Lilia, who were still sound asleep in their rooms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The cool air greeted her as she stepped out into the hallway, barefoot, her hair messy from sleep, carrying a blanket like a cape. She checked the kitchen and living room, but Agatha wasn’t there. A soft sigh escaped Rio’s lips, and she moved toward the porch, drawn by the peace of the morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There, just outside, Agatha sat on a bench on the small wooden porch, her back to Rio. The early morning sunlight bathed her in a soft golden hue, the world around her still quiet, except for the gentle chirp of birds and the rustling of the trees. Agatha’s gaze was fixed on the horizon, her face calm and serene, as if lost in the beauty of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated for a moment, unsure whether to interrupt the peaceful silence, but the sight of Agatha, so relaxed and at ease, made her heart swell with warmth. She stepped outside, her feet padding lightly on the wooden floor as she approached.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t seem to notice her at first, so Rio stopped just behind her, watching her for a moment. There was something undeniably calming about the way Agatha sat, her posture perfect, her expression thoughtful but unburdened. It was a rare moment for Agatha, who always seemed to be moving or planning or thinking about the next thing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Morning,” Rio whispered, her voice soft, not wanting to disturb the tranquility of the moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned slightly, her eyes brightening when she saw Rio standing there. A smile curved on her lips. “Morning, love. I didn’t want to wake you. I thought I’d catch the sunrise while it was still quiet.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stepped forward, her gaze softening as she sat down next to Agatha on the porch, wrapping the blanket around them both. She didn’t speak for a moment, just taking in the view of the sunrise, the soft colors beginning to stretch across the sky. The world felt still, like everything was holding its breath for just a moment longer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stretched out her legs, leaning back with a contented sigh. “It’s nice to just… breathe sometimes, you know? No deadlines, no responsibilities… just the quiet of the morning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her own shoulders loosening as she sank into the calmness of the scene. “Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. It’s hard to find these moments when everything else is so… loud.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They sat in silence for a little while longer, just watching the sky as it shifted from deep purples to soft pinks and oranges. The world around them seemed to come alive slowly, like a slow-moving wave of energy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Agatha broke the silence, her voice gentle but full of meaning. “I’ve been thinking… about everything. About us, about Nicky. This weekend has been perfect, just… perfect. It reminds me that I want to make more time for this. For us. To just be… here. Together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned her head to look at Agatha, her heart swelling with emotion at the words. There was a depth to Agatha’s voice, a sincerity that made Rio feel both incredibly loved and incredibly lucky.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I feel the same way,” Rio said softly, her eyes locking with Agatha’s. “I don’t want to rush through life anymore. I want to be here, in the moments that matter. With you. With Nicky.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand reached out, brushing gently against Rio’s, fingers intertwining as if sealing the promise between them. “We’ll make it happen. All of it. Every step of the way. Together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s, a small, contented sigh escaping her lips. “Together,” she whispered, the word feeling more right than anything else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know, I was thinking,” Rio continued, her voice quiet but firm as she gazed at the horizon, “about everything we’ve built so far. About this little life we’ve created… It feels like we’re just getting started, you know? Like we still have so much more to experience.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted slightly, her hand finding Rio’s, their fingers naturally intertwining as if it were the most natural thing in the world. The connection between them was always present, a bond forged through shared experiences, challenges, and joys. She squeezed Rio’s hand gently, offering her a sense of reassurance even before she spoke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know exactly what you mean,” Agatha replied, her voice low, full of warmth and certainty. “And that’s because we <em>are</em>just getting started. There’s so much more waiting for us out there. We’ve already made something beautiful together, but the journey isn’t over. It’s only just beginning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio sighed softly, her chest lifting with a contented breath as she closed her eyes for a moment. Her mind wandered to all the things they had yet to do, all the moments they’d share, the lessons they’d teach Nicky, and the places they’d see. It was like standing on the edge of a cliff, looking out at a vast, unknown landscape. The future was uncertain, but with Agatha by her side, Rio knew she could face whatever came next.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I want to experience everything with you,” Rio said, her voice soft but steady. “Every single thing. I don’t want to miss a moment of it. I want to see the world, make memories with you and Nicky, and… just be <em>present</em> for all of it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled, her thumb tracing the back of Rio’s hand with a gentle, reassuring motion. “We will, my love. All of it. There’s nothing we can’t do together. Whatever life throws at us, we’ll face it as a family. I believe in us. I believe in this… in <em>you</em>. And I know we’ve built something solid here. Something worth protecting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled with emotion, and she felt a lump form in her throat. Agatha’s words always had a way of soothing her anxieties, grounding her when her mind threatened to race. She had always been the rock in their relationship, the steady force that kept Rio from spiraling. And in return, Rio was the spark—fiery, passionate, and full of life. Together, they were a perfect balance, a perfect order.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t know what I’d do without you,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with the depth of her feelings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha turned her head slightly, her lips brushing softly against Rio’s hair. “You don’t have to worry about that, love. You’ll never be without me. I’m here, always. And we’re building a life together—a good one. A strong one.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio leaned in, her cheek pressing against Agatha’s, and they sat there together, wrapped in the blanket, watching the sun climb higher in the sky. The world seemed to expand around them, offering endless possibilities, but in this moment, all that mattered was the quiet promise they had made to each other—to live fully, to face the future hand in hand, and to cherish every step of the journey they would take together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning sun rose quickly, illuminating the cottage with a soft golden light streaming through the windows. It was a peaceful start to the day, but there was a sense of inevitability in the air as they began packing up. The weekend had been everything they had hoped for—relaxing, fun, and full of memories—but it was time to head back home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky darted around excitedly, his little hands busy gathering his treasures from the weekend: a few leaves he had pressed between the pages of a notebook, a pinecone he had found on their walk, and of course, his ever-present dragon. His dragon had been his comfort throughout the trip—his little guardian through the unfamiliar woods and the adventures of the weekend. He was determined to make sure it was in the picture, too.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Moms, you have to get in! It’s the last picture of our family at the cottage!” Nicky said, his voice full of enthusiasm as he clutched the camera. “Dragon gets in, too!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Rio exchanged a smile, amused by Nicky’s determination. Rio was the first to comply, squatting down to make sure the dragon was carefully placed in the frame beside Nicky. She looked up at Agatha with a quiet affection in her eyes, her hand reaching out to intertwine with hers. Agatha smiled back, her expression soft, and nodded in agreement. They were going to make this moment last, just like every other moment they’d shared during the weekend.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, we’re all set,” Rio said, standing next to Nicky, who was now bouncing excitedly on his feet, holding up the camera.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, who had been organizing the last of their things inside, stepped out onto the porch, wiping her hands on her apron. “Do I get to be in this family picture, too?” she asked with a playful smile, clearly enjoying the family dynamic she was witnessing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, Grandma!” Nicky said enthusiastically, grabbing Lilia’s hand and pulling her into position. “You’re part of the family!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly at the sight of Nicky taking charge, and Rio laughed, shaking her head. “Alright, Lilia, come on over here. You’re part of the team now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia joined them, giving Rio a soft glance, proud of the family they had all become. Nicky placed his dragon on the grass in front of them, making sure it had the perfect spot in the frame.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay, on three,” Rio said, leaning down to make sure they were all in the shot, just as the timer on the camera clicked on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cheese!” Nicky grinned, his face alight with excitement, while Lilia smiled warmly, her hand resting on Nicky’s shoulder. Agatha and Rio exchanged a quiet, knowing look, one that spoke volumes about the love and strength they had built together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the camera clicked, capturing the moment forever, the four of them sat there for a few seconds longer, taking it all in. The cottage, the memories, the quiet affection they shared—it was more than just a snapshot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Nicky,” Agatha said, her voice full of affection as she ruffled his hair. “This picture will be a treasure.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It will go straight to the mantle,” Lilia said, already planning to print and frame the picture when she got home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed up at her, his eyes shining with pride. “I’m going to show my friends when we get home! And I’m going to tell them about the deer and the dragon that I’m sure I saw in the woods!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve certainly earned your title as the family photographer,” Rio added with a grin, her voice warm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they packed the last of their things into the car, the cottage looked a little emptier, the energy of their presence already starting to fade. But the memories they had created here would stay with them forever, woven into the fabric of their family.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do we really have to leave already?” Nicky asked, his voice quieter now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll come back, I promise,” Rio said, her voice soft but filled with certainty. She turned to Agatha, their gazes meeting for a brief moment before they both smiled. “There’s always next time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, who had been watching them closely, added her own quiet, comforting voice to the moment. “And I’m sure we’ll also find other places just as special,” she said, her smile warm and knowing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they made their way to the car, ready to drive back to their life at home, Rio felt a sense of contentment settle over her. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the car rumbled down the winding road back home, the landscape shifting from the peaceful woods to the familiar stretch of highways, Rio sank into the seat, feeling a quiet sense of peace wash over her. The trip had been exactly what she needed: a break from the weight of her thesis, from the endless deadlines, from the stress of her day-to-day routine. But more than that, it had been a reminder of the simple joys of life—the kind she had sometimes forgotten to savor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced out the window at the changing scenery, the familiar landmarks blurring by. But as the moments passed, she found herself feeling more and more at ease, the knots in her stomach loosening. The weekend had given her a fresh perspective, a calm clarity that she hadn’t realized she needed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her fingers found Agatha’s hand resting on the console between them, their palms briefly touching before Rio entwined her fingers with Agatha’s. She squeezed lightly, drawing Agatha’s attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha quickly looked over at her with a soft smile before refocusing on the road. “What’s on your mind, love?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio paused for a moment, her thoughts catching up with her. Then she finally spoke, her voice quiet but full of sincerity. “I just… I just wanted to thank you. For pushing me to celebrate my achievements. I’ve been so focused on always moving forward, on the next thing I have to do, the next hurdle I have to jump. But I’ve forgotten how to stop and appreciate how far I’ve come.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened as she squeezed Rio’s hand gently in return. “You’ve worked so hard, Rio. I’ve always admired your determination, but you deserve to take a breath and celebrate yourself, too. You’ve earned it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let the words settle in her heart, feeling a mix of gratitude and warmth. She had always been so driven, always thinking about the future, about what was next. But this weekend, she had allowed herself to be present, to enjoy the little moments with her family, to celebrate the work she had already done instead of worrying about what was still to come. It was something Agatha had encouraged her to do, and it felt like a small but significant shift in her mindset.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened even further, her gaze filled with the depth of her affection. “You should be proud, love. Look at everything you’ve done. You’re a brilliant, strong woman—and you’ve surrounded yourself with a beautiful family who loves and supports you. You don’t need to chase after perfection. You’re already enough, exactly as you are.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a lump form in her throat, a wave of emotion threatening to overwhelm her. She had always been her own harshest critic, but hearing Agatha’s words, feeling the warmth of her love and support, made her realize how much she had to be grateful for. Her life was filled with so much—so much love, so much support, so much strength—and for the first time in a while, she felt a sense of peace in that.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the car continued its journey back to their home, Rio felt the weight on her shoulders lift, replaced by a sense of warmth and belonging. She had always known she was loved by Agatha, by Nicky, by Lilia, but in this moment, she truly felt the depth of that love. It was a quiet, comforting certainty, one that filled her up from the inside out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She leaned back against the seat, content and at ease, ready to face whatever came next—with the people she loved, and with the knowledge that she was enough, just as she was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And for what felt like the millionth time over the weekend only, Rio allowed herself to simply be present, basking in the love that surrounded her. It was enough. It was more than enough. With Agatha, with Nicky, with this life they were building… the future felt bright and full of hope. And for the first time, Rio didn’t fear it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She was ready.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p>*</p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>                  (T. S. Eliot. “Little Gidding.” <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A few months later, the day dawned bright and warm, a late-May morning carrying the unmistakable promise of summer in the air. Rio woke up early, her heart fluttering with a mix of nerves and excitement. The soft morning light poured through the curtains, painting the room with a warm glow. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She blinked a few times, her eyes adjusting to the softness of the morning, and turned to find Agatha still asleep beside her. Agatha’s peaceful expression made her smile, the soft rise and fall of her chest as she slept, a calming presence beside Rio. In the quiet of the room, Agatha looked so serene, as though the world outside hadn’t yet begun its day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio stayed still for a moment, savoring the tranquility. The weight of the day ahead hung around her like a soft, comforting blanket, familiar but full of promise. She could already feel the rush of anticipation tightening in her chest, a mixture of excitement and nerves. This was the day, after years of hard work, when everything she had sacrificed and poured her heart into would come together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She had spent countless hours hunched over textbooks, in libraries, and in lecture halls. Long nights writing papers, revising drafts, and questioning everything she thought she knew. It had been grueling at times, but it had also been a journey that shaped her in ways she could never have anticipated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But today wasn’t just about her graduation, or the culmination of her academic achievements. It wasn’t just about the recognition she would receive for all of her hard work. Today was about everything that had come before it—the journey that had led her here. The late nights with Agatha by her side, the quiet moments spent in the warmth of their shared space, the words of encouragement and love that had kept her going when self-doubt crept in. Agatha had always been there, a constant source of strength and tenderness, even in moments when Rio thought she couldn’t go any further. Their shared dreams for the future, the ones they spoke of in the early mornings or late at night, when they let their hearts wander beyond the here and now. The vision of what they wanted to build together, side by side, was right there, within her reach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And it was more than that. It was the family they had begun to build—a family that was made of love, of choice, of the spaces they carved out for each other in their lives. There was a quiet joy in knowing that, no matter what this day brought, it would be shared with Agatha. With the person who had seen her at her best and her worst, and loved her all the same. This moment was as much about them as it was about Rio herself. Every triumph, every milestone, every step forward had been something they had walked through together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned her gaze back to Agatha, her heart swelling with affection. The future they had dreamed about, the future that was beginning to unfold, was right here, right beside her. The weight of everything—the accomplishments, the sacrifices, the love—settled into her chest as she gently brushed a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. She smiled, taking in the comfort of this moment. No matter what came next, she had already built something worth cherishing. Something that would carry her through whatever challenges lay ahead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a deep breath, Rio slid out of bed, careful not to disturb the peace around her. She glanced at Agatha, still nestled beneath the covers, her breathing even and calm, a small smile playing at the corners of her lips as if she were still lost in a good dream. Rio tiptoed to the bathroom, taking a moment to wash away the remnants of sleep and the buzzing anticipation building within her. The water was refreshing, like a reset, a small ritual to help clear her mind. She stepped out of the shower, toweling off quickly, the cool air of the morning brushing against her skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When she returned to the bedroom, only clad in the towel, she paused in the doorway. Agatha had woken up in her absence and was sitting up in bed, her expression soft, still half-lost in the gentle haze of sleep. Their eyes met across the room, and an unspoken understanding passed between them. Twin smiles blossomed on their faces—small, intimate, as though the world outside didn’t matter right now. There was only this moment, this shared space of quiet joy and nerves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, future graduate,” Agatha said, her voice warm and tender, filled with that same affection that always seemed to wrap around Rio like a protective embrace. She stood up and moved toward her, reaching out to take Rio’s face in her hands, her thumbs brushing softly against Rio’s skin before she kissed her, gentle and lingering. It was a kiss that said everything Rio didn’t have the words to express right now—how grateful she was, how full her heart was, how much she loved Agatha.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good morning, Dr. Harkness,” Rio replied, her voice thick with the warmth of affection and nervousness. She closed her eyes, savoring the aftertaste of Agatha’s kiss, the reassurance that everything was unfolding just as it should. For a moment, it felt like time had slowed down, just enough for them to savor the quiet before the excitement of the day ahead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ready for today?” Agatha asked, her voice a gentle challenge, but with an underlying tenderness that reminded Rio just how far she had come.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Rio replied, her heart pounding with a mix of excitement and nerves. There was no way to fully prepare for a day like today, but she had walked this path for so long that she could almost feel the weight of every step that had brought her to this point. She had earned this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You deserve it all, my love. Enjoy it,” Agatha said, her eyes full of pride. Her hand brushed against Rio’s arm, the touch grounding, reminding Rio that the moment was hers to live, to embrace.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a breath, glancing down at herself. “I should get dressed,” she said softly, the hum of the day calling her to move forward.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let me help.” Agatha’s voice was low, filled with the kind of quiet affection that only deepened Rio’s appreciation for her. She reached over to the closet, where Rio’s outfit had been carefully laid out the night before, waiting for this very moment, and returned to her side, dress in hand, her movements unhurried and intentional. With a deft hand, she untied the towel wrapped around Rio, letting it slip at her foot to the floor, and Rio couldn’t help but blush. Agatha’s gaze lingered, her eyes soft and appreciative, her smile a mix of adoration and tenderness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“As much as I adore you like this,” Agatha said, her tone teasing but warm, her words heavy with affection, “in all your naked, glorious perfection, I think this might be a better fit for the day.” She held out the dress, the fabric draping gracefully over her arm like a quiet offering.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio reached out to take it, her fingertips brushing against Agatha’s in a fleeting touch that sent a grounding warmth through her. The simple contact felt intimate, grounding—an anchor in a moment that could have easily swept her away in its magnitude.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without a word, Rio slipped the dress on. She stood before the mirror in their bedroom, smoothing a hand over the soft fabric. The dress was simple but perfect—a soft green linen that reached gracefully to her mid-calf. The material moved with her, light and comfortable, and would flare around if she twirled. Two delicate bows sat undone at her shoulders, thick enough to make the dress feel like it was meant for a day like today.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It had been a gift from Agatha, one Rio had hesitated to accept at first. Agatha had picked it out weeks ago, knowing Rio’s preference for simplicity and comfort, yet choosing something just a little more special than she would have picked herself. She remembered Agatha’s soft smile as she handed it to her, the quiet confidence in her eyes. “You could wear this when you walk across that stage. I think it would suit you perfectly.” At the time, Rio had been unsure, but now, as she looked at herself in the mirror, feeling the fabric against her skin, she understood why Agatha had chosen it. It felt perfect. It felt like her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped forward, reverently sliding her hands along Rio’s arms, her fingers brushing the fabric as she carefully tied the bows at her shoulders. The soft cotton slipped through Agatha’s fingers, the gesture intimate, small, yet significant, as if she way tying the loose ends of the journey that was coming to an end today.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Today, Rio would take another leap—into the future, into the recognition of all the hard work and sacrifice. Today, she would become Dr. Vidal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a deep breath and smiled, the nerves still there but tempered by something deeper—a sense of gratitude, love, and achievement. Today, she would celebrate not only her academic journey but the incredible support system that had carried her through it all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let me help you with your hair,” Agatha offered, her fingers gently running through the dark strands.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The gesture was simple, but Rio felt it deeply. Agatha’s hands were always gentle with her, always a reminder that no matter what was happening around them, she was loved and cared for. Agatha’s touch was a reminder of how far Rio had come—from the girl who once felt lost to this moment, standing before the world with so much more than just a degree.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled with pride as she watched Agatha work in the mirror, her steady hands pulling her hair back into a neat style that felt like the perfect balance of elegance and ease. “You look stunning,” Agatha said softly, her hands lingering for a moment on Rio’s shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio met Agatha’s gaze in the mirror, her breath catching as she saw the look of love and pride in her eyes. “Thank you,” she said, her voice barely a whisper.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve worked so hard for this, Rio,” Agatha said, her voice thick with emotion. “I’m so proud of you. So incredibly proud.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, her eyes glistening. It was hard to put into words how much this moment meant—how much Agatha’s unwavering belief in her had shaped who she was today.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I couldn’t have done it without you,” Rio whispered, her voice cracking just slightly. “You’ve been my strength through all of this. I couldn’t have made it here without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, leaning forward to press a kiss to Rio’s temple. “And you’re going to keep going,” she said, her voice filled with quiet determination. “Because you’re amazing. You’ve always been.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio took a deep breath, steadying herself. She could feel her nerves settling, the weight of the day’s significance pressing against her chest. But with Agatha’s touch, with the love and support that had always been there, Rio knew she was ready. She was ready to stand before the world and claim the title she had worked so hard to earn.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just as Agatha finished placing the last pin in Rio’s hair, securing the delicate twists and curls with a small white flower, the door to their bedroom flew open with a burst of energy. Nicky, his small feet pattering against the floor with unrestrained excitement, dashed into the room. His eyes were wide, full of wonder and curiosity, and his smile was as bright as the sun spilling through the windows.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom, you look <em>so</em> pretty!” Nicky exclaimed, his wide eyes shining with awe as he took in Rio’s appearance. His small hands clasped together in front of him, and for a moment, he looked like he could hardly believe his mom was standing right there, all dressed up and radiant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned to him, her smile warm and filled with love. “Thank you, sweetheart,” she said, bending down slightly to meet his gaze. “You like it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love it!” Nicky nodded enthusiastically, his curls bouncing as he did. He looked up at her with sparkling eyes, brimming with excitement. “Will I get to see you walk across the stage? Will you wave to me? <em>Promise</em> you’ll wave!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh, a sound light and genuine that filled the room and chased away the nerves that had been tightly wound inside her moments before. She bent down with practiced ease, scooping Nicky into her arms, his little hands reaching for her neck as she pulled him close, wrapping him in a tight, comforting hug. His small body felt warm against her chest, and the simple joy of being his mother made her heart swell with a love so pure it took her breath away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course, you’ll see me walk across the stage, sweetheart,” she said, her voice soft and reassuring, as though she could calm all of his boundless energy with a few simple words. “And I’ll definitely wave to you,” she added with a smile, her heart fluttering at the thought of Nicky cheering her on.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky clung to her, his tiny arms wrapped around her neck, his face pressed against hers as he whispered conspiratorially, “I’m gonna be so loud, Mom. I’ll cheer louder than anyone else!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart melted at his declaration, her smile growing even wider as she pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “I know you will, my loud little champion,” she said, her voice full of warmth. She pulled back slightly, holding him out just enough to look him in the eyes, her affection for him almost overwhelming.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">From the corner of the room, Agatha watched this tender moment unfold with a soft smile, her heart swelling with pride. She had always known Rio to be the chaotic, unpredictable force in their family, but seeing her like this—so full of love for Nicky, so full of life, so completely immersed in the joy of this morning—was a reminder of just how much she had grown. The transformation was both beautiful and humbling. Rio wasn’t just a partner; she was a mother, a daughter, a force of nature with so much to give.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gently set Nicky down, her fingers brushing through his hair in a playful ruffle, her face lit with affection. “You know what?” Rio said, looking into his bright, eager eyes. “Hearing you cheer is going to be my favorite part of the day.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s grin stretched from ear to ear. “Really?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Really,” Rio confirmed, her voice soft but full of love. She leaned down and kissed his forehead. “You’re my good luck charm, you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky giggled, wrapping his small arms around her waist in a quick but tight hug. “I love you, Mom.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you, too,” Rio whispered, her voice catching just slightly as the moment settled in her heart, filling it to the brim.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes sparkled with determination. “I’m gonna make sure everyone knows you’re my mom!” he announced with a beaming grin, his little chest puffing out with pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The simple words struck Rio like a gentle wave, washing over her with an unexpected flood of warmth. Her heart, already full from the love she felt for Nicky, expanded even further as she looked at him—her son, her family. She caught a glimpse of Agatha, who had been watching them both with an almost imperceptible softness in her eyes. There was so much love between them, so much shared history, so much to be grateful for. In this moment, Rio could hardly believe how far she had come—from the girl who had once been unsure, lost in her own struggles, to this confident, whole woman, surrounded by the people who made her life everything she’d ever dreamed of.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As if reading her thoughts, Agatha met Rio’s gaze across the room. A small, knowing smile played at the corners of her lips. It was a smile that spoke volumes—of pride, of deep affection, of a love that needed no words to be understood. In that moment, Rio knew exactly what Agatha was thinking. She knew how proud she was of her, how much she loved her. It was a silent exchange, but it was louder than anything either of them could have said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, kiddo,” Agatha said, her voice light but firm, as she stepped toward Nicky to coax him toward the door. “Let’s let Mom finish getting ready and get you dressed. We don’t want to miss the ceremony. And remember—you’re the loudest cheerer in the room, okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s face lit up even more, his eyes practically sparkling with mischief. “You got it, Mama!” he said, already bouncing on his heels in anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha led Nicky toward the door, Rio watched them, a soft smile on her lips. But just before they left the room, Agatha turned back, her eyes twinkling with love. She blew Rio a playful kiss, her gesture light and filled with affection. It was the perfect little moment—one that Rio would carry with her throughout the day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Today wasn’t just another milestone in Rio’s life—it was a new chapter. Today, she would step into the next phase of her journey, both as a graduate and as a mother, partner, and woman. It was a day that Agatha had stood by her for from the very beginning, and in her heart, Rio knew that Agatha would always be there, supporting her every step of the way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Today, Rio would cross that stage with the people she loved cheering her on, and nothing felt more perfect than that.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, Agatha, Lilia, and Nicky arrived at the graduation venue, stepping into the vast, grand hall that seemed to stretch endlessly before them. The soaring ceiling, adorned with elegant chandeliers, arched high above, as if reaching for the heavens themselves. The rows of seats below were already filling with proud families, eager faculty, and excited students—each person buzzing with anticipation as they waited for the ceremony to begin. Rio felt a flutter of nerves mixed with excitement as they entered, the weight of the moment settling over her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they moved through the crowded room, Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand one last time, offering her a look of quiet reassurance. With her characteristic poise, Agatha released her hand and moved gracefully toward the stage, her steps deliberate and confident as she took her place among the faculty. There was something powerful in the way Agatha held herself, a subtle shift in her posture that made it clear she was no ordinary professor. She belonged here, standing among the distinguished educators who had helped shape the future of so many. As Rio watched her from across the room, their eyes met for a brief, intimate moment, that was enough to calm the last of her nerves.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, in the front row, Lilia sat with Nicky, who was practically vibrating with excitement. The sheer joy radiating from him was contagious, and Rio’s heart skipped a beat as she took in the sight of her little boy. Nicky’s energy was palpable; he was bouncing in his seat, practically bursting with pride as he waited to see his mom walk across that stage. He was dressed to the nines, a small bowtie neatly tied around his neck, his outfit crisp and polished for the occasion. His eyes were fixed on Rio with an intensity that made her heart swell. It wasn’t just admiration in his gaze—it was pure, unfiltered love, the kind that only a child could offer. His face glowed with a smile that could light up the entire room, and it struck Rio how deeply he had changed her life. He had taught her what it meant to love unconditionally.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She took a deep breath, her nerves calm now that she was surrounded by her family. They were all there for her, each one a pillar of unwavering support. Lilia, her mother, who had been there for so long, providing love, stability, and wisdom when Rio needed it the most. Agatha, her partner, the woman who was her everything, the woman who had stood by her side through thick and thin, who had believed in her even when Rio doubted herself. And Nicky, their son, the one who had brought a whole new dimension of meaning to her life—a little boy who, with his infectious joy and love, had given Rio one more reason to dream, to push forward.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Pulling herself from the comforting thoughts that had briefly carried her away, Rio made her way through the bustling hall, her eyes scanning the crowd in search of her two best friends. The air was thick with excitement, filled with the buzz of conversations and the sound of heels clicking against the polished floors, but Rio’s heart lightened when she spotted Alice first. Her vibrant black and red hair was unmistakable, even from a distance, a striking contrast to the sea of black graduation gowns. Beside Alice stood Jen, her calm yet radiant presence adding a quiet balance to the scene. The two women were standing together, their matching gowns flowing around them as they laughed, their hands clasped into each other’s, their joy unmistakable. Their faces lit up with that infectious energy that had carried them all through their academic journey.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but feel a surge of gratitude for the shared experiences, for the late nights and long hours spent in libraries, the endless conversations about everything and nothing, the way the three of them had always had each other’s backs. They had been through it all, and now here they were, standing together at the finish line, ready to take on whatever came next.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, you two!” Rio called out, her voice carrying across the crowded hall. As soon as the words left her lips, the last of her anxiety vanished away, replaced by the comfort of their familiar faces.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s eyes flicked up, and when she saw Rio, a wide grin spread across her face. “There she is!” Alice teased, her tone playful, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “How does it feel to be one of the stars of the show?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, always a little more reserved but just as enthusiastic, gave Rio a knowing smile. “It’s surreal, huh? We’ve all worked so hard for this moment.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled softly. “Surreal doesn’t even begin to describe it. I feel like I’ve been waiting for this day forever, but now that it’s here, it feels like it’s happening too fast. Like I’m not even sure how I got here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, we know that feeling,” Alice said, bumping her shoulder against Rio’s playfully. “But we made it!” She paused for a moment, her expression softening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled at the bond the three of them shared—three women who had supported each other through so much, and now, here they were, on the verge of a new chapter in their lives.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s expression softened slightly, her voice quieter but full of meaning. “We’re here. We did it. Together, like we always said we would.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And someone is graduating with high honors, no less!” Jen added, her pride evident in her voice. “You’ve earned this, Rio. You’re incredible.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thanks,” Rio said quietly, feeling a rush of emotion. “But I couldn’t have done it without both of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Stop it,” Alice laughed. “We were all in this together. No one did it alone.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They exchanged a moment of knowing glances, a shared understanding between them. They had all started this journey as individuals, but they had grown together, each of them leaning on the others when things got tough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With the ceremony about to begin, the trio moved toward their assigned seats with the other graduates, their black gowns swishing as they walked in sync.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they sat down, Rio glanced over at Alice and Jen, both of them looking as proud as she felt. There was a calmness in the air now, an understanding that this was the final step in a long, challenging journey. The nerves that had once been so strong inside Rio began to settle, replaced by a sense of anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was time to graduate—not just as a student, but as a new version of herself, one who had found her place in the world.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The ceremony began with the soft hum of excited whispers that gradually fell into a respectful silence as the dean stepped up to the podium, a commanding presence in the center of the grand hall.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His tall, imposing figure paused for a brief moment, surveying the sea of graduates, family members, and faculty gathered before him. The smile that tugged at the corners of his lips was warm, prideful, and full of acknowledgment—recognizing the hard work and sacrifice that had led to this moment. With a sweeping glance over the crowd, the dean cleared his throat, and the room fell into an expectant hush.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Today, we gather to celebrate the achievements of a remarkable group of students,” the dean began, his voice steady and full of pride. “A group of individuals who, through determination, discipline, and unwavering commitment, have proven that there is no challenge too great for those who set their minds to it. These graduates have poured hours of work, countless nights of study, and heart and soul into their fields of study. They have overcome obstacles, faced the unexpected, and persevered in the pursuit of knowledge, excellence, and truth.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The words carried through the hall, reverberating off the high ceilings, each syllable imbued with the weight of their meaning. The graduates in the audience sat straighter, their hearts swelling with pride as the dean spoke of the passion and effort they had invested in their journey. There was something about hearing it said aloud—something about the recognition that made their years of hard work feel tangible, real, like a building that had been meticulously crafted brick by brick, each experience adding another layer of accomplishment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Today is not just about degrees or honors,” the dean continued, his voice deepening with emotion. “It is about the culmination of a journey, a journey that has shaped you, tested you, and most importantly, helped you grow. You have all arrived here not only with knowledge but with a sense of purpose, a drive that will carry you forward into the next chapter of your lives. This is the moment where we pause to reflect on everything you have achieved—both the challenges overcome and the triumphs celebrated. But it is also the moment where we acknowledge the path ahead, the unknowns and the opportunities that await you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A soft murmur rippled through the crowd, the dean’s words striking a chord with the students. Some smiled, others were lost in thought, but all of them shared the same sense of reverence. It wasn’t just about the degree—it was the people they had become through the process. It was the late nights studying together, the support of friends, the professors who pushed them to be their best, and the sense of community that had guided them to this pivotal point.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“As we call each of your names today,” the dean continued, his tone shifting to one of quiet reverence, “we honor not just the knowledge you have acquired, but the growth that has occurred within you. You have learned not only from books and lectures but from one another. From your experiences. From the moments of failure that taught you resilience, and from the moments of success that proved you could rise to any challenge.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air felt charged now, the words stirring something in the hearts of the graduates, making them feel both reflective and hopeful. Rio’s gaze wandered briefly to her friends, Alice and Jen, and then to Agatha, sitting among the faculty. The pride in Agatha’s eyes made Rio’s heart swell. She had come so far, and now, it was finally here—the moment of recognition.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The world is waiting for you,” the dean said, his voice filled with a sense of responsibility and promise. “Your education has equipped you with tools—tools to build, to innovate, to create, to question. But above all, it has equipped you with the ability to make an impact. Whether in science, in art, in business, or any other field, <em>you</em> are the architects of the future. And the future, as we know, will not wait for you to catch up. It will be built by your hands, shaped by your decisions, and driven by your vision.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The graduates sat still, absorbing the weight of the dean’s words, their eyes reflecting a mixture of awe, excitement, and even a hint of uncertainty. What lay ahead was unknown, but the dean had just reminded them of their power to shape it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Today is not an end,” the dean concluded, a sense of finality settling in his voice. “It is a beginning. The beginning of your journey beyond these halls. As you step out into the world, remember the lessons you’ve learned, the bonds you’ve formed, and the dreams you’ve dared to chase. Know that you are prepared for whatever comes next, and that you are never alone. You carry the legacy of this institution with you, and more importantly, you carry the promise of your own potential. We are proud of you all, and we look forward to the incredible things you will accomplish.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A wave of applause filled the hall as the dean quieted for a moment, the room buzzing with the energy of accomplishment and anticipation. The air, once thick with nerves and anxiety, now felt light, full of possibility. The graduates looked at each other, some wiping away tears, others grinning widely, all standing together in the shared experience of the moment. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’ll proceed alphabetically” the dean announced, his voice carrying across the hall, full of warmth and pride. He smiled down at the row of students seated in front of them, each one preparing to step forward in a momentous rite of passage. The air was thick with anticipation, the collective buzz of excitement palpable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“When I call your name,” the dean continued, his tone infused with gravitas, “please step forward and claim what is now rightfully yours—a testament to your hard work, perseverance, and dedication.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart picked up its rhythm as the dean’s gaze swept over the graduates, and she couldn’t help but feel a surge of energy. This was the moment. Her friends had worked so hard to get here, and now, they were about to cross the finish line.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dean’s voice echoed through the hall as the first names were called, and Rio watched as one by one, students rose to their feet. Their movements were measured but full of meaning, their faces illuminated by a mixture of pride, relief, and excitement. The steady rhythm of applause filled the space as each name was announced, and Rio couldn’t help but smile, her own sense of accomplishment intertwined with theirs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jennifer Kale,” the dean announced suddenly, his voice ringing clear and sure.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen stood up immediately, her tall frame standing out among the sea of graduates. She looked back at Rio and Alice, giving them a small, excited wave before making her way to the stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Go, Jen!” Rio cheered, the words tumbling out of her with enthusiasm she couldn’t hold back. Her voice rang loud and clear, cutting through the room as if propelled by sheer joy. She saw Jen’s face light up, her lips parting into a bright, wide grin as she looked back at Rio, their eyes meeting for a split second before Jen turned her attention to the stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, who was sitting just behind Rio, leaned in with a soft smile. “That’s my girl,” she whispered, her voice full of pride and love, as they both watched Jen make her way down the aisle. “God, I love her so much.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dean handed Jen her diploma, and the moment seemed to stretch in Rio’s mind, as if the world paused to honor her friend’s accomplishment. Jen’s smile was radiant, a mixture of relief and excitement as she turned to face the audience, beaming with pride. The dean placed the doctoral hood over her head, and Jen straightened up with a sense of dignity that left Rio in awe.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Jen made her way back to her seat, Rio could hardly contain herself. She clapped enthusiastically, her hands vibrating with energy, feeling every bit of the pride she had for Jen’s success.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The ceremony continued, the names of graduates being called one by one. Rio clapped along with the rest of the audience, her heart swelling with pride for each of her peers as they crossed the stage to receive their diplomas. The atmosphere was electric, filled with an overwhelming sense of accomplishment that vibrated in the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then, the dean’s voice rang out again, cutting through the murmur of the crowd with authority and warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio Vidal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The room seemed to hold its breath, and for a moment, Rio felt as though the entire world had slowed down. Her heart thudded in her chest as she stood, her green dress swaying softly underneath her gown with each step she took toward the stage. The soft linen fabric brushed against her legs, grounding her in the moment as she walked up the aisles towards the stage.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She met Agatha’s gaze as she reached the front, and the world seemed to narrow until it was just the two of them. Agatha’s smile was warm, but the depth of emotion in her eyes took Rio by surprise—there was a fierceness, a pride that transcended words. It wasn’t just a smile; it was a look that made Rio feel seen, loved, and understood in a way that no one else could.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio walked up the few steps that led to the stage and, to her surprise, she saw Agatha stand up from her seat among the faculty, her eyes never leaving Rio as she crossed the stage with purpose.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was a pause, a collective inhale from the audience. Traditionally, it was the dean who placed the doctoral hood over the graduate’s shoulders, but Agatha’s confident stride toward Rio was a clear signal that this moment meant more than tradition. The dean, after a brief glance, nodded approvingly, as if he knew what was about to happen, understanding the significance of this personal gesture between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took the hood from the dean’s hands with a grace that was almost reverential, her fingers brushing against the soft fabric, her touch lingering as if savoring the moment. She turned to face Rio, and the entire room seemed to hold its breath. The quiet tension in the air made it feel as though time had slowed, allowing them to stretch this second into eternity. Rio’s pulse quickened, but she held still, her heart swelling with emotion. She couldn’t tear her gaze away from Agatha, who approached her with a quiet confidence, each step bringing them closer to this pinnacle moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In one fluid motion, Agatha ceremoniously draped the hood over Rio’s shoulders, her touch gentle but deliberate. The weight of the moment seemed to settle on Rio’s shoulders along with the hood, a symbol of her years of hard work, her growth, and everything she had achieved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned in slightly, her voice low and intimate, though clear enough for Rio to hear. “Congratulations, Dr. Vidal,” she murmured, the words rich with emotion, each syllable carrying a depth of pride and love that only Agatha could convey. There was something in the way Agatha spoke that made Rio’s chest tighten—a promise, a recognition of all they had gone through together, and a celebration of everything Rio had become.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s smile widened as she looked into Agatha’s eyes, the emotion and history between them evident in the way they shared this quiet exchange. “Thank you, Dr. Harkness,” she replied, her voice steady but rich with warmth. Her words carried a teasing lilt, a playful edge that was uniquely theirs. It was an inside joke, a reminder of the playful, ever-present chemistry that ran between them—of the late nights spent together, the laughter, the tears, and the quiet moments of understanding. This was more than just a formal exchange—it was a reflection of their entire relationship, the highs and lows, the shared triumphs, and the deep emotional connection that had gotten them to this point.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They now stood as equals in every sense of the word.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curled into a soft smile, her eyes glimmering with pride and affection. For a brief moment, the noise of the audience faded away, leaving just the two of them standing together in that precious instant. They shared a glance that said everything—love, partnership, mutual respect, and the quiet understanding that this was just one of many milestones they would reach together. Then, with a simple movement of her hand, Agatha invited Rio to face the crowd, and present herself in her new light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned back to face the audience, her heart full, her hand brushing against the hood resting on her shoulders. She was no longer just Rio Vidal; she was <em>Dr. Rio Vidal</em>. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The applause filled the room, and Rio stood on the stage, momentarily lost in the sea of sound. She felt the weight of the moment settle on her shoulders, but it wasn’t a burden—it was a celebration. The overwhelming sense of accomplishment and pride was almost too much to contain, and she smiled, her heart soaring with every clap and cheer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, through the applause, she heard a voice that cut through the noise—small, excited, and full of joy. “Mommy! Yay!” Nicky’s voice rang out, unmistakable and filled with so much love and energy. The sound hit Rio like a wave, and her heart swelled. She couldn’t help but smile brighter, the sound of her son’s joy ringing in her ears. Nicky’s excitement was palpable, his pure joy echoing through the auditorium as if he was cheering for her alone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio turned her head, and there, in the front row, was Nicky, bouncing in his seat, his little hands clapping with enthusiasm. His wide grin was infectious, and Rio’s chest tightened with emotion as she waved a little, like she had promised him. She caught a glimpse of Lilia beside him, clapping proudly, her eyes shining with tears of happiness. The sight of her mother, who had given so much of herself to raise Rio, filled her with gratitude. Lilia’s face was a reflection of everything Rio had worked for—the love, the dedication, the quiet moments of support.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The joy of the moment swelled within Rio, overwhelming her in the best way. Her family was here, surrounding her with love and pride, and she knew she had everything she needed in that moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a final glance at Agatha, who stood watching her with the same pride and admiration, Rio straightened her shoulders, her heart soaring. <em>Dr. Vidal</em>—it had a certain ring to it, one she knew she would carry with grace, with humility, and with the knowledge that this was only the beginning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio returned to her seat, her heart still fluttering from the moment on stage. As the ceremony continued, she listened to the names being called, but her mind kept drifting back to the powerful moments she had just experienced—the sound of Nicky’s excited cheers cutting through the applause, the weight of the doctoral hood resting comfortably on her shoulders and back, and the pride in Agatha’s eyes as she placed the hood on her. Every part of the ceremony felt surreal, a culmination of everything she had worked for, but also a reflection of all the love and support that had gotten her there.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The world felt like it had shifted ever so slightly, and she was anchored in this moment of joy, surrounded by her family, her friends, and the community that had nurtured her along the way. It was as if she was floating, everything else fading into the background.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then, just as her thoughts began to settle, Alice’s name was called.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alice Wu-Gulliver.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s attention snapped back to the present, and she instantly focused, her excitement bubbling over. She cheered loudly for her best friend, her voice carrying through the auditorium. Alice had been her constant companion throughout this journey, and seeing her friend up on that stage, receiving her degree in musicology, was a moment Rio would remember forever.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yay, Alice!” Rio called, her voice brimming with pride and joy for her friend. She waved enthusiastically, her hand above her head, making sure Alice could see her cheering from the crowd.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice smiled brightly as she took the stage, her gown flowing around her, and gave Rio a small wave. The connection between them was palpable, their bond forged through long hours of studying, shared laughter, and countless cups of coffee. Alice’s achievement was Rio’s as well, and the pride she felt for her friend was immense.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Alice stood at the front, receiving her diploma and hood, Rio’s heart swelled again, this time with happiness for the journey that they had all completed together. It was a bittersweet moment, knowing that their time as students was ending, but also filled with anticipation for the new chapters that lay ahead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The ceremony continued, but Rio’s mind stayed with Alice, with Jen, with Nicky, with Agatha, with Lilia and with the incredible sense of accomplishment that was shared between her and her friends.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yes, it was an ending—an end to a long, hard-earned journey—but more importantly, it was the first step into a future that, for the first time in her life, felt entirely within her reach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Agatha watched Rio from her seat on the stage, she felt a profound mix of emotions swelling in her chest—pride, love, admiration. There had been so many moments where she had witnessed Rio struggle, grow, and overcome obstacles, but today was different. Today, Rio wasn’t just the student who had come to her with a thirst for knowledge; she was a woman who had become everything Agatha had always hoped she would be and more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wasn’t just a student anymore, not just the woman who had walked into her office with a notebook full of scribbles. Rio had grown into a mother, a fierce protector of Nicky, a woman who Agatha had fallen for harder than she even thought was possible, a partner who stood by Agatha’s side through every challenge, and a woman who had carved out a space for herself in a world that had once felt too big. Agatha had watched her blossom into someone who was equal parts strength and tenderness, someone who was capable of so much more than she had once believed possible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio sat there, her face glowing with pride, Agatha felt a deep, overwhelming sense of accomplishment swell within her. She had watched Rio grow, stumble, rise again—had been there every step of the way, offering guidance, challenges, support, and unwavering love when Rio needed it most. It had been a journey of transformation, not just for Rio, but for them both.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But now, in that moment, Agatha looked at Rio not as someone she had helped along the way, but as her equal, her partner in every sense. It was a quiet realization, one that settled deep in her chest, warming her from the inside out. They had come so far together, and now Rio stood as a reflection of her strength, determination, and brilliance—a force in her own right.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The love between them was immense—so quiet in its depth, yet loud enough to fill every corner of their lives. It had been forged in shared experiences, in challenges faced and conquered together, and in moments of pure, unrestrained joy. Today, more than any other, was a testament to everything they had built together: the life they had created, the family they had made, and the future that was now stretching out before them, wide and full of possibility.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s heart swelled with pride—not just for Rio, for the woman she had become, but for the life they had built side by side. The love, the family, the future—it was all unfolding in this single, perfect moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could see it all clearly now: all the paths they had walked, the hurdles they had overcome, and the countless victories—big and small—that had shaped them. And as she looked at Rio, standing so tall and proud, Agatha knew one thing with absolute certainty: no matter what lay ahead, she was more than ready to face it all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And she would face it with Rio by her side, every step of the way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the ceremony finally came to an end, Rio found Alice and Jen, both of whom were already grinning from ear to ear. As soon as they saw her, they couldn’t contain their excitement and rushed over to her. Without a second thought, the three of them jumped around, laughing and cheering like little girls, their joy bubbling over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We did it! We actually did it!” Alice squealed, her voice high-pitched with excitement as she spun in a circle, her graduation gown billowing out around her like a cape. The sight was so pure, so unfiltered, that Rio couldn’t help but laugh, her own spirit soaring. Jen joined in, unable to resist the infectious energy of Alice’s antics. She broke into a little happy dance, her laughter spilling out, loud and contagious, and Rio couldn’t help but join them, her heart light and her cheeks aching from smiling so much.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’re Dr. Wu-Gulliver, Dr. Kale, and Dr. Vidal!” Jen shouted, still bouncing on her feet, her pride shining through with every syllable. The three of them looked at each other, the weight of their new titles settling in slowly, as though they had just unlocked a new level in a game they had been playing for years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t believe it!” Rio exclaimed, her voice brimming with excitement. Her eyes were sparkling, reflecting the enormity of the moment. “We’ve come so far.” Her words felt like they had been years in the making, and now, standing there with her two best friends, they felt almost impossible to comprehend. But the truth was undeniable—they had worked for this. They had earned it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They collapsed into a group hug, arms thrown around each other, laughing and holding on tight as though the world outside of that embrace didn’t matter anymore. It felt like all the weight of their accomplishments, all the sacrifices they had made, was finally sinking in. After all the sleepless nights, the stress, the self-doubt, and the relentless pursuit of something greater, they were here, together, with PhDs to their names.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m so proud of us,” Alice said, her voice thick with emotion, her usual energy softened by the weight of her own pride.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled as she took in the sight of her best friends—these two women who had supported her through the toughest of times, and who she’d supported in return. They had all walked this journey together, and now, they were standing on the other side, ready to take on whatever came next.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they separated, Rio felt an undeniable pull toward her family, who had been waiting patiently at the entrance of the room. Her heart was still racing from the ceremony, her chest full of pride and excitement, but she was eager to see the faces that had been her constant support throughout this journey.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment she spotted them, her heart skipped a beat. Nicky, her beloved little boy, was the first to see her. His eyes lit up as he jumped to his feet and, with all the energy a six-year-old could muster, dashed towards her. Before she could take another step, he had practically launched himself into her arms, wrapping his small arms around her neck in an enthusiastic hug that knocked the wind out of her but filled her with overwhelming joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly, lifting him effortlessly into her arms and holding him close. She could feel his heart thudding in excitement against her chest, a mirror to her own. Nicky beamed at her, his eyes wide with awe, and his little hands reached up eagerly to touch the doctoral hood resting on Rio’s shoulders, his touch gentle but filled with admiration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom, you did it!” Nicky exclaimed, his voice full of pride. “You’re the best! You’re Dr. Mommy!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The title—Dr. Mommy—struck Rio deeply, and she smiled, her heart overflowing with joy as she kissed his forehead. She could barely contain her happiness—seeing her son so proud of her, so sure of her, made everything worth it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With a wide, gleaming grin, Nicky reached into the pocket of his little dress pants and pulled out something he had made himself—a small diploma. It was drawn with crayons in a childlike scrawl, with squiggly letters that only a mother could decipher. Despite its simplicity, it was the most precious thing Rio had ever received. She held it close to her chest, tears welling up in her eyes as she looked at the love and effort he had poured into it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, my little love,” Rio whispered, her voice thick with emotion as she hugged him tighter, feeling the warmth of his small body in her arms. “This means everything to me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia, who had been watching the exchange with tearful eyes, walked up and pulled Rio into a tight embrace, her hands gentle but firms around her. “I’m so proud of you, sweet girl,” Lilia murmured, her voice thick with emotion as she wiped away a stray tear. “Look at how far you’ve come.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio squeezed her mother tightly, grateful for the unconditional love and support Lilia had always given her. Lilia had been the one constant in her life, the woman who had opened her heart and home to Rio when she needed it most. “I couldn’t have done it without you, Mom,” Rio whispered, her voice muffled by Lilia’s shoulder. “You’ve always been there for me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Just then, Rio felt a familiar presence behind her, and she didn’t need to turn around to know who it was. Agatha was standing there, radiating warmth and pride. Rio slowly turned toward her, her heart fluttering at the sight of her lover, who was now walking toward her with a purposeful stride. Without a word, Agatha reached out, pulling Rio close to her with a strength that grounded Rio completely. The comforting, steady embrace of Agatha’s arms wrapped around her like a shield, a place of sanctuary that only Agatha could offer. None of them cared if anyone saw them anymore. After all, Rio wasn’t a student anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand slid into Rio’s, their fingers intertwining in a quiet, intimate moment, before Agatha brought Rio’s hand to her mouth, kissing the back of It lightly. It was a simple touch, but it spoke volumes. It was their wordless exchange of gratitude, love, and deep connection. No words were necessary; they had already said everything with a glance, a touch, and a shared understanding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The little family stood together, surrounded by love, each of them feeling the weight of the moment in their own way. Rio looked at Agatha, her eyes filled with love and gratitude, and in that moment, everything felt perfect.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify">*</p><p align="justify"> </p>

Eliot. “Burnt Norton”. <em>Four Quartets</em>.)</p><p> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After the grand graduation ceremony in the hall, the university’s sprawling gardens came alive with a festive, almost enchanting air for the PhD graduates’ garden party. The evening sun cast a warm, golden glow over the space, softening the edges of the vibrant greenery and adding an extra layer of magic to the scene. Classical music, the kind that seemed to float through the air like a gentle breeze, filtered through the trees, creating a serene and elegant backdrop to the gathering. Twinkling fairy lights hung like stars in the branches above, their soft glow illuminating the pathways and the guests below as dusk settled around them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Long tables, each draped in crisp white linens, were lined with meticulously arranged displays of refreshments—an assortment of finger foods, sparkling drinks in delicate glasses, and trays of delicate desserts that looked too beautiful to eat. Platters of fruit, cheese, and pastries glistened under the ambient lighting, their colors vivid against the soft ivory tablecloths. The scent of freshly cut flowers from nearby vases mixed with the crisp evening air, adding to the sensory pleasure of the event.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The graduates, now wearing their hard-earned doctoral hoods, mingled with their families and faculty members, their faces flushed with pride and excitement. Conversations filled the air, a mix of gratitude, congratulatory words, and reflections on the journey that had led them all here. Laughter rang out, clear and light, blending harmoniously with the music. The atmosphere was one of camaraderie, of celebration for not just the academic accomplishments, but for the shared experiences that had brought everyone together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio walked through the crowd, her graduation gown still draped over her green dress, the silky material brushing against her calves as she moved. Beside her were Agatha, whose presence radiated quiet pride; Lilia, beaming with maternal joy; and Nicky, full of exuberant energy, darted excitedly between the adults, his small feet barely touching the ground as he ran ahead, then paused to catch up again. His bowtie was a little crooked, but it only made his joy even more contagious. His laughter filled the air, a sound that Rio knew she would carry with her always, a symbol of the love that bound their family together. Alice and Jen, also in their black gowns, walked alongside them, still riding the high of the ceremony.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt a new kind of lightness in her chest—a mix of freedom and accomplishment. She was no longer a student, no longer tethered to endless drafts and looming deadlines. Instead, she stood here, surrounded by the people she loved, ready to celebrate not only the journey she had completed but the life she was stepping into.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The gardens stretched out before them in a scene of understated elegance. Graduates in their gowns and their families moved gracefully between the tables, some pausing to capture the moment in photos, others lost in conversations, reminiscing about their time at the university. The air was thick with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, a light breeze carrying the fragrance of freshly cut grass as it swept through the lush greenery. It was a perfect evening, as though the very world had conspired to mark the significance of the occasion</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced around, taking it all in, her heart swelling with gratitude. Today wasn’t just about a degree—it was about every step that had brought her here, every person who had supported her along the way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze swept across the garden, noticing the way her friends and family moved through the crowd, each of them carrying their own joy, their own sense of accomplishment. As they wandered further into the lush gardens, the sounds of laughter and lighthearted conversation enveloped them like a comforting blanket. The clink of glasses, the soft hum of music drifting from the nearby string quartet, and the occasional burst of laughter filled the air, blending into a symphony of celebration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s attention was pulled towards Alice and Jen, who had snuck away from the crowd for a moment of fun. Their eyes sparkled as they each snatched a glass of champagne from a nearby tray, their faces lit with that familiar, carefree joy. Without a word, they shared a quick, silent toast, the moment as simple as it was pure. Rio felt a warm smile tug at her lips as she watched them. She joined in their laughter, feeling the last vestiges of the tension of the day slip away as her heart opened to the joy of it all. They had earned this. All of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening was young, and Rio knew, deep down, that this night—this celebration—was just the beginning. There was so much more ahead. The promise of the future, the excitement of new opportunities, and the comfort of knowing she had the people she loved most by her side. It was a moment of both reflection and anticipation, and Rio couldn’t help but feel that everything was exactly as it was meant to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now that Rio was officially no longer a student, and Agatha no longer her professor, there was a shift in the air between them—one of freedom. For so long, their relationship had been one of secrecy, hidden away in the quiet corners of their lives, tucked behind closed doors and shielded by cautious glances and fleeting touches. It had been a delicate dance, each step measured and restrained, as they balanced the unspoken tension of their growing bond with the responsibilities of their roles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But tonight—tonight, everything had changed. With Rio’s graduation, the final curtain had fallen on that chapter of their lives. No longer were they confined by the rules of student and professor, no longer bound by the formalities and restrictions that had once kept their feelings carefully tucked away. There were no more professional lines to toe, no more whispered conversations or stolen moments in the shadows. Tonight, they were simply two people who had been through everything together—the trials, the triumphs, the heartaches—and had come out stronger for it. The air between them hummed with the electricity of freedom, a heady mix of anticipation and the comfort of knowing that they could finally be who they truly were without fear of consequence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For so long, they had kept the intensity of their feelings wrapped in the silence of their professional roles. But now, that silence could finally break. Tonight, there were no more walls between them, no more rules to follow. They could move freely, speak openly, touch without hesitation. They had crossed an invisible threshold, one that signified more than just the end of Rio’s academic journey. It was the beginning of something new—something entirely their own. No longer restrained by the roles they had played for so long, they were free to fully embrace the depth of their bond, to explore it in all its glory and its complexity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha and Rio moved through the gardens side by side, their connection now free to be as open as they wanted. Agatha’s hand rested lightly on Rio’s back as they walked, a gesture so subtle yet intimate, one that said without words, <em>She is mine.</em> Rio could feel the warmth of Agatha’s hand through the fabric of her dress, a grounding presence, one that made the world feel softer, more real. Rio glanced up at her, catching the faint shimmer of the fairy lights in Agatha’s hair, her dress catching the soft golden hue that spilled from above. Agatha’s eyes met hers with a smile that was at once tender and knowing, filled with pride and affection. It was a smile that carried so many quiet moments, hidden support, and the depth of their bond.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt the shift too, a lightness in her steps, a warmth spreading through her chest. There was no need to guard her feelings anymore. She could lean into Agatha as they walked, brushing their arms together, or laugh at something Alice said without worrying if her gaze lingered on Agatha too long. It was liberating, this new openness. It felt like shedding an old skin and stepping fully into the life they had built together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know,” Rio said with a quiet laugh, glancing over at Agatha, “it feels a little strange, not having to hide.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile softened, her eyes flickering with a knowing affection. “I think it’s one of the best feelings in the world,” she replied softly, her voice almost a whisper in the evening air. “We deserve this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her heart swelling with gratitude, as they continued their walk. “We do,” she agreed, her gaze drifting over the faces of their friends and colleagues gathered around. Alice, Jen, and Lilia were scattered throughout the crowd, chatting and laughing, their faces alight with the joy of the evening. Everything seemed to be unfolding exactly as it should.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they passed a group of colleagues, Agatha’s hand slipped over Rio’s back again, a quiet reassurance that they were in this together. Agatha didn’t need to say anything; it was clear to anyone watching that their link was undeniable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio caught the gaze of one of Agatha’s colleagues, a curious glance that quickly shifted away when she saw how Agatha’s hand remained on Rio’s back. There was no hiding now. Their bond was written in every glance, in every touch, in the subtle way they moved as one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they reached a nearby table, Agatha handed Rio a glass of champagne. As their fingers brushed, Rio’s pulse quickened. Agatha met her gaze, and for a moment, the world seemed to disappear. They had fought for this—had worked, sacrificed, and loved for this moment—and now, it was theirs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s laughter bubbled up as Alice, who was talking animatedly nearby, caught her attention. “I’m going to need to keep an eye on you two,” Alice teased, her eyes twinkling with playful mischief. “I think everyone’s starting to notice.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile deepened, but her eyes never left Rio’s. “Let them,” she said, her voice low and steady, filled with the quiet power of their shared understanding. “It’s time for everyone to know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt the heat in her cheeks, but she didn’t look away. Instead, she reached out, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s hand in return, a silent affirmation of the love they no longer needed to hide.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they moved from the refreshment table, Lilia approached with Nicky in tow, the little boy holding onto his grandmother’s hand with one of his and a half-eaten cookie in the other, crumbs falling onto the floor with each enthusiastic step.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyes twinkled with a knowing glint as she came to stand beside them, a soft chuckle escaping her lips. “You two are practically glowing,” she teased, her voice light and playful, yet filled with affection. Her gaze flickered between Agatha and Rio, and the pride in her eyes was unmistakable. “It’s about time the world sees what I’ve known all along.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio blushed slightly, but the grin tugging at her lips was unstoppable. “It feels… strange but good,” she admitted, her voice soft as she glanced up at Agatha. “Not having to hide anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand, which had been resting gently by her side, moved then, slipping into Rio’s with the quietest of gestures. Her fingers interlocked with Rio’s in a seamless, natural way, as if it had always been meant to be like this. “It’s more than good,” Agatha said gently, her voice carrying a quiet certainty that made Rio’s heart flutter. “It’s exactly as it should be.” Agatha’s certainty became Rio’s anchor in that moment, reminding her that they had earned this. <em>They had earned the right to be seen, to be loved without barriers.</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia was the picture of    the proud mother and bustled around with her camera in hand, determined to document every precious moment of the day. She waved Rio over with an excited gesture. “Come on, sweet girl, we need pictures to remember this! Stand right there, right under the lights!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed softly but complied, standing amidst the soft glow of the fairy lights. Her green dress flowed gracefully beneath her black graduation gown, her doctoral hood resting proudly on her shoulders. She posed for Lilia, a soft smile on her lips, her eyes sparkling with happiness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Perfect,” Lilia said, clicking the shutter. “Now, Nicky, go to your mom!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At the sound of his name, Nicky’s small feet scurried across the grass, his bowtie still crooked and a few cookie crumbs dotting his shirt as he clutched the remnants of yet another treat. Rio, beaming, held out her arms, and Nicky, with a delighted laugh, practically threw himself into her embrace. She caught him easily, lifting him into her arms and holding him close, his small hands gripping the back of her neck as his grin grew wider. Rio gently brushed the cookie crumbs from his shirt, her fingers grazing over the soft fabric.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Say cheese!” Lilia called from behind the camera, her voice laced with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cheese!” Nicky said loudly, his giggles bubbling over as Rio kissed the top of his head. Lilia caught the moment perfectly, snapping a picture of her daughter and grandson that radiated love and joy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia lowered the camera, her smile soft but full of satisfaction. “This one’s going in the album,” she said quietly, her voice filled with a quiet pride. “Alright, now the two of you,” Lilia said, gesturing to Agatha and Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped forward, slipping an arm around Rio’s waist. There was no need for words as they leaned into one another, a quiet moment of love and connection captured in the frame. Lilia smiled behind the camera, her gaze soft and proud.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Now, the whole family,” Lilia said softly, her voice filled with warmth as she captured the intimacy between the couple.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha extended her arm out, and Nicky stepped in front of them, leaning against their legs as they each draped a hand on his shoulders. The three of them stood together—a perfect family picture. Agatha’s protective presence, Rio’s radiant happiness, and Nicky’s boundless energy all harmonized in a way that felt complete.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Wait, wait, now the girls!” Lilia said, ushering Alice and Jen into the frame.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The three graduates stood together, their black gowns matching but their personalities shining through. Alice cracked a joke, and all three burst into laughter just as Lilia clicked the shutter, capturing the candid, carefree moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Finally, Agatha took the camera from Lilia, her eyes glinting mischievously. “Your turn, Lilia. Get in there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What? Oh no, no,” Lilia began, shaking her head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t argue with me,” Agatha said firmly, but the smile on her lips made it clear she was enjoying this playful exchange. She gestured toward Rio, who was already smiling warmly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio, her heart swelling with affection, reached for Lilia’s hand, gently pulling her closer. “Come on, Mom,” she said softly, her voice filled with the kind of warmth that made it impossible for Lilia to resist.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia relented, standing beside Rio as Agatha framed the shot. The two women embraced, Lilia’s pride and Rio’s gratitude evident in their expressions. Agatha captured the moment, a picture perfect image of a mother and daughter whose bond had grown unshakable.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The impromptu photo session ended with everyone grinning, their happiness tangible in each picture. Rio glanced over at Lilia and Agatha, her heart full. These weren’t just photographs—they were memories, moments of love and celebration captured forever, and Rio knew those pictures would soon find their place on the walls of Lilia’s house, among all the other memorabilia of Rio’s teenage years and achievements as a young adult.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The group settled into the lively atmosphere of the garden party, the soft hum of classical music weaving through the chatter and laughter of the crowd. Rio found herself standing with Alice and Jen near one of the refreshment tables, their black gowns billowing slightly in the evening breeze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“So, do you guys remember that time in the library when the Wi-Fi went down, and Jen almost had a meltdown trying to download her data?” Rio asked, a playful glint in her eyes as she watched Jen’s face change in anticipation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen immediately groaned, slumping her shoulders dramatically, and threw one hand over her face as if trying to shield herself from the flood of memories. “Don’t remind me,” she muttered. “I was <em>this</em> close to throwing my laptop out the window. It was a <em>disaster.</em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice, who had been listening intently, doubled over in laughter. “And then Rio, in all her tech wizardry, swooped in with her magical hotspot, saving the day like some sort of tech goddess.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio shrugged nonchalantly, though the mischievous grin tugging at her lips told a different story. “It wasn’t that dramatic,” she said, trying to play down her heroics.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, it absolutely was!” Jen insisted, leaning in with mock seriousness. “If it weren’t for you, I’d probably still be in that library right now, crying over corrupted files and a crashed system.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes sparkled with a sense of triumph, and she leaned closer to her friends, lowering her voice conspiratorially. “Okay, okay, but now I think I can finally admit something… I may or may not have <em>borrowed</em> that hotspot from the IT office when I went over there to try and convince the guy in charge to fix my laptop for free…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice’s eyes widened in disbelief as she clutched her sides, her laughter bubbling over. “No! You didn’t! I <em>can’t</em> believe it. You, Rio Vidal, the rule follower, the academic purist, <em>stole</em> something from the IT guy? Oh my god, I’m dying!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio only shrugged again, not even bothering to look guilty. “I mean, the situation was dire. And technically, I didn’t steal it. I just borrowed it. It was for the greater good, really.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t even try to look contrite as the three of them dissolved into laughter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen wiped away a tear from the corner of her eye, still chuckling. “I’ll never look at you the same way again. I mean, we all thought you were too good for rule-breaking. Turns out, we were wrong!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, a spark of rebellion in her eyes. “You know what they say, sometimes rules are meant to be bent.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on, she was literally dating her <em>professor</em> the whole time, we <em>knew</em> she was a rule-breaker,” Alice said, patting Rio’s shoulder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Nicky flitted around the group like a little bundle of energy, his small bowtie bobbing as he moved. He had somehow managed to charm nearly everyone he met, asking endless questions about the party, the music, and why people wore funny fabric on their shoulders.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom, why do you all wear these ribbons on your shoulders?” Nicky asked, tugging at Rio’s sleeve with his small hand, his gaze locked on the tassels of her doctoral hood, which swayed slightly as she moved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio bent down to his level with a soft chuckle, her heart warming at the sight of his curiosity. “Those are called doctoral hoods,” she explained, adjusting the fabric gently. “It’s a special tradition for graduates like me. They represent all the hard work and studying we’ve done.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s brow furrowed in thought, his small lips pursed as he processed the information. After a beat, his face lit up with a new question. “Do you get to keep it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio nodded. “I do. Maybe I’ll let you try it on later.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cool!” he exclaimed, spinning on his heels and darting toward Agatha, who was chatting with a few faculty members nearby. “Mama, why are there so many flowers here?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked down with soft eyes, indulging his curiosity. “Because it’s a celebration, and flowers make everything look beautiful, don’t you think?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes lit up with understanding, and he nodded vigorously. “Yeah, like the one in Mom’s hair!” He grinned, pointing up at the delicate flower tucked behind Rio’s ear, the same one Agatha had placed there that morning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled softly, her gaze drifting to Rio, who was still laughing with her friends. “Exactly like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The evening continued in a joyful blur, the air filled with lighthearted conversations, the clinking of glasses, and the occasional burst of laughter. For Rio, it felt like the perfect way to cap off such a monumental day, everything felt easy and joyful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha lingered on the edge of the celebration, her sharp blue eyes following Rio as she moved through the crowd, her dress catching the fading sunlight. From the way Rio laughed with Alice and Jen to the way she crouched to answer one of Nicky’s endless questions, every movement of hers was full of life, joy, and the confidence that had blossomed over the years and that Agatha adored. Her lips curved into a small smile, a quiet but unmistakable expression of love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Anyone paying attention would have seen it—the way Agatha’s gaze softened whenever it landed on Rio, the way her posture subtly relaxed as if her world felt right so long as Rio was near. Every so often, she caught herself staring too long, but she didn’t care. Not tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A fellow faculty member, Dr. Spencer, stood next to Agatha, his glass of wine nearly empty as he glanced over at her with a wry smile. He had always known Agatha to be composed, a woman of quiet authority, but tonight, there was something different in the way her gaze lingered on Rio. His eyes followed her line of sight before he spoke with a teasing tone, “Dr. Harkness, you look especially proud this evening.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted her attention to Dr. Spencer, a small, knowing smile curling on her lips. Her blue eyes were warm, but there was something deeper behind the surface, something that only those who knew her well might recognize. “I suppose I have every reason to be,” she replied softly, her voice carrying an almost private quality, as though the words weren’t meant for anyone else but herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dr. Spencer raised an eyebrow, sensing there was more to the statement than the usual academic pride. He followed her gaze, noting how it was solely fixed on Rio. He couldn’t help but smile knowingly, having seen Agatha and Rio together often, but tonight, there was an added layer to their dynamic. It was the unspoken bond, the unguarded tenderness that had become so apparent between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve always been a bit of a hard one to read, Dr. Harkness,” he remarked with a teasing grin, taking another sip of his wine. “But tonight, it’s like I can see the weight of everything you’ve been holding back. It’s quite clear whose achievements you’re proud of.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curved into a soft, almost imperceptible smile, a smile that was only for Rio. She glanced back at him, her posture relaxed, but her eyes still held that quiet intensity, the type that only came when she spoke of the people she truly cared for. “There’s a difference between being proud of someone’s achievements and being proud of who they are,” Agatha said, her voice low but firm, and there was a sincerity in it that made Dr. Spencer pause.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah,” he nodded, his tone shifting from playful to understanding. “I see. It’s the kind of pride that goes deeper than any academic honor, isn’t it?” His eyes flickered back to Rio, who was now lifting Nicky into her arms as the little boy squirmed with excitement, pulling at her doctoral hood. Agatha’s smile widened at the sight, and Dr. Spencer followed the moment with a thoughtful hum.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’ve found your one, haven’t you?” he added, not just as an observation but as a statement of understanding.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t respond immediately, her eyes softening as she continued to watch Rio. Nicky’s laughter echoed through the garden, and Rio’s infectious joy filled the space around them. Agatha’s heart swelled, and for a moment, the weight of everything—her achievements, her struggles, the years that had passed—seemed to settle into place, anchored by the woman she loved.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I have,” Agatha said finally, her voice quieter now, almost a whisper. “And I’m proud of her, more than I ever thought I would be.” Her eyes shone, and though she remained poised as ever, there was a vulnerability in the words that Dr. Spencer caught.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She’s everything,” Agatha added in a soft murmur, just loud enough for Dr. Spencer to hear.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The colleague took another sip of his drink, leaning back slightly, as if sensing the conversation had reached a quiet, unspoken end. “I don’t think anyone would question that,” he said, his tone thoughtful and more respectful than it had been before. He nodded toward Rio, who was now sharing a laugh with Jen, her energy bright and palpable. “Looks like you’ve got a good one there, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha smiled at him, her expression both content and proud. “I know,” she said simply, the quiet certainty in her voice speaking volumes. She turned her attention back to Rio, feeling the warmth of the evening settle in her chest. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Every reason to be proud indeed,” she murmured softly to herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the evening continued, Agatha moved through the crowd, greeting colleagues and students, her professional demeanor firmly in place. But she always kept Rio within her line of sight, her presence grounding her in a way that nothing else could.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When their eyes met across the garden, Rio gave her a radiant smile, one that sent warmth rushing through Agatha’s chest. She returned it with a subtle nod, her fingers twitching with the urge to reach out and hold Rio’s hand, to close the space between them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tonight, though, there was no need to hide. Agatha allowed her affection to show in the way her gaze lingered, in the small but genuine smiles she reserved just for Rio. Anyone watching would know that this wasn’t just a moment of professional pride for Dr. Harkness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This was personal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At some point, amidst the laughter and chatter, Agatha quietly slipped away. Her departure had been so seamless that even Rio, who was typically attuned to her partner’s every movement, didn’t notice right away. She was deep in conversation with Alice and Jen, the three of them reminiscing about late nights in the library and the endless cups of coffee that had fueled their final dissertations.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“…and remember when that one guy fell asleep so loudly, we had to move tables?” Alice asked, her voice bubbling with laughter. Jen leaned in, nodding in agreement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I swear it was like a foghorn!” she added, her tone filled with mock exasperation, though the laughter that followed made it clear she had no real complaints.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled, shaking her head at the memory. “I can’t believe we survived those nights. The amount of caffeine we consumed should be illegal.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, shaking her head at the memory, but something tugged at the edge of her awareness—a sudden sense of absence. Her gaze darted around the garden, searching for the familiar figure of her lover. But the sleek black dress Agatha had been wearing, the one she looked so stunning in, was nowhere among the clusters of people.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Frowning slightly, she excused herself from the conversation. “I’ll be right back,” she said, her tone casual, though curiosity and a touch of concern were already building.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen exchanged a knowing glance but didn’t comment, letting Rio slip away to search.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She wandered through the garden, her eyes scanning the crowd. Agatha wasn’t near the refreshment tables or chatting with colleagues. Rio’s steps quickened slightly, though she told herself there was no reason to worry. Agatha had probably stepped away for a moment of quiet—it wasn’t unusual for her to do so in large gatherings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Still, Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that something was different. Her search became more focused, her dress swaying around her legs as she weaved through the clusters of people, her mind turning over possibilities.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Where had she gone? And why hadn’t she said anything?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio scanned the garden, trying to locate Agatha, a small voice broke through the haze of her thoughts. She turned just in time to see Nicky appear at her side, his tiny hands tugging insistently at the fabric of her gown. His face was illuminated by a grin so wide it seemed to stretch across his entire face, and his excitement was practically radiating off him like a burst of energy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom! Come with me!” he said, his voice bubbling with enthusiasm, an infectious cheer that Rio couldn’t help but feel. “It’s a surprise!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio tilted her head, bemused by the intensity of his energy. “A surprise?” she asked, her voice soft with amusement as she crouched down slightly to meet his gaze. “What kind of surprise, little love? I need to find your Mama.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky shook his head vigorously, his small hands now tugging harder at her gown as if to pull her toward whatever awaited. “Nope! Not telling! You just have to come! And I know where Mama is !”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before she could respond, Lilia stepped in from nearby, her expression soft but knowing. She gently placed a hand on Rio’s shoulder, her other hand reaching for the edges of Rio’s black graduation gown.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let me take this for you, sweetheart,” Lilia said, her tone calm but somehow filled with meaning. She slid the gown off Rio’s shoulders, revealing the entirety of the soft green fabric of her dress, which swayed lightly in the gentle evening breeze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lilia, what’s going on?” Rio asked, her brow furrowing slightly, sensing something more was afoot than just the excitement of the evening. She handed over the gown, her fingers lingering for a moment as Lilia took it from her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia just smiled, her eyes twinkling with something Rio couldn’t quite place. “You’ll see,” she said, folding the gown over her arm. “Go on, darling. Nicky’s waiting.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced from Lilia to Nicky, who was practically vibrating with excitement, his tiny fingers already grabbing for Rio’s hand with determination. Still feeling a small twinge of uncertainty but trusting whatever was unfolding, Rio let herself be guided. Nicky was nothing if not persistent.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Come on, Mom!” Nicky urged, his small fingers gripping hers tightly as he guided her through the garden, weaving between groups of graduates and their families. “It’s so cool! You’re gonna love it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio glanced back over her shoulder one last time, catching Lilia’s warm and encouraging smile as she watched them go. There was something unspoken in her expression, something that made Rio feel both reassured and more curious than ever. Whatever this was, it felt important. There was a sense of quiet intention behind it, and Rio found herself eager to uncover it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky led Rio through a winding path that grew quieter with each step, the lively hum of the garden party fading into the background.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Where are we going, Nicky?” Rio asked, her tone gentle but teasing, as they walked through the garden, the sounds of laughter and conversation fading into the background.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky only gave her a mysterious, sideways glance, his grin growing wider as he pulled her along. “You’ll see, Mom. You’ll see!” he said, practically bursting with excitement as he led her down a quiet path at the far end of the garden, the soft rustle of leaves overhead and the scent of flowers filling the air.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They emerged into a secluded section of the garden, a hidden oasis where the air felt still and sacred, carrying the faint, intoxicating fragrance of blooming flowers. The vibrant colors of the blossoms seemed to pulse with life—roses in rich shades of red and pink, lilacs in soft purples, and tulips in bright splashes of yellow and orange, their petals swaying gently in the breeze. Every corner was a painter’s palette, vivid and alive. In the center of it all stood a small fountain, its water softly bubbling, adding a peaceful, rhythmic melody to the serene atmosphere</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio gasped, her steps faltering as she took in the breathtaking scene before her. The garden seemed like something plucked from a dream, a place where time slowed and the world outside faded away. The setting sunlight filtered through the canopy of trees, casting dappled patterns of light and shadow across the ground, and the soft rustle of leaves created a symphony of whispers. Everything about this moment felt perfect—almost too perfect, like something that could only exist in the quiet space between reality and fantasy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This… this is beautiful,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with awe, the words slipping from her lips in a hushed reverence. Her heart stuttered slightly in her chest as she gazed around, her mind still processing the beauty of it all. She could hardly believe this was real, this tranquil moment tucked away from the busy celebration that had been going on moments ago.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And then her gaze landed on Agatha, and everything stopped.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There, standing in the center of the garden, was the love of her life, holding a bouquet of purple and white flowers wrapped in greenery. The deep purples of the blooms contrasted against her elegant dark dress, and the whites seemed to glow in the soft light, their petals almost ethereal, like something touched by magic.  </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For a moment, Rio was frozen, her breath catching in her throat. Agatha’s face softened when she noticed her, her smile blooming into something gentle yet full of profound emotion. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Agatha…” Rio whispered, her heart racing as the realization began to dawn on her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky tugged on her hand again, breaking her trance. “I told you it was a surprise, Mom!” he exclaimed, bouncing on his heels, clearly proud of his involvement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped forward, bending down slightly to ruffle Nicky’s hair. “Thank you for helping, my little man,” she said softly, her tone filled with affection.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky beamed, puffing out his chest proudly. “Did I do good, Mama?” he asked, looking up at Agatha with wide eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile deepened, a mixture of fondness and love in her expression as she leaned in, pressing a light, affectionate kiss to Nicky’s forehead. “You did perfect,” she replied, her voice thick with affection, her tone tender and assuring. “I couldn’t have done it without you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand lingered on Nicky’s shoulder for a moment longer before she gently guided him toward the path that led back to the main gathering. “Now, why don’t you go back to Grandma Lilia?” Agatha suggested softly. “I think she’s waiting for you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s eyes brightened at the mention of Lilia, and without hesitation, he turned to Rio, wrapping his arms around her for a quick, tight hug. “Okay! Have fun, Moms!” he called out as he pulled away, giggling as he ran off down the path, his little feet quick and light on the soft earth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The garden grew quiet again and Agatha turned back to Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a step closer, the bouquet still in her hands. Her eyes never left Rio’s, and in that moment, Rio felt the weight of what was coming settle over her—a mix of anticipation, love, and overwhelming emotion.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now alone in the quiet, magical garden, Agatha stepped closer to Rio, her movements slow and deliberate. Her hand reached out, fingers brushing against Rio’s before she took it fully, lacing their fingers together. Agatha’s touch was warm, grounding, and as Rio met her gaze, she felt a lump form in her throat. Agatha’s eyes were steady, deep blue pools of emotion that seemed to hold the weight of every unspoken word they’d shared over their time together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Rio, my love,” Agatha began, her voice low and steady, but tinged with vulnerability. She glanced at their intertwined hands before looking back at Rio’s face. “I’ve been thinking all day about how to say this, how to put into words everything I’m feeling right now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched slightly, her lips parting as she watched Agatha, every word sinking into her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“When I first met you,” Agatha continued, her voice softening, “I thought I knew what my life was—what it would always be. Controlled, predictable, comfortable.” She smiled faintly, her thumb brushing against Rio’s hand. “And then you came into my world like a tornado I never saw coming. You challenged me, frustrated me, and made me laugh more than I had in years. You brought light into corners of my life I didn’t even realize were dark.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her free hand coming up to cover her mouth as her emotions bubbled to the surface.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve watched you grow, not just as a scholar, but as a mother, a friend, and a partner,” Agatha said, her voice trembling slightly as her emotions crept in. “You are strong, compassionate, and brilliant. And standing here today, I feel like the luckiest person in the world, because I get to love you and be loved by you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha paused, her own eyes glistening now as she steadied herself. “You’ve made me believe in things I thought I’d lost faith in. You’ve reminded me what it means to hope, to dream, and to build a life with someone.” She took a deep breath, her hand tightening slightly around Rio’s. “And I want to spend the rest of my life building that with you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s voice softened further as she continued, her words deliberate and heartfelt, like she was laying bare every corner of her soul. “Rio, my darling, sweet, caring, fierce, Rio,” she said, her thumb brushing gently over Rio’s knuckles, “you’ve taught me so much—not just about love, but about what it means to live fully. You’ve shown me that life doesn’t have to be predictable to be beautiful. It can be messy, chaotic, and volatile, and still be the most extraordinary thing I’ve ever experienced. <em>You</em> are the most extraordinary thing I’ve ever experienced.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio let out a shaky breath, her fingers tightening around Agatha’s as her chest swelled with emotion. Agatha smiled softly, her own tears threatening to spill over, but she pushed on, her voice steady even as it trembled with feeling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve always been someone who thought strength was about control,” Agatha admitted, her eyes holding Rio’s. “But then you came in and taught me that real strength is letting go—letting someone in. You taught me that strength is in being vulnerable, in trusting someone so completely that you’re not afraid to fall because you know they’ll be there to catch you. You caught me, Rio. And I never want to let you go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s free hand trembled slightly as she reached out to touch Agatha’s cheek, her fingers grazing the soft skin there. Agatha leaned into the touch, her voice growing even softer, almost like a secret meant only for Rio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve watched you love so fiercely—whether it’s your family, your friends, or your little dance students. You put your heart into everything you do, and you make the world a brighter, better place just by being in it. And somehow, you’ve given me the greatest gift by letting me stand by your side. You’ve let me see you at your strongest, your weakest, and everything in between, and I love every part of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio was openly crying now, tears slipping silently down her cheeks as she looked at the woman in front of her, the woman she loved with everything she had. Agatha smiled gently, brushing a tear from Rio’s cheek with her thumb.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t just want to build a life with you, Rio,” Agatha said, her voice gaining strength as she poured her heart into her next words. “I want to build <em>our</em> life—a life where we never stop challenging each other, where we never stop laughing, and where we wake up every day knowing we chose each other, over and over again.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s tears spilled over, her chest rising and falling with emotion. “Agatha…” she whispered, her voice shaky as her love for the woman standing before her threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha gave her a small, almost bashful smile, her thumb brushing over the back of Rio’s hand one last time before she stepped back slightly. “There’s more,” she said, her tone soft but steady, as she reached into a hidden pocket of her dress and pulled something out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted gracefully to one knee, her dark hair catching the soft glow of the garden lights as she revealed a small velvet box from her closed hand. The moment felt suspended in time, the gentle bubbling of the fountain the only sound accompanying the scene.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She opened the box with steady hands, revealing the most beautiful ring Rio had ever seen—a pear-shaped amethyst set in a delicate gold band, flanked by emerald clusters arranged like leaves. The design was elegant yet earthy, perfectly encapsulating both of their personalities.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha looked up at Rio, her expression a mixture of vulnerability and quiet determination. Her voice, though steady, was thick with emotion as she spoke. “Rio Vidal, will you marry me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The question hung in the air, suspended in the stillness of the garden, its weight heavier than any ring could ever be. It was a question that carried not just love but an entire future—one they were both ready to step into, side by side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart stopped for a beat, her breath catching in her throat. Tears welled in her eyes, blurring the vision before her as she stared at the ring, then back at Agatha. The sight of her, kneeling with such raw tenderness, the love and trust in her eyes—it was everything Rio had ever wanted and more. Her chest felt like it might burst from the sheer force of her emotions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without thinking, she pressed a hand to her mouth, stifling a sob, and when she finally spoke, her voice trembled with joy and disbelief. “Yes,” she whispered, the word feeling like a promise to both Agatha and herself, “a thousand times yes.” Then, unable to resist the playful spark that always seemed to exist between them, she added with a teasing grin, “Took you long enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a soft, relieved laugh, her eyes glistening with tears of her own, and in that moment, Rio could see the weight of everything lifting, replaced by pure, unrestrained joy. With gentle hands, Agatha slid the ring onto Rio’s finger, its delicate design glinting in the soft light, a perfect match to the emotion that swirled between them. The world seemed to pause, to hold its breath, as they shared this moment—this promise—together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Standing, Agatha reached for Rio’s face, pulling her close as their lips met in a kiss that spoke volumes—a kiss filled with love, joy, and the unspoken vow of forever. Rio’s hands came to rest on Agatha’s wrists as the kiss deepened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, overcome with the exhilaration of the moment, wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist and, in one fluid motion, lifted her off the ground. She spun her around, the sheer joy of the action making Rio’s heart race, and the world seemed to tilt and spin with them. Rio laughed, her green dress flaring out like a soft wave in the wind, caught up in the motion. She clung to Agatha’s neck, her arms tightening instinctively as she reveled in the dizzying rush of happiness, her laughter mixing with Agatha’s in a harmony that felt almost magical.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Agatha finally set Rio down, the ground beneath her seemed to momentarily shift, as if the euphoria had left her a bit unsteady. But Rio held on tight, her arms wrapping around Agatha as she pressed her forehead against hers, her chest still rising and falling with their shared breaths.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When they finally pulled back, both of them breathing heavily, their hearts racing. Agatha let out a soft, watery laugh, her thumb tracing Rio’s cheek. “You’ve just made me the happiest woman in the world,” she murmured.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio laughed through, the sound sweet and joyful, her arms still wrapped tightly around Agatha’s neck. “Funny,” she whispered, her voice trembling with joy, “I was just about to say the same thing.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands lingered gently on Rio’s waist, her thumb brushing against the soft fabric of her dress. They stood there for a moment, the world outside their bubble still and quiet, the soft sounds of the garden’s fountain filling the space as they caught their breath.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio smiled, her eyes sparkling with a mix of affection and wonder, and she whispered, her voice thick with emotion, “You really know how to make a day unforgettable, Dr. Harkness.” Her words were soft, but they carried a weight of sincerity, as if every moment of their time together had led to this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled, the sound warm and rich, and she pressed her lips briefly to Rio’s temple, her hands still resting on her waist, anchoring them both in the present. “For you, Dr. Vidal,” she replied with a playful glint in her eye, “I’ll spend every day trying.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her words were simple, but there was a depth to them, a promise that no matter where life took them, Agatha would always strive to make moments like this an everyday reality.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After a few moments alone, savoring the joy of their engagement, Rio and Agatha made their way back to the main party, their hands intertwined. It was as if the energy from the proposal lingered between them, a delicate thread of connection that neither of them wanted to break. Rio still held the bouquet Agatha had given her earlier, the purple and white blooms nestled in her arm like a precious keepsake. The flowers, now a symbol of the promise they had just made, seemed to glow in the soft light, the petals dancing with the same joy that filled Rio’s heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her pulse still raced with the excitement of the proposal, and every step felt lighter than the last. She couldn’t help but steal glances at Agatha, whose face was glowing with a mix of pride, love, and a quiet, contented joy that made Rio’s chest tighten with adoration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they neared the main gathering, the sounds of celebration grew louder, the music and laughter drifting through the air like a warm embrace. But Rio felt as though she was walking in a world of her own—one that was quieter, more intimate. Everything seemed brighter, more vivid, as if their engagement had turned up the color of the world around them. She couldn’t stop smiling, the happiness blooming inside her like the flowers in her arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She glanced over at Agatha, her gaze softening. “This… this feels like a dream,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper but filled with the depth of her feelings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smile widened, her eyes crinkling with joy. She squeezed Rio’s hand, her thumb brushing over the back of it in a comforting, loving gesture. “It’s real,” she said, her voice steady and filled with certainty. “And it’s just the beginning.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart swelled at the words, the truth of them settling deep within her. Everything had changed, and yet, nothing had. They were still the same two people who had loved each other through everything—the challenges, the quiet moments, the chaos—but now, they were stepping into a new chapter, hand in hand, ready for whatever came next.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they reentered the party, their arrival didn’t go unnoticed. Guests paused mid-conversation, their gazes shifting toward the couple, noticing the way Rio’s eyes sparkled with happiness, the way Agatha’s beaming smile could light up the entire garden. Their engagement was as evident as the glow that surrounded them. But in that moment, it didn’t matter. They didn’t need the validation of others. They had each other, and that was enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio lifted the bouquet slightly, her fingers brushing the delicate petals. “Thank you,” she said softly, her voice filled with emotion. “For everything.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze softened as she looked at her now fiancée, her heart full of a love that words couldn’t quite capture. “You deserve everything, my love,” she whispered back, her voice thick with affection. “And I will spend my life giving it to you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As Rio and Agatha approached their family, the air around them seemed to crackle with anticipation, a shared excitement palpable in every step. Lilia, Nicky, Alice, and Jen were all waiting, their expressions a mix of knowing smiles and gleaming eyes. It was clear that the surprise had been carefully orchestrated by all of them, and as Rio glanced toward Nicky, she could see the barely contained energy radiating off him. He bounced on his heels, his excitement so evident it was almost contagious, his wide eyes locked on them as he shouted, “Did she say yes?!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s face lit up even more, a smile so bright it seemed to light up the entire garden around them. She only raised her left hand, showing off the sparkling engagement ring now adorning her finger. The room seemed to pause for a second, the weight of the moment hitting everyone all at once.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment Rio held up her hand, their family erupted into cheers. Lilia’s eyes welled with happy tears as she stepped forward, wrapping both Rio and Agatha in a tight, emotional hug. “I’m so happy for you both,” she whispered, her voice choked with joy. Her hands cupped Rio’s face then Agatha’s for a brief moment, her gaze soft but steady. “You deserve all the happiness in the world.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen were not far behind, their faces alight with joy. They didn’t waste a second before jumping into the celebration. Alice’s arms shot out to wrap around Rio, pulling her into a hug so tight it nearly lifted her off the ground. Rio let out a surprised laugh, her heart swelling with affection for the woman who had been her closest friend through it all. Alice’s voice was full of excitement as she pulled back just enough to look at Rio’s face. “I knew it! I knew you two were meant to be together,” she exclaimed, her grin infectious. “We’ve got to start planning this wedding right away! I’m thinking something big and beautiful, like you deserve. We’ll make it magical, Rio!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jen, with her usual cool demeanor, had a soft but wide smile on her face as she wrapped her arms around Agatha, pulling her into a bear hug that showed her genuine joy. “You two are perfect for each other,” Jen said, her voice full of warmth and sincerity. “I can already see it all—the flowers, the music, the atmosphere. It’s going to be stunning. I can’t wait to help make this day one for the books.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio felt the embrace of her chosen family surrounding her, and it was overwhelming in the best way possible. Lilia’s proud, tear-filled expression, Alice’s infectious enthusiasm, and Jen’s practical yet heartfelt excitement were all reflections of the support and love that had defined their journey. Rio’s chest tightened with the knowledge that she wasn’t walking into this new chapter alone—she had an entire family who would be there every step of the way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, who had been practically bouncing in circles around them, clapped his hands together, his little face beaming with pride. “You did it, Mama!” he exclaimed, looking up at both Rio and Agatha. “And Mom, you said yes!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart fluttered at the sight of his excitement. She nodded, her voice thick with emotion as she gazed at Agatha, unable to tear her eyes away from the woman who had just become her fiancée. “Yes, sweet boy,” she whispered, her words barely escaping as her eyes softened with love. “I said yes.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky’s joy was infectious, and he jumped up and down with barely contained energy, his little hands flapping in the air. “You’re getting married! Best moms ever!” he cheered, clearly bursting with pride at being part of such an important moment.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but laugh, bending down to hug Nicky tight. “I’m glad you’re happy, little love,” she said, planting a kiss on his forehead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air was filled with laughter, love, and joy as the group surrounded Rio and Agatha, offering their heartfelt congratulations. The weight of the moment settled in fully—this wasn’t just a celebration of an engagement, but a celebration of a family, of their journey together, and of everything they had ahead of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For Rio, standing there with Agatha, surrounded by the people they loved, she felt more complete than ever. The future, once uncertain and full of obstacles, now felt wide open, ready to be filled with all the love and happiness they had earned fair and square.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as the applause and cheers continued, Rio knew one thing for sure: the next chapter of their lives was going to be beautiful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia’s eyes glistened with tears as she took a step closer to Agatha, placing a hand gently on her arm. “I just want to say,” she began, her voice soft but filled with emotion, “how grateful I am that you’re making my daughter so happy.” Her gaze shifted to Rio, who was still beaming, twirling Nicky around to the sound of the quartets. “I’ve seen how she’s changed, how much she’s grown, and it’s all because of you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha, who had been soaking in the joy of the moment, met Lilia’s eyes. She could see the love and sincerity in Lilia’s gaze, and it touched her deeply. She’d always known that Lilia cared for Rio and for her so deeply, but hearing this now—so openly and full of warmth—moved her more than words could express.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia continued, her voice trembling slightly. “I love you both like daughters, you know. You’ve both brought so much light into my life, and watching your relationship grow, watching it blossom into something so pure and beautiful… it’s an honor. An absolute honor to be a part of this.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha felt her heart swell, and she pulled Lilia into a heartfelt embrace. “Thank you,” she whispered, the weight of Lilia’s words filling her with gratitude. “I love her more than anything. I promise you, I’ll spend every day making sure she’s happy.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, hugging her tightly. “I know you will, Agatha. I know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As they pulled away from the embrace, Rio was magically there, standing beside them with a smile that could light up the world. She took Lilia’s hand in hers, squeezing it gently. “Thank you, Mom,” Rio said, her voice full of warmth. “We’re so lucky to have you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia smiled back, wiping away a tear before it could fall. “And I’m lucky to have both of you,” she replied softly, pulling Rio into a tight hug once again. “You’re my sweet sweet girl.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment felt timeless, full of love and the kind of deep connection that could only come from years of shared history. It was a moment Rio would carry with her forever—knowing she was surrounded by people who truly understood the depth of her relationship with Agatha, and who cherished the happiness they had found together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The garden party carried on around them, the warm glow of the now set sun casting a soft light over the festivities. Laughter and music filled the air, the atmosphere light and joyful as the group celebrated together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nicky, still full of excitement, bounced around, asking questions and delighting in the love and attention from everyone. Alice and Jen chatted animatedly, already tossing out ideas for the wedding, while Lilia, with a proud smile on her face, stood by Rio and Agatha, her eyes never leaving them and their happiness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio’s hand never left Agatha’s, the new engagement ring glinting under the lights. She leaned in close, resting her head on Agatha’s shoulder as they shared a quiet moment amidst the celebration. It was a moment of contentment, of feeling like they were exactly where they were meant to be. Their love was out in the open now, no longer hidden, and it felt like the world was finally catching up with them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They all gathered around the tables, sharing a meal, exchanging stories, and savoring every moment of the evening. Lilia raised her glass in a toast. “To family, to love, and to new beginnings,” she said, her voice full of emotion. “May we continue to grow together.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Cheers!” they all chorused, clinking glasses.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As the stars began to twinkle above, and the last notes of the soft music floated through the air, Rio glanced around at the people she loved. Her heart swelled with happiness.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This was her family.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This was her life.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And as she squeezed Agatha’s hand once more, she knew that this was just the beginning of the most beautiful journey ahead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Here they stood, hand in hand, their whole life in front of them, <em>at the still point of the turning world</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
