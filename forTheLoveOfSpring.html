<p>
<em>“If I deliver Billy, you let me go.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You will eventually die, Agatha.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“But I want you to stop pursuing me. I want you to stop making my life hell. And when I die, a long, long, long, long, long time from now…” Agatha’s face is resolute, her patience worn down by the centuries. “I don’t want to see your face.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio’s steadfast demeanour wilts away. Hurt settles in the cracks of her frown, tugs at the corners of her mouth. “Okay.”</em>
</p><p>--</p><p>The walls beside Agatha crack open, spewing bits of debris everywhere. Frantic hands push against the wooden panels above her head. She is screaming. The words leave her mouth before her brain can make meaning of them. She has to get out, break open the doors before she is buried by this collapsing universe. With all her might she pushes against the door, begging whomever can hear her to let her out. To let her survive. Then suddenly, the doors swing open.</p><p>Agatha clambers out. Expects fireworks, explosives, the euphoric feeling of all her power returning to her. Instead, she is bathed in the bright yellow light of the sun. Shadows are cast upon the grass of Agatha’s backyard. Nearby, a pigeon coos, indicating today is nothing but an ordinary summer morning.</p><p>Agatha channels her own magic, wills every last drop to spark out of her fingers, and feels nothing akin to the familiar rush of Purple. She scoffs. She walked down the Witches’ Road, survived every trail and got not one drop of the glory she desired and deserved. Agatha screams. Stomps on the ground. Her foot hits something small and hard and shoots out from under her. Agatha flails her hands up as she falls backwards.</p><p>Disgruntled, she sits up. A ball of brown lies where she stomped. The bulbous shape covered in thin layers of light brown, paper thin leaves. She picks it up, wanting to throw it so far away it burns in the sun’s atmosphere but is halted by an unfamiliar tickle at the back of her neck.</p><p>A tickle of magic.</p><p>Agatha frowns, gets up, and wills the magic to form in her hand. Whisps of orange flow from her skin. Alice’s magic. It begs to be used, wagging like an eager dog. Peculiar. Staring at the naked skin of her hand Agatha wanders to her front yard. Half remembering her front door was blast wide open. Anything is better than returning to her house through the treacherous basement doors.</p><p>“Everything alright, Agnes?”</p><p>Norm, dressed in sports clothing, is standing on the pavement in front of her house. Concerned, he nods towards the hole that was once Agatha’s front door.</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha calls back. “Some hooligan came waltzing in but I took care of it.”</p><p>“Right.” Norm does not sound convinced. “Have you already called someone to fix it? You can’t keep your door open like this.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. Makes a waving motion with her hand, waving away the importance of safety and realises she is still holding the onion in her hand. With the elegance of a javelin thrower, she flings the thing as far as she can down the street. She watches it hit the asphalt with a satisfying thud.</p><p>“What?” She says when she sees Norm’s confused expression. “It’s an onion. A stinky one at that.”</p><p>With sure steps, she walks towards the hole that was once her front door. She pushes aside one of her couches – admittedly a fine front door for now – and slips through the hole. Inside, the splinters of wood are a wretched reminder of the earlier incidence. She should grab a broom, brush away the dust and the splinters and every bit of the havoc caused by Rio, who has a nasty habit of leaving things in ruins.</p><p>Agatha sits down on her couch. At least the living room was spared in the fight. She channels Alice’s magic again. It feels fresh, unbalanced. A child still learning how to ride a bike. It knows tricks, how to perform specific spells, Agatha feels. Protection spells. Defensive blasts. Shielding and the sort. Exactly the spells Agatha does not know by heart for why would an all-mighty witch perform simple protection spells? Not her. Though now, almost as vulnerable as the day she was born, protection magic might be the best to have if she cannot have more.</p><p>The Salem Seven were taken down by Lilia in her stupid but noble act of self sacrifice. However, there is no telling who will avenge Agatha next for some forgotten crime she committed eons ago.</p><p>To test what exactly she is working with, Agatha speaks a transmutation spell, wills the remote to change in a vase. The magic in her hand gushes out like pitch. It laps at the remote, tries to change its shape to something resembling a vase only to give up halfway. A saucer, half ceramic half plastic, with an odd few buttons, now lies on the table. Agatha sighs, stores the magic away and decides she didn’t want to watch TV anyway.</p><p>“Oh, hi there. Still alive, buddy?” A voice calls from behind.</p><p>Agatha turns around, looks for the source of the sound and sees nothing but the hole leading outside. The sound of footsteps moves deeper into her house. Agatha gets up, grabs a candlestick from the sideboard and follows the footsteps.</p><p>She sees the leg of a figure disappear to the corridor leading to her basement. Slowly, she lifts the candlestick, ready to hit the figure over the head. She sneaks closer, stepping over the debris on the floor with precision. She catches another glimpse of the figure in the laundry room and lowers the candlestick. With her sternest voice she calls out: “Teen?”</p><p>Billy screams as he turns around. One hand lifting instinctively to protect his face, almost dropping Señor Scratchy in the process. Agatha drops the candlestick and immediately takes Scratchy from him.</p><p>“Why are you trying to kidnap my rabbit?”</p><p>Billy looks at her, still scared but less so now that he realises Agatha won’t kill him. His mouth opens and closes a few times before he speaks a proper sentence. “I- I wasn’t. He was sniffing around. Last time I saw him the Salem Seven tried to kill me… You?” Billy thinks about it for a second. “Us? They were after you but I am pretty sure they would kill anyone in your proximity. I mean, did you see how they burst through your window? One almost grabbed me and dragged me to hell. Do witches have a hell or is it a different place? Maybe Rio-”</p><p>“Oh, how I peaceful my life was the last five minutes without your blabbering mouth.”</p><p>Agatha regards Billy, decides he is neither a threat nor an ally, and returns to the living room. She continues musing her future plans, with Scratchy as moral support in her lap. Without the protection of the Darkhold, every witch is able to sense her. And with a bit of practice, any witch is able to follow her scent like a sailor follows a compass.</p><p>Behind her, Agatha hears the sound of, what she assumes to be, Billy cleaning up the mess in her hallway and kitchen, murmuring his frustrations as he does so. She doesn’t think much of it until she hears a loud thump of a heavy object falling over. She whips around.</p><p>“Billy, what the hell are you doing?”</p><p>He looks up at her, half bent over the couch that was once her front door. “Cleaning up?”</p><p>“Cleaning up?” Agatha mocks in a weird voice. “You’re making even more of a mess.”</p><p>“I thought this was the perfect time to try out a spell from my book and-”</p><p>Agatha waves his rambles away and turns back around. Her eyes fall on something. It is small. Lies perfectly in the middle of the ruined remote/saucer. The hairs in Agatha’s neck rise as she stares at the brown, organic ball.</p><p>“What the…”</p><p>Agatha puts Scratchy on the floor and moves to pick the bulb up. Again, she feels a tickle of magic. It feels familiar, like the way a fresh gust of air on a summer morning reminds one of childhood, the smell too vague to conjure up a specific memory. She moves it over in her hand. It does look like an onion, but the form is ever so slightly cone-shaped. And the top is… <em>off</em>. As though a horn is attempting to grow from it, not quite bursting through the outer layer. She is about to call over Billy when a loud crack rumbles through the house. Agatha nearly drops the bulb as she rushes over.</p><p>“Uhm… Oops?” Billy looks apologetic. Makes his tall and lanky stature as small as possible as he presses himself into the wall. On the floor lies Agatha’s old front door. Perfectly pristine except for it being <em>on the floor</em>. “I swear it was upright before.” Billy explains. “I just have to figure out how to summon it into the doorframe.” He says the last bit like a question, underlining his insecurity of now knowing how.</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “At least the debris is gone.”</p><p>“Yes! I had a perfect spell for that. It’s called-”</p><p>“I don’t care.” Agatha interrupts him. “I have something for you. Here, touch it.” She reaches out her hand and shows the strange bulb.</p><p>Billy takes it. “What is it?” Then his face turns white. His whole body stiffens. He drops the bulb to the floor. “That feels horrible.”</p><p>Agatha frowns at him. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“The bulb.” Billy points out. “It’s like a shock of static went through me the second I touched it. But this terrible feeling came with it. As if the Salem Seven were chasing me again.”</p><p>Agatha frowns more, bows to retrieve the bulb and attempts to feel what Billy feels. She doesn’t. She does feel the familiar tickle of magic. A waft of something sultry or honeyed. A reminder of incoming spring. She hands over the bulb to Billy. “Try again.”</p><p>Eyes skittish like a deer, Billy takes it. His gaze twists from concerned to frightened, skin paling by the second. Every fibre in his body wants to move away from the thing.</p><p>“You can drop it.” Agatha decides she has tortured the kid enough. With a thunk the bulb hits the ground.</p><p>“What is it?” Billy asks. His eyes flitting from the bulb to Agatha and back. Wary but inquisitive.</p><p>“I don’t know. Found it in my backyard when I broke free from the Road.” After a moment of silence she adds: “I think it’s magical. Maybe some remnant of the Road.”</p><p>“Glory shall be thine.” Billy speaks the words with the sophistication of an old wizard. Agatha nearly rolls her eyes at the theatricality of it all. “Perhaps this is your glory after completing the road?”</p><p>“A static onion?”</p><p>Billy looks at her, attempts to stifle his laugh and fails. He moves to pick the thing up again. Inspects it with a keen eye, even holding it up to the light as if he held a gemstone. “I don’t like touching it.” Is all he says after his thorough investigating. He hands it back over to Agatha and drops it to the ground when Agatha makes no attempt to take it from him.</p><p>---</p><p>“Your third attempt was the funniest.” Agatha stirs her smoothie with her straw. She had never used her mixer and Billy craved a smoothie. Brown eyes ever being a weakness of hers, Agatha blended up what fruits she could find to satisfy his cravings. “There always is something comical about doors opening to a brick wall.”</p><p>Billy looks at her, a mixture of embarrassment and delight on his face. He had spent the entire afternoon practicing and fixing Agatha’s house. His first attempts a complete failure, he eventually learned to control his power and managed to fix both the front door and the broken window. In the basement, he put up a memorial to the fallen witches Lilia Calderu and Alice Wu-Gulliver, and Sharon Davis. Agatha had asked, annoyed, if it was necessary, but Billy retorted he would turn her whole house upside down if she didn’t let him. He got it perfect first try.</p><p>“Charlie Chaplinesque.”</p><p>Agatha slaps her hand on the kitchen island. “Exactly!”</p><p>Billy giggles, then pulls his face in a serious expression. “Agatha, I think I should go home.”</p><p>Agatha stops in the middle of taking a sip from her smoothie. The lightness she felt pops like a bubble. She wouldn’t tell him, but she had grown fond of his presence and the prospect of being alone again, despite being her usual lifestyle, is something she faces with antipathy.</p><p>“Right.” Agatha forces herself to acknowledge the statement. “Let me see you out, then.” She moves to guide Billy to the newly summoned front door when she kicks something with her feet. It shoots away and hits a cabinet at an angle before rolling right back to Agatha’s feet. It is the bulb.</p><p>“Did you leave this in the kitchen?” Agatha turns to billy, bulb in hand.</p><p>“No. I left it in the hallway were we last spoke about it.”</p><p>Agatha hums. She can throw it out – again – when she says goodbye to Billy, but when they are on her front porch she is stopped.</p><p>“I think you should keep it.” Billy says. “It clearly wants to be with you.”</p><p>“How can an onion ‘want to be with me’?”</p><p>“You don’t get shocked and scared to death.” Billy states as if that explains is argument entirely. When Agatha looks at him disapprovingly, he continues. “If it’s your ‘glory’ at the end of the Road, then it would make sense it belongs to you, doesn’t it? You don’t seem to get shocked or terrified when you touch it.”</p><p>“I don’t.” Agatha deadpans.</p><p>“Exactly! What do you feel?”</p><p>Agatha weighs the bulb in her hand. It isn’t heavy, similar to the weight of a chestnut, she thinks. The skin of the bulb feels flimsy, like the skin of an onion. A meagre protection of the core inside of it. Despite the drip of magic it seems to exude it feels entirely organic.</p><p>When it comes to subjective feeling, however, Agatha finds it hard to describe. Every touch comes with déjà vu. A dream she just woke up from and already forgot, the bits and pieces she so drastically wants to remember falling from her fingers like water. It is certainly not unpleasant or terrifying in the way Billy describes his experience. Agatha finds herself longing to remember what the bulb reminds her of.</p><p>“A lost…” Dream? Memory? Wish? Agatha isn’t quite sure. She is even less sure if she wants to tell Billy what the bulb does it with her. Thinking about it makes her feel dizzy, but she doesn’t mind it entirely. It is pleasant in the way light-headedness sometimes is pleasant: a reminder you are alive in your body. “A lost dream.”</p><p>Agatha settles on dream. The word seems at once fantastical and not too personal. Memory should have been more appropriate but she isn’t ready to lay down on a chaise and have Billy psychoanalyse her thoughts.</p><p>“Keep it.”</p><p>Agatha nods, unsure what else to say.</p><p>After Billy left, she put it back on the kitchen counter. Out of reach from Scratchy, who is always looking for something he can snack on. In the morning, she finds the bulb on her nightstand.</p><p>---</p><p>The bulb is more like a hamster, Agatha decides. At first, it acted like a nasty pest. A mouse. Appearing when least expected, never seeming to move and watching her. It would watch over her in the morning when she fed Scratchy, follow her to the kitchen. Sit on the coffee machine not caring for the steam wafting up nor the loud noise when the beans were ground.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha found herself getting used to its presence. Like Scratchy, it had a will of its own. At first she thought it followed her everywhere blindly, magically teleporting to her if she was out of reach. On more than one occasion she found the bulb looking at her front door. One time, it sat on the ground, slightly angled upwards so its side faced the door properly. Agatha wasn’t sure how it did it, but she knew it was looking at the door. She almost stepped on it that time.</p><p>She had gone to the attic, which had now become her new lair and practiced with Alice’s magic. Small spells at first, getting used to the temper and level of skill. When she had gone down for a snack and to check up on Scratchy, who always freely roams the house, she nearly crushed the bulb. She had completely forgotten about it, not expected the lonesome thing to be there. Instinctively, like she does with Scratchy, she picked it up.</p><p>“Watch it, little thing.” She had said. “I almost stepped on you.”</p><p>She put it on the kitchen island then, facing the door – she wasn’t exactly sure where the ‘face’ part of the bulb was but she figured it was the thought that counted. After the incident, she found it there semiregularly.</p><p>--</p><p>“Have you found out what it is yet?” Billy sips his tea. He comes over regularly now. He appeared at Agatha’s doorstep about a week after they last saw each other, asking for guidance. His power, seemingly able to bend reality in any which way he wants too much for him to learn how to control on his own.</p><p>It also came with the revelation he was the core reason Alice, Lilia and Sharon passed. Agatha had consoled him as best she could. Told him she could teach him, if he wanted her to. Mentioned a disclaimer that she too had a habit of killing her coven. Billy decided to take that risk.</p><p>So now, the attic had become Agatha and Billy’s lair. Both their own notebooks scribbled with spells, projects and runes. They worked in tandem, nursing their magic to a controlled beast. In truth, Agatha’s magic was more like a timid chihuahua, but perhaps that made it even more of a challenge for her to control and steer it. Never before was she to control her temper to muster up her magic.</p><p>“Not yet.” Agatha says. The bulb had joined their tea break, sitting in the middle of the plate with biscuits. Seemingly, craving to be at the centre of Agatha’s attention.</p><p>“It may sound stupid,” Billy laughs nervously, “But I read the whole Wikipedia page on onions. The taxonomy part was lacking, so I went to the library and read a book or two on onion taxonomy. Heavily studied the pictures too. None of them look like <em>that</em>.” Billy points to the bulb. “I don’t think it’s an onion.”</p><p>“It’s not.” Agatha agrees.</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“It doesn’t smell like one.”</p><p>Billy reaches to grab the bulb and smells it. “It doesn’t smell like anything.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “It does. Especially in the morning. It’s kind of… Sweet? Nothing like the sweetness you are used to. All those perfumed candies and deodorants. It’s sweet in the way nature smells sweet sometimes. It reminds me of 300 years ago.”</p><p>Billy looks befuddled. He smells the bulb again. His lack of reaction showing he smells nothing of the like. Agatha grabs it, smells and faintly detects the smell that has started to occupy her house.</p><p>“Yeah,” she nods, “like spring.”</p><p>“Has spring changed that much over the years?”</p><p>Agatha laughs. It’s humourless, filled with poisonous scorn. “Yes. I can’t pinpoint exactly when it happened, but the air nowadays is grainy. Back in my youth it was fresh, empty, like a clean piece of paper.”</p><p>They sit in silence after that. Billy mulls over Agatha’s words, humming as he does so. Agatha nurses her tea. She eyes the bulb, now back among the biscuits. When she looks at a point behind it, or near it, but not directly at it, she is almost sure she can see it sway. Slowly moving from left to right, like a fish in a stream.</p><p>“What’s got you all in a chipper mood?”</p><p>Agatha is shook from her thoughts. “What?”</p><p>“You’re humming. Why are you so happy all of a sudden?”</p><p>“Am not.”</p><p>Billy frowns. “Yes you are. I heard it.”</p><p>“I thought you were humming. Thinking about global warming and such after I talked about the air.”</p><p>Billy shakes his head.</p><p>Now it’s Agatha’s turn to frown. She looks back at the bulb. The humming has stopped. So has the illusion of it swaying. She picks it up. Pokes at it to see if she can force it to sway. The bulb just rolls over in the palm of her hand like an inanimate object.</p><p>“You think it’s the bulb?”</p><p>“I know it’s the bulb.” There is an edge of exasperation in Agatha’s voice. She has accepted its presence in her life by now. But when it starts pulling tricks like this, seemingly having hidden peculiarities that cannot be explained, her temper gets in her way. Agatha gets up. “Time to practice again.”</p><p>“What? What are you going to do with it?” Billy scrambles after her, barely managing to keep up with her tempo.  </p><p>Agatha wipes everything from the small table she hauled up the stairs one day. She places the bulb in the middle of it. She speaks her transmutation spell – it was funny, really, teaching it to Billy at the same time as she tried to control her newfound magic to perform it – and channels her magic from her hands to the bulb. It comes out in a strong burst of orange, though almost bluish at the palm of her hand. A gradient of magic, like the flame of a candle. Surely but slowly, Alice’s magic is becoming purple.</p><p>The magic laps at the bulb. Twists around it in the way a stream flows around a boulder. The bulb stays the same shape, not the vase Agatha wanted to shape it into. Agatha sits down on an old pouffe, ignoring the cloud of dusts that explodes from it. She frowns, deep in thought.</p><p>“Aw, that’s too bad.” Billy placates. “You got the spell under control last week. Must be a fluke.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha murmurs. “’s Not a fluke.”</p><p>Billy sits down on a different pouffe, more a luxurious pillow at this point. His knees nearly up to his chest.</p><p>“Transmutation spells only work on inanimate objects-”</p><p>“They work on bugs.” Billy interjects.</p><p>“Yeah, well, they’re not as sentient as real animals.” Agatha has no time to dive into the ethics of sentience and agency of objects. “Insects and plants are free range for transmutation. Animals, like rabbits or cows are more difficult. You can make a stone look and act like a bird, but you can’t make a bird look and act like a stone.”</p><p>Billy nods along. Remembering this lecture from a while ago. He has since stopped writing everything down, learning the science of magic is much more intuitive than he originally expected.</p><p>“Which makes this bulb, onion, <em>thing</em>,” Agatha points at the bulb on the table, “an animal. Something with enough sentience to be an agent. A thing with agency. A will, a soul, a life, whatever you want to call it.”</p><p>“But… it’s a bulb…?”</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha says it like it’s the most obvious thing ever. “Which means it has used a shape-changing spell. It usually only works by changing animals, like humans, into other animals. But somehow someone figured out how to change into a bulb. Which would need an insane amount of power.”</p><p>Agatha points an accusatory finger at the bulb as if she caught the one who cast the spell red-handed. The moment her finger is directed at the bulb an electric shock goes through Agatha. Her eureka moment becoming a secret that should have stayed hidden. Agatha feels the shock spread out through her body, starts at her fingertips and moves inward. Ice cold flashes of terror freeze her in place. Words cling to the edge of her teeth. Agatha wants to speak, say anything, finds herself unable to. Stuck in this imaginary gun duel. The bulb seems to tremble. Agatha wonders if it feels the same as she does.</p><p>As quickly as it happened, it stops. Her arm falls to her side with increased gravity. Agatha looks at her hand for a second, sees nothing unusual.</p><p>“Agatha… Are you okay?”</p><p>The bulb is still trembling. Either frightened or… giggling? When Agatha grabs the bulb, she expects the same shock of terror to stun her again. It doesn’t. Instead, the trembling shifts to a buzzing. A hive of bees reduced to the size of a chestnut. The bulb is happy in the palm of her hand.</p><p>Agatha looks at Billy. The gravity on her face mirroring in his.</p><p>“Billy,” Agatha starts, “I think… I think this is Rio.”</p><p>--</p><p>The bulb – Rio – still hovers Agatha like before. Rio is on her nightstand when she goes to bed, watches her when she sleeps and greets her in the morning with her honeyed spring smell. She is on the coffee machine, sometimes has a cup ready whenever Agatha has a hard time getting up.</p><p>At times, Agatha finds her watching Scratchy from a safe place, a table, the armrest of the couch, a stack of books on the floor. She becomes more daring as time passes. One time, she was laying with Scratchy in his dog bed. Agatha had commented on it, how cute they were, both napping, laying against each other. Agatha hasn’t seen it happen since, but she is certain Rio still does it when she isn’t looking.</p><p>Ever since the revelation Rio has started growing. It started with a tiny speck on the bottom of the bulb. Then two, then more. Slowly growing into larger tentacles. Her roots – the roots of the bulb? Agatha isn’t sure what to call it. The horn at the top has burst through the flimsy layers of skin. Now, a rod of green peeks out, roughly the size of Agatha’s pinky nail.</p><p>“Perhaps you should plant her.” Billy says to her one day. They are watching one of his crime shows. Rio is between them, placed on a higher pillow so she can watch too.</p><p>Agatha looks at him. Confused. “Why?”</p><p>Billy shrugs. “She’s a bulb. Bulbs grow into plants. She wants to grow, look at her roots.” Billy picks Rio up, tickles at the roots. The biggest now the length of a phalanx.</p><p>“Careful!” Agatha takes Rio from him and places her back in her spot. “She doesn’t like that.”</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“I just do.” Agatha says, pretending to focus on the TV show. The blond guy with a cane is vehemently explaining something about the psychology of their killer. The guy should cut his hair sometime. He looks like a lesbian.</p><p>“Then do you know if she wants to be planted?” Billy asks after a moment of silence.</p><p>Agatha looks at Rio. “Do you?” Rio doesn’t move.</p><p>Still, Agatha can almost see the cheeky smile on her face. She feels the familiar way Rio would sling her arms around Agatha’s shoulders, innocently pulling her closer under the guise of nonchalance. Lips twisted into a haughty grin, eyes betraying something more lascivious.</p><p>“I don’t know what I want.” She would drawl out with a hint of a petulant whine. “What do you want?”</p><p>It was a trick. Always a trick. Agatha would always be wrong and exactly right at the same time. She would be be scolded for insinuating any physical activity between them but with the same breath Rio would pull her close. The mind games were dizzying, trying to guess the correct answer that never existed.</p><p>Agatha had cursed Rio on multiple occasions in moments of exasperation. Her patience worn down by whatever superficial problem she had in that moment. She didn’t have time for games, proximity, sex, whatever it was Rio wanted from her but would never outright say. She misses that now.</p><p>Agatha looks at the bulb. Simply the organ of a plant that stores nutrients for the winter until it can bloom again. The only feeling it should bring is a slight sparkle of happiness when the full flower is in bloom. Yet here, Agatha is sitting on her couch speaking to it, asking it what it wants as if it’s her friend.</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond. Doesn’t sway, teleport or turn away.</p><p>“She can get what she wants when she learns to ask for it.” Agatha says coldly to no one in particular.</p><p>--</p><p>One late afternoon, Billy enters Agatha’s house with burritos and a heavy bag. It clinks as he sets it down beside the kitchen island.</p><p>“What’s that?” Agatha asks as she gets plates for the both of them. Rio sits on the edge of the counter, looks down at Scratchy who is hopping around Agatha’s feet.</p><p>“I brought pots for Rio to choose.” He grabs Rio and twists her to face the centre of the kitchen island. First, Billy reveals a metal bucket. Too big for Rio. The water would sink down deep in the earth but the top would stay dry.</p><p>“No.” Agatha says decisively before Billy can ask Rio’s opinion. “That’s too big. The watering would be messed up.”</p><p>Billy retrieves another one from the bag. This one is smaller. A plain terracotta pot. Not too big in size. Ugly in its plainness.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “That’s hideous.”</p><p>“You didn’t even wait for Rio to respond.”</p><p>Agatha turns to Rio, raises an eyebrow. Rio sways slowly from left to right, as if shrugging her shoulders.</p><p>“No enthusiasm, so it’s a no.”</p><p>Billy has more. A burgundy one shaped like a soup bowl. A dark green glazed pot tapering up at the top in a weird triangle shape. One pot is so vibrantly yellowish green it hurts the eyes. At last, he pulls out a dark grey pot, nearly black with pawprints on one side. This one tapers at the top in the same way as a prehistoric pot does.</p><p>“That one came with a lid. But I dropped it and it broke so I threw it away.” Billy says as he points to the pot with pawprints. “Figured it’s odd for a plant pot to have a lid.”</p><p>Rio starts buzzing vibrantly, attempts to roll towards it. It is made difficult by her extending roots.</p><p>The pot is too big for Agatha’s liking. She picks it up to inspect it. As she turns it around to look at the bottom for a watering hole, grey sand falls out and scatters across the countertop. She puts the pot down with a bang and shakes the sand from her sleeve, dusts it off her blouse. Agatha’s face twists into an expression of disgust.</p><p>“Where did you get these?”</p><p>“There was a yard sale on my way here.” Billy explains. “I bartered with the dad to get all of these for 50 cents a piece.”</p><p>Rio has finally reached the pot. Continues to bang against it with ardent enthusiasm.</p><p>“The lady has spoken.” Billy says, satisfied with himself.</p><p>“She can have it.” Agatha says, her tone flat, though her mouth betrays she finds humour in the situation. “Can’t think of a better pot for her than the urn of a dead cat.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>--</p><p>Rio thrives in her pot. Agatha cannot see her root growth, but the green stem has quickly doubled in size. Leaves, Agatha corrects herself, the stem has since developed into at least three separate leaves. Or what she assumes to be leaves. They look more like broad blades of grass, or the wooden sticks inside of popsicles painted green.</p><p>Agatha tried to figure out when and if she should water Rio. Alas, not knowing what kind of plant she was made it a difficult feat. She resorts to watering her twice a week and misting when she feels like it. Or when Rio feels like it, when the two tallest leaves cross each other, Agatha found out. She may have become less mobile since being planted, but not less expressive.</p><p>One thing Agatha quickly found out, to her disdain, is how the pot prohibits Rio from moving. The first time she woke up after Rio was planted, she panicked when Rio was not on her bedside table. Nor was she on her coffee machine. She was in the windowsill, illuminated by the morning sun. The exact spot Agatha left her the evening before.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t know.” Agatha cried stoic tears as she picked up the pot. With the pad of her index finger she rubbed the part of the bulb that stuck out from the dirt. She traced each leaf with care. Placed a tender kiss to the tallest stalk.</p><p>From then on, she moved Rio with her. She had a spot in each windowsill of the house. Watched over Agatha as she practiced and wrote down spells in her lair. Hid behind the curtains in the living room. Rio came with her in the morning so she could soak up the sun from the kitchen window as Agatha made her coffee. It soon became Rio’s favourite spot. In the evenings, Agatha lifted Rio up the stairs. Placed her on the nightstand, kissed her goodnight and hoped Rio liked watching her sleep as much as she did in the olden days.</p><p>Oftentimes, Agatha wonders if Rio gets enough sunlight. She has resorted to reading in her backyard. Misting Rio when she asks for it.</p><p>“Wanna know something funny?” Agatha asks Rio one day as they sit in their usual spot in the backyard. “Sometimes, when we sit here, I pretend we’re back at that one big lake. The one near our cottage.”</p><p>Rio is soaking in the sun and listens to the birds sing. Next to her, Scratchy laid himself down. Earlier he had spent exploring the yard and grazed till his stomach was full. Now, the little guy is dozing off.</p><p>“You always begged me to join you for a swim. I said I preferred the view from the bank. I definitely did enjoy the view, but like I told you after a couple years, I couldn’t swim. Looking back, I don’t know why I didn’t tell you earlier. I had no fear you would think differently of me for not being able to.”</p><p>Agatha sighs deeply. She puts her book down and sits back to enjoy the sun. If she closes her eyes, she can almost hear Rio splashing nearby.</p><p>“It took me a long while to understand why you liked swimming so much, but it hit me the summer after you first taught me to swim. I just ran after you, dove deep instantly and submerged myself without thinking twice about it. If you were to ask me, that is where I truly felt free. Flying is fun, but there is something about swimming. Flying without magic. It’s deathly human and ordinary.”</p><p>Agatha smiles to herself. Warmed by the memory of before. She looks over at Rio.</p><p>Rio crosses her two tallest leaves.</p><p>--</p><p>“Have you tried true love’s kiss?” Billy’s eyes are big. Radiant with a sparkle of hope to end Agatha’s agony.</p><p>Agatha looks at him. For a moment unwilling to reveal the soft underbelly of her desperation. “Yes.” She decides to truthfully answer.</p><p>“Maybe you can…” Billy’s sparkle of hope now fleeting. “… kiss her again?”</p><p>Agatha looks at him again. Her body deflates. She can muster up not an ounce of energy to debate with him. Instead, she sags down from the couch and kneels by the coffee table. Delicately, she places her hands on the wooden surface near the pot, as if afraid Rio will run away if Agatha moves erratically. She bows down her head and kisses the green stalks.</p><p>Nothing happens.</p><p>“Perhaps try kissing the bulb? Maybe that is where her essence is?”</p><p>Agatha kisses the bulb of the plant. Half of it sticks out. She wonders if she is kissing Rio’s waist or her feet. It brings her back to a memory of long ago.</p><p>Rio was laying on their bed reading a book she had ‘borrowed for an indefinite amount of time’. Her hair was still damp from her bath and dripped on her linen shift, creating see-through blotches on her chest. Her eyebrows slightly furrowed as she focussed on the story. She did not notice Agatha as she sat down on the foot of their bed.</p><p>Agatha watched her then. Wanting to cherish the domestic scene and tuck it away for a later moment. With an uncanny shyness she reached out and grabbed Rio’s nearby foot, bowed down to kiss it plainly on the sole. The skin smooth, tender. The opposite of Agatha’s, which were calloused by years of walking long distances in all kinds of weather.</p><p>She kissed again. Open-mouthed this time. Rio tasted of lavender. A residue of her perfumed bathwater, Agatha assumed. Having lived a century and more, she was happy with the improvement of general hygiene. Preferring the lavish options life had to offer, Agatha would never refuse a hotel like this.</p><p>With her tongue she kissed away the hints of lavender and revealed Rio’s earthiness she never completely lost. At first, Agatha had assumed it was simply because of the way they lived. The sporadic way they bathed themselves properly. How Rio preferred to dive into rivers despite the cold. Later, she thought it had something to do with earth magic itself. Now, Agatha is certain both of these options are true and wishes for nothing to be different. Rio and earth go hand in hand.</p><p>The Christians were right by wanting to bury their dead to be closer to their god. To be completely enveloped in it, surrounded, slowly decaying and becoming one with earth as an act of divine devotion. But then, so were the Muslims correct in their understanding that a divine being cannot be expressed in imagery, instead choosing to decorate their mosques in geometrical floral patterns. The balance of nature.</p><p>Agatha wanted to be inundated by the flavour. She wanted to submerge herself in Rio’s bathwater and savour the feeling of her body having been there. She wanted to wade in the same bog Rio had pulled so many souls from. The feeling of standing in front of a raging waterfall, to feel the wind blowing and pushing against her bare skin, to be covered in the misty droplets and only able to hear the water rushing in front of her. She needed Rio to be that waterfall.</p><p>Instead, she dipped her body a little lower, lifted Rio’s foot a little higher and kissed her calf. Placed a second one beside it for good measure, and moved up to her knee. As Agatha kissed the joint, she wondered if it looked the same as hers if she drew a knife to it and cut it open. She wanted to see if Rio bled the same as she did. A token to her humanity which Agatha helped shape.</p><p>With a hand that knew no shame, Agatha lifted the shift higher, revealing Rio’s lean thighs. She kissed her there, too. Dotted her lips as light as butterfly wings across the expanse of Rio’s skin. Higher and higher until she reached her hipbone. Agatha loved the way it protruded. Drawing a line to the dark hairs growing around Rio’s vulva, guiding the devotee to the altar.</p><p>She looked up as she sucked on tender skin. Rio’s eyes had followed her soon after the second kiss like the constant flow of a river. Now, they watched as Agatha marked the pale surface. Blissfully unaware of the victorious feeling that Agatha, a puny witch, could will the appearance of a higher power to be different. Unaware, too, of the desire burning inside Agatha, wanting to see Rio writhe to her doing.</p><p>Agatha bit harshly. Rio’s lip twitched as a response to the pain. Her eyes darkening, uncapable of enjoying life the way humans do. <em>More, </em>she asked Agatha,<em> make it hurt</em>. Agatha simply scratched her nails down the outside of Rio’s thighs, brushed her hands over her knees as she settled between them, and, with the tenderness of a sultry summer’s breeze, dragged all ten fingers back up. Her hands grabbed Rio’s hips. Heavy thighs settled on her shoulders with the ease of an old shepherd guiding his flock home.</p><p>Agatha fucked her then.</p><p>The crass word shakes Agatha out of her memories. She refuses to say she made love to Rio that night, finding it sounds banal. Uncapable of expressing the depth with which she felt her devotion. Besides, most of the time, they fucked. No way around that. Rio, never completely becoming used to resembling a human, sought out the edges of what a human is capable of experiencing. She likes things to be harsh, noisy, and open. Agatha, with enough anger and energy to fuel three revolutions, willingly participates.</p><p>Now, as she looks at the bright green of the developing plant, Agatha wishes they had been tender more often. Devoting herself completely to the will of Rio’s body, and Rio doing the same. Grains of dirt stick to her lips. She licks them up, savouring the taste of dirt. Wishing it was Rio she tasted instead.</p><p>--</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>Agatha blurts it out before she fully formed her thoughts. Rio sits in the windowsill in the attic. The sun is low, casts a long bar of light on the floor of Agatha’s lair. If the sun sinks a little lower, Agatha’s shoes are bathed in light. For now, she remains completely in the shadows.</p><p>Agatha came here to study, originally. She gave up not an hour in. Not for a particular reason – her magic cooperated fine – other than she was bored of it. She thought of the times she would study with Rio. Made her help her with blasting spells, which would quickly turn into playfights. On more than one occasion it ended with one of them being pinned to the ground, begging for mercy in their most theatrical acting.</p><p>She looks at the silhouette in the window. Rio has grown a lot. Is now taller than Agatha’s hand. One of her stalks is much longer than the rest. The tip swollen. Something waiting to burst out. Agatha is pretty sure Rio will bloom soon. She has been looking forward to it for quite some time.</p><p>Rio always made her fantastical flowers, though never a bouquet. She said she prefers the beauty of a singularity. It took Agatha a while to understand she had meant her.</p><p>“I want to see you bloom.” Agatha says next. “I have been counting the days.” She chuckles. “I’ve secretly been keeping track of your growth in the tiny calendar in the downstairs toilet. It has notes like ‘Monday: length of pinky finger’ or ‘Saturday: tall leaf is ring finger’ or ‘Tuesday: fifth leaf discovered’. I think it’s silly.”</p><p>Agatha looks at her hands. Rio’s stalk the size of her pinky finger seems like ages ago. Realistically, she knows it is a difference of a few weeks. She sighs with the gravity of disclosing something private.</p><p>“I keep thinking of your blooming as a face reveal. It hasn’t been that long since we last saw each other.” Agatha looks at the plant in her window. It seems like such an ordinary plant now. “I mean really seeing each other. The last time I saw you before you dressed up as agent Vidal was, what? In the fifties? Maybe a little later?”</p><p>Agatha has a vivid memory of Rio in a fifties cocktail dress attempting to recreate the scene of Marilyn Monroe in <em>The Seven Year Itch</em> with her powers. It was one of the many times they set aside their anger for a quick moment of company. Agatha remembers it so vividly for that was the moment she found out why Rio always brought her knife with her. The sight of the blade strapped to her thigh made her feel like she was caught with her fingers in the cookie jar and it snapped shut like a mouse trap.</p><p>It wasn’t for the ordinary vulgar sight. Simply the realisation the knife is as much Rio as is the darkness of her hair, the gap between her teeth and the impulsive, carefree nature with which she faces life. The idea that even after centuries of knowing the woman, there were still things she could discover about her.</p><p>The discovery had never been unnoticed, the same way men figured out ravens follow death. The explanation that follows the why of the question is that ravens learn to follow humans into a battlefield to feast on the dead bodies. In the same vein, Agatha knew Rio and her knife always went together, though never considered Rio as a supernatural being to be the explanation as to why that was.</p><p>“I can still picture you in my mind. You look exactly like you, but when I try to zoom in on specific features I can’t for the life of me see them.” Agatha confesses. “I know the curve of your smile. The gap between your teeth. How you would raise your eyebrows when you were offended, but I cannot see the specific wrinkles in your forehead when I picture you doing it.”</p><p>Agatha blinks away a tear forming in the corner of her eye. She refuses to look at Rio. The plant a sullen reminder of what she lost, like the bouquets of flowers on the side of the road.</p><p>“I’m still really, really angry at you. But I’m also tired of it.”</p><p>Agatha decides to end the conversation there. She goes downstairs alone, but promises Rio to pick her up later.</p><p>She still kisses Rio goodnight that evening.</p><p>Agatha wakes up early the morning after. A thin strip of sunlight bursts through a crack in the curtains, blinding her. She keeps her eyes closed as she turns around. That is when she notices the sweet smell of spring. It had always hung around Rio, but this morning the smell is particularly strong. It would be smothering if Agatha didn’t like it so much.</p><p>When she opens her eyes, she looks up to find the yellow and orange of a daffodil looking back at her.</p><p>--</p><p>For the first time in weeks, Agatha can actually see what Rio is looking at. Though the daffodil is always facing slightly downwards, Agatha can tell the trumpet is always pointed towards the centre of Rio’s attention.</p><p>The flower itself is ordinary. Agatha could have bought Rio from a garden store. In her head, she had tried to anticipate what kind of flower Rio would go for. A big one. Chaotic. With he leaves of a lily and the colours of a hibiscus. The plain yellows of the daffodil do not feel anticlimactic, if you were to ask Agatha. If anything, it is the purest parts of Rio distilled for her. Despite expecting the world, Rio capers into a fifth dimension and brings something entirely new. In this case, the most conventional in a state of absolute aberration.  </p><p>Rio seems to like Scratchy. She follows him with her gaze. At first, Agatha was afraid the little rabbit would see the plant as a meal, nibbling away at the leaves. However, he seemed to realise Rio was not a plant at all. He treated her with careful curiosity, sniffing attentively the first few times Agatha let them interact after Rio started growing. Rio was but the leg of a couch, the cover of a big chair. Perhaps, if Agatha tries hard enough, she could see Rio being a companion of his.</p><p>“You know…” Agatha looks at Rio. Rio faces the floor. “Billy hasn’t visited yet since you bloomed. Is it weird I want to show you off?”</p><p>Slowly, Rio moves to face her. Even if she had not moved, Agatha knew she was listening. Rio always listened to her.</p><p>“Plant-keeping skills are not something to feel much pride over, no offense,” Agatha chuckles. The yellow of Rio’s leaves seem to light up, mirroring her smile. “But the feeling of nursing something – someone – with love and care is something I missed. I think… I got caught up in my emotions when Nicky passed. I forgot what it was like when all I cared about was you. The way you return what I put into you. It feels so much better than being angry at you.”</p><p>Agatha is not sure what to say next. She wants Rio to know she loves her. That if Rio stays like this forever, her tiny plant companion, she will accept that. Even more so, she will live every last second of her life with a passion she hasn’t felt since Nicky’s birth, knowing the force of nature has not given up on her. Given her too many chances, perhaps, something she will never be able to completely understand. Something she is grateful for.</p><p>Agatha decides to not put any of that to words. “When he comes over, I think I am going to be one of those obnoxious mothers who show off the first echo of their speck of dust. Screeching ‘look what I made!’ and ‘who thought I was able of creating this?’ Isn’t that silly? How I nursed you to life?”</p><p>--</p><p>As time passes, Rio’s leaves get wrinkly. Never before had Agatha expected to see Rio age. She remembered the pads of Rio’s fingers tracing the crows’ feet beside her own eyes, the wonder that sparked across Rio’s face.</p><p>“I didn’t see them appear.” Rio had said.</p><p>Agatha had chuckled. “They don’t suddenly appear. Your skin doesn’t decide one day to be old. It happens slowly. Like the changing of the leaves from green to yellow to brown.”</p><p>Rio had nodded then. Signalling she understood. Agatha wondered if she truly did. To understand is different from accepting a statement to be true.</p><p>“Do I have them?” Rio had asked next.</p><p>Agatha had shifted herself closer to Rio. Pretended to thoroughly inspect her skin. Pushing and pulling on every imagined fold. Tracing imaginary lines and touching every dimple and pore. Rio chuckled the whole time.</p><p>“No.” Agatha answered truthfully. She smiled to lighten the sullen tone with which she had spoken. She had thought about it before, the way Rio was unaffected by time. Acknowledging the fact out loud gave it gravity. Agatha wasn’t one to fantasise about the years at the end of her life, preferring to live in the here and now, but the thought of a wrinkly Agatha being bathed by a youthful Rio felt <em>wrong</em>. The way a hare kit does not belong in snow and a flower should not bloom among hoarfrost grass.</p><p>With extreme tenderness, Agatha rubs one of Rio’s wilted petals between her thumb and forefinger. The closest thing the motion resembles is stroking the bottom of her ear, or sliding past the edge of her jaw. It doesn’t fit right, Agatha thinks. The caress is too forced. Just the right amount of fake. A watching eye would pick up on it immediately.</p><p>The petal snaps. Breaks loose from the base and flitters between fingers. Agatha nearly drops it. With a pang, Agatha feels hot all over. The hotness like pinpricks under her skin screams for a way out. The pores in her skin stay closed, refuse to sweat. A beating heart wills the body silent.</p><p>The wilted yellow in her hand, at a time more vibrant than the sun, is now nearly translucent. With bated breath, Agatha looks at it, cradles it like a baby bird. Refuses to look up, to see what she has inflicted upon Rio. For a moment she wonders if she can put it back. Glue the petal where it once stood proud. Then she remembers life doesn’t work that way. Losses need to be mourned, anything else makes them merely a nuisance, an obstacle to face or forget.</p><p>Agatha forces herself to look at Rio, who seems to have shrunk centimetres in mere seconds. Her head hangs low. Her leaves sag to the side. Her whole being, once a fierce deep green, has a sickly yellowish hue.</p><p>“You’re dying.”</p><p>Agatha speaks the words she never once expected to say to Rio. Those same words she refused to voice a lifetime ago when the evidence of her motherhood clung to her hands and lead her to look at the fish in the stream.</p><p>She had never told Nicky why he was sick, what would become of his sickness. Never once did he ask about it. After a while, during his last year alive, he had known he was dying with no way to change the will of fate. Be it through instinct or careful deduction. Agatha didn’t care to define the specifics. All she cared about was the glazed look in his eyes those last few months. How he would blink it away, treated it like the inevitable. One simply deals with such things the way one deals with frost in the winter and flooding in autumn. To question why or how a waste of energy for something that happens regardless.</p><p>As Agatha puts Rio down on her nightstand, a second petal falls. Lays on the dirt, ready to be consumed and recycled. The sight shocks Agatha, who, deep down, had chosen to ignore the empty space the first petal left behind – Daffodils had always had five petals.</p><p>The bedroom is dark. Refusing to let artificial light show Rio’s dying, Agatha had changed with the lights off. She stares at Rio from her pillow. She is yet to kiss her goodnight. She hesitates. The knot in her stomach twists, winds itself tighter, lets itself be known as the only truth in Agatha’s life. A goodnight kiss is followed by sleep, a moment in which Agatha cannot look over and protect Rio. A moment in which she was bereaved before.</p><p>She sits up. Brings the pot to her chest. Stares closely at Rio. Gently, as to not ruin Rio any further, she moves in to kiss the side of a wilted, crumpled up petal. Agatha pretends she is looking at an older Rio. Her face full of wrinkles. Strands of grey peppered through her dark hair. She looks like a sweet old lady, one who would keep chickens, and have an orchard in her backyard to give fruits to the children in the summer.</p><p>Agatha’s lips touch the petal. An electric shock goes through her, mirroring the moment she figured out the bulb was Rio. The shock spreads from her lips, ice cold, to the rest of her body. Her heart a frantic bird wanting to escape its cage as terror keeps her in place. At once, Agatha realises what Billy felt those times he held Rio, when he turned stiff and white as a sheet. It was utter and pure panic. Anxiety only experienced when facing the threat of death.</p><p>Rio trembles. Agatha wonders if she feels it too.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha’s voice sticks to her throat. She holds the pot closer to her chest. “It’s okay.”</p><p>Rio is shaking now. Agatha is unsure if her sobs have anything to do with it. She is fully crying now, lets herself drift away with the feeling.</p><p>“If this is where it ends, where us ends, I am okay with that. I was a selfish partner. Things have to come to an end, I accept that now. I loved every moment you gave me with Nicky, I don’t want to hold his death over you anymore.”</p><p>Tears roll down Agatha’s cheeks. Fall onto her chest and into the dirt. She is careful not to touch Rio, the wilted stalks so fragile the touch of a feather could snap them in half.</p><p>“I have loved you the second you came in to my life. And I love you still. I hope you do too. That in some distant future when I am gone, you still think of me sometime as the mortal you created life with. I would be honoured if you did.”</p><p>Agatha kisses Rio again. Gently sets her down on the pillow beside her. She feels Rio watching over her as she closes her eyes. She forces herself to take deep breaths. The energy of life is cyclic. This was mirrored in the dance both Agatha and Rio were guilty of for performing in, constantly moving away and towards each other for centuries. Like a comet in orbit.</p><p>Rio, having chosen to present herself in a way Agatha can only approach with love, curiosity and desire, will pass on after this night. She always listens. And Agatha, having commanded her to never return, knows this. Should have known this. Has always known it to be true. Still, in a bout of hurt she cursed herself to a fate of loneliness. Agatha will reap the seeds she has sewn.</p><p>She falls into a deep sleep. Dreams of nothing. Knows better than to expect to feel death coming.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha wakes with the rising of the sun. Before she even opens her eyes, she notes an absence of the smell of spring in the air and an increase of the smell of dirt. Petrichor. She turns, looks at where she left Rio and finds she is gone. In the darkness of night, the pot broke into multiple pieces, scattering dirt everywhere.</p><p>In a rush, Agatha sits up. She had expected for Rio to lay weakly on the dirt, half dangling off the edge without the slightest hint of any sentience. She digs her fingers in the black void, gropes and twists to find evidence of Rio having once been rooted there. She finds none.</p><p>Rio has disappeared. Like she had asked her to that fateful moment on the Witches’ Road.   </p><p>With stiff limbs, Agatha dresses herself. She feels cold. Her movements almost robotic as she goes through the motions. The way to the coffee machine is tiresome. Agatha has to drag her feet every step of the way.</p><p>She reaches the hallway, sees the door Billy magicked up for her all those weeks ago. When Rio was a mystery to her still, when she had thought she was a remnant of the road. Agatha smiles at the memory. Trickster she is.</p><p>The coffee machine buzzes, grinds the beans to a powder. The air is thick with the smell of honeyed flowers and coffee. And Agatha is still standing in her hallway, facing the door. She frowns. Dares not to get her hopes up and rushes to the kitchen.</p><p>She is bathed in the warm yellow light of the sun. Shadows are cast upon the wooden floor of her kitchen, showing off the proud silhouette of Rio, in full human glory, sitting on the kitchen island.</p><p>Agatha, not wanting to be greedy, slowly lifts her gaze from the floor to the bottom of the kitchen island. She sees ten perfect toes first, dangling in the air. Then lean calves, knees connecting to toned thighs. Scratchy is sitting in Rio’s lap. He licks her hand. Agatha follows the slope of the arm to the shoulder. The white shirt. One protruding collarbone. Then, finally, Rio’s bright smile. Her gaze is fixed on the little rabbit, as Agatha should have grown to expect.</p><p>Agatha moves closer, delicately places her hands on either side of Rio’s thighs, afraid Rio will disappear if she moves erratically. Only then does Rio look at her.</p><p>“When he dies. I want a dark green urn with carrots on it for him.” Is the first and only thing Rio says before Agatha kisses her.</p><p>She tastes the earthiness of Rio, the salt of her tears. She smells coffee and spring and grass and blossoms. Feels the bones of Rio’s hips beneath the touch of her fingers. She digs her nails in until it hurts, touching her fully, understanding now why Rio always wanted more.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This story is loosely inspired by a fic I read years ago, where someone turns into an orange after the couple fights. I don’t remember the author or any specific details, other than that the ending made me cry the first time I read it. I was reminded of that story and then this came to me in a vision.</p><p>I hope you appreciated the bits of humour I sprinkled in and that I didn’t leave your heart in too many pieces by the end &lt;3</p></blockquote>
