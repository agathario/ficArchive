<h2>
     Chapter 1
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     A 9 hour road-trip from Pawnee, Indiana to Washington, DC to take up an internship was the last thing April would’ve been doing with her time. It’s only because of Leslie’s influence and April’s search of finding a different job away from her annoying coworkers that she reluctantly agreed to Leslie’s antics. After getting out of Ben’s car, (courtesy of Ben after the disaster of the last time they tried to take a road trip together, it led to them pushing the car back into an empty parking spot) April quickly unpacks her baggage in the shitbox of an apartment she’s in and puts on the most what she calls “Knope clothes”, gets back in Ben’s car and drives away to meet with the supervisor of the internship in a busy café.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do we really have to go meet up with the supervisor?” April fidgets around with her thumbs, why would they meet beforehand when they would see each other tomorrow at work anyway?
    </p>
<p>
     Ben turns around to face the brunette with fear struck into his eyes, “April I can’t stress this enough on how scary Jen Barkley is” he exasperates. “Let’s just make sure you have a first good impression on her and—“ before April could shut down whatever gibberish was spilling out of the man’s mouth, a familiar voice rang through both of the other person’s ears.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you two just gonna stand there dumbfounded? cause I don't have all the time in the world.”
    </p>
<p>
     Ben immediately gave April a light push forward towards the caramel haired woman already seated drinking what looks to be a cappuccino. Jen lets them both take their respective seats before introducing herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi! I'm Jen Barkley! I'm your new supervisor for the next few months you'll be here."
    </p>
<p>
     "Jen, you don’t have to, I told her alrea—"
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, I do. This is how it’s gonna go: You either keep up or you get left behind." Jen asserts, making sure Ben doesn’t interrupt her once more. She turns to April, reading her and taking all the insignificant features of her face in, for no reason whatsoever.
    </p>
<p>
     "Now, how about you introduce yourself? You're bound to."
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m April Ludgate.. I’m probably gonna get fired within the first week.”
    </p>
<p>
     "God forbid. I like you. You'll do just fine."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, sure, if by 'just fine' you mean accidentally setting something on fire.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen lets out a genuine giggle, startling the younger woman slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, I love a wild-card. Keeps things interesting. Do me a favor though—aim the fire away from me. These heels are new.” Jen points down to where her heels are and gives April a playful nudge to the shoulder, experimenting with how the other would react.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, no promises, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, Jen!” Ben cuts them off, “You did say you were gonna show April around Washington properly.” Ben reminisces the moment as he talks, knowing that the last time April was here, she was with her ex and her coworker Andy Dwyer. He thought it was a shame that they didn’t work out, but he is grateful to see April be a little more open and happy, even if she didn’t show it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh did I? Guess I did. Field trip it is then. Of some sorts.”
    </p>
<p>
     "Is this where you teach me how to smile and shake hands with rich people without throwing up in my mouth?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, sweetheart, if you're already this cynical you’re gonna fit perfectly in here.”
    </p>
<p>
     April didn’t flinch under Jen’s gaze, but she could feel the weight of it, like Jen was cataloging every detail—the stubborn slouch in her chair, the bored tilt of her head, the way her arms stayed locked across her chest like she was daring Jen to try harder.
    </p>
<p>
     For a second, April thought about snapping back, about saying something snarky just to wipe that amused little smirk off Jen’s face. But she didn’t. Not yet. Because as annoying as Jen already was, April couldn’t ignore the tiniest flicker of curiosity in her chest. (Although, she’d rather set herself on fire than admit that to anyone.)
    </p>
<p>
     Jen, of course, noticed. She always noticed. And it only made her grin widen ever so slightly as she leaned forward, with an expression that April couldn't quite decipher, looking like she’d already won this small unspoken game they were playing.
    </p>
<p>
     ———————
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the sun started setting, casting a warm orange glow over the city, April was already questioning every life choice that had led her here. Jen, meanwhile, was practically skipping down the street in her heels, pointing out buildings like an idiot (a tour guide, but an idiot could suffice.) on a power trip.
    </p>
<p>
     They stopped in front of yet another massive, overly impressive (Was it really? It was just a tall pillar, but that was just April’s thoughts on it.) structure, its shiny exterior glowing in the fading light. April stuffed her hands in her jacket pockets and stared up at it like it had personally offended her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright, uh, Ludgate. Welcome to Washington, D.C. This place is a monument to power, to politics, and to… well, people who can actually get things done."
    </p>
<p>
     April could feel her own eyes roll to the back of her head involuntarily, hearing Jen say that crap instantaneously filled her with boredom; as someone like her who loved spending her days wasting time, April was already considering quitting the internship to move back to Pawnee.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "That’s great. But does it have a donut shop that serves stuff with more sugar than what I can put on a spoon and eat for breakfast?"
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re in Washington now, sweets. We have real things to look at. Like this—“ Jen points out to the inescapable view of the historical landmark, “this is the Washington Monument. It's big, it’s bold, and it’s a tribute to someone who got stuff done.”
    </p>
<p>
     For someone who she only met a handful of times through her ex-boss Leslie, April couldn’t help the sensation of her so-called black heart beat just for a bit hearing the name “sweets” roll off of Jen’s tongue. She tried to pay no mind to it and instead bite back with a snarky remark.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, yeah, that thing looks just like a giant needle. Perfect."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "'It’s the tallest obelisk in the world, you know. A symbol of strength and..something. Leadership."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "Sounds exhausting."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "Well, this whole city might be too much for someone like you. How’s Pawnee? Still, a hole in the ground with a diner and a suspicious amount of raccoons?” The older woman teases, if there’s one thing that Jennifer Barkley would never get tired of, it’s bullying and dragging down everything about Pawnee and its unfortunate citizens.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "Probably. And it's perfect. It's mostly quiet, no one asks questions..well almost no one, and you can pretty much disappear into a pile of leaves and no one will bother you. Unlike here, where it looks like everyone’s wearing a costume and pretending to care about ‘the greater good.’"
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "in D.C..” she pauses, keeping April engaged within the conversation, “pretending is practically an art form. The difference is, here, people can actually do things while pretending."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "Yeah, I bet. I can’t wait to see how they’ll pretend to make my day interesting."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "it’s not about making your day interesting—it’s about making your presence known. If you want to stick around here, you’ve got to be like that monument: tall, bold, and hard to ignore."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "Okay. So, just be a giant prick who stands there and refuses to leave until everyone’s forced to acknowledge me?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April raised an eyebrow, the challenge in her expression clear, crossing her arms lazily like she had all the time in the world to dismantle whatever nonsense Jen was about to throw her way. It wasn’t like she cared—except, maybe she did, just enough to see how far she could push before the carefully composed woman across from her broke her perfect, smug exterior.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen, who had been gesturing dramatically toward the Washington Monument like a tour guide (Well she really was a tour guide now.) auditioning for a reality show, froze slightly. She turned to face April, her expression a mix of amusement and mock offense.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     "Sweetheart," Jen said, her heels clicking as she took a step closer, "it’s called presence. Owning the space. But sure, if you want to simplify it to ‘giant prick,’ go ahead."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April shrugged, shifting her weight to one foot as she stared up at the monument. "I mean, if the shoe fits…”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April watched Jen with the kind of detached curiosity she reserved for things that were mildly interesting but still probably dangerous, like raccoons (sort of) or unattended fires. Jen was laughing now, loud and sharp, like she knew the whole world was in on a joke she’d written. Everything about her radiated confidence, the kind of self-assurance that only came from knowing you’d always get what you wanted—and probably didn’t even have to ask.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The way she moved was infuriating. Every step, every flick of her wrist, every click of her stupidly expensive heels felt like a performance, but not the kind that tried too hard. No, Jen made it look effortless, like she’d been born with this weird, stupid (which is what April thought) energy that demanded attention. She didn’t talk; she owned the space with her voice, like it was some kind of invisible currency she knew everyone else was too poor to afford.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April hated her a little bit. But only a little.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Because, as much as April wanted to roll her eyes and walk in the opposite direction, there was something about Jen that made it impossible to look away. It wasn’t just the confidence, or the sharp edges of her personality that somehow didn’t scare people off. It was the way she seemed to be waiting for something—like every joke, every smirk, every gesture was a test to see who would keep up and who would fold.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April hated tests. But there was a small, inconvenient part of her that wanted to pass this one. Not because she cared what Jen thought of her—obviously—but because there was something fun about trying to match wits with someone who might actually be sharper than her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It was annoying. Jen was annoying. And yet, as Jen turned on her heel and strode off like she owned the entire city, April (unfortunately) found herself following without hesitation.

<p>
     It had been two weeks since April had arrived in D.C, and, much to her own annoyance, she hadn’t found a single good excuse to hate this city, at least not yet.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jennifer Barkley prided herself on reading people. It wasn’t just part of the job—it was the job. Politicians, donors, even interns like Ludgate—they all had tells, little giveaways that let her know exactly how to handle them. April Ludgate, though? She was proving to be an interesting case.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jennifer didn’t get surprised often, but when she did, it usually came with dollar signs attached or a disaster she’d have to clean up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The politician hadn’t expected much from the sullen twenty-something when Leslie Knope had sung her praises. (Well, sung was generous.. more like frantically gushed over April like she was some misunderstood genius.) But, Jennifer did notice something about her. April wasn’t just dismissive for the sake of it (well, truth be told, she sometimes was); she was watching, quietly picking everything apart, and—most annoyingly—probably deciding exactly how much of it wasn’t worth her time, and that amused Jen.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April, on the other hand,
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She didn’t get people like Jennifer Barkley. Actually, scratch that—she got them, she just didn’t care for them. People like Jen were slick, confident, and calculated, always working some angle. They spoke in polished sentences, smiled too easily, and acted like the world revolved around whatever deal they were trying to close.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And yet, there was something about Jen that bugged her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn’t just that she was annoying (because she most definitely was). It was the way Jen seemed to see straight through her usual tactics. Most people would take April’s sarcasm and disinterest at face value, happily letting her fade into the background. But not Jen. No, Jen always had that knowing smile, like she’d cracked some secret code April didn’t even know she had.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It was infuriating, and absolutely ridiculous, but she really should have seen it coming from a mile away.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Maybe she should’ve taken what Ben said about the politician seriously.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Somehow, April hadn’t quit. She wasn’t sure if it was because she was too lazy to pack her bags or because D.C. wasn’t the actual hellhole she’d convinced herself it was. No, it was a hellhole—it just… wasn’t boring, and she hated that.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     More specifically, she hated that part of the “not boring” equation was Jen Barkley.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It was snowing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April kicked at a crack in the sidewalk, noticing the light amount of snow, watching as Jen glanced over her shoulder with that stupidly perfect smirk. (Not that she cared to take note of that, she just couldn't help but notice. It was good to notice once in a while.)
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Currently, they were supposed to be heading to some café to meet with a few people Jen had referred to as “important,” which April had immediately translated to “annoying.” Leslie had drilled into her head the importance of “networking,” but April’s version of networking usually involved a solid glare and the hope that people would just leave her alone.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen slowed her pace just enough to fall beside April, “You know, Ludgate,” she began, her tone dripping with faux seriousness, “if you’re going to meet important people, you might want to work on your handshake. First impressions are everything.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April gave her a sidelong glance. “My handshake is fine, I shake hands. Done.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Fine?” Jen gasped, clutching her chest like she’d been mortally wounded. “Darling, ‘fine’ is what you say about a mediocre salad or a pair of shoes you settle for when they don’t have your size. Handshakes are significant.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah?” April deadpanned, hands shoved deeper into her pockets. “And what’s your genius method? Do you crush their hand into a fine powder or just hold on until it gets awkward?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen grinned, tilting her head in mock thought. “Its a delicate balance. You want firm but not aggressive, confident but not sweaty, and just enough eye contact to say, ‘I could ruin you, but I won’t… Yet.’” She said, jokingly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April stopped mid-step, turning to stare at her. “You do realize you sound like a Bond villain, right?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen raised an eyebrow. “I was only kidding, sweets. I mean, unless you want me to be a Bond villain, I think I could pull off the whole ‘world domination’ thing very well.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April rolled her eyes and started walking again, her boots crunching against the thin layer of snow on the sidewalk. “You already act like you own the world. What’s left to dominate?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen let out a quick laugh, her breath puffing in the cold air. “What’s left to dominate? Oh, I don’t know, maybe your enthusiasm. Seems like the last frontier.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She wanted to roll her eyes, but instead, she caught herself smiling. Smiling because of Jen. That should’ve been a ridiculous thought in itself, but it was involuntary. It wasn’t even a fake one. It was small, and it made her stomach twist in irritation the second she realized it had happened.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And for a split second, April caught herself thinking: This isn’t so bad.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It was a quiet thought, almost sneaky in the way it slipped into her brain before she could swat it away. She didn’t even like Jen, not really. Jen was pushy and fancy and way too comfortable being the center of attention. But there was something about her that felt… less awful than most people. Which was horribly idiotic.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     That realization hit like a cold splash of water.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April immediately wanted to scowl, as if that could chase the thought away.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     What was worse, Jen noticed her smile. Of course she did.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Was that a smile for me?” Jen teased, stopping in her tracks to face April. “Oh, this is a historic moment. Someone call the Washington Post!”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April groaned, already regretting every decision that led her here. “It wasn’t a smile. It was a... facial twitch.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Well then…” Jen takes a breath, “I’ll be looking out for your hmm—“ she begins to imitate air quotes with her fingers “facial twitch.”
    </p>
<p>

     The mere thought that April would be even feeling any type of emotion, let alone feel it towards Jen Barkley of all people; she couldn’t help but egregiously feel nauseous, queasy even. Why do I even feel this way for a woman that I’ve barely known? She ponders, but the truth is, maybe that’s what’s exciting about it. The anticipation, the “not knowing what’s going to come next”, all these little games that April should resent are things that interest her—excite her even.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re horrible.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes I am, dear.”
    </p>

</p>
<p>
     The two things that April had picked up during her weeks at this internship were that:
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     1. These people were just as annoying as April had expected, if not worse.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     2. Jen Barkley had some kind of freakish power to make hours of pointless chatter look like some kind of art, and April didnt know if she was the only one who thought so.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     As the group finally wrapped up, April leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, silently daring anyone to ask her opinion on the riveting discussion they’d just had about funding strategies or whatever boring nonsense they’d been going on about. Oh well, it wasn't like she'd care.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen, of course, was the last to stand, flashing one final dazzling smile at the group as she made her goodbyes. April hated how effortless it looked—like she’d just orchestrated a symphony of fake pleasantries and left everyone wanting more.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     When they finally stepped outside, the cold air hit April like a blessing. She shoved her hands deep into her coat pockets and muttered, “That was hell.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Hell?” Jen asked, feigning shock as she adjusted her scarf. “I thought it went beautifully. You didn't make any sarcastic comments. I’m so proud of you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April shot her a look. “Don’t get used to it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen laughed softly, “I wouldn’t dream of it, sweets.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They started walking again. For once, Jen didn’t immediately launch into some witty quip, and April didn’t bother to fill the silence. It wasn’t a bad silence, though—just… there, like she didn’t have to force anything out of Jen or herself and could just enjoy the unspoken intimacy.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April glanced at Jen out of the corner of her eye, watching as the older woman tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear, her face lit faintly by the glow of the streetlights. She hated how the sight of it made her stomach twist in that now-familiar, irritating way which she felt earlier. She definitely hated this, despised it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Still thinking about your ‘facial twitch,’ Ludgate?” Jen asked suddenly, breaking the quiet with a teasing grin.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April groaned, pulling her hood up over her head like it might shield her from whatever weird spell Jen was casting over her. “Shut up.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You'll have to deal with me,” Jen said lightly, and for some reason, the sentence didn’t sound as annoying as it should have.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     By the time April got home, she let the door slam shut behind her and dropped her bag onto the floor with a heavy thud. Her apartment was quiet—comfortably so, usually—but tonight, it felt off. The silence seemed louder, and it was doing that annoying thing where it gave her too much time to think.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Mostly about Jen. Wait, what?
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Before she could really ponder whatever absurdity that sneaked into her mind, she kicked off her boots and flopped onto the couch, staring at the water stain on the ceiling that kind of looked like a screaming skull. Normally, she’d find that kind of thing comforting. But tonight, her brain wouldn’t shut up about the way Jen had grinned at her when they’d parted ways, tossing out a breezy “Try not to miss me too much, Ludgate,” that April should have hated.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And the worst part? April had let her do that; she'd also let Jen walk alongside her, rambling about how the pigeons in D.C. were "far more sophisticated than the Midwest ones" and throwing out nonsense facts about statues they passed. April had even laughed, like real laughter. She should’ve shoved her into traffic.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Instead of committing homicide, she’d enjoyed the company instead.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “This is ridiculous,” April muttered into the pillow. She hated the fact that Jen was in her head, hated how her voice still rang in her ears, hated—most of all—that she didn’t completely hate it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The silence of the apartment stayed that way, leaving her alone with her thoughts. And for the first time in forever, that wasn’t comforting at all.

<p>
     Jennifer Barkley didn’t obsess over people. That would be ridiculous, absurd, and frankly, beneath her. She liked to keep her world efficient—relationships, conversations, even thoughts, all neatly compartmentalized and moving at the pace she dictated. And yet, somehow, April Ludgate had wormed her way into an irritating corner of her brain, like a splinter she couldn't quite reach.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t that April was difficult to figure out; no, she was relatively transparent in her disdain for most things, but it was the specificity of that disdain that intrigued Jen. April didn’t just dislike things arbitrarily. She evaluated them first, chewed them over, and then decided they weren’t worth her time. And more often than not, April’s judgment fell on Jen herself—though not in the way most people dismissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     April didn’t roll her eyes or sigh because she didn’t get Jen. No, she rolled her eyes because she did, and that was maddening to her. Well, in a fascinating way. Which it really should not be.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer wasn’t accustomed to being someone’s ongoing project of quiet scrutiny. Most people accepted her exterior immediately, which was convenient. But April? April looked at her like she was trying to decide whether Jen was a complex piece of..something (whether or not that was meant in a derogatory way, April didn't really know), or a really expensive scam.
    </p>
<p>
     Honestly, Jen couldn’t entirely blame her.
    </p>
<p>
     There was something satisfying about the way April held her own, never quite folding, even when she was clearly annoyed. It made Jennifer want to push just a little further, see where the edges frayed—if they frayed at all. And maybe that made her sound like a villain in one of those movies April probably pretended to hate but secretly loved, but hey, Jen was willing to embrace the role if it meant keeping things interesting.
    </p>
<p>
     April also made things very interesting. Which was both great and, unfortunately, a little bit dangerous. (Luckily, Jen didn't scare away from danger.)
    </p>
<p>
     Not that Jen would ever say any of this out loud. God, no. If April even suspected Jen found her remotely interesting, she’d probably weaponize it, and Jen couldn’t have that. Someone who thinks she could be superior / and or on equal grounds to her, it would threaten everything about Jen’s perfect image that she’d been building up all these years to show off to the world.
    </p>
<p>
     That was the problem really (or in Jen’s case,
     <strong>
      problems
     </strong>
     .) Jen liked too much about April. The way her voice could be both soft and biting at the same time. The way she always seemed just a little bit unimpressed with the world, as though she was holding out for something—or someone better.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Alright, nevermind, she won't go there. She can't afford to. It's silly that she even thought of the word ‘someone’.
     </em>
</p>
<p>

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Jennifer was currently buried in a mountain of paperwork, each sheet more dull than the last. As the newest assistant to one of the city’s most outspoken (and sometimes eccentric) political figures, she’d quickly learned that her job involved a lot more than just organizing events or making calls. Today, it was a fundraiser for Doug Harris; someone whose name had only recently crossed her radar, and likely wasn’t going to stay there for long. She’d been told to attend, expected to manage the guests, and, of course, handle any disasters that came her way. The usual.
    </p>
<p>
     And while she could technically handle the evening alone, Jen decided that dragging April along would be infinitely more tolerable. After all, if she was going to suffer through an evening of painfully dull small talk, she might as well have some company.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ludgate,” Jen started, setting a folder down with a precise thud. “I need you to come with me to a fundraiser on Thursday.”
    </p>
<p>
     The unanticipated action caused April to get up from her almost permanent slouched position  like she's actually being productive (as if Jen hadn’t caught her like this on the daily) and blinked up at her. “A fundraiser? What, are you trying to make me a part of the system or something?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen smirked, not missing a beat. “It’s for Doug Harris. He’s running for city council, and while I wouldn’t exactly call him ‘exciting,’ I’d still prefer it if I didn’t have to go alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah, I see,” April said, nodding. “You want me to be your emotional support human while you network with a bunch of rich people who pretend to care about community issues.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen met April's gaze for a second, her expression unwavering. “Yeah, that’s pretty much the gist of it. But I also need someone who can keep me company in a room full of people who’ll bore me to death with their small talk. It’s... better that way.”
    </p>
<p>
     April smirked, clearly unimpressed. “That's what I said, your emotional support human.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen let out a short laugh, shaking her head. “Something like that, but you’re the only one I can tolerate for hours on end without wanting to throw myself into the nearest fountain.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nice,” April replied dryly. “You really know how to make a girl feel special.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gave her a pointed look before putting a hand to her shoulder as if she was some sort of
     <em>
      kind-hearted woman
     </em>
     . “You’re not there to be my emotional support, Ludgate. You’re just... the person who’s not going to try to sell me on their latest ‘passion project’ or ask me if I’ve ‘heard of their campaign.’”
    </p>
<p>
     April’s lips twitched into the faintest of smiles, (facial twitch, if you will) eyeing the unfamiliar hand to the right side of her shoulder. “So, I’m your designated wallflower, got it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen raised an eyebrow, her smirk sharpening before clicking her thumb and index finger towards her. “Exactly. My personal wallflower. I thought I was being clear.”
    </p>
<p>
     April tilted her head, her expression deadpan. “Great. Do I get a leash, or are you just going to drag me around by my disdain?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s laugh was short and precise, like everything else about her. “Disdain works fine. It’s practically your brand, anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     They share a quiet but observant moment of silence between each other, as if they were planning ahead for whatever the other had up their sleeve, with their eyes locked onto the opposites, as if time slowed and stopped for them to have these fleeting moments to themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, that's settled then!” Jennifer clicked her tongue, like she’d just closed a deal, and strode out, the sound of her heels echoing down the hallway. The door swung halfway shut behind her, leaving April sitting dumbfounded there in silence.
    </p>
<p>
     She stared at the folder on the table like it might explode if she looked at it too hard. A fundraiser, for Doug Harris, whoever that was. A room full of rich people pretending to care about things while secretly competing over who could eat the smallest canapé.
    </p>
<p>
     April’s lips pressed into a thin line. Normally, she’d blow it off without a second thought, though she didn't know what possessed her to say yes.
    </p>
<p>
     She slumped back in her chair, folding her arms tighter. “Fundraiser,” she muttered under her breath.
     <em>
      Cool. Sounds like a blast. Maybe I’ll wear a garbage bag.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The snow outside was relentless, piling up in soft, annoying heaps that screamed “Hallmark movie,” while inside, the fundraiser buzzed with the kind of energy only rich people could muster when patting themselves on the back. April stood just inside the entrance, her coat still on, staring at the room like it had personally insulted her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” she said flatly, her tone dripping with disdain. “A room full of rich people pretending to care about poor people. This is my heaven.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen, already a step ahead of her, turned just enough to glance back, her perfectly arched eyebrow raised. “Could you not? At least try to look like you don’t want to burn the place down for once.” She scrunched her face up, a very not so subtle sign for April to shut it down. “For me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     April (now defeated) she lets her eyes scan the room, finding a different victim that wasn’t her poor supervisor before zeroing in on a man in the corner, gesturing wildly with a wine glass like he was trying to land a plane. “Let me guess. The big deal tonight is that guy? Tie too tight, hair that says ‘I peaked in college’”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen let out a quiet, almost affectionate sigh, leaning slightly toward her. “Doug Harris. City council candidate, and while I’d rather discuss literally anything else, he’s important tonight. Just keep the nihilism in check, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     April tilted her head. “How much in check are we talking? Like, ‘don’t ask him if he knows his suit makes him look like a game show host,’ or ‘don’t tell him the concept of city councils is a scam for power-hungry PTA moms’?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dial it all the way down to off, Ludgate.” Jen said firmly, adjusting the cuff of her jacket like she was about to close a major deal. “Tonight, you’re
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     wallflower. No commentary necessary.”
    </p>
<p>
     April froze mid-step, turning to look at her. “You're seriously taking the wallflower thing seriously?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen didn’t even break stride. She glanced back, and gave April a quick, small wink.
    </p>
<p>
     April said nothing, just stared as Jen disappeared into the crowd, her mind caught on the word.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Wallflower
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Okay… maybe that was something she had to get used to.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     For a second, she considered just staying put—maybe loitering near the snack table and making sarcastic comments in her head and uncomfortably stare at anyone who tries to make meaningless small talk—but then she caught sight of Jen disappearing deeper into the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     April sighed, shoving her hands into her pockets.
     <em>
      Right. She was supposed to be sticking with her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Great
     </em>
     , she thought to herself, starting after Jen.
     <em>
      Guess I’m also her lost puppy now.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      —
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The entire event was just.. Well, a blur of small talk, polite laughter, and conversations Jen barely registered beyond the key phrases she needed to feign interest. She maneuvered through the room with practiced ease, weaving April in and out of clusters of donors like they were in some idiotic choreographed routine.
    </p>
<p>
     April, for her part, stuck close, occasionally muttering an observation that Jen had to bite her tongue not to laugh at.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is there a factory where they make these people?” April remarked as they passed a trio of men who looked like they shared the same group chat titled
     <em>
      ’How to Dress Like a Politician.’
     </em>
     “Same tie, same haircut, same vacant smiles. It’s like the Stepford Wives, but for dudes who talk about tax reform for fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen glanced back at her, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Careful. If they hear you, they’ll offer you a membership packet.”
    </p>
<p>
     April snorted softly. For a second, Jen almost felt like this fundraiser wasn’t the worst thing she’d ever attended. Almost.
    </p>
<p>
     Without thinking too hard about it—or at least, that’s what she’d tell herself later—Jen reached back. She told herself it was just that she was just trying to keep April moving. Her hand brushed against April’s before slipping fully into place, fingers curling around hers like it was something she’d done a hundred times.
    </p>
<p>
     April froze slightly, boots scuffing the floor as she slowed her pace.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen kept walking, fully aware of what she’d done but refusing to acknowledge it. Instead, she focused on the donor who was now in front of her, nodding like she was deeply invested in their spiel about zoning regulations.
    </p>
<p>
     The donor had been saying something about "community growth" and "historic preservation," words that should have registered as important. But Jen's brain had decided to hyperfocus on the way their hands locked perfectly around each others, the warmth of April’s hand in hers. It was in the middle of December, and it was cold. How could she not? At this point any coherent thought Jen could make went completely haywire, having completely lost track of what absurd idea the donor had and letting her head go into a subspace that was completely new to the woman. She didn’t even fully recognize her own hand having a mind of its own as she caressed the back of her palm in slow circles, as if this was second nature to her.
    </p>
<p>
     On the other hand, April had felt as though the space around her was getting increasingly smaller, noticing how the lights flicker,
     <em>
<strong>
       anything
      </strong>
</em>
     to take her mind off of what is happening currently between the two of them. Her thoughts race back and forth:
     <em>
      does anyone else see what’s going on? Would this not affect Jen’s reputation? How is she being so calm right now?
     </em>
     and the most damning thought that won’t leave her head,
     <em>
      why do I not want to let go?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     All of a sudden Jen’s head was clear again, as if someone whacked away whatever fog was clogging up her head. Instead of directing her attention to the man she was even talking to, it landed on April instead, but instead of being met with her usual deadpanned face looking off somewhere more worthwhile—she found something she couldn’t decipher.
    </p>
<p>
     April’s face was… different, something that Jen couldn’t put her finger on and from what Jen could even piece together, neither could April.
    </p>
<p>
     Swiftly, Jen immediately let go of April’s hand and exchanged goodbyes with the man before walking up to April’s favorite spot of the venue, the snack table.
     <em>
      God, why did I even remember that?
     </em>
     Jen pauses.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She turned around, now fully aware of April walking beside her again, now matching her pace. Out of the corner of her eye, Jen could see the subtle confusion flickering across April’s face, the way her eyebrows furrowed just enough to be noticeable.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen,” April said, finally breaking the tension between the two, her voice quieter than usual, but with a slight twinge of vulnerability that April would have never thought of revealing to anyone. “You plan on telling me what happened back there with me? Or are you just going to run away?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen’s fists immediately curled up into a ball before being loosened instantly, not finding satisfaction of using her own hands to relieve herself of any pent up feelings and folded her arms back, keeping her expression cool, with a smile, as if nothing had happened. “Sorry,” she said, barely paying any attention towards her (as if mere seconds ago the only thing she could focus on was her) “Reflex.”
    </p>
<p>
     April tilted her head, skeptical. “Reflex?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shot her a sharp, almost playful look. “Yes. Reflex. I was trying to keep you from wandering off like a stray cat, sweets.”
    </p>
<p>
     April didn’t say anything for a moment, her gaze lingering on Jen with the kind of scrutiny that made Jen feel like a bug under a very judgmental magnifying glass. April decided right then and there that she wouldn’t push Jen right now,
     <em>
      they do say some things are just better left unspoken.
     </em>
     With the faintest twitch of her lips, she replied, “If I’m a stray cat, you’re one of those people who carries tuna in their designer purse because you’re ‘quirky’ and trying to relate to commoners.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s laugh escaped before she could stop it. “I’ll take that as a compliment,” She shot back, smoothing the lapel of her blazer; the rigidness of that peculiar situation smoothening out too.
    </p>
<p>
     April just tilted her head, unimpressed, and stuffed her hands into her coat pockets as they continued their navigation through the crowd of interchangeable people. Jen wasn’t sure if April’s silence was a blessing or a trap, but she decided not to poke the bear—or, in this case, the stray cat.
    </p>
<p>
     The next hour passed rather quickly, with forced smiles, overly enthusiastic handshakes, and what felt like a TED Talk on zoning laws from a man named Harold who looked like he’d built his personality around golf. Normally, Jen would breeze through these conversations with the precision of a surgeon, but tonight, she kept getting distracted.
    </p>
<p>
     By April.
    </p>
<p>
     April wasn’t even doing anything special—just standing there, radiating her usual air of casual hatred for humanity, occasionally muttering things like, “Why does everyone here smell like expensive soap?” or, “Do you think these people know what fun is, or do they just schedule it in?”
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t until they ended up back at the snack table—as if it was some kind of safe space for them to recollect and reevaluate, that April finally broke through Jen’s defenses.
    </p>
<p>
     April grabbed a toothpick speared with something Jen was sure had been described as “locally sourced artisan charcuterie” and waved it vaguely in her direction. “So, are we done yet, or do I have to keep pretending not to want to set off the sprinklers?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen raised an eyebrow, already reaching for a glass of wine she didn’t particularly want but absolutely needed. “First of all, don’t you dare. This blazer is new. Second, we’re not done until I say we’re done.”
    </p>
<p>
     April popped the snack into her mouth, chewing slowly like she was trying to decide if it was worth the calories. “Cool. Just let me know when you’re ready to leave. I’ll be here, judging everyone’s life choices.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen opened her mouth to retort but stopped when she noticed the faintest ghost of a smile tugging at the corner of April’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she turned back to the crowd, her voice perfectly measured. “Stick close, Ludgate. We’re almost done here.”
    </p>
<p>
     April didn’t respond right away, just stuffed her hands back into her pockets and leaned against the table, her expression unreadable.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen told herself it didn’t matter. This was just another night, another event, another checklist item on her perfectly organized schedule.
    </p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
     It happened so fast that Jennifer didn’t notice at first. She was mid-sentence, charming some retiree with deep pockets and an even deeper love of hearing himself talk, when it happened. Across the room, April was standing by one of those absurdly tall cocktail tables, trying to look like she hadn’t just been cornered by some over-eager wine enthusiast.
    </p>
<p>
     The man, gesturing too wildly for someone holding a glass of merlot, tipped it just enough to send a splash of deep red liquid directly onto April’s blouse.
    </p>
<p>
     April froze, her face shifting from disinterested to something much darker. The man stammered an apology, but April didn’t dignify him with a response. Instead, she grabbed a napkin from the table and dabbed at the stain halfheartedly, muttering something Jennifer couldn’t hear from across the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer only noticed the aftermath when she finally made her way over to April, whose posture was somehow even more slouched than usual. The deep red stain spread across the front of her shirt like a murder scene, and her expression was so flat it could’ve been a death glare—if she hadn’t already emotionally checked out.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the hell happened to you?” Jennifer, now distressed and blinking at the mess.
    </p>
<p>
     April glanced at her, deadpan. “Wine. Some guy thought I’d look better as a Jackson Pollock painting.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer’s eyes darted around the room, as if searching for the person responsible, but April waved her off. “Don’t bother, he already scurried off like a scared rat.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Of course you’re the one who ends up with collateral damage.” Without another word, she shrugged off her blazer and held it out.
    </p>
<p>
     April blinked at the blazer like Jennifer had just handed her a live snake. “I’m not wearing that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I'm not a corporate lawyer from the 1980s.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer exhaled sharply, already losing patience. “It's either this, or you keep walking around looking like a rejected crime scene. Your choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't wait for April’s inevitable smartass reply. Instead, she stepped closer, choosing to take matters into her own hands.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stand still, sweets.” she muttered, her tone sharp enough to cut through April’s usual wall of sarcasm.
    </p>
<p>
     Before April could even protest, Jen unceremoniously tossed the blazer over her shoulders, adjusting it like someone who spent way too much time making sure everything was perfect. Her hands moved quickly, smoothing the fabric down, pulling it over April’s frame in a way that left no room for argument.
    </p>
<p>
     April’s mouth opened, likely to deliver some snide comment, but she stopped as soon as Jen tugged the lapels into place. The taller woman leaned in slightly, her eyes flicking over the wine-stained blouse with something that suspiciously looked like concern.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, all April could do was stand there, letting Jennifer fuss over like she was some wayward intern who’d spilled coffee on herself. It wasn’t the words (or lack thereof) that caught April off guard . It was the small, effortless way Jennifer wrapped the blazer around her, like it wasn’t a $3,000 garment but something she’d just casually toss aside without a second thought.
    </p>
<p>
     “There,” Jennifer said finally, her voice softer but no less authoritative. “Good as new.”
    </p>
<p>
     April glanced down at herself, feeling the weight of the blazer and the faint trace of Jennifer’s perfume clinging to the fabric. It was absurdly warm, annoyingly so. But April couldn’t summon her usual quips.
    </p>
<p>
     April blinked, her usual sharp retort forming, but it stalled the moment her gaze landed on Jennifer. Something was... off. For the first time since she’d known her, Jennifer Barkley wasn’t wearing a blazer.
    </p>
<p>
     It was stupid—completely irrelevant, really—but April couldn’t stop her eyes from lingering. She wasn’t used to seeing Jennifer without that perfectly tailored shield of authority. The crisp white blouse underneath was still obnoxiously perfect, of course, but it felt different,
     <em>
      but she didn't care to name the feeling, not yet, anyway.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Jennifer snapped her fingers in front of April’s face, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. “Did the wine fry your brain, or are you just not used to someone being nice to you?”
    </p>
<p>
     April blinked, scowling instantly to cover the momentary silence. “Nice? This is an act of self-preservation. You’re just trying to stop me from embarrassing you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly,” Jennifer replied smoothly, which was somewhat true. She stepped back and surveyed her work. “Now come on, sweets. Let's leave already.”
    </p>
<p>
     April tugged at the lapels of the blazer, but she didn’t say anything as Jennifer steered her toward the exit, one hand lightly resting on her back.
    </p>
<p>
     For once, she let herself be guided without resistance.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen looked behind her to stop April in her tracks, letting them finally stand face to face alone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ludgate, about what happened back there…”
    </p>
<p>
     April’s eyes immediately shoot right up to meet hers, April was full on ready to pretend like nothing had ever happened for Jen’s sake, but is this really happening?
     <em>
<strong>
       THE
      </strong>
      Jennifer Barkley trying to communicate and resolve a
      <strong>
       PERSONAL
      </strong>
      issue? Now this was news..
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Jennifer couldn’t bear to ignore the strange warmth that stirred in her chest at the sight of April’s expression, the same expression that she couldn’t decipher when holding her hand. She chalked it up to exhaustion—or maybe the second glass of wine she’d downed earlier. Whatever it was, it didn’t matter. It was nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s just… get you home.” immediately dismissing everything that she just said before gesturing April over to her car.
    </p>
<p>
     April, now too tired to argue with her superior anymore, replied back with silence, because of course it meant nothing, to both Jen and her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      But then again, with April, it was always something.
     </em>
     No matter how hard she tried to deny it.

<p>
     Jennifer hadn’t even planned on offering April a ride home—it just happened, like most things did when she was around the younger woman. One minute, she was walking toward her car, and the next, she’d gestured with all the casual confidence of someone assuming the world would fall in line.
    </p>
<p>
     The drive home wasn’t exactly tense, but it wasn’t what anyone would call great either. Jennifer kept her eyes on the road, one hand on the wheel, the other casually draped over the gear shift like she wasn’t thinking at all about the fact that April Ludgate, of all people, was sitting in her passenger seat.
     <em>
      (Seriously, that shouldnt bother her, what? April was her intern.)
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     April, meanwhile, was pressed against the car door like she was trying to create as much space between them as possible, her chin resting on her fist as she stared out the window. The city lights zipped by in streaks of neon, reflecting off the window and playing tricks on her expression—though it was impossible to tell whether the small hint of a smile was real or just another product of the glare.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re quiet,” Jennifer said at last, her voice breaking through the hum of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, you’re observant,” April shot back, her tone flat, though it lacked the usual bite she reserved for unsolicited small talk.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer rolled her eyes but didn’t press. She was good at reading rooms, even cramped ones like this car, and April clearly wasn’t in the mood for conversation. Fine. She could handle the silence.
     <em>
      She was great at silence.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Except... she wasn’t. Not tonight. Not with April sitting there, half-drowning in her oversized blazer like it wasn’t ridiculously expensive and not designed to hang off her like that. It shouldn’t have been noteworthy—it was just a jacket. But something about it made Jennifer’s gaze flick over a little too often, catching the way April fidgeted or tugged at the lapels as though she wasn’t quite sure what to do with it. Or herself.
    </p>
<p>
     It was—what was the word? Interesting. Yes, that’s all it was. Jennifer nodded to herself. April was interesting. The kind of person who could maybe make a decent friend.
     <em>
      (Which was also an interesting thought..)
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     April, meanwhile, let her eyes wander from the cityscape to the reflection of Jennifer’s hands on the wheel—steady and annoyingly elegant. She frowned at the thought and immediately filed it away under
     <em>
      “Things That Don’t Matter.”
     </em>
     But still... Jennifer wasn’t as unbearable as she seemed at first. Sure, she was bossy, kind of smug, and always talking like she was the star of her own made-for-TV drama, but there was... something.
    </p>
<p>
     No. It was nothing. Jennifer was just—ugh, fine—a good person (well,
     <em>
      a little
     </em>
     ). Deep, deep down. April huffed, more at herself than anything, and shifted in her seat. She wasn’t going to dwell on it. Jennifer Barkley was the kind of person who could make a good friend.
    </p>
<p>
     The city lights flickered in and out, casting shadows across two people pretending they weren’t figuring out what to do with this unfamiliar, inconvenient warmth in their chests.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      It's just friendly.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
     It was the 23rd of December.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer stood at the airport gate, watching her mother and her latest husband—who, for the record, was 19 years old—exchange an overly enthusiastic farewell. Her mom was practically glowing, arms wrapped around him like he was her first love, while Jennifer, as usual, was just there to wave them off like a dutiful, emotionally detached daughter. It was fine, really. They’d been doing this for years—her mom off to some new exotic destination with a guy who probably couldn't even pronounce half the places they were visiting, and Jennifer, well, Jennifer was still stuck in D.C. taking care of everything that mattered. She wasn’t bitter, though. Not at all. She smiled as they hugged it out for the third time, wished them a nice flight, and watched them walk away. Classic family stuff.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer turned away from the gate, already gearing up for a quick escape from this overly sentimental Hallmark scene her mom had crafted, when a familiar shape caught her eye. Sitting in one of those uncomfortable airport chairs near the world’s saddest coffee kiosk was April, looking like she’d been sentenced to solitary confinement, and her expression screamed, This airport is the ninth circle of hell. Had she been placed into the inferno by Satan himself?
    </p>
<p>
     For a second, Jen debated just walking past. It wasn’t like they were close or anything, and she’d already hit her socializing quota for the day with her mom and her child groom of a husband. But something stopped her, some tiny spark of curiosity—or maybe it was the fact that April looked genuinely miserable, and that wasn’t something she saw every day, no matter how much it humoured her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ludgate?” Jen spoke aloud, her voice cutting through the chaos of boarding calls and crying babies.
    </p>
<p>
     April glanced up hearing the voice she knew all too well, turning her head from the left to the right, her eyes searching and scattering until she narrowed down the source.
     <em>
      Shit..
     </em>
     she uttered. She was debating whether to even acknowledge her. “Oh, great. Just when I thought this day couldn’t get worse.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen smirked, taking a step closer. “Merry Christmas to you too. What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be on a flight to... wherever it is your family does?”
    </p>
<p>
     April let out a dramatic sigh and slumped further into her seat. “Flight got canceled. Thanks to this stupid snowstorm, I’m stuck here with nothing but overpriced coffee and the faint hope that a giant snow plow will just take me out and end my suffering.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen raised an eyebrow and glanced out the window, where snow was coming down in thick, relentless sheets. “Well, that’s festive.”
    </p>
<p>
     April shot her a look. “Yeah, super festive. Nothing says Christmas like being trapped in an airport with a bunch of strangers pretending not to hate each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen tilted her head, studying her for a moment. There was something unusually subdued about April tonight—not her usual biting sarcasm, but something quieter, almost resigned. It wasn’t sad, exactly, but it was close enough to catch Jen off guard.
    </p>
<p>
     She gestured her non-dominant hand vaguely toward the window, an incoherent flick that would’ve looked foolish and idiotic on everyone, but not Jen. She made it look calculated, like she had everything planned out and a backup for whatever else was headed her way. “My place isn’t far from here, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     April blinked, sure, she was a little too infatuated with such a simple move, but that didn’t mean she could be still unimpressed. “Cool. Want a medal for being good at geography?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer tilted her head, studying April for a moment. She wasn’t used to seeing her like this—slumped in her seat, almost defeated, the sharp edges of her usual sarcasm dulled by exhaustion or boredom or… whatever. It wasn’t sad exactly, but it was definitely something..
    </p>
<p>
     “You want a ride to my place?” she offered, keeping her voice casual, like she hadn’t just surprised herself by saying it. “It’s close, and, I mean, unless you’re really enjoying sitting here with the human equivalent of a lukewarm latte.” She motioned vaguely at the sad coffee kiosk.
    </p>
<p>
     April’s eyes fluttered, her eyebrows furrowing. “What? Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gave her an exaggerated shrug, trying to mask the weird build up of tension in her chest. “Because it’s snowing, because flights aren’t happening, because I’m feeling, like, this much festive spirit, apparently.” She held up her fingers an inch apart. “Take it or leave it, Ludgate.”
    </p>
<p>
     April tilted her head, her eyes narrowing like she was trying to find the catch. “This feels like a setup. What’s the endgame here? You make me watch some weird Scandinavian Christmas special and bond over eggnog?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen smirked, hands slipping into her coat pockets as she shifted her weight onto one foot. “No eggnog. No bonding. Just a couch, a heater, and maybe a bottle of wine. Unless you’d rather keep marinating in here.”
    </p>
<p>
     April huffed and stood up from her seat, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “If this turns into some weird Christmas miracle thing where you make me feel a weird jolly epiphany, I’m walking back here in the snow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Noted,” Jen replied smoothly, already turning toward the exit.
    </p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Jennifer’s sleek car slid into the driveway of her absurdly modern, very
     <em>
      “I-own-a-ski-lodge-in-Aspen
     </em>
     ” mansion, April had developed a new hatred for Christmas music. Somewhere along the drive, a jazzy rendition of “Jingle Bells” came on, and now it was permanently etched into her brain like a personal attack.
    </p>
<p>
     When they stepped out, the snow had piled up high enough to bury someone’s will to live. April stood for a moment, looking at the house in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You live here?” she asked, voice flat. “This is the kind of place where someone gets murdered in the first ten minutes of a Netflix thriller.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer locked the car with a flick of her wrist, already heading for the door. “Thanks, sweets. I’ll be sure to print that on the holiday cards next year.”
    </p>
<p>
     Inside, Jennifer’s house was everything April had expected: wildly expensive, and so devoid of personality it could have been a showroom. The kind of place where even the throw pillows looked like they came with a security deposit.
    </p>
<p>
     April stood just inside the door, surveying the open floor plan and glass walls with her arms crossed. “This is your house? You live here?
     <em>
      Willingly
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer rolled her eyes as she kicked off her heels, placing them neatly by the door like someone might come and grade her on it. “I’ll have you know, I paid an absurd amount of money for this ‘aesthetic.’ Try not to ruin it with your... attitude.”
    </p>
<p>
     April let out a snort, dropping her bag onto the couch with zero regard for its designer origins. “Yeah, this place just screams ‘lived-in.’ It’s like a museum exhibit for people who’ve never felt joy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer ignored the jab, heading into the kitchen and returning a minute later with a bottle of wine and two glasses. Walking over to April, she questions her. “Red or white? Actually, don’t answer that. You’re drinking red.” She places the bottle of wine with the two glasses onto the coffee table, already expecting a snappy reaction from the other woman already loitering on her couch.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she was met with a brief moment of silence.
    </p>
<p>
     April raised an eyebrow but didn’t argue as Jennifer poured the wine and handed her a glass. “What, no hand-knit stockings on the mantle? Where’s your Christmas spirit?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer smirked, taking a sip of her wine as she sat down on the farthest end of the couch. “My Christmas spirit is currently snowed in at the airport with the rest of humanity. Now, shut up and pick a movie before I make you watch an eight-part documentary on Nordic design.”
    </p>
<p>
     April rolled her eyes but grabbed the remote anyway, scrolling through Jennifer’s aggressively curated streaming library. Everything was either too pretentious or too depressing, so she settled on a random christmas movie.
    </p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
     The movie was background noise, the kind you didn’t even notice unless you tried too hard to ignore it. April didn’t seem interested in the painfully predictable plot—some couple saving a Christmas tree farm or whatever—and Jennifer couldn’t blame her. Her own gaze had drifted more than once to the way April had curled into the corner of the couch, her legs tucked up beneath her like she was trying to make herself as small as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     April had her glass of wine perched on the armrest, untouched for the last fifteen minutes. Her eyes flicked toward the screen every so often, but Jennifer could tell she wasn’t really watching. Instead, her fingers absentmindedly played with the edge of the throw pillow in her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer sighed, setting her wine glass down with a soft clink. Subtlety wasn’t her strong suit, and frankly, it was exhausting. “Ludgate,” she said, turning to face her fully.
    </p>
<p>
     April glanced at her without moving her head, her expression halfway between intrigued and suspicious. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer rested her elbow on the back of the couch, her hand propping up her head as she tilted it to study April. “Do you wanna spend Christmas here with me?"
    </p>
<p>
     April blinked, visibly caught off guard. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You heard me.” Jennifer waved a hand toward the snowy window as if to say,
     <em>
      Look outside, genius.
     </em>
     “Your flight is canceled, it’s a blizzard out there, and let’s be honest—do you really want to go back to the airport and fight a hundred angry parents for a spot at Cinnabon?”
    </p>
<p>
     April gave her a look, skepticism dripping from her voice. “You’re seriously asking me to spend Christmas with you? Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer shrugged, leaning back against the couch and pretending she wasn’t hyper aware of how close they were sitting. “Because I can’t imagine anyone else who would willingly endure my terrible taste in wine and overwhelming charm. And—” She hesitated for a fraction of a second, then added, “I don't wanna spend the holidays with people who make me wanna claw my eyes out."
    </p>
<p>
     April stared at Jennifer, her mouth opening slightly like she was about to shoot back some sarcastic quip, but nothing came out. For a moment, she just blinked, like her brain was buffering.
    </p>
<p>
     And there it was.
     <em>
      That stupid, inconvenient warmth in April’s chest she had felt a few days before
     </em>
     , creeping in uninvited. She actually hated it. Hated that it made her feel like a person who might actually care about someone else’s motives. Hated that it made Jennifer Barkley, of all people, seem less like the embodiment of a snarky political machine and more like someone who wasn’t completely awful.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow,” April finally said, her voice carefully flat. “That’s the saddest pitch for company I’ve ever heard. You want me to stay here so you don’t have to sit in your cold, soulless mansion by yourself?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer’s smirk faltered, just for a second—so brief it could have been mistaken for a trick of the dim lighting. Of course, April wasn’t going to make this easy. Jennifer didn’t know why she’d expected anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned back into the couch, taking a deliberate sip of her wine to cover the faint flicker of disappointment. Not that it mattered. She was Jennifer Barkley, and disappointment wasn’t in her vocabulary. At least, that’s what she told herself.
    </p>
<p>
     April hesitated for a moment, her fingers still absently tugging at the pillow, but Jennifer's nonchalant shrug, the way she tried so hard to act like she wasn’t bothered, made something in April shift. It wasn’t guilt—she didn’t do guilt.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced at Jennifer, who was now expertly pretending not to care about anything, but April could see the small trace of disappointment still hanging in the air, thick like fog.
    </p>
<p>
     “I'd like that though,” April muttered, quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer’s lips curled into a satisfied smirk, like she had finally got a point into their unspoken games, but there was a softness to her eyes now. She hadn't expected April to respond with no rude or snarky remark attached to it. Instead of pestering her about it, she decides to leave it be, at least for now.
    </p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
     After some time of talking, Jennifer had slipped out a few minutes earlier, mumbling something about the house being “a literal glacier” as she disappeared down the hall. April, cocooned in her corner of the couch, had rolled her eyes and vowed—
     <em>
      vowed
     </em>
     —she wouldn’t fall asleep. It wasn’t like she trusted Jennifer to come back with anything better than some overpriced cashmere throw that probably cost more than April’s first car.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, the movie droned on in the background, a swirl of saccharine Christmas tropes and soft holiday jingles. April had told herself she was just closing her eyes for a second. She was resting, not sleeping.
    </p>
<p>
     And yet.
    </p>
<p>
     When Jennifer returned, a bundle of actual, practical blankets in her arms (surprising, really), she stopped in her tracks. April was slumped in the corner, her head tipped back against the couch cushion and her legs tucked under her. Her arms were loosely crossed like she was still pretending to be unimpressed with everything, but her breathing was steady, her features softer than Jennifer had ever seen them, her nose not as scrunched, neither her brows—not as furrowed as they typically are.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jennifer paused, tilting her head slightly as she took in the sight.
     <em>
      Of course
     </em>
     . April had fallen asleep during the most painfully cheesy movie on Jennifer’s meticulously curated streaming list.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, this is adorable,” Jennifer murmured to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, she unfolded one of the blankets and stepped closer, draping it over April, making sure that it wouldn’t disrupt April’s sleep. Despite all the complaints that she would get from her coworkers regarding April, she had known how hardworking she was, even though if she ever told her that she’d be greeted with an immediate death threat. The world gradually felt like it was slowing around her, as if it was finally letting her breathe with the thoughts she didn’t dare to say aloud. That wasn’t until April shifted slightly, her head turning just enough that a strand of hair fell into her face. Jennifer hesitated for what it felt like forever instead of half a second before brushing it away, her fingers lingering for the barest moment as if she was testing her own patience.
    </p>
<p>
     “There,” Jennifer said quietly, more to herself than anyone. She tucked the blanket around April’s shoulders with surprising gentleness, making sure it covered her completely. “Now you look like you were born to hate this holiday.”
    </p>
<p>
     April let out a soft sigh in her sleep, shifting just enough to curl further into the blanket. Jennifer froze, briefly wondering if she’d wake up and throw a sarcastic comment her way, but April stayed asleep, her expression blissfully neutral.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen sat back down on her end of the couch, pulling her own blanket over her legs. She glanced at April, then at the screen, then back at April.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      I should charge you rent..but then again, I did ask you to stay,
     </em>
     she thought, though the smirk on her face softened almost immediately. She shook her head, reaching for her wine glass.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer took a sip, eyes flicking back to April once more. She tried to focus on the movie, but her gaze drifted back to April again, and she sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer leaned back into the couch, her wine glass dangling from her fingers as she glanced at April again. It wasn’t like she was catching feelings or whatever (that was absurd)—Jennifer Barkley didn’t
     <em>
      do feelings
     </em>
     —but there was something about April passed out on her couch, wrapped in a blanket like some idiot, that made her chest feel weirdly... tight.
     <em>
      Probably indigestion. Or the wine.
     </em>
     Definitely not the way April looked kind of peaceful for once. Jen shook her head, forcing her gaze back to the screen.
     <em>
      Whatever
     </em>
     . She was fine, normal. If anything, this was just proof that even Jennifer Barkley had a soft spot for her intern, who fell asleep on her couch. That was all. Nothing else.
