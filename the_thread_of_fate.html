      Chapter 1: Rio
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio sat at her kitchen counter sipping a mug of coffee and looking at the flat she had chosen in England; Cambridge to be exact. The place she would be moving to in six months time to begin her PhD. She was loath to be moving from the house that she owned in Virginia to a rent controlled apartment that would inevitably be a money vacuum, but it was a sacrifice she needed to make if she wanted to re-enter the world of academia this September. Her lease didn’t start for another 3 months which gave her time to pack as much of her life as she could possibly need, to move to another country for at least three years. She had chosen a spacious two-bedroom flat in Eddington, just a five minute drive from the university. Though it had only just occurred to her that she wouldn't actually have her car with her. <em>‘Damn it,’</em> she thought. <em>‘I guess walking won’t kill me.’</em> <br/><br/>Her place at Cambridge university was secured and her accommodation was waiting for her, the only thing she needed to sort out now was her PhD supervisor. Was she cutting it incredibly fine by waiting this long to email prospective supervisors? Absolutely. Did she care? Absolutely not. She had confidence in her academic CV to grab the attention of the people she had chosen to email.</p><p>With her emails already written and saved as drafts, she set her alarm for 2:45am to make sure she was able to send them at exactly 8am UK time. She had two supervisors in mind, both specialising in ancient history, and tried to tailor the two separate emails to them specifically. The research topic she had chosen was ancient Greece – specifically the portrayal of ancient Greece in modern media – and she hoped it would appeal to them.<br/><br/>The first email was sent to Wanda Maximoff, a senior lecturer who had coached many PhD students to a pass. Her reputation spoke for itself, as did the past students Rio had spoken to on various message boards whilst making her choice on which university she was going to attend. She would be in extremely good hands if Wanda agreed to be her supervisor. <br/>But her second email was sent to her first choice, Professor Agatha Harkness. Agatha’s name had been the first to come up when Rio had googled Cambridge university and, throughout her research on the various lecturers and professors that worked there, her searches had always found a way back to Agatha. <br/>She had a reputation much like Wanda’s. Plenty of PhD students under her belt with an incredibly high pass rate. In fact, Rio couldn’t find any suggestion that any of Agatha’s students had failed. Though she believed that there was no way not a single student had failed, this had intrigued her. </p><p>The message boards had confirmed that Agatha’s PhD students always left with a pass. Some people joked that her title should be changed from Professor Harkness to Professional Ball-breaker as she also had a reputation for taking no nonsense and pushing her students a little too far to achieve the results she believed they should be getting. This didn’t phase Rio though, she was confident that she could take whatever Agatha threw at her. She wasn’t one to break easily and didn’t back down from a challenge. If anything, she thrived when people pushed her, applied pressure and raised the stakes. Yes she was happy with her choices for supervisors and now just had to hope they’d choose her. </p><p>Rio paced around her house for the next half an hour, not wanting to go straight back to bed after sending the emails and risk missing a reply, but she could feel her tiredness winning her over. She was about to shut her laptop down and go back to sleep when her email notification pinged. She clicked it as quickly as she could and read the response: </p><p><b>Dear Miss Vidal,</b> <b><br/></b></p><p><b>I thank you for expressing your interest in my being your supervisor for your PhD. I would like to request a meeting with you in person on the 15th of September at 11:30am in my office to discuss the matter further. I look forward to meeting you.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Sincerely </b> <b><br/></b> <b>Professor Harkness</b></p><p>Rio’s heart was pounding, maybe she wasn’t as confident as she originally thought. But Agatha Harkness had asked for a meeting so she was definitely happy. She sent a reply expressing her gratitude and agreeing to the meeting. She waited for another fifteen minutes in case Wanda replied to her as well but when she didn’t receive one, she decided to go to bed. The slight excitement made it so that drifting off posed a challenge but she eventually managed a restful night's sleep.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p><br/>The following three months were spent surrounded by her family helping her pack her life into as few cases as possible. Her parents flew out with her, taking some of her luggage as their own so that she didn’t have to do multiple trips, and spend a silly amount of money, in order to get all of her things into her flat. <br/>“You did a good job picking this place, kiddo.” Her father said as he moved from room to room taking it all in. “Thanks dad, I learned from the best.” Rio said with a chuckle. <br/>“Damn right you did!” He popped his head around a door frame with a smug smile on his face. </p><p>“Yes you definitely inherited your fathers expensive tastes, mija.” Her mother stood grinning at the two of them, “it’s going to be a change going from your house to an apartment though, and no car. Are you sure you’re going to be alright?” Rio had heard her mothers concerns many times since she told her parents that she’d be moving to England. She knew her mom was proud of her and supportive of all of her choices, but she was a natural born worrier and couldn’t help showing it. “I’ll be fine mom, I’ve thought it all through.” Rio said, her voice calm. <br/>“And she’s got her old man’s smarts.” Her dad added as he walked to his wife’s side. <br/>“That doesn't fill me with the confidence you think it does.” Her mom replied jokingly.</p><p>They spent the next few days getting Rio’s things unpacked and in some semblance of order. The flat was already partially furnished so there wasn’t much that Rio needed to source on her own, but they did have the foresight to order some things to the apartment building such as: a TV, some flat-packed furniture and some pots and pans to get her started. <br/>When her parents were satisfied that they’d moved her in well enough, they said their goodbyes – a teary one on her mothers end – and headed off back to the States. </p><p>Rio now had the next three months to get her bearings around the area. Finding the good bars, the best places to get food and familiarising herself with the walk to and from the uni. Her meeting with Agatha was always in the back of her mind attached to a small shred of uncertainty. What if she rejects her? Would she still be able to try and appeal to Wanda? Why did Wanda not reply to her email? This wasn’t normal for her, she didn’t usually panic about things. She was always so controlled and collected, but then again this was a pretty big thing. </p><p>In what felt like the blink of an eye, the start of the semester rolled around. Rio decided to attend some of the freshers week events to get her bearings around the university campus and maybe start making some friends. She was on her own here after all, having some people she enjoyed spending time with wouldn’t be a bad thing. She went to some of the introduction events for the ancient history courses hoping to meet some like-minded undergraduates, and they didn’t disappoint. Rio didn’t consider herself a ‘social butterfly’ by any stretch of the imagination, but if she could find common ground with someone, that was enough of a start. <br/><br/>A boy with bouncy, dark hair approached her and offered his hand. “Hi I’m Billy,” he enthusiastically said. “Are you studying ancient history too?” <br/>Rio shook his hand. “Nice to meet you, I’m Rio, and I’m here to get my PhD but I figured it couldn’t hurt to check out the department and meet some people.” She gave him a small smile. He was wearing a pair of black, ripped jeans, a knitted jumper and a dark hoodie. His style reminded her of her own at his age and the fond memories came back to her. The freedom she felt when she first painted her nails black and shaved the slit in her eyebrow, her parents encouraging smiles and words of encouragement. <em> “You look great, mija. It really suits you!” </em> </p><p>Billy gestured over his shoulder, “my friend Alice is over there, we’re kind of on our own at the moment, but if you’re wanting to expand your social circle you’re more than welcome to spend the day with us.” His smile was so genuine that Rio couldn’t resist following him over to Alice. Her main colour scheme was red and black, even in her hair. She wore a leather jacket and big black boots. “I’m glad to see that the goth and emo looks are coming back in. It’s really validating for my younger self.” Rio said with a small chuckle and extended her hand towards Alice. “I’m Rio, nice to meet you.” Alice accepted her hand shake and introduced herself in turn and, just like that, Rio had found some people that she could see herself spending some more time with. </p><p>The three of them spent the day touring the department and ended it in the campus bar. “You undergrads don’t know how good you’ve got it, you know.” Rio said, starting her second pint. “You won’t find alcohol this cheap anywhere else.”<br/>“Is that why you’re doing your PhD? Because paying adult prices for beer was too much for you?” Alice asked with a smirk. <br/>Rio snorted. “Yes, exactly. I’m paying north of $30,000 a year so that I can have cheaper beer. It’s a decent trade if you think about it.” The three of them laughed, another round was bought in and the conversation flowed. </p><p>Rio was happy with how easy it had been to connect with these two – even if they were teenagers. But then again, when she was doing her masters, she found herself spending more time with the undergrads than she did her fellow masters students. She liked the idea of being able to help them the way the post-graduate students had done for her. Paying it forward, as it were. <br/>Billy’s voice brought her out of her thoughts. “So since you’re getting your PhD, does that mean we can give our coursework to you?” <br/>Alice nudged him playfully. “He means to read it over before we submit it, not write it for us. He wouldn’t dream of being that cheeky, right Billy?” Billy just shrugged with a lopsided smile and Rio laughed. “I guess I could proofread your work. Not for free though.” She gave a show of pretending to think, “I’ll take payment in the form of alcohol.” <br/>Alice smiled, “I’m sure we can arrange that.” </p><p>Over the course of the week Rio, Billy and Alice met up for drinks a few more times and then Monday the 15th of September arrived. Rio’s meeting with Agatha was today. She had taken the liberty to check Agatha’s lecture schedule and decided to attend her first lecture of the semester to get a feel for her style of teaching. <br/>That morning Rio found herself agonising over what clothes to wear, it felt juvenile. She wanted to make a good impression on Agatha but also didn’t want to appear like she was trying too hard – and her limited outfit choices weren’t helping. After what felt like hours, she finally decided on a plain, white shirt, black jeans and a dark-green leather jacket, finishing by throwing on her cleanest pair of Converse and headed to the university. </p><p>She found herself a seat in the back corner of the lecture hall and Alice and Billy settled in next to her. “I didn’t think PhD students needed to attend lectures.” Billy said, giving her a confused look.<br/>“Oh we don’t, but I have a meeting with Professor Harkness today about her being my supervisor so I thought I’d sit in.” <br/>“Agatha Harkness is your supervisor?” Alice asked, her eyes widening. “You’re a brave woman.” <br/>Rio was about to respond when a woman strode into the room, closing the door behind her. All she did was walk towards the desk in the centre of the room, but she had the attention of every single person in there. Rio recognised her from her picture, this was Professor Agatha Harkness. </p><p>When Agatha spoke her voice was low and controlled, echoing around the hall. She had a transatlantic accent which made her very easy to listen to. “Welcome to your first lecture of the semester. I am Professor Harkness and you will address me as such.” She adjusted the cuff on her blazer before speaking again. “You will be expected to turn in a 3,500 word essay at the end of each semester and the word count is non-negotiable. You will lose ten percent for every hundred words you come under, but you will not get any extra for going over. I don’t like teachers' pets.” Her gaze swept over the crowd of wide-eyed, baby-faced first year students before her, and Rio swore Agatha’s eyes lingered in her direction for a fraction of a second longer than they did anywhere else. “Does everyone understand?” The question was met with a quiet murmur of agreement and Agatha moved around the desk to the laptop in the centre of it. “Excellent. Let’s begin.” The lights dimmed and the projector came to life as she fired up the PowerPoint. </p><p>The lecture was much like all of the other introductory lectures Rio had sat through in her academic career. An outline of the module and the things that would be covered – each semester would cover either Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome or Ancient Egypt – and a reiteration of the coursework that was expected. Even when talking about such mundane things, Agatha commanded the room. Everyone’s eyes were on her, taking in every word she spoke like they were the most important words they’d ever hear. Rio suddenly understood why Agatha had such a good pass record, you couldn’t help but listen to her and let every word sink in. </p><p>The rest of the lecture was an introduction to Ancient Greece, covering the main twelve Olympian gods and some of their more notable children. “As we all know, Disney’s Hercules is the most accurate re-telling of the story.“ Agatha said as a still from the movie was projected on the screen. A chuckle made its way around the room from the students, “but something that people don’t know too much about is that Heracles – the Greek pronunciation – was originally given the name Alcides by his parents.” She let the statement sit and watched the students scribble the information down before she continued. “It was only later that he became known as Heracles as a way to honour Hera, the Queen of the gods.” <br/>Rio couldn’t help the way that she scoffed, it was almost like she didn’t have control over it. She knew the statement was incorrect and thought, <em>‘well that’s not true.’</em> <br/>It was only when she noticed everyone’s eyes trained on her that she realised she’d said it out loud. She looked at Billy and Alice who were staring at her wide eyed, mouths slightly open in surprise, like they couldn’t believe that she’d dared speak when Professor Harkness was teaching – never mind had the gaul to tell her that she was incorrect. <em>‘Fuck</em>. She thought. <em>What a great first impression.’</em></p><p>The silence in the room was heavy before Agatha filled it. “I sense somebody disagrees with me.” She levelled her gaze directly at Rio. “Don't be shy, speak your mind.”<br/>Rio shuffled in her seat, changing her slouched position to a straight one, and cleared her throat. “Well you said that Heracles’ name was changed to honour Hera.” She paused, choosing her words carefully and Agatha gestured at her to continue. “But he was renamed Heracles in an unsuccessful attempt to mollify Hera, with Heracles meaning Hera's ‘pride’ or ‘glory.’” Rio looked around, uncomfortably aware that Agatha hadn’t stopped looking at her. She hadn’t even blinked. But Rio swore that, even from this distance, she could see a faint look of amusement cross Agatha’s face. “What is your name please?” <br/><em> ‘Absolutely fantastic. I haven't even had my meeting with her yet and she already has a negative opinion of me. Well done, Rio.’ </em> <em> <br/></em>“Rio Vidal.” </p><p>Agatha picked up a piece of paper from the desk and studied it for a second. “Miss Vidal, I don't recall seeing your name on the list of students taking this module.” <br/>“I'm here to get my PhD and thought this module would be a good one to sit in on.” Rio spoke before she could overthink, although thinking in any capacity would really benefit her right now. <br/>Agatha hummed quietly in acknowledgment and went back to teaching, flicking the PowerPoint to the next slide. Rio’s face burned with embarrassment as the words “This is not true!” were shining bright for everyone to see. “Well the surprise of this slide has been ruined, but the point remains the same. There are many different ways that Greek myths are told and portrayed, all we can do is find the consistencies between them and hold those in higher regard.”</p><p>The rest of the lecture passed without incident and Rio practically ran out of the room when it ended. She didn’t dare spare a glance in Agatha’s direction and waited for Billy and Alice to catch up. “Well you’re brave, I’ll give you that.” Billy said. <br/>Rio snorted, “stupid is what I am. I never could keep my mouth shut.” She looked between Alice and Billy before saying, “come on, I need a coffee.” She had half an hour before she had to be face-to-face with Agatha and, no doubt, pay for what she’d just done. Alcohol was her instinct, but coffee was the better choice. “You’re gonna have fun with Agatha as your supervisor after that stellar first impression.” Alice joked, “although Billy is grateful that you took some of the heat off of him.” She finished as she playfully nudged him but Billy just levelled her with a glare. Rio raised her eyebrow in intrigue but didn’t press for more information, she checked the time and decided it was time to go face her fate. “It’s been fun kids but I have to go. I’ll see you on the other side.” She gave them a mock salute before heading off in the direction of Agatha’s office.</p><p>Rio had never found a door intimidating before, but no other door had ‘Professor Harkness’ written on a plaque attached to it. She checked the time, 11:30 exactly, took a deep breath and knocked on the door. A few seconds passed before “you may enter” was heard from the other side. Rio did as instructed and entered the room. The office was smaller than she was expecting, the far wall was lined with bookcases which were full – possibly dangerously so with the way the books were stacked – the other walls were bare save for an A3 canvas of a forest bathed in moonlight hanging above a desk that was tucked into the corner. Agatha sat at the desk, a pair of glasses perched on her nose, typing on a laptop. Without looking up she said, “please, take a seat.” In the centre of the room were two arm chairs with a coffee table between them, Rio took off her bag and uncomfortably perched on one of them. </p><p>It felt like an hour passed before Agatha spoke again. “Miss Vidal, wonderful to finally meet you.” She still didn’t look up from her laptop. Rio tried to respond but the words got stuck, she tried to disguise it as clearing her throat. “It’s wonderful to finally meet you as well, Professor Harkness.” She saw the corners of Agatha’s mouth lift slightly and realised that she definitely hadn’t been able to disguise it as clearing her throat. “There’s no need to be nervous Miss Vidal, you’ve already challenged me in a lecture. This meeting should be easy for you.” Agatha’s eyes flicked up and briefly met hers before returning to the laptop screen. Rio felt the heat creeping into her cheeks. <em> ‘Amazing first impression acquired.’ </em> She thought. “Yeah, I jumped the gun on that one. I apologise, Professor.” <br/>“No need to apologise. It’s nice to know at least one person in that class has prior knowledge of the subject being discussed. I just ask that, if you’re going to challenge me, you have the confidence to do so immediately and don’t need it coaxing out of you.” She gave another brief look in Rio’s direction. “I have to ask, why did you wait until six months before starting your PhD to inquire about me being your supervisor?” <br/>“I figured you'd have lots of requests to sift through so I decided to wait on the off chance you'd be able to give my inquiry your full attention.” Agatha had asked for confidence and Rio was going to show it. </p><p>She was focussed on Agatha, searching for any signs of approval but she was still looking at her laptop. “What subject do you have in mind for your thesis?” The question took Rio by surprise. Her email to Agatha had included the details about her thesis, surely she wouldn’t have requested an in person meeting if she hadn’t read the full email. But she answered anyway. “The portrayal of Greek Mythology in modern media.” </p><p>Agatha hummed in thought, still not giving Rio her full attention. “Not the strongest of titles.” Rio was about to respond when she spoke again, “and why should I be interested in being your supervisor?” <br/><em> ‘Is she being fucking serious?’ </em> “Because you specialise in Ancient Greece.” Rio stated as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “I did my research, you're the most wanted PhD supervisor in the field.” She was starting to get annoyed, what gave Agatha the right to speak to people like that? “Hmm. So you googled me.” There was no inflection of a question, it was an observation. Rio was trying her best to keep it together. “I googled the university and you came up.” But the fact that Agatha had barely bothered to look at her since she walked into the room was grating on her. “Are you going to pay any attention to me during this meeting, or is your laptop more interesting?” <br/>Agatha’s gaze remained trained on her laptop but her eyebrow lifted slightly. “When you give me something to devote my full attention to, Miss Vidal, you shall have it.” </p><p>Rio’s resolve snapped. She would not be spoken to in this manner and she was going to make Agatha regret asking for confidence. “So you don't deem me asking you specifically to be my supervisor worth your time? I came to this university for your reputation, for <em> you </em>. But you know what? I'm good actually, I always have a backup plan. I also emailed Ms. Maximoff about being my supervisor and she was rather enthusiastic about the idea. She also seems like someone who can actually be bothered to drag herself away from her laptop for two seconds to have a conversation with me.” She wasn’t sure why she’d lied about getting a response from Wanda as it was sure to come back and bite her in the arse in about thirty seconds, but the look on Agatha’s face was worth it. She was finally looking at Rio, her attention wasn’t anywhere else. There was definitely surprise in her look and something else that Rio couldn’t currently place. Was it anger? Hurt? Or just incredulity at her sudden outburst? Either way she felt pride swell in her chest. </p><p>Agatha removed her glasses, definitely uncomfortable in the tension Rio’s words had created. “I really thought it would take you longer to break than that. You don't seem that,” she gestured lazily, “easily flustered.” <em> ‘She’s trying to get control back.’ </em> Rio thought. But before she could respond, Agatha continued. “But I have to admit, the passion you just showed is intriguing. Bring me your proposal on Wednesday, I'll give it a look over and make my decision.” <br/>Rio was stunned. What had just happened? How had she had two opportunities to make a good impression on Agatha, fucked both of them, and still managed to come out with a win? Agatha’s voice shook her from her thoughts. “This is where you agree, thank me and leave.”</p><p>“I- Yes I'll bring my proposal to you, thank you.” Her brain had switched off and she was on autopilot as she made her way to the door. “Miss Vidal?” Agatha called after her. She stopped and looked over her shoulder. “Try not to get so easily wound up in future, or this will not work out.” Agatha put her glasses back on and turned her attention back to her laptop as if she had never moved in the first place, and Rio left the office.</p><p>The door clicked shut behind her and she leaned against it, sighing heavily. “How the fuck am I going to survive this?” She checked the time, 12pm. Had it really only been half an hour? It felt like years. Was it too early to get a drink? ‘<em> Fuck it, it’s five o’clock somewhere,’ </em> she thought. She opened a group chat with Alice and Billy as she started walking. <br/><br/><b>Rio: Either of you two fancy a drink?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Alice: Can’t, we've got lectures all day</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Billy: Also it’s only 12. I know time moves differently at your age but damn!</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Rio: Losers</b> </p><p>She chuckled because she knew they were right, it was probably too early to start drinking on a Monday and she needed to go home and rethink her thesis title. The combination of being on her phone and thinking about Agatha’s harsh comments meant that she didn’t see the other person coming towards her until it was too late. </p><p>Their bodies collided and the other person was knocked off balance, throwing the stack of papers they were carrying into the air. Rio instinctively grabbed the other person to stop them from falling, grabbing both their arm and waist pulling them close to her. It took a second for the papers to settle on the ground and for both of them to realise that they were practically hugging. They awkwardly broke apart saying overlapping apologies.<br/>“Oh my god I am so sorry!” <br/>“No, no it’s fine. It was my fault!” <br/>“Here let me help you pick these up.” Rio crouched down and started scooping up the papers scattered around them. The other person joined her and Rio handed them her pile, their fingers brushing lightly and they took it. It was only then that Rio noticed the red waves of hair and the striking green eyes. She recognised this woman but through the jumble of the last 30 seconds, couldn’t place her face. They both stood back up and the other woman spoke first. “Thank you for your help and for stopping me from ending up like these papers.” She chuckled and extended her hand. “I’m Wanda,” she cleared her throat. “Ms. Maximoff.” <em> ‘Wanda of course.’ </em> Rio remembered her from her picture on the university website. She took her hand and shook it. “I’m Rio, Rio Vidal.” Wanda raised her eyebrows slightly in recognition. <br/>“PhD student right? Sorry for not responding to your email, I’m unfortunately not taking any more students this year.” She seemed to realise that they were still shaking hands and pulled hers away. “I hope you managed to find someone, I thought your proposal was excellent.” She spoke like it was a speech she'd been rehearsing for a play. Rio found her tone of voice slightly odd but didn’t read into it. “Yes I did! Professor Harkness is my supervisor.” Wanda cast a shy glance in the direction of Agatha’s office. <br/>“Well good luck with that one. You’re gonna need it.” She smirked and walked away leaving Rio standing there.</p><p>Maybe Monday afternoon <em> was </em> the best time for a drink after all. </p>

<p>Agatha had spent the last six months sifting through emails from PhD students requesting her as their supervisor, and this evening was no different. She was used to this, knowing that she was so coveted did wonders for her ego, but the pickings for this upcoming academic year were more slim than the last. “Does no one have an original idea any more?” She asked to her empty living room as she read yet another proposal on the fall of the Roman Empire. She didn’t <em> need </em> to take on any PhD students this year, it wouldn’t kill her to have a year without doing it. But the truth was that she enjoyed it. She liked being a mentor and shaping people into the best they could be – even if her methods did get some complaints – so she felt that a part of her would be missing if she didn’t take on a student this year.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed on the table next to her, a message from her colleague, Jen Kale.<br/><br/><b>Jen: Any joy picking a student yet?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Agatha: I’m this close to just putting their names in a hat and letting fate decide.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Jen: Let’s not get too extreme just yet. You still have 6 months, you might be surprised.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Agatha: I’ll give one more student a chance. If the next request I get doesn’t immediately grab my attention, I’m calling it for the year.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Jen: I’m glad my advice is being taken and extreme behaviour is being avoided.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> Agatha rolled her eyes and shut her laptop down, deciding on an early night. <b> </b> </p><p>She woke the next morning an hour earlier than usual, she groaned when she checked the time and saw 7:30, but dragged herself out of bed anyway. Immediately offended by the lack of caffeine in her system, her first port of call was the kitchen turning her laptop on as she waited for her coffee to brew.<br/>She leant against the kitchen counter letting the coffee work its magic and running through the list of errands she had for the day, when her email notification pinged on her laptop. Reluctantly she moved to sit in front of it – definitely not awake enough to deal with whatever this was – and groaned when she saw the subject line, “PhD Supervisor Request” at the top of her inbox. She had really hoped that people had given up. It was so rare that people would wait this long to request a supervisor. But, if she was being honest with herself, the fact that it had been left this long was intriguing. That’s why she’d been so quick to read the other five she’d received this past week, and she’d be ready to give the same rush to this one had the others not been so bad.<br/><br/>She allowed herself a few minutes of annoyance before she opened the email. It had the same basic structure she’d grown accustomed to: polite and formal wording, a little bit of smoke being blown up her arse and an attached academic CV and PhD proposal outline. Remembering her message to Jen the night before, she said, “hmm, let’s see what you’ve got Rio Vidal.” She opened the CV first. A three year undergraduate degree in Archaeology followed by a gap year and a part-time masters in Ancient History, graduating both with a first. This wasn’t a surprise to Agatha as it was rare for students to request her when they had less than a first.<br/><br/>So far the email was exactly like the rest of them but something made her want to take extra time to read the proposal. She wasn’t sure what it was, but she just had a feeling that this one wouldn’t be bad. She opened the proposal and quirked an eyebrow as she read the title: The Portrayal Of Greek Mythology In Modern Media. <em>‘Not the strongest title, but I can work with this.’</em> She thought as she scanned the rest of the document. All in all it was a very well put together proposal, it actually held her attention as she read it. The fact that she’d stopped skimming it and had actually gone back to the start to read every word properly took her by surprise. She never did that. “Well Miss Vidal,” she said to her empty kitchen, “you have my attention.”<br/><br/>She was about to start typing her response when her phone buzzed, the screen lighting up with a name she was less than enthusiastic about seeing.<br/><br/><b>Maximoff: Have you also received a supervisor request from Rio Vidal?</b><br/><br/>Of course Rio Vidal would also request <em>her</em>. The only student that had actually managed to interest her was making her work for it.<br/><br/><b>Agatha: I have. I want her.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>There was no chance that Agatha was letting Wanda have this one. Was it rooted slightly in pettiness? Yes, yes it was. Wanda had hurt her and Agatha loved to hold a grudge.<b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Maximoff: Of course you do, she’s the only student with a decent proposal.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><em>‘Astute as ever.’ </em>She thought<b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha: I have sent plenty of other requests your way.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Maximoff: Only because you don’t want them, that’s hardly fair Agatha. My pass rate is just as good as yours is,</b> <b>I deserve to be able to pick my own students. </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Agatha let out an exasperated sigh. She hated when Wanda remembered that she had a spine and now she was going to have to resort to asking nicely. But she was <em>not</em> begging. That was entirely different.<br/><br/><b>Agatha: Wanda, please. Let me have this one and I’ll let you have the next one.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>The seconds waiting for the reply turned into minutes and it made Agatha wonder if Wanda was finally going to stand up for herself, put her in her place and take Rio Vidal on as her student.<br/><br/><b>Maximoff: Okay. I will not respond to her email, but we can’t keep going on like this Agatha. We are going to have to talk properly at some point.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha: Thank you.</b><b><br/></b><br/>She refused to acknowledge the last part of Wanda’s message. They had an agreement to only speak about work related matters and Agatha didn’t break agreements.<br/>She returned her focus to her email to Rio Vidal. She was fairly sure that she wanted to take her on this year, but wanted to meet her in person first. First impressions can make all the difference.<br/><br/></p><p align="center">__________</p><p> </p><p>Agatha used freshers week as her final prep time, choosing to go into the university and sit in her office to avoid distractions. That lasted all of about thirty seconds before there was a knock at her door. She sighed and said, “you may enter.” The first word had barely been spoken before the door was flung open and two women barged in. Agatha rolled her eyes. “Good morning Lilia, Jen,” she started, looking between them. “What can I do for you on this fine Monday morning?” Lilia and Jen were also lecturers at Cambridge university and, much to her chagrin, Agatha’s best friends. “Can’t we just want to spend some time with you, Harkness?” Lilia asked and she flopped into one of the armchairs. Jen, ever the prim-and-proper one, delicately perched herself in the other armchair before adding, “for once we’re ahead on our lecture prep but I can see now that you’re uncharacteristically behind.” She furrowed her brow in confusion as she craned her neck to try and see the notes on Agatha’s desk.<br/>Agatha, not liking being called out, quickly gathered up the papers covering her desk and placed them face down. “I know I’m very behind right now, but I’m sorting it out. Or I was before you two came bumbling into my office.”<br/>Lilia leaned forward in her seat. “Well now we simply need to know what could have been distracting the great Professor Agatha Harkness this much.” Her smile was mischievous and Jen picked up her train of thought. “Could there be a new woman in your life?” She feigned a shocked expression but Agatha quickly shut her down. “No. There are no new women in my life, nor will there ever be. I am enjoying my time being single.”<br/>Lilia snorted. “Tell that to Agatha from a two and a half years.”<br/>“We really don’t need to be bringing that up.” Any hint of joking had been removed from Agatha’s voice, letting Lilia and Jen know that they’d taken it too far. They both quickly apologised and Agatha said, “now if you two don’t mind, I really need to get this finished.” Her tone was lighter but there was still some hurt lingering beneath it. Her two friends agreed and left her in peace. <br/><br/>She obviously knew what had been distracting her, she just didn’t want to admit it. The truth was that she’d spent the last month agonising over seeing the kid again. They’d been so close before she left. No. Before she was <em> forced </em> to leave. But now, two and a half years later, who knows where they stood with each other. She was absolutely capable of putting the past behind her and treating him like any other student but she’d be lying if she said that receiving the text from Wanda a month ago hadn’t spun her head.<br/><br/>The text had read: <b>“I’m letting you know this because I don’t think it’ll be good for either of you if it’s a surprise. Billy is in your class this semester. Please try to be nice to him. I’m not asking for me because I know that will only achieve the opposite result, I’m asking for him.” </b> <b><br/></b> At first Agatha had been angry. That was her immediate reaction. How <em> dare </em> that woman insinuate that she’d be anything other than kind to Billy? When had she ever shown any inkling of ill will towards him? But then she’d seen the guilt trip that Wanda had embedded in the message. “I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for him.” Agatha had read out loud and the anger had been shunted in a new direction. She was no longer angry at Wanda, she was angry <em> for </em> Billy. How on earth could she use her child in that way? What kind of mother would use her son to guilt trip her ex? Billy wasn’t a part of this, he hadn’t done anything wrong. This was between the two adults.<br/><br/>It had taken Agatha nearly two days to calm down enough to reply to Wanda’s message, not that she deserved a reply, and she’d spent the next month cycling through emotions about the upcoming semester.<br/>That was why she was behind on her lecture prep. She’d let Wanda get into her head and was overthinking every possible upcoming interaction she could have with Billy.</p><p> </p><p align="center">__________</p><p><br/>Monday the 15th of September arrived entirely too quickly, Agatha only just got her lecture notes for the first semester sorted in time. But with everything done and ready it was time to begin the first lecture of the semester. On the first day she always made sure she was the last to enter the room. She enjoyed the control it gave her to be able to walk in and know that everyone’s eyes were on her. All she did was walk to the desk, but she knew every single person in that room was waiting for her to speak.<br/><br/>She revelled in the fact that this was a room of fresh faced students with minds that were hers to mould. There was a reason that she took up teaching as a profession. She liked the feeling she got when a student's face lit up upon hearing a new piece of information. She liked knowing that she’d changed someone's negative opinion on something. But more than anything she <em>loved</em> getting to talk about subjects that interested her. In this lecture hall, speaking to these students, she wasn’t just the ‘weird kid’ who knew a bit too much about the Greek gods. They were all there to hear her speak about exactly that. They were <em>paying</em> to hear her speak about it, and that feeling was unparalleled.<br/><br/>She began the way that she always did, by introducing herself and giving a brief outline on the essays that she expected from them. She looked across the crowd of faces before her, taking them all in, lingering ever so slightly on the back corner. She knew that he was in her class but was still surprised to see him, for some reason. It was almost like she’d been refusing to believe it until she saw it, but there he was clear as day. He’d dyed his hair black but his features remained the same. <em>Billy Maximoff.</em> She had a faint feeling of guilt watching the way he shuffled in his seat under her gaze.<br/><br/>Needing to bring herself back into the room, she let her gaze wander back to the centre and asked, “does everyone understand?” A murmur of agreement came in response and she made a mental note to bring them all out of their shells and help them find their voices. “Excellent. Let’s begin.”<br/><br/>She opened up the PowerPoint and began the introduction to the module. She could practically feel her students hanging on her every word as she moved on to the lecture proper. Even she wasn’t able to tell that she’d finished prepping this mere days ago. She felt so at ease standing front and centre of the room watching people rush to write down what she was saying, eager to remember every word. <br/>She was ramping up to the first plot twist of the lecture. “As we all know, Disney’s Hercules is the most accurate re-telling of the story.“ She said, accompanying it with a still from the movie being projected on the screen, and allowing herself to share in the chuckle that made its way around the room. “But something that people don’t know too much about is that Heracles – the Greek pronunciation – was originally given the name Alcides by his parents.” She allowed the students time to write the fact down. “It was only later that he became known as Heracles as a way to honour Hera, the Queen of the gods.”<br/><br/>Her finger was hovering over the button, waiting to change to the next slide when she heard a scoff from the back corner. <em>‘Surely that’s not him.’</em> She thought as her gaze snapped in the direction she’d heard it. But it was followed by a mumble that wasn’t in his voice. “Well that’s not true.” Agatha watched as all the heads in the room turned in the direction the voice came from. A woman with dark hair tucked into the far corner of the seating bank who now looked very uncomfortable. <em>Interesting.</em><br/><br/>“I sense somebody disagrees with me. Don't be shy, speak your mind.” The woman suddenly seemed to become aware that Agatha was looking at her and she shuffled in her seat, clearing her throat to – Agatha assumed – buy herself some time to compose her thoughts. “Well you said that Heracles’ name was changed to honour Hera.” She paused and Agatha gestured for her to continue. “But he was renamed Heracles in an unsuccessful attempt to mollify Hera, with Heracles meaning Hera's ‘pride’ or ‘glory.’” Agatha didn’t let her gaze drop. <em>‘Impressive, she knows her stuff. </em>Very <em>interesting.’</em> She couldn’t hide the amusement that crept into her expression, and she didn’t care to. “What is your name please?” she asked as she made her way to the desk. “Rio Vidal.” Agatha felt an involuntary look of surprise appear on her face, but she hid it by looking at the list of names she’d printed out. “Miss Vidal, I don't recall seeing your name on the list of students taking this module.” Obviously she knew why that was but she couldn’t let Rio know that could she? Wait, why couldn’t she? Why did she have the sudden urge to appear aloof to this woman?<br/><br/>“I'm here to get my PhD and thought this module would be a good one to sit in on.” Rio’s voice broke her from her thoughts but said thoughts had shaken her slightly and she needed to get them back on teaching. All she gave in response was a non-committal “hmm” and returned her attention to her lecture, quickly flicking to the next slide. In truth she had forgotten what the next slide was, but as soon as she saw it, it brought her right back to where she needed to be.<br/><br/>She got through the remainder of the lecture with no further hiccups and watched with slight amusement as Rio practically ran from the room. But then her attention was quickly drawn back to Billy. Should she try to talk to him? Should she ask him to wait behind until everyone was gone so that she could reassure him that she wouldn’t make his life hell? Should she let him know that she misses him and that she wished he didn’t have to be caught up in the shit between her and his mother?<br/>His eyes met hers as he walked past her but she couldn’t read his expression. She tried to speak to him but the words got stuck in her throat, probably for the best since she didn’t actually know what she would say to him, and he hurried out of the door.<br/>This was not going to be easy.</p><p>Having been knocked off balance during the lecture, Agatha went straight to her office. She needed some silence to be able to sort her head out.<br/>She practically threw herself into the nearest chair and held her face in her hands. How was she going to go a whole semester having Billy in her class? She definitely needed to talk to him, on that she was certain, and it was for purely selfish reasons. Of course she wanted to make sure that he was okay, she still cared for him, but she needed to do it for her own peace of mind. She needed to know where they stood and how to conduct herself going forward.<br/><br/>And then there was Rio, the other person occupying her mind. She would be in Agatha’s office in approximately fifteen minutes for a meeting that Agatha had not prepared for in any way, shape or form. Billy had been taking up so many of her thoughts and she <em> really </em> didn’t think this PhD student would immediately be fighting for space, and yet here she was. She’d taken it upon herself to attend the first lecture of the semester – no doubt an attempt to make a good first impression – and had shown that she wasn’t afraid to speak out, even if she did need a little prompting. Agatha was always impressed when students found the nerve to question her, she enjoyed engaging in debates and discussions, and when the debate was good, she didn’t mind it derailing her lecture. As long as there was still something to be learned, she couldn’t be mad. But she wasn’t used to being challenged in the very first lecture, students typically found their voices in the second week, so she was instantly intrigued.<br/>But <em> why </em> was she intrigued? Agatha recalled the way Rio had spoken with certainty. Despite her nervous tone, she still spoke as if she knew what she was saying was the ultimate truth. She didn’t say, “I read that…” or “I’ve heard that…” she simply just spoke like it was plain and simple. Agatha respected that. Respect, that was it! That’s what she felt.<br/><br/>A knock at her door broke her from her thoughts and she checked her watch, 11:30. <em> Fuck </em> .<br/>She scrambled to her desk and sat before saying “you may enter.” Agatha watched as Rio Vidal entered her office and immediately started scanning the room and turned her gaze to her laptop when Rio found the canvas above her head. She opened a blank document typing bullet points to try and structure the meeting that had already begun – before telling Rio to take a seat.</p><ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Ask why she waited so long</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Subject of thesis?</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Why should I be interested?</li>
</ul><p>When she was happy with her list she started working through the points. “Miss Vidal, wonderful to finally meet you.” <em> Check. </em><br/>Rio’s seemed to choke on her response and Agatha couldn’t help the small smile that crossed her lips. <em> ‘She’s as nervous as I am.’ </em> she thought, letting the revelation calm her down a fraction.<br/>“There’s no need to be nervous Miss Vidal,” Agatha began, though she wasn’t sure where it was coming from, “you’ve already challenged me in a lecture. This meeting should be easy for you.” She allowed herself to briefly look at Rio, finding her eyes immediately. Such a nice shade of brown. <em> ’Wait, what? No, I wasn’t focussing on that.’ </em> She battled with her own thoughts as Rio spoke again, but Agatha only tuned in to the last few words. “I apologise, Professor.” What was she apologising for again? Oh the lecture, right. “No need to apologise. It’s nice to know at least one person in that class has prior knowledge of the subject being discussed. I just ask that, if you’re going to challenge me, you have the confidence to do so immediately and don’t need it coaxing out of you.” Some part of her brain must have been prepared for this because it’s like she was running on autopilot. It was dangerous though so she brought herself back to her list but not before her eyes wandered back to Rio’s face for a second.<br/><br/>“I have to ask, why did you wait until six months before starting your PhD to inquire about me being your supervisor?” <em> Check. </em> It wasn’t relevant to anything but it was something that had puzzled her, so why not find out? She barely heard Rio’s answer though as she was so focussed on getting through her list and ending this meeting as quickly as she could. “What subject do you have in mind for your thesis?” <em> ‘Wait, I know this. At least I </em> should <em> know this. What was it?’ </em><br/>“The portrayal of Greek Mythology in modern media.” That was it! She hummed as she remembered reading it months ago. “Not the strongest of titles.” <em> ‘Shit was that out loud? That was out loud. Fucking hell just move on.’ </em> “And why should I be interested in being your supervisor?” <em> Check. </em> All of her points had been hit, now she just needed to wrap it up. Rio’s response was much like her email had been, just in a less formal wording. “Hmm. So you Googled me.” Agatha deadpanned. It was meant to be a question but she was just trying so hard to get this meeting to end that her tone came out wrong.<br/>“I googled the university and you came up. Are you going to pay any attention to me during this meeting, or is your laptop more interesting?” It seemed Rio was responding to the harsh tone of Agatha’s last comment, and she couldn’t blame her. She had been wholly unprofessional throughout this entire thing. But there was no point trying to backpedal, the best she could do was lean into it and try to own it. Still not daring to look at Rio she said, “when you give me something to devote my full attention to, Miss Vidal, you shall have it.”<br/><br/>Agatha knew as soon as she’d said it that it wasn’t the right thing to say <em> at all </em> and Rio’s response drove that point home. “So you don't deem me asking you specifically to be my supervisor worth your time?” It was the opposite actually, but it was too late to say that now. “I came to this university for your reputation, for <em> you </em> . But you know what? I'm good actually, I always have a backup plan.” A backup plan? What backup plan? How had she managed to royally fuck this up? This wasn’t how she usually was! “I also emailed Ms. Maximoff about being my supervisor and she was rather enthusiastic about the idea. She also seems like someone who can actually be bothered to drag herself away from her laptop for two seconds to have a conversation with me.” Wanda’s name ripped her from her thoughts. She had said that she wouldn’t respond to Rio’s email, why had she lied? Agatha couldn’t believe the audacity that woman possessed. There was no way in hell that she was going to let Wanda take this student away from her. She <em> had </em> to claw this back. She was searching Rio’s face for any hint that she was lying about Wanda responding to her but she couldn’t find one. All she saw was a look of determination.<br/><br/>Agatha took off her glasses in an attempt to appear casual before saying, “I really thought it would take you longer to break than that. You don't seem that easily flustered.” Was it working? She could see the response forming in Rio’s mind and spoke before she could. “But I have to admit, the passion you just showed is intriguing. Bring me your proposal on Wednesday, I'll give it a look over and make my decision.”<br/>Rio was just staring at her, her mouth hanging open slightly. <em> ‘Please can this just end now? I need this to be over.’ </em> “This is where you agree, thank me and leave.” Rio stuttered out her reply and started to make her exit. This absolute travesty of a meeting was so nearly over, so why was she calling Rio’s name again? “Try not to get so easily wound up in future, or this will not work out.” She didn’t look at Rio for her response. She just put her glasses back on and stared blankly at her screen until she heard the door shut.<br/><br/>What the actual <em> fuck </em> was that?<br/><br/>Agatha checked her watch, 12pm. How had it only been thirty minutes? It felt like an age. She leant forward, resting her head on her desk and groaned. Today was <em> not </em> her day. Thankfully she only had the one lecture to do today as it was the first day of classes and she always kept the rest of the day free for meetings with PhD students. She thanked every god she could think of that the rest of them had been so lack-lustre this year that she’d only taken one on, even if that one was already causing her some issues.<br/><br/>She sat back up and promptly deleted those useless bullet points, instead replacing them with an actual plan to supervise Rio through her PhD. She opened up her proposal and started making notes on it. <em> ‘Fuck me, did I ask her to bring me her proposal on Wednesday?’ </em> She was literally annotating Rio’s proposal now. Why had she asked her to bring it to the next meeting? <em> ‘She is absolutely going to think I’m crazy. Maybe she should go to Wanda instead.’ </em> As soon as the thought entered her head she chastised herself for thinking it. <em> ‘Absolutely not! Get your shit together, Harkness!’ </em> She wasn’t sure how long she’d been working on it, but her head was starting to spin. So she closed her laptop and left her office.<br/>She couldn’t decide what she needed more, some fresh air or a drink. Muscle memory seemed to take over and she found herself outside Jen’s office.<br/><br/>Agatha knocked on the door and, upon Jen’s approval, entered the room.<br/>She sighed heavily, and dramatically flopped into one of the arm chairs. “Okay, how bad is it?” Jen asked, knowing exactly what Agatha needed.<br/>“The cupboard under your desk kind of bad.”<br/>“Oh damn.” Jen reached down, retrieving a bottle of whiskey and two glasses from the cupboard. She gave them both a healthy pour and sat in the chair opposite Agatha. “Should I text Lilia?”<br/>Agatha sighed again. “No, I’ll tell her later. She always puts more into the first day than we do.”<br/>Jen laughed. “She puts us to shame really.”<br/>“Ha. Yep.” Agatha raised her glass to Jen before taking a sip. The whiskey warmed her throat as it went down. If she thought about it too long she’d say that she and Jen had made a little too much of a habit out of midday drinks in their offices, which is why she wasn’t thinking about it. “So go on, tell me what you needed the comfort of the cupboard for.” Jen said as she sat back in her seat.<br/>“I just had my first meeting with that PhD student I told you about.” She took another sip. “It went… well, it went.” She chuckled dryly.<br/>“Oh, was she not what you thought? Did she catfish you with her proposal?”<br/>“The opposite.” Agatha said, turning her attention to the liquid in her glass. “She’s actually more than I thought she would be.” She wasn’t entirely sure what she meant by that, so she took another sip. “She attended my lecture actually.”<br/>Jen raised an eyebrow, taking a sip herself. “Oh wow, she was really trying to make an impression then. And it sounds like it worked?”<br/>“It did.”<br/>Jen leant forwards, putting her glass on the table between them. “Agatha, if I may, I don’t think this is the student you came here to talk about.” She paused and Agatha knew she was waiting for her to meet her gaze. “The Maximoff boy is taking your module this semester isn’t he?” Agatha let her eyes drop again – more looking through Jen than looking at her – but she didn’t respond. She really didn’t know what to do about Billy.<br/><br/>“Agatha?” Jen brought her back into the room. “We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to, but it’s clearly messing with your head.”<br/>Agatha took another sip before saying, “He’s the reason I was so behind on my lecture prep for the semester. Wanda messaged me to let me know that he would be in my class for the semester. <em> Because she’s thoughtful that way. </em> ” She said the last few words in a whinier tone.<br/>“You spoke to Wanda?” Jen’s voice was sharp with concern and an edge of surprise.<br/>“We made an agreement to only speak about work. Since we work in the same department we figured that we couldn’t just avoid speaking entirely, so this was the compromise we found. And now, since Billy is one of my students, he counts as work.” She let out one short laugh before continuing. “You know she implied that I’d treat him harshly? ‘Please try to be nice to him,’ she’d said. As if I’d <em> ever </em> treat him badly. I mean how could she actually think that?” She’d started and now she couldn’t stop. It all just came pouring out. “Oh and the cherry on top was that she said ‘I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for him.’ I mean what right does she have to ask <em> me </em> for anything? How the <em> fuck </em> did she think using Billy to guilt trip me was a good idea? I should have taken him with me instead of leaving him with his manipulative bitch of a mother. He doesn’t deserve this. He did nothing wrong.” When her rant finally ended she was breathing heavily. She hadn't even realised how angry she’d gotten until she was sat in the silence after the fact.<br/><br/>Jen had just sat, quietly listening to her vent, clearly aware that she needed to get this off of her chest. Agatha took a deep breath and slowly released it. “I think I needed that. Thanks.”<br/>“Literally any time.” They both took a long sip of their whiskey. “Are you going to talk to him before your next lecture?” <br/>“I honestly have no idea. I don’t even know how to begin a conversation with him any more. Do I request a meeting with him?”<br/>Jen thought for a second. “You could ask him to meet you in an empty classroom. That way you get privacy to have a conversation and you’re both free to leave whenever you want.”<br/>“That’s a pretty decent idea actually, Jen.”<br/>“I do have them occasionally.”<br/>They both laughed and then let a comfortable silence settle around them for a moment.<br/><br/>“I am disappointed that you don’t have a new woman though. You’re getting boring in your old age.” Jen smirked.<br/>“Shut the fuck up Jen.”<br/><br/></p>

<span>There was something about the way Wanda had spoken that bothered Rio, but she couldn’t quite place it. Was it just the awkwardness of them literally running into each other and that being their first conversation? Did Wanda feel embarrassed about the fact that she never replied to Rio’s email? Why did she appear almost nervous when Agatha was mentioned? </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had so many questions that she knew she wasn’t going to get the answers to any time soon, so she put her headphones on and walked back to her flat. The mild September air and the music playing in her ears helped to ground her as her mind was still racing. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Her thoughts wandered back to her meeting with Agatha. She wasn’t going crazy, that was a strange meeting right? Had Agatha truly not read her proposal? Had she forgotten to attach it to her email? Or was this Agatha’s weird way of punishing her for speaking out in her lecture, for ruining a twist she was trying to give the first years? </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio arrived at her flat and turned on the TV for background noise, doing basic tasks to keep herself busy and to try and pass some time. She was starting to miss home, her parents, her friends. Sure she’d called them in the past few months that she’d been in England, but it wasn’t the same as physically being with them or actually spending time with them. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She was pacing around the living room, restless, unsure what to do with her time. It was early afternoon – and she’d already decided that she wasn’t the kind of lonely woman who drinks alone on a Monday afternoon – so she did the next best thing. She went out, bought some snacks, changed into comfy clothes and settled herself in for a Lord Of The Rings marathon. It had been a good few years since she’d treated herself to twelve hours of the best cinema ever made and she knew that it would take her mind off of, well, everything. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The next morning she woke up still on her sofa, having fallen asleep at some point during the last half of Return Of The King, with a sharp pain in her neck and shoulder. “Ah, fuck.” She hissed when she tried to sit up properly. “Note to self, do not fall asleep on this sofa again.” She tried her best to massage it to a point where she could move her neck again and shuffled into her room to freshen herself up for the day. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She stood in the shower letting the warm water cascade over her, getting lost in the feeling for a moment. When she finally managed to drag herself out of the shower she checked her phone for the first time and saw messages in her chat with Alice and Billy.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Billy: Are you coming in today or did Agatha scare you too much yesterday? </b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Billy: I’ll take your silence as an admission of fear</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Alice: Leave her alone, she’s an important PhD student you know. 😘</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>Rio chuckled and checked the time: 10:12am. It was too late for her to go now even if she wanted to.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: Nah I’ve got some actual work to do for my important PhD haha</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>She got dressed and took her laptop to the sofa, opening up her proposal to make her edits. She read and re-read the title as Agatha’s words replayed in her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>“Not the strongest of titles.” </span>
</em>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She sighed as she erased the words before typing it back out exactly word for word. “‘Not the strongest’ what the fuck does that mean?” she asked out loud. “What does she want me to change it to?” What did Agatha want her to do to any of the proposal? She hadn’t been specific, she’d just asked for it to be brought to her. </span>
<em>
<span>‘She’s getting it emailed.’</span>
</em>
<span> Rio thought. </span>
<em>
<span>‘I’m not wasting paper for her.’</span>
</em>
<span> <br/>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She opened up her original email to Agatha and checked that the proposal had actually been attached, which it had, so what did she actually want her to do? Was this all just some weird mind game to see if Rio would do anything she asked without questioning it?  </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She thought about going into the university to ask Agatha what she wanted her to do but then decided going in was stupid when she could just email her. But what would she say? </span>
<em>
<span>“I’m terribly sorry but this basic task you’ve set me has proven too difficult.”</span>
</em>
<span> No, of course she couldn't say that. Would asking for clarification give Agatha more ammo to use against her? </span>
<em>
<span>“Miss Vidal, not only have you attempted to embarrass me in a lecture, but you have also failed to perform the most mundane task I could have asked you to do.”</span>
</em>
<span> Rio could hear her voice clear as day saying the words in her head. She huffed and threw her head backwards against the couch, staring at the ceiling before her eyes began to wander around her strikingly bare apartment. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She thought about her house back in Virginia and how she had a plant or a painting in every room to add colour and character. She was renting this flat so she knew she couldn’t start putting canvases on the walls, but there was nothing stopping her from getting a few plants. She closed her proposal and started googling garden centres nearby, within an hour she was walking down the aisles carefully choosing plants. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She didn’t want anything too high maintenance in case she managed to find herself a social life at some point, but she got a few indoor plants and a couple of outdoor ones to put on her balconette. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Happy with her choices, she went back to her flat and got to work finding places for them. She liked working with her hands, feeling the soil shift through her fingers, it reminded her of working at her parents' vineyard when she was a child. She fondly remembered chasing her cousins through the vines and sneaking handfuls of grapes when the adults weren’t paying attention. They’d always know, of course, because her lips would be stained red, but they never told her off. She later realised that they probably didn’t care because the grapes were a healthy snack and they’d rather she ate those than sugary candy.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio caught herself smiling widely at the memories and decided that she’d print out some pictures of her family at some point and put them in the living room to bring a little bit of home to her current accommodation.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Her stomach rudely reminded her that she hadn’t eaten anything yet and she widened her eyes in surprise when the time showed 2pm. Had she really been that long at the garden centre? Actually, she should be more surprised that she wasn’t longer. She could have happily spent hours there. Her stomach rumbled again, protesting its emptiness, so she made some food and settled in front of the TV. She hadn’t found any British shows she enjoyed yet so she watched reruns of Brooklyn 99 while she ate. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Hours went by while she was zoned out watching the show but she told herself that she couldn’t procrastinate any longer and she </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to do something with her proposal. She begrudgingly opened her laptop and pulled it up only to be staring at it with no idea what to do. She let out an exasperated groan and shouted into the ether. “What do you want from me?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Her phone buzzed next to her and a small part of her hoped it would be from Agatha saying that she’d made a mistake and she no longer needed a new proposal, but it was from Alice.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Alice: Our lectures are done for the day. Fancy a drink?</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>God did she </span>
<em>
<span>ever</span>
</em>
<span>! </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: Give me half an hour, I’ll meet you guys at the bar.</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>She got her jacket and shoes on and practically ran out of the door. The air was cooler now, biting slightly at her cheeks as she briskly walked onto campus. She knew she was cutting it fine but honestly, what the fuck what she meant to write? If Agatha was making her overthink this much after only one day what hope did she have for the next three years?</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She walked into the bar and immediately spotted Alice and Billy, sliding into the booth next to Alice. “We took the liberty of buying you a pint.” She said, gesturing to the glass in front of Rio and Rio took a healthy first sip. “Not that I don’t enjoy a good pint, but I’m going to have to get you two to expand your palettes at some point.” She smirked at the two of them.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh we’d love to,” Billy began, “but we don’t have the funds to expand our palettes. We’re starving students you know.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio laughed. “Okay, fair point. I’m just saying there’s more to experience than the cheapest lager in the student bar.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“We get it, the older you get, the more boujee you get. We’re not at your level yet.” Alice said in mock annoyance.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Hey, I’m only thirty! I can still drink you teenagers under the table!” Rio replied with a confidence she thought she would regret later… and she was right. As soon as the shots came out she knew she was done for. She managed to hold her own against Billy and Alice but she would be lying if she said that they didn’t have her on the ropes.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The bar lights came on at exactly midnight signalling that it was time to go home. Rio insisted on making sure the kids got back to their campus accommodation safely but didn’t spare a thought on how she was going to get home until she was already ten minutes into the half an hour walk. She could stop and order an Uber to take her the rest of the way but that would mean standing in the street and waiting for it. She could walk back to campus and order it from there, but that would be a waste of ten minutes walking, so she just decided to keep going. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She was glad that there was nobody around to see her nearly fall into her flat – she had leaned too heavily on the door as she was unlocking it and it took her with it as it swung inwards. She kicked off her shoes and haphazardly threw her keys onto the kitchen counter before getting herself a glass of water. She leant against the counter to steady herself as she sipped. Maybe she couldn’t keep up with the undergrads any more. But they didn’t need to know that. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Her eyes lazily moved across the living room and focussed on her laptop still sitting on the sofa and she groaned as she turned around, putting her cheek on the cool surface of the kitchen counter. “Some of my best essays during my undergrad were written whilst drunk.” she mumbled against the marble. “How much different could this be?” She allowed herself another few seconds of moping before she forced herself to go to the couch and open her laptop once more. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She decided to stop thinking and just type. Her fingers flew over the keys as she made change after change and some amount of time later it was done. She attached it to an email to Agatha that read:</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Dear Professor Harkness,</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Please find attached my newly written proposal. I do hope this one is more to your satisfaction.</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Sincerely</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Rio Vidal</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>She hit send and relaxed into the sofa cushions. She had been agonising over this for the whole day and now it was finally over. She was annoyed at how easy it had actually been. Why had it been so hard for her to do while sober? Her email notification pinged and she opened one eye to look at it. It was from Agatha.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Dear Miss Vidal,</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Thank you for your revised proposal. I would very much like to discuss it tomorrow in my office, 9am. </b>
<span> </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Sincerely</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Professor Harkness</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>9am? She could do 9am.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><span>Rio woke the next morning to the sun burning her eyes. She clearly hadn’t shut her blind before falling into bed last night. She slowly rolled over, very aware of the dull ache in her head. </span><em><span>‘Fucking undergrads.’</span></em> <span><br/>
</span><span>She cracked open one eye and grabbed her phone to check the time – thankfully she’d had the brain power to plug it in last night – 8:15am. She groaned and pushed her head further into her pillow for a few seconds before her eyes flew open. 8:15? Her meeting with Agatha was in 45 minutes. </span><span><br/>
</span><em><span>Fuck.</span></em><span><br/>
</span><span>She practically flung herself out of bed, barely able to ignore the pounding in her head, and ran to her en-suite. Had she brushed her teeth last night? The way her mouth felt suggested that she hadn’t. She rushed to get ready and since she didn’t have time for a shower, had to put all of her faith in dry shampoo. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She threw her laptop and keys into her bag and ran out of the door, power walking towards campus. She prayed that she’d make it there in time to grab a coffee.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She did not.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She jogged through the ancient history department, nearly flattening a student as she went, and stopped at Agatha’s office catching her breath. She checked the time, 9:08. </span><em><span>FUCK.</span></em><span><br/>
</span><span>She took one last breath before knocking on the door. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“You may enter.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio gingerly opened the door and slowly stepped into the room, nervously anticipating the harsh words that were sure to be fired at her. But instead, Agatha was sitting at her desk just watching her. After a moment she spoke. “Please take a seat, Miss Vidal.” Rio did as instructed and began trying to explain her lateness. “I’m really sorry that I’m late, it’s entirely my fault. I forgo-”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha cut her off by raising her hand and speaking over her. “You don’t need to provide excuses.” There was no harshness in her tone, it was more reassurance than anything. “I would like to start by apologising for my lack of professionalism in our last meeting. I had some personal things that I needed to sort out, but I assure you that nothing will affect my conduct going forward.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio relaxed in her chair and nodded, unsure what to say. Agatha continued. “Speaking of professionalism, let’s discuss your proposal shall we?” Rio nodded again trying to remember what she had written just a few hours ago and realisation dawned on her that she hadn’t actually proof-read it before sending it to Agatha. She hoped that she managed to keep her expression cool enough to hide her panic, though the slight twitch at the corners of Agatha’s lips suggested otherwise. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I won’t sugar coat it Miss Vidal, this has to be, without a doubt, the best PhD proposal that I have ever read.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really?” She asked incredulously. </span><em><span>’Point Vidal.’</span></em><span> She thought. But her confidence was wiped out when Agatha’s face turned serious. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“No.” She fixed her eyes on Rio, “I don’t think a single word was spelled correctly in the entire document.” Rio shuffled trying to look away but she couldn’t help herself from locking her eyes onto Agatha’s. They were the kind of blue that held you, kept you where she wanted you until she was ready to let you go. Agatha continued her chastisement, bringing Rio back into the room. “I would go as far as to suggest that you were inebriated when you wrote this, Miss Vidal.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio’s head dipped, shame taking over her. She wasn’t a first year undergraduate any more, her headache served as proof of that. She really shouldn’t have written and sent a PhD proposal while she was half-torn. But also, she wasn’t the only one in the wrong. Agatha shouldn’t have asked her to re-send a document that she already had without giving specifics on what she wanted changing, right?</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Three times now Rio had had an opportunity to prove to Agatha that she was worthy of having her as her supervisor, and three times now Rio had messed it up. Agatha didn’t seem like the type to give out endless amounts of second chances. She had to find a way to claw this back. “Professor Harkness, I…” She could come up with a myriad of excuses, put the blame anywhere she wanted, but she knew honesty was the best course of action. “Yes, I was drunk when I wrote and sent that to you. I can only apologise and hope that I haven’t painted a picture of myself that is too tarnished to fix.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha pursed her lips and leant forward, resting her elbows on her desk. “I appreciate your honesty, Miss Vidal.” She seemed to think for a moment before continuing. “How about we wipe the slate clean? Let’s use this moment to start again.” She stood up from her desk to sit in the chair opposite Rio, and handed her her laptop. “Here are my edits on your original proposal.” Rio accepted the laptop and began skimming through the document. “There aren’t many as it is a very strong one. One of the best I’ve seen, actually, but I did take the liberty of changing your title.” That had been the first thing Rio had noticed and she had to admit that it was miles better.</span><span><br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span><b>How Modern Media Has Changed The Portrayal Of Greek Mythology To Make It Accessible For A New Generation.</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>“I guess this is why they pay you the big bucks.” Rio said with a chuckle as she looked back up at Agatha, who gave a satisfied smile in return. Rio gave the laptop back to her and she closed it, setting it on the coffee table in between them. “So tell me, Miss Vidal, what piqued your interest about Greek Mythology in the first place?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio leaned back in her chair. “I read Percy Jackson as a kid, and that was all it took really.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha matched her posture. “Of course it was.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Excuse me?” Was Agatha actually mocking her? Why ask a question if she was just going to ridicule the answer? “Was my answer not up to you-”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“No, no, Miss Vidal, I apologise. I wasn’t meaning to poke fun at you.” Agatha hurried to defend herself. “I just meant that Percy Jackson is a gateway drug for most people.” She smiled softly.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio blinked, her mind going blank for a second. “Oh.” </span><em><span>‘Jumped the gun again.’</span></em><span> “Sorry. I guess I’m just used to being the ‘weird kid’ and having to defend myself.” She rubbed the back of her neck sheepishly.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh, you and I both. You don’t need to apologise for that.” Agatha leaned forward, resting her arms in her lap. “Passion like that is a good trait to have. It does dance along the line of hot headedness though… You might want to watch out for that.” She finished with a smirk.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio knew that she was right. She usually had a tight grip on her emotions, but this was the second time she’d let that control slip in just a few days. </span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio found herself looking into Agatha’s eyes, they were shining softly and she swore that she saw two shades of blue in them. She suddenly became hyper aware of the fact that she was staring at Agatha. </span><em><span>‘How long have I been looking at her? How long have we been sitting in silence for? Say something you idiot.’</span></em> <span><br/>
</span><span>“Have you ever read them?” She blurted out, inwardly cringing at how loudly she’d said it.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha leaned back again before saying, “I think I was a little too old for them when they came out.” She cleared her throat before speaking again. “What other sources are you planning on using for your thesis? You’ve outlined a few in your proposal, but are you going to expand your research at all?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They spent the next hour talking about the various books, shows and films that Rio had read and watched as part of her research and Agatha offered up a few new ones that Rio hadn’t considered. The conversation was easy, just two like-minded individuals talking about something they were both passionate about and Rio barely felt the time pass. She was so at ease that she had to keep reminding herself that Agatha was a professor and she was technically her student, although Agatha still hadn’t actually said that she would be her supervisor. She began to wonder why that was. Had she forgotten to say it? She’d mentioned that she’d had some ‘personal things’ on her mind so maybe she’d just been so caught up in whatever that was and it had slipped her mind.  Should she ask her? Or was it redundant now since they were already talking about her research materials and how she was going to structure her thesis? </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was broken from her thoughts by Agatha checking her watch and saying, “I’m afraid we are going to have to call this meeting here, Miss Vidal. I have a lecture to teach in fifteen minutes.” She stood up and started gathering up her laptop and various papers from her desk. “You’re welcome to sit in, you might learn something new.” She had her back to Rio so her expression was hidden but her tone was light. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio stood to leave as well but she needed to clarify Agatha’s stance on being her supervisor. “So does this mean that you’re agreeing to be my supervisor, Professor Harkness?” Agatha was on her way to the door, but she stopped and turned. “I thought that was obvious, no? I wouldn’t have changed your title, annotated your proposal and asked about your research methods if I wasn’t planning on taking you on.” She moved to the door and opened it before continuing. “I’d like to set up a weekly meeting at the same time as today to discuss your progress.” Rio’s expression must have been one that conveyed worry because she quickly followed up with, “relax, I don’t need a specific word count. I just like to know that my students are capable of showing that they’re committed.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio agreed and walked past her, leaving the office. “Miss Vidal?” She turned back. “I wouldn’t recommend drinking heavily before our meetings in future. I let it slide this time, but do not expect me to be so gracious should it happen again.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Of course, Professor.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They both went their separate ways and Rio pulled out her phone to message Billy and Alice.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Rio: I’m coming to the lecture today to offer my incredible brain to you two.</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Alice: Ha. We’re just grabbing a coffee and we’ll be there</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Rio: Can you pick me one up too and I’ll meet you in there?</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Billy: Sure, what’s your order?</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Rio: Black, like my heart</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Billy: Obviously.</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Rio shook her head and turned a corner in the corridor, narrowly avoiding walking into someone. “Oh shit, I’m sorry!”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“You’re making a bit of a habit out of this, Miss Vidal.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She looked up and met Wanda Maximoff’s eyes. “Please, call me Rio, Miss Vidal is so formal. Especially since I’ve nearly killed you twice now.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda laughed. The sound was bright and Rio couldn’t help but join in. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I suppose that’s true. Where are you rushing off to?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I’m going to sit in on Professor Harkness’ lecture.” At the mention of Agatha’s name, something flashed across Wanda’s face. It was similar to the look that Agatha had had when she mentioned Wanda’s name a few days ago. There was something between them, a history of some kind, but it wasn’t Rio’s place to know – as interested as she was. Whatever the look was, it disappeared quickly as Wanda seemed to steel herself. “Isn’t an undergraduate lecture a bit beneath you?” Her tone was harsh and it took Rio by surprise, but she hid it well keeping her expression neutral. “You’re never too old to learn new things.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda hummed in thought. “I suppose that’s true. I’ll let you go.” She started to walk away, but turned back to face Rio whilst walking backwards. “I’m sure we’ll see each other again, Rio. Though next time I hope it’s not because I’m about to have a near death experience.” She winked and turned to walk forwards again.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio stood there for a second, unsure what to do. </span><span><br/>
</span><em><span>‘Was she just flirting with me?’</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>‘What was that look she had when I mentioned Agatha?’</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>‘Was she just flirting with me?’</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><span>She felt her phone buzz in her hand.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Alice: Where are you?</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><em><span>Shit. </span></em><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She checked the time and raced to the lecture hall, sliding into the seat that Alice and Billy had saved for her just in time. “What took you so long?” Alice asked.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I bumped into Ms. Maximoff and we got talking. I didn’t notice the time.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy whipped his head to look at her. “You were speaking to Ms. Maximoff?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>But before Rio could respond, the lights dimmed and Agatha began her lecture. She made a mental note to ask Billy why he looked so worried and pulled out her laptop to take notes on the lecture. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Having not immediately embarrassed herself this time, she was able to be fully immersed. Agatha taught with such confidence, knowing exactly where to inject humour and how to bring people back when she could see that she was starting to lose them. She made a few attempts to get the students to speak up and engage but, being scared first years, they didn’t bite. Rio nudged Billy and whispered, “You should join in.” but he just shook his head so she leaned forward slightly to catch Alice’s eye. “Well one of you needs to.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“No thank you.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She rolled her eyes. </span><em><span>‘If someone doesn’t start joining in soon, I’m going to have to.’</span></em><span> She thought even though she’d made a promise to herself that she would stay silent. Eventually a quiet voice somewhere near the front piped up, answering Agatha’s question and then there was a trickle of other responses. Rio saw Agatha smile. “Excellent thank you. You see, it’s not so scary to join in.” She cast a glance over the students and Rio was certain that this time, Agatha’s eyes lingered on her.</span></p>

<p><u><b><em>6 Years Ago</em></b></u><b><em><br/></em></b><b><em><br/></em></b><span>Agatha stood in front of her wardrobe staring at her clothes as if the perfect outfit would magically appear. Her hair and makeup were done, the final hurdle was just the clothes, and it was causing issues. She wanted to make an impression of course, but didn’t want to go overboard, and towing that line right now was proving difficult. </span><span><br/></span><span>A banging at her door got her attention, she opened it and was greeted by Jen and Lilia barging into her flat and beelining for her bedroom. </span><span><br/></span><span>“Don’t panic, we’re here.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“What are our options?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha followed them into the room and dramatically threw herself onto the bed with a groan. “I feel like a teenager again. I swear first dates get harder the older you are.” </span><span><br/></span><span>“Where are you going again?” Jen and Lilia were deep in her wardrobe throwing her clothes into piles of yes, no and maybe. </span><span><br/></span><span>“She’s taking me to dinner. A classic first date location.” Agatha lifted her head when a jacket flying across the room caught her eye. “Be careful please, some of those are expensive!” She got off of the bed and moved towards the yes pile. “They’re not going to be good choices if they’re wrinkled.” She picked up a pair of plum trousers and scrunched her face up. “These made it to the yes pile?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Agatha please, this is a delicate process.” Lilia said, turning to see what she was talking about. “Oh actually, hang on. Jen, pass me that shirt!” </span><span><br/></span><span>Jen raised an eyebrow in disbelief. “Really?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Yes, trust me.” Lilia handed Agatha a white shirt and shooed her into the bathroom to get changed. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She stood in front of the mirror toying with the top button on her shirt. Should she do it all the way up or should she leave a couple of buttons undone? No doubt Jen and Lilia would tell her to  leave them undone. She touched up her makeup and made sure her hair was in place before walking back into the room. </span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh damn.” Jen said, her eyebrows lifted and her mouth slightly open. “Good job, Lilia.” They high-fived and Lilia gave a satisfied nod, clearly pleased with her work. </span><span><br/></span><span>“I have to hand it to you, the outfit is good.” Agatha said, doing a twirl. </span><span><br/></span><span>“Purple </span><em><span>is </span></em><span>your colour, Harkness. Wear the blue coat with it as well. It’ll pull it all together.” </span><span><br/></span><span>The three of them went into the living room and Jen started adjusting Agatha’s collar. “Just have it open a little bit mo-”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha swatted her hand away. “Jennifer, get off me.” She checked her watch and started putting her boots on. “She’s picking me up in ten minutes. So thank you for your help but now I need you to leave before you embarrass me. I would like to get further than the first date.” She gave them a smirk before ushering them out of the door.</span><span><br/></span><span>Lilia stopped at the threshold and said, “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.” Punctuating it with a wink.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Get out!”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She paced around her flat until she heard a knock at her door. She took a deep breath and counted to five before opening it and felt her stomach flip when she saw Wanda standing on the other side. She looked gorgeous. Her red waves framing her face perfectly, making her eyes look like a brighter shade of green. She looked Agatha up and down, a smile spreading across her face. “You look amazing.” </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha smiled back, her heartbeat quickening just a fraction as Wanda said, “ready to go?”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda had picked a small, Italian restaurant that was tucked down an alley. “Are you bringing me here on a date, or to kill me?” Agatha asked sarcastically. </span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda laughed, “now that would be telling.” She winked and Agatha knew that she could no longer deny just how smitten she was. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The date was probably in Agatha’s top three. The conversation flowed easily, a good balance of flirty and serious. Wanda told her that she had a child, a twelve year old boy, and said that she wanted to be upfront about it straight away. “Dating when you have a child can be somewhat of a minefield. It’s best to get the revelation out of the way as early as possible.” She looked nervous and Agatha immediately reassured her that it wasn’t going to scare her off. </span><span><br/></span><span>“When you’re comfortable with it, I’d be happy to meet him.” </span><span><br/></span><span>“Agatha, are you implying that this date is going well enough that you’ll reach that point?” Wanda smirked, her tone giving no hint of seriousness.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I know! How presumptuous of me.” Agatha laughed. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They were there for hours and didn’t notice that they were the only two customers left until a waiter politely told them that they needed to close. Wanda insisted on paying and walked Agatha home. They stood on the front steps of Agatha’s building still talking, not noticing the time passing. Being with Wanda was already so easy and gave Agatha a warm feeling in her chest. The way that Wanda looked at her made her feel like a teenager again. She had butterflies in her stomach and she was filled with giddy excitement. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh wow, I didn’t realise how late it had gotten.” Wanda ran a hand through her hair as she checked her watch. “I don’t think I’ve stayed up this late in, well, twelve years.” She chuckled lightly and Agatha liked the way it made her eyes crinkle slightly. </span><span><br/></span><span>“I didn’t notice the time passing, honestly.” Agatha said. “It’s been a good night.” She smiled looking into Wanda’s eyes and flinched slightly when she felt Wanda's fingers brushing her cheek. She was pushing a stray strand of hair behind her ear, letting her hand continue around the back of Agatha’s head and loosely holding the brown waves before pulling her forwards into a kiss. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>It was gentle and quick, a mere suggestion of what it could be. They pulled back, holding each other's gaze for a second before Agatha grabbed Wanda’s face and brought their lips back together. It was rougher this time, more needy, more passionate. Wanda’s free hand found Agatha’s waist and pulled their bodies closer. Suddenly any space between them felt like the most offensive thing in the world and Agatha knew that this was the start of something good.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><u><b><em>Present Day</em></b></u><b><em><br/></em></b><b><em><br/></em></b><span>Agatha had been drifting in and out of sleep for a few hours. Every time she considered giving it up as a bad job, she’d manage to drift back off for a bit, and so the cycle continued – until she heard her phone buzz. </span><em><span>‘Who the fuck is trying to contact me at this hour?’</span></em><span> She thought as she rolled over to grab her phone, the notification showing an email from Rio. This could absolutely wait until morning. This </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> absolutely wait until morning. So why was she desperate to see what Rio Vidal had to say right at this moment? </span><span><br/></span><span>Refusing to sit up and risk waking up further, she rolled onto her back and read the email.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Dear Profesor Harlness,</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Pleade find attached my newly written propposal. I do hope this on is more to you’re satisfactipn.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Sincerely</b><b><br/></b><b>Rip Vidal</b> <b><em><br/></em></b><span><br/></span><span>Was this a joke? What game was Rio playing with this? She was going to save reading the proposal for the morning, but the way this email was written had made her curious as to what she had just been sent. </span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh. She is definitely drunk right now.” she said aloud, the surprise of the revelation taking over her, but she wasn’t mad about it. Usually receiving an email in the early hours of the morning from a student who is clearly under the influence would have pissed her off. But she had to laugh at the ridiculousness of it. Given how she had behaved in their first meeting, Agatha could hardly be mad at Rio right now. She was many things, but a hypocrite wasn’t one of them. At least she thought it wasn’t, Jen and Lilia might disagree. She replied, setting a meeting for 9am and rolled back over, drifting back to sleep and this time managing to stay asleep.</span></p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>She was in her office for 8am sorting her notes for the lectures she was giving that day and adding some revisions to Rio’s original proposal – but the only thing that she really changed was the title. The proposal was good. No, it was amazing actually. Agatha opened her own PhD proposal, from all those years ago, to compare the two and Rio’s won by a mile. She would have absolutely no trouble writing her thesis that was for sure. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>9am came and went and Agatha knew that, given the state of her email from the early hours of the morning, there was a high chance that Rio had slept in. But she also knew that someone who had tried as hard as Rio had to impress her on the first day wouldn’t risk missing a meeting. She told herself that she’d give her a ten minute grace period and after that she would embrace the nickname of ‘Professor Hard-arse’ that Lilia had lovingly given her a few years ago. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The minutes ticked by and Rio was so close to sealing her fate, but at 9:08 there was a knock at Agatha’s office door. “You may enter.”</span><span><br/></span><span>She fixed her eyes on the door and watched Rio carefully step into the room. She was definitely hungover but she’d gotten there just on the right side of the ten minutes so Agatha was going to go easy on her. Well, easy-ish. She watched Rio awkwardly try to avoid her gaze and let her stand for a minute before telling her to sit. </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio immediately launched into an apology for her lateness but Agatha had already decided to let it go, so she cut her off. “You don’t need to provide excuses. I would like to start by apologising for my lack of professionalism in our last meeting. I had some personal things that I needed to sort out, but I assure you that nothing will affect my conduct going forward.” She kept her tone gentle and her face neutral and saw Rio relax a little bit. Despite her reputation for ‘busting balls’ she didn’t like doing it unless it was warranted. It just so happened that it was warranted more often than not so she didn’t have a choice most of the time. But she knew already that Rio didn’t need her to act like that. She was already a very good academic and just needed a little guidance here and there. That didn’t mean that she wasn’t going to take an opportunity to make her squirm though. Agatha was human, after all.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Speaking of professionalism, let’s discuss your proposal shall we?” Rio nodded and Agatha could see the panic on her face. It was evident that she hadn’t proof-read the proposal before she had sent it. She had been too drunk to spell, never mind reading it back and making corrections, and Agatha had to fight to control the smile that wanted to be on her lips. She could be kind and tell Rio straight away that this was far from what she expected, rip the band-aid off so to speak. But she wanted to toy with her a tiny bit. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“I won’t sugar coat it Miss Vidal, this has to be, without a doubt, the best PhD proposal that I have ever read.” The look of surprise on Rio’s face was exactly what she wanted. She’d created a false sense of security for Rio to sit in for a moment. “Really?” </span><span><br/></span><span>When the surprise started to take on an edge of smugness, she took that as her cue to end it. “No.” She fixed Rio with a glare that she knew she wouldn’t be able to look away from. It was a talent she’d picked up many years ago and she’d learned exactly when to use it. “I don’t think a single word was spelled correctly in the entire document. I would go as far as to suggest that you were inebriated when you wrote this, Miss Vidal.” Agatha couldn’t lie, she loved this feeling. The feeling of being in control and having the other person in the palm of her hand. The power she got from walking someone to the edge of what they wanted and pulling them back before they could step over. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The way that Rio hung her head made Agatha falter. Had she taken it too far? She’d only spoken to Rio once previously and didn’t know how far she could push her so it was entirely possible that she had overstepped. </span><em><span>Shit.</span></em><span> She could already hear the Dean reprimanding her about yet another complaint and so early into the academic year? She was going to feel this one for a while. Rio spoke and it broke her from her thoughts. “Yes, I was drunk when I wrote and sent that to you. I can only apologise and hope that I haven’t painted a picture of myself that is too tarnished to fix.” </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Okay, an apology. Maybe Agatha could bring this back. She told Rio that she appreciated her honesty and offered a fresh start for both of them before sitting opposite Rio and showing her the changes that she had made on her original proposal. This seemed to be the right move because Rio relaxed again and Agatha relaxed in turn. </span><em><span>‘Crisis averted. Now behave.’</span></em><span> she told herself. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She realised that she needed to find out more about Rio to avoid this happening in the future. She was also just intrigued by Rio as a person and wanted to know more about her anyway, but the professional context was more important since that was how they were spending their time together. At least, that’s what she told herself. “So tell me, Miss Vidal, what piqued your interest about Greek Mythology in the first place?” </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio assumed a more relaxed posture, clearly feeling more at ease and possibly a little bit excited to answer the question? </span><span><br/></span><span>“I read Percy Jackson as a kid, and that was all it took really.” </span><span><br/></span><span>A classic response. Not a bad one, but maybe an obvious one. Agatha had definitely taught her fair share of Percy Jackson fans and she liked to think that she’d gotten quite good at spotting them. Rio hadn’t given the vibe, but then again they had barely spoken. She really needed to find out more about this woman, for purely professional reasons. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Of course it was.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Excuse me? Was my answer not up to you-” </span><span><br/></span><span>“No, no, Miss Vidal, I apologise. I wasn’t meaning to poke fun at you.” Agatha hadn’t really thought herself to be a flexible person, but the way that her foot was firmly lodged in her mouth had her reconsidering that. How did she keep managing to do this? She was actively trying to avoid offending Rio but ended up doing it anyway. If she thought about it for too long she might say that Rio made her feel nervous, but she didn’t want to entertain the idea of why that might be. So she wouldn’t. “I just meant that Percy Jackson is a gateway drug for most people.” She smiled as she recalled the memory of giving Billy the books for his thirteenth birthday. The brightness of his smile, the way that he had hugged her and even the way that Wanda had laughed saying that it would keep him occupied for a week. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio apologised for her defensiveness and Agatha assured her that it was okay. They shared the experience of being known as the ‘weird kid’ and Agatha was actually happy that she had this kinship with Rio – though she couldn’t resist making a quip about Rio’s passion being mistaken for hot headedness. Was this the pot calling the kettle black? Absolutely. But Rio didn’t need to know that. Agatha had learned to keep a good hold on her emotions. There were, of course, exceptions but Rio wasn’t one of them. Her behaviour a couple of days ago had been a result of seeing Billy again and she had already acknowledged that it had been wholly unprofessional. The incident earlier in this meeting had been a poor judgement on her part and hadn’t been directly to do with Rio, she was like that with all of her students. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha had fully zoned out and was more looking through Rio than looking at her. It wasn’t until Rio spoke that she came back into the room. “Have you ever read them?” </span><span><br/></span><em><span>‘Have I been completely ignoring her? How many times has she asked that? How long were we sitting in silence for? Have I ever read what?’</span></em><span> She sat back in her chair, giving herself a second to collect her thoughts. </span><em><span>‘Oh! The Percy Jackson books!’</span></em><span> “I think I was a little too old for them when they came out.” Not a lie, but they’d already traded experiences of being outsiders as children and Agatha didn’t feel comfortable with her students knowing too much information about her. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha had intended for this meeting to last an hour at the most. She did not expect to be sat for as long as they were discussing different books, shows and films that Rio could use for her research. The woman had good taste, Agatha couldn’t deny that, and she was incredibly well read. This shouldn’t have been a shock given her CV and the bibliography she had already listed in her proposal, but Agatha was pleasantly surprised nonetheless. </span><span><br/></span><span>She enjoyed talking about her interests with someone who understood, it was rare to find someone who shared the same passion that she did and even more rare to find someone who was smart enough to keep up with her. Jen and Lilia weren’t idiots by any stretch of the imagination – and they could definitely hold their own –  but they were experts in other things that she didn’t know much about, and they didn’t really ‘talk shop’ like this. Her past PhD students had been too scared of her to engage in conversation like this and their meetings had often been stale and very much of a muchness. But this, this was something she could get used to.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She started to wonder how long they’d been sitting there, they’d been so engrossed that it didn’t feel like much time had passed. She checked her watch and was shocked to see that an hour had gone by. “I’m afraid we are going to have to call this meeting here, Miss Vidal. I have a lecture to teach in fifteen minutes.”  She picked up her laptop and went to get her lecture notes from her desk. She genuinely didn’t want the conversation to end so she offered for Rio to sit in on the lecture in the hopes that she would chime in again. </span><em><span>For purely professional reasons.</span></em> <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“So does this mean that you’re agreeing to be my supervisor, Professor Harkness?” </span><span><br/></span><em><span>‘How can someone this smart be this bad at reading the room?’</span></em> <span><br/></span><span>Agatha turned to face Rio. “I thought that was obvious, no? I wouldn’t have changed your title, annotated your proposal and asked about your research methods if I wasn’t planning on taking you on.” </span><span><br/></span><em><span>‘Did she really need this spelling out for her? I know that I haven’t explicitly stated it but we have just spent a literal hour talking about it.’</span></em><span><br/></span><span>She went to the door and opened it, telling Rio that she wanted to set up weekly meetings to check her progress. She had to suppress a chuckle when she saw the worried expression on Rio’s face. “Relax, I don’t need a specific word count. I just like to know that my students are capable of showing that they’re committed.” </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio started to walk away and Agatha couldn’t resist one last quip.  “Miss Vidal? I wouldn’t recommend drinking heavily before our meetings in future. I let it slide this time, but do not expect me to be so gracious should it happen again.” She meant it, it wasn’t something she would usually stand for and she’d given Rio a free pass purely based on her own behaviour.</span></p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She went via the campus café on her way to the lecture hall. The staff knew that when they saw her approaching, her order took precedence and they always had it ready in record time. Her reputation definitely had its perks and she wasn’t in a hurry to deprive herself of them. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She arrived at the lecture hall when students were still filtering into their seats and set up her laptop on the desk. She saw Billy sitting with his friend – who’s name she could not remember to save her life – but there was no sign of Rio. She checked her watch, 10:57. Rio had already been late once today, maybe she should have been more harsh about it earlier. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>10:58. She felt a pang of disappointment, but Rio wasn’t required to sit in on lectures, she could come and go from campus as she pleased. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>10:59. Rio came rushing through the door and beelined for the seat next to Billy. Had he been saving it for her? Were they friends? Billy, his friend, and Rio exchanged some words but they were hushed and Agatha couldn’t make them out. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>11:00. Time to begin. She dimmed the lights and fired up the PowerPoint. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Today we are going to talk about Hades and Persephone.” She changed the slide to show pictures of statues depicting both of the Gods. “Hades – as I’m sure you all know – is the King of the underworld, God of the dead and riches; and Persephone, his wife, is the Goddess of the dead, grain and spring. Hades was the eldest son of Cronus and Rhea, and the elder brother to Zeus and Poseidon. Persephone was the daughter of Zeus and Demeter, which makes them uncle and niece.” The slides changed to show a very complicated family tree for the Gods. It was so extensive that the text at the bottom was too small to actually read. “Don’t worry, I do not expect you to memorise this whole thing. This is just to illustrate that all of the Greek Gods are related and I promise that it will lose its shock factor.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She spoke about Hades and Persephone as separate people first, outlining who they were and giving more detail about what they were known for, always enjoying the rapid typing or scribbling of the students taking notes. She noticed that even Rio was writing down the things she was saying. </span>
<em>
<span>‘No doubt trying to find things to correct me on.’</span>
</em>
<span> She thought, though it wasn’t in distaste. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She moved around to the front of the desk and leaned against it, taking a more relaxed posture. “So now that we’ve covered them as separate entities, does anyone know the story of how they began their relationship?” The students remained silent and she was making a pointed effort to not look at Rio. There was not a single doubt in Agatha’s mind that Rio knew multiple versions of the myth, hell they’d talked about a couple earlier on. But the first years were the ones she was wanting the answers from. “I find it hard to believe that none of you have come across a version of this tale.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Out of the corner of her eye she saw Rio nudge Billy, trying to get him to join in, but he just shook his head. In truth, Agatha didn’t expect to hear from him much. She was currently just happy to accept that he kept coming to her lectures, it was a start. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was pulled from her thoughts by a voice in the front row. “Hades saw her in a garden and he fell in love with her.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was about to respond when someone else spoke. “He abducted her and Demeter was so distraught that she neglected the earth.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Zeus sent Hermes to convince Hades to return Persephone and he agreed to let her leave for six months of the year.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha smiled, they were starting to gain their confidence. “Excellent thank you. You see, it’s not so scary to join in.” She couldn’t resist stealing a glance at Rio. </span>
<span>
<br/>

      Chapter 5: Wanda
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Wanda knew that she had royally fucked up when it came to Agatha Harkness. Sure there were times when she hadn't wanted to admit it, times where she had used Agatha's hatred as a reason for her own, but at the end of the day, it had been her actions that had caused Agatha's reactions. At first Wanda had tried to match Agatha's hatred but it had always felt fake and wrong – because it was. The rumour of the reason for their break-up had spread through the faculty like wildfire and Wanda was standing at the spark point holding a match and kindling, nurturing the fire making sure it stayed lit. But then Agatha had allowed the flames to consume her.<br/><br/>She could have fought back, defended herself, told everybody that Wanda was lying, but she didn't. She just let them believe the story they were being told and had to deal with all of the snide remarks, the hushed conversations and blatant bitching that happened in the months following. People had been cruel to Agatha, and Wanda had let them. Her own need for self preservation winning out over her love for Agatha, that had been the problem all along. So many people had gotten hurt because Wanda was scared and the record had never been set straight, Agatha's name had never been cleared. Sure people eventually stopped talking about it and left her alone, but it was still a lie that they believed was the truth. They still took Wanda's side over hers in every little tiff they had at work and Agatha still let them. <em> Wanda </em> still let them. <br/><br/>After their break-up they had made an agreement to only speak about work – it was a compromise that Wanda had all but begged for – Agatha was more than happy to never speak to her again, but she could hardly be blamed for that. Wanda had tried on a few occasions to have a conversation with Agatha, to explain herself, but she was shot down in a tone of voice that was so venomous she was surprised she didn’t get ill after hearing it. She had been trying when the wound was too fresh and the rumour mill was still churning, so she decided to wait a bit before trying again.<br/><br/>‘A bit’ had turned into a two and a half years and in that two and a half years Agatha showed no signs of opening back up to Wanda. If anything she got more closed off, which didn’t seem possible but she had managed it. At the start Agatha would make snide remarks when passing Wanda in the corridors which dissolved into not even acknowledging her existence and eventually became avoiding her entirely wherever possible. She knew that she deserved every bit of it, but that didn’t stop it from hurting.<br/>Agatha had also changed how she treated other people in that span of time. She was always a no-nonsense kind of person – it’s what had drawn Wanda to her in the first place – but during that time she got more harsh, less forgiving and became downright mean. Wanda noticed that she received a record number of complaints against her from students that had unfortunately become the target of her anger. She was no longer giving it directly to Wanda so it had to go somewhere, and apparently she still had so much of it.<br/><br/>Receiving Rio Vidal's email requesting her as a supervisor had provided a work-related-excuse to talk to Agatha, and resulted in her losing out on an incredible PhD student. Wanda was prepared to stand her ground and fight for Rio as Agatha had been sending her, her rejects for far too long, but Agatha had asked. She had actually, and politely, asked. So Wanda had given in, how could she not? It was the first time in a two and a half years that Agatha had spoken to her in any hint of a nice manner and it had taken her a few minutes to process it, but in the end she couldn't deny her. She had to see this as Agatha giving her the smallest sliver of a chance to start taking a step in the right direction, so she broached the subject of them talking properly. It was completely ignored, but it wasn’t denied and she took that as a small win.<br/><br/>The worst part of their tumultuous past wasn't that she'd hurt Agatha – though that was definitely bad – it wasn't even that she'd hurt herself. It was that her own stupidity had hurt Billy. Her son was her everything and she'd taken Agatha away from him. She'd even made him hate Agatha to make herself feel better, to serve her own self-centred needs above his. That wasn't the trait of a good mother, it wasn't a way of being that she wanted to pass onto him. But she had, and that damage was irreversible. </p><p>Her and Billy's relationship had been strained since she'd told him the truth, but she'd needed to do it. She'd almost lost him and she couldn't let him waste his second chance at life harbouring such intense hatred for a person that he had once loved so deeply. He hadn't looked at her the same since and that killed her, but she'd done the right thing – even if it had taken her far too long to do it. She'd told him to take Agatha's module, she'd not forced him, it was still a decision that he had made on his own, but she had told him that it would be okay. She had assured and reassured him that Agatha wouldn't treat him any differently to any of her other students, that she'd want him there and that she would be happy to see him again. </p><p>There was an undercurrent of selfishness to it though, if Billy was taking Agatha's module then it would give her an excuse to talk to her. With Billy in her class he officially counted as ‘work’. Was it right to use her child in this way? Definitely not. Was she clutching at straws, trying any available option to just be face-to-face with Agatha again? Absolutely.<br/>Agatha had driven her to this, she’d given her no other options. Wanda knew that Agatha would hate her using Billy like this, so she’d crack eventually and Wanda would get what she wanted. She didn’t want to cause any more hurt to Billy though so she hoped that this would also give the two of them a chance to fix <em> their </em> relationship and then everybody was able to win. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p><br/>The first day of the new school year was the same as always: introductory lectures for the first years, re-introductions for the second and final years, starting the placement students off on their projects and meetings with the PhD students. Billy, like a typical teenager, had given her a set of rules to follow while they were both on campus. </p><p><em>“No acting like my mother, no embarrassing me, no trying to spend time with me in public, and under absolutely no circumstances should you tell my friends that we’re related.”</em><br/>She had laughed but promised to follow them all the same.<br/><br/>She was making her way back to her office to have a quick lunch before having to give more lectures. She liked to have a packed first day because it meant that she could get a head start on the year and hopefully have less work to do down the line. She was musing on how surprised she had been with her first year students. They were surprisingly confident and willing to join in with the lecture, it was a rare occurrence and she had welcomed it with open arms. Her thoughts shifted to Billy and she began to wonder how his day was going, she knew his first lecture had been with Agatha and she had messaged him wishing him a good day but he was yet to reply.<br/><br/>Her wonderings came to an abrupt end when she walked straight into a wall. No, not a wall. A person. The shock made her throw her arms out, forgetting the stack of papers she was holding, and she felt herself start to fall – her thoughts were running a mile a minute.<br/><em>‘Ow!’</em><em><br/></em><em>‘What was that?’</em><em><br/></em><em>‘Oh my god I’m falling!’</em><em><br/></em><em>‘This is going to hurt.’</em><em><br/></em>She clenched her eyes shut and braced for impact. <em>Another impact.</em> But the feeling of hitting the floor never came, instead she felt a strong grip on her arm and a softer one on her waist steadying her and pulling her into the body of the other person. She instinctively threw her arms around them for support, immediately finding comfort in their grasp, and stayed lost in it for a moment before she felt them pulling away. She came back to herself and unwrapped herself from the poor person that she had just body slammed. They both started apologising, talking over each other.<br/><br/>“Oh my god I am so sorry!”<br/>“No, no it’s fine. It was my fault!”<br/>The other person, who Wanda now noticed was a woman, started picking up the mess of pages that were now scattered around them. “Here let me help you pick these up.” Her long, brown hair was covering her face so Wanda still had no idea who she was, but she didn’t recognise the voice and placed the accent as American. She bent down and started gathering the pages as well, accepting the pile that the mystery woman handed her.<br/><br/><em>‘Who is she?’</em><em><br/></em><em>‘Is she an undergrad?’</em><em><br/></em><em>‘She doesn’t look like a teenager.’</em><em><br/></em><em>‘Is she a mature student?’</em><em><br/></em><em>‘Please don’t let her be a teenager.’</em><em><br/></em>Wanda’s thoughts were still racing as they stood back up and she started to process what had just happened. “Thank you for your help and for stopping me from ending up like these papers.” She offered her hand to the other woman, who she could now see was definitely not a teenager – she really didn’t need the scandal of being seen holding a teenager in the middle of a corridor. “I’m Wanda,” she said before correcting herself. “Ms. Maximoff.” The last thirty seconds had left her flustered and she momentarily forgot that she was at work and had just collided with a student. A student who smelled of forest pine and had a gentle smile.<br/>“I’m Rio, Rio Vidal.” She was broken from her reverie by a hand taking hers and shaking it, and a name that she recognised. <em>The PhD student she had lost out on.</em> She had come up with a generic apology should she accidentally bump into her, of course she never thought that it would <em>literally</em> happen. “PhD student right? Sorry for not responding to your email, I’m unfortunately not taking any more students this year.” Wanda became hyper aware of the fact that they were still shaking – no, <em>holding</em> – hands and pulled away feeling awkward, before saying the rest of her prepared lines. “I hope you managed to find someone, I thought your proposal was excellent.” She cringed internally at how robotic she sounded. Rio Vidal’s proposal was one of the best that she had ever read and she had to admit that she was annoyed at how quickly she had folded at Agatha’s request to give her up. But she had to pick her battles with Agatha and if she wanted to have the smallest chance of Agatha letting her in long enough to say her piece, then she knew that she had to make sacrifices.<br/><br/>“Yes I did! Professor Harkness is my supervisor.” At the mention of her name, Wanda shyly looked in the direction of Agatha’s office as if she would appear and demand that Wanda stop talking to her student. But that would mean her actually being in the vicinity of Wanda which only happened if there was no conceivable way that it could be avoided. “Well good luck with that one. You’re gonna need it.” Wanda said before continuing to her office. It wasn’t a lie, Agatha was formidable even without the added anger Wanda had incited and Rio Vidal might seem brilliant on paper, but she had no doubt that she would find ways to pick her apart and break her down.<br/><br/>Wanda walked into her office, dropped her papers on the desk and absentmindedly rubbed her arm where Rio had grabbed her. There had been no intent to hurt her but the force needed to keep her upright had left a dull ache in the area. She picked up her phone, still no reply from Billy. She knew that he had lectures all day and wouldn’t be able to text her, and he probably wouldn’t want to, but she was still his mother and couldn’t help starting to worry.<br/>She was considering messaging Alice as well – she had insisted that Billy give her Alice’s number when they were moving him into his accommodation, just in case – but that was a level of crazy that she didn’t want to be at on the first day.</p><p>She had never been an overprotective or overbearing mother, she wanted Billy to experience all the joys of being a child. Running around outside, playing sports, getting muddy when playing in the rain, scraping his knees falling over in the playground. She didn't want a ‘glass child’, it was something her and her ex-husband had agreed on as soon as they found out that she was pregnant. </p><p>She did start to worry about him a little bit when he came out at thirteen. High school was hard enough without the added pressure of being ‘different’, but she was with Agatha then and she'd reminded her that they had both been fine being out in high school, and that he had both of them on his side ready to offer any help and guidance. </p><p>Then they had the accident and she had come so close to losing him. Her whole world was balancing on a knife's edge and she felt like the walls of every room she was in were closing in on her. She had never had a panic attack before that time, but they were frequent until Billy was given the all clear to go home again. After that she was constantly worried about him. She became the overprotective and overbearing mother she'd vowed that she would never be, and their relationship suffered for it on top of the fact that she told him that she'd lied about why she and Agatha broke up. </p><p>“He's fine, he's in lectures.” She said to herself, repeating it a few times until she felt calm again and tried to think about other things. She had about fifteen minutes left to eat her lunch before going back to teaching, throwing herself back into the day was her best option right now. So she did just that. The day didn’t exactly fly by, but it moved at a good pace and when it finally ended, she got a reply from Billy.<br/><br/><b>Billy: First day went well. Alice says hi.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b>Hardly the tell-all that she was hoping for, but it was good enough for now. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p>The next day she had tried a few more times to get Billy to open up, which was fruitless so she changed her angle and asked about Agatha. But he had just asked her why she cared. A very good question. What did she actually want to come out of talking to Agatha? She definitely wanted Agatha and Billy to fix their relationship, but she knew that would take time and wasn’t something she should meddle in – no matter how much she wanted to.<br/>It was far too late to come clean and attempt to absolve Agatha of the blame that had been placed on her but Wanda at least wanted to apologise, as meek of a gesture as it might be.<br/>It was something she had never actually done. Not with the words “I’m sorry” anyway.<br/><br/>She had told Agatha about the car crash and that Billy was in the hospital, and she had dropped everything and came running. She had even let Wanda hug her in the family waiting room while he was in surgery. That whole time was equal parts a blur and seared into her memory. Some things should recall clear as day and others she wasn’t sure if they had actually happened or if she had made them up. But Agatha being there was a memory she had kept.<br/><br/>She had told Agatha when Billy was awake, when he was home and that she was welcome to go see him, but she never did. Wanda didn’t hold that against her, she knew that when Agatha said she would never step foot into the house again, she meant it. It didn’t stop her from hoping though.<br/><br/>She had even let Agatha know that Billy had passed his A Levels with flying colours and that he had been given an unconditional offer to study at his top three university choices, but Agatha hadn’t replied. The only time she had replied was when Wanda told her that Billy would be taking her module this year and even then it was only, “Thank you for letting me know.”<br/><br/>But none of these situations had contained the words “I’m sorry.”<br/><br/>As time had progressed the words had faded into obscurity. Would they even matter this far down the road? Would Agatha be open to hearing them? Was she ever open to hearing them? They both struggled with expressing their emotions. In the four years that they were together the amount of times they’d said ‘I love you’ could be counted on one hand – and in their final argument, Agatha had wielded that fact like a weapon.<br/><br/><em>“I should have known that every time you told me you loved me it was a lie. You only ever said it when you needed to tighten the locks on my cage.”</em><br/><br/>The words echoed in Wanda’s head. They had been there since she’d first heard them, burying themselves into her brain loving to pop up again in moments of vulnerability. She had never quite managed to block them out, but she deserved them being there. She knew that she did, but she didn’t want to admit that they were true. She wasn’t ready to do that yet. She might never be ready.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p>9am lectures weren’t Wanda’s favourite thing, and she didn’t believe anyone who said they enjoyed them, but she was sufficiently caffeinated and ready to attack the day. She gave her lecture to her final year students who, much like her, didn’t like having to be in morning classes, so she took pity on them and ended the lecture early. The stress of final year was something that she remembered all too well and she liked to do what she could to help alleviate it for her students. She took the opposite approach to most of her colleagues and graded their work on a less harsh curve, the students didn’t know this of course but it made her feel good knowing that her module was one that they didn’t have to worry so much about.<br/><br/>She got herself a fresh coffee and made her way back to her office for a meeting with one of her PhD students. She had decided to take two on this year, usually she had three but the pickings were so slim this year that she had to be more selective and, on top of that, she was working from Agatha’s reject pile as she had been for the last two and a half years.<br/>Agatha was always the top choice for a supervisor, it had been that way since she had decided to become a supervisor. Or more correctly, since Wanda had <em> convinced </em> her to become a supervisor.<br/><br/>She had been toying with the idea for a while and Wanda knew how good she would be at it. She was an excellent teacher and a brilliant mentor.<br/>“Your undergraduate students always achieve a high 2:1 or a 1st, and your masters students very rarely get below a distinction, so why not take that one step further?” Wanda had said and Agatha had finally agreed. It was never a competition between them, Wanda had been doing it for longer but she knew now that the requests would be split between them and she was happy that Agatha was getting the recognition that she deserved.<br/>But since they broke up, it became a competition that Agatha was determined to win, hence her only picking the best and only allowing Wanda to choose from the ones she deemed unworthy of her time.<br/><br/>She was about to turn the corner to her office when she saw someone step around a split second before she did and she side-stepped to avoid colliding with them.<br/>“Oh shit, I’m sorry!”<br/>It was Rio Vidal again. Her eyes were wide and her face was full of concern, probably because she had very nearly knocked her over again. “You’re making a bit of a habit out of this, Miss Vidal.” Their eyes met and Wanda felt her breath catch. She hadn’t really had time to take in Rio’s features the last time they met but now there was no denying that this woman was gorgeous.<br/><br/>Wanda hadn’t dated anyone else since Agatha, she had decided to dedicate more of her time to Billy – even more so after the accident – and the idea of having to start again with someone in her forties was quite a daunting one. But now here she was having to fight to keep her expression neutral as her stomach started to flip while she made eye contact with an attractive woman.<br/><br/>“Please, call me Rio. Miss Vidal is so formal. Especially since I’ve nearly killed you twice now.”<br/>The words Rio said weren’t funny, but Wanda had to laugh at how ridiculous she was being. She was a senior lecturer at Cambridge University getting butterflies over a student. A PhD student, but a student nonetheless. “I suppose that’s true. Where are you rushing off to?”<br/>“I’m going to sit in on Professor Harkness’ lecture.”<br/>There it was, the name that brought Wanda crashing back into reality. Rio wasn’t just any student. She was <em> Agatha’s </em> student and Wanda couldn’t help the animosity that coloured her words. “Isn’t an undergraduate lecture a bit beneath you?” She heard it as soon as she said it, but Rio didn’t react so maybe it hadn’t been as bad as she had thought.<br/>“You’re never too old to learn new things.”<br/>“I suppose that’s true. I’ll let you go.” Wanda started walking away but her thoughts got louder. <em> ‘Why am I letting the mention of Agatha’s name make me scared? Why am I letting her control my life so much? Fuck it.’ </em> She turned on her heel to face Rio again. “I’m sure we’ll see each other again, Rio. Though next time I hope it’s not because I’m about to have a near death experience.” She turned back the other way and continued walking. The wink had been subconscious, but she wasn’t mad about it. A little bit of flirting never hurt anyone. She subtly checked over her shoulder and smiled when she saw that Rio was watching her walk away.<br/><br/><br/><u> <b> <em>6 Years Ago</em> </b> </u> <b> <em><br/></em> </b> <b> <em><br/></em> </b> Wanda paced around her empty house, Billy was staying with his father for the night – not because she expected to be bringing Agatha home, but because she wanted to be able to process the night without having to worry about him. Also she wasn’t sure how to explain to her twelve-year-old son that she was going on a date. Her relationship with his dad had always been on and off, even during their marriage, so the only person Billy had really known her to be going on dates with was his dad. But this was someone completely new for both of them and she wanted – <em> needed </em> – to wait until she knew it was the right time to tell him.<br/><br/>When she saw Agatha standing in the warm light of her apartment she couldn’t help looking at her – <em> all </em> of her. She looked incredible from her hair to her shoes, she didn’t expect anything less but seeing it with her own eyes was different. She heard the wobble in her voice when she told Agatha that she looked amazing but she didn’t care. The woman standing before her was breath taking and she deserved to know.<br/><br/>Wanda had been worried about bringing up Billy, she had a picture of him on her desk and was not ashamed of being his mother by any means but, she didn’t know if Agatha knew about him and how she would feel about it. The news was incredibly well received and Wanda felt like she was finally able to relax and fully enjoy the date. Talking with Agatha felt effortless, there were no awkward pauses and there was equal attentive listening on both sides. It was mostly flirty small talk but Agatha made her feel like she could say anything and she would be heard.<br/><br/>The time passed around them but it felt like they were in their own special pocket that would last forever. Until a waiter had to ask them to leave. Wanda didn’t want the night to end so she walked Agatha back to her apartment to get every last minute possible from the date. Their conversation didn’t stop when they got to Agatha’s building but there was a point when Wanda knew that they had to say goodnight. Afterall, how could they have a second date if the first never ended?<br/><br/>She’d had the urge to kiss Agatha since she first saw her and when her foot had accidentally grazed Wanda’s leg in the restaurant, the feeling had sent a jolt through her. Now, standing there on the steps of Agatha’s apartment building she couldn’t resist any longer. She needed to feel Agatha’s hair between her fingers, she needed to feel Agatha’s lips on hers and she needed other things that she would definitely have to wait longer for. But she didn’t mind waiting. Not when being with Agatha already felt this right. </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">The first week of the semester ended quickly and Agatha had found her rhythm – after a bumpy start. She usually found it easy to jump back into the new academic year, but seeing Billy again had knocked her off balance and it had taken her a few days to find her footing again. She didn’t blame him of course, how could she? It was his mother’s fault. It was <em> always </em> her fault.<br/>Well, as of a two and a half years ago anyway. Before that point Agatha found that her mother was to blame for everything, but she had passed the mantle to Wanda as soon as she had given her the opportunity to do so. She couldn’t keep giving her mother the satisfaction of knowing just how badly she had messed up her daughter. The woman had been dead for twenty years for christ sake.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed on the kitchen counter and it startled her from her thoughts, it was a message from Jen.<br/><br/><b>Dinner is almost ready, where are you?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> She checked her watch and muttered “shit” before grabbing her keys and setting off.<br/>Her, Jen and Lilia had been taking turns to host each other on a Saturday night for years. It had started sporadically, then became a term-time thing, then it became monthly and finally it turned into a weekly affair. Agatha would never admit it out loud but she was glad that she had found a connection with the two of them, having them in her corner during the fallout with Wanda had been a godsend and she genuinely didn’t know how she would have gotten through it if they hadn’t been there.<br/><br/>She pulled up outside of Jen’s house and walked straight through the door. “You know leaving your door unlocked as a single woman isn’t a safe choice, Jennifer.”<br/>“Well it’s a good job you finally turned up, your glare is strong enough to destroy an army.” Jen called back from the kitchen. Agatha snorted, Jen wasn’t wrong. She took off her boots and hung up her coat before making her way to the kitchen to join her friends, taking a deep breath as she went. “Is this an original Kale creation tonight or are we feasting on the stylings of Hello Fresh?” It wasn’t a judgement, she was partial to using Hello Fresh herself.<br/>“It’s a combination.”<br/>“She’s treating us this time.” Lilia said, taking a spoon and helping herself to a taste of whatever Jen was stirring on the hob. “Though she could treat us to a little bit more salt.”<br/>Agatha laughed. “Careful Lilia, you know how precious she is over her seasonings.”<br/><br/>The three of them sat around the table, the wine flowing freely, and enjoying each other’s company. Jen had pointedly, and slightly aggressively, put the salt grinder in front of Lilia and made a quip about women of her age needing to watch their salt intake. Lilia responded by flipping her off and Jen rolled her eyes. “Always the classy lady.”<br/>Lilia waved her fork in Jen’s direction. “Look, it gets to a point where you just have to decide ‘fuck it’”<br/>Agatha raised her glass and said, “I’ll definitely drink to that!” snapping her head to Jen when she heard her snort.<br/>“Oh please, tell me when you’ve ever said ‘fuck it’ to anything.”<br/>Before Agatha could get out a clever retort, Lilia jumped in. “Other than women who aren’t good enough for her, you mean.”<br/>“Oh, I’ll drink to <em> that. </em> ” Jen knocked her glass against Lilia’s and smirked at Agatha.<br/>Agatha put her glass down and threw her hands up in mock exasperation. “Why does my relationship history always get brought up when we’re all together?”<br/><br/>The meal finished and they moved to the living room. The conversation stayed light until Jen took it upon herself to change that. She was sitting opposite Agatha and leant forwards slightly when she asked, “Did you reach a decision on how you were going to talk to Billy?”<br/>Agatha sighed, she truly didn’t have an answer to that question. She had been trying not to think about it, to push it out of her mind and hope that the nagging feeling would disappear. But it hadn’t. If anything, it had gotten <em> more </em> persistent. She knew that she would have to do it at some point, even if it was for selfish reasons. Even if the outcome wasn’t what she hoped it would be.<br/><br/>“Not yet.” She ran a hand through her hair, feeling restless all of a sudden. “It’s… delicate. Also, it’s only been a week. Would it be too soon?”<br/>Lilia turned to face her. “Do you feel like it would be too soon for you, or are you worried it would be too soon for him?”<br/>Agatha looked between her friends quietly hoping that the answer would appear in the air for her and she wouldn’t have to think of it for herself. But no such thing happened. “Yes… Both... Neither… I don’t know.” She leaned back into the sofa. “I know that Wanda told him the same lie that she told everybody else so would he even want to speak to me?”<br/><br/>She shut her eyes trying to quiet her mind. There were only a handful of people that she would allow herself to be emotional in front of, and Jen and Lilia were on that <em> very </em> short list, but she didn’t want to be emotional right now. She wanted to be able to think rationally and attack this head on like she would with any other problem that she faced. But maybe thinking of Billy as a ‘problem’, in itself, <em> was </em> the problem.<br/>He wasn’t something she could solve, he wasn’t something she could fix and he wasn’t something she could just wave away and come back to when she deemed it worth her time. He had been a big part of her life, and she his, and it was killing her that she was so close to him yet so far away at the same time.<br/><br/>“I think the fact that the situation has you reacting like this should tell you that you need to do it.” Lilia said softly. It was a fair assessment. She could put it off as long as she wanted to, but it didn’t change the fact that it needed to happen. She just had to be prepared to accept a negative reaction from Billy and she could do that.<br/><br/><em> She could do that. </em> </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha got home at the end of the day and immediately got in the shower, needing to wash the stress of the day away. She was sure that her final year students were determined to send her to an early grave, how they had managed to make it this far in their education was beyond her comprehension. <em> ‘They’re not going to last the year.’ </em> She thought, rolling her eyes. She was waiting for the inevitable lack of attendance from them, it usually started in the second semester but with the impression the current group had given her, she expected it to start sooner.<br/><br/>Her other students were pretty much what she had expected them to be. The second years had that spark of knowing that this is where everything starts to matter, so they should be vigilant with their attendance and coursework.<br/>The first years were the bright-eyed children that she was used to seeing. Eager to get stuck in and desperate to make a good impression while showing that they had heard the rumours of why you should not, under any circumstances, find your way on to Professor Agatha Harkness’ bad side.<br/>There was one first year student that had taken a place in her mind of course. Billy. She knew that Jen and Lilia were right about talking to him, so she stood under the water deciding how to do it.<br/><br/>When she finally got out of the shower she started checking room availability for the following morning and compared it to Billy’s timetable, to make sure he’d actually have the time. That way, if he said he couldn’t make it, she’d know that he was making excuses and didn’t want to talk to her. But would that be better than not knowing he was avoiding her? She ran a hand through her hair and sighed. As Lilia would say, <em> fuck it </em> . She needed to try anyway.<br/>The next obstacle was choosing between texting him or emailing him. Was emailing him too formal? Was texting him too informal? Does he even still have the same phone number? It had been a two and a half years since they’d last spoken so a text might be too personal. She chose an email.<br/><br/><b>Dear Mr. Maximoff, </b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> She deleted it. Too formal.<br/><br/><b>Hello William</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> Nope absolutely not. She rubbed her temples. <em> ‘Why is this so hard?’ </em> She took a deep breath and tried again.<br/><br/><b>Billy, </b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>I’m glad that you’re taking my module this semester and I would like it if we could talk.</b> <b><br/></b> <b>If you’re open to it, I’ll be in room C24 tomorrow at 9am. Meet me there?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Agatha</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> She read and reread it until the words no longer made sense, agonising over it until she forced herself to press send. It was done now, she couldn’t take it back. She told herself not to expect a reply. If he turns up then great and if he doesn’t then at least she’ll know that she tried, and that will have to do.<br/><br/>She spent the next few hours zoning out in front of the TV trying to keep her mind as clear as she could.<br/>Her email notification pinged and she opened it. It was from Billy. There was no preamble, just a single word.<br/><br/><b>Okay</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> She released a slow, steady breath. “Okay.” A smile started to spread across her face. “Okay.” She repeated, standing up and turning off the TV. “Okay.” She said a final time before taking herself into her room and going to bed.<br/><br/>She woke the next morning to her alarm and laid staring at the ceiling for a few minutes after turning it off. In an hour and a half she would be talking to Billy. She knew that there was no way that they’d clear two and a half years of tension in just one conversation, but it would be a start. A step in the right direction. At least, she hoped it would be. “No. No negative thoughts. This will be good.” She said out loud to motivate herself, and with that she got out of bed and began the day. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">She got to the room fifteen minutes early to prepare. Though what she was actually preparing for, she wasn’t sure. She paced the room, doing lap after lap around the desks in the centre, only stopping when she felt herself become dizzy. She sat on one of the tables whilst waiting for the room to stop spinning, biting her nails out of nervousness. She still had five minutes, she could leave now if she wanted to but the thought of walking out on Billy for a second time made her chest tighten. She couldn’t let him down again.<br/><br/>The door slowly crept open and she stood up, smoothing out her shirt. Billy walked into the room, looking as nervous as she no doubt did. His eyes flicked around the room trying to find anything to look at but her. “Hi.” He said quietly.<br/>“Hi.” She replied, smiling softly at him. He stayed standing by the open door – probably so that he could make a quick exit if he needed to. “It’s nice to see you again, Billy.” He seemed to relax a tiny bit at the softness of her words and took a step closer to her. “It’s nice to see you again too, Professor.”<br/>She chuckled quietly at his choice of words. “You don’t need to be formal, you can say my name.” She wanted to walk to him but decided to give him space, letting him make the choice of lessening both the physical and emotional gap between them. He started playing with the hem of his jumper, looking at the floor. “Why did you ask to see me, Agatha?”<br/><em> Because I miss you, kid. Because I hate the fact that I let your shit-cunt of a mother ruin our relationship. </em>But she couldn't say that… could she? She couldn't be so open right away and risk scaring him off. </p><p align="justify">“Because I wanted to check in, see how you're doing.” He looked back up at her, meeting her eyes for the first time. There was a hint of disbelief on his face. Did he think she was lying? </p><p align="justify">“You had a two and a half years to <em> check in </em>. Why wait until now?” </p><p align="justify">It was a fair question, but she hadn't gone the whole span of time without checking on him. Not really. They still lived in the same city, just not in the same house any more. She would sometimes park across the street from his school just to catch a glimpse of him leaving, trying to work up the courage to say hi but she tried not to make a habit of it in case she ended up on a register. Jen and Lilia would let her know if they'd seen him out and about and tell her if he seemed happy, had friends and was generally doing okay. </p><p align="justify">She was beside herself when she found out that he and Wanda had been in a car accident and he was in the hospital. Thankfully Wanda had seen fit to let her know and keep her updated on his condition. She had gone to see him a couple of times but he had been unconscious and hadn't known she was there. When he had woken up, she rushed over to see him but left again when she saw both of his parents there. She hadn't wanted to add any unnecessary stress for him. <br/>But now? Now she had an excuse – no, an opportunity – to reconnect with him and she wasn't going to miss it. </p><p align="justify">“I know. I could make excuses and blame whomever I wanted, or needed, to blame but I'm not going to do that. I should have done this sooner and I'm sorry.” She couldn't look at him any more. Her guilt was too heavy to keep eye contact and she leant against the table for support. She heard him move, felt him shuffle closer and sit on the table next to her but she still couldn't look at him. Not yet. </p><p align="justify">“I'm sorry too. I let my mum get in my head and convince me that you were the bad guy.” She turned her head slightly towards him, still not able to look at his face, but she could see him nervously picking at his fingernails – a habit he got from his mother – as he continued. “I hated you for a long time.” </p><p align="justify">Her breath got caught in her throat and her chest tightened. She wasn't naïve, she knew that he would have had negative feelings towards her. But hearing him say it was something else entirely. It made it real, it made the whole situation ten times worse. Suddenly all the hatred she held towards Wanda paled in comparison to the way she felt hearing Billy say those words. </p><p align="justify">“I am so sorry that you got caught up in this. You didn't deserve it, you were just a child.” She forced herself to look him in the eye, he deserved her full attention. He deserved so much more than that, but it was all she could offer in that moment. “I can't take back that time and I can't erase the way I made you feel, no matter how much I wish I could.” She took a shaky breath. “But I can promise that I will do anything I can to make it up to you. I really miss you, kid.” </p><p align="justify">He smiled, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. “I'm not a kid.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh sorry. Teen.” She leant into him, nudging him gently with her shoulder and his smile brightened. “I know that we're not going to fix this in one day, but I want you to know that I'm willing to listen to you. You can tell me how you felt and I'll answer any questions you have.”<br/>He dipped his head, thinking for a moment. “Did you ever think about coming to see me?” </p><p align="justify">She could feel tears start to well in her eyes, he was still so hurt by her leaving. “Of course I did!” She winced at how harsh her tone was. She didn't mean it to come out like that and consciously softened it when she spoke again. “I spent ages trying to work up the courage to talk to you but I guess I was scared that you wouldn't want to talk to me. I also didn't want you to feel like you had to talk to me if you didn't want to.” </p><p align="justify">He looked back up at her, meeting her eyes again, his own eyes starting to shine with tears. “At the start I was angry with you. When I came home from school, and mum told me that you'd gone because you'd found somebody else, I wanted to find you, to scream at you, to ask how you could do that to us.”</p><p align="justify">Wanda's lie wasn't new to Agatha, the rumour had flown through the faculty at record speed, but it still didn't hurt any less. “Billy you know that isn't true, don't you?” <br/>He nodded. “I found out about a year later. She told me when we got home from the hospital. I guess that she felt guilty after I nearly died and told me the truth.” He laughed but there was no humour in it. “Every cloud, as they say.” </p><p align="justify">She wanted to hug him but didn't want to overstep his boundaries so she opted for a soft and gentle smile instead. “I visited you in the hospital, your mother at least had the decency to let me know that you were hurt. I was there when you woke up as well but I didn't want to add to the stress of the situation and overwhelm you, so I didn't go into your room. I watched you from the window for a few minutes and left.” <br/>His eyes went wide and his mouth dropped open slightly. “You were there? I thought I was going crazy! I saw you in the window but when it dawned on me that it was you, and I looked again, you were gone.”</p><p align="justify">Oh that made her heart ache. He'd seen her there but because of her own fear, her own unwillingness to be in the same room as Wanda and Billy’s father, she had denied herself the chance of speaking to him. She had denied <em> him </em> the chance of speaking to her. She couldn't stop the tears that started to fall. “I'm so sorry, Billy. I'm sorry that I didn't go in and see you when you woke up. I'm sorry that I waited this long to talk to you again. I never stopped caring about you.” She gasped when he moved towards her and wrapped his arms around her. It took her a few seconds to process what was happening before she hugged him back. Billy was crying now as well and they both stayed there for a minute holding each other, their combined pain, anger and hurt starting the slow transformation into forgiveness.<br/><br/>“I shouldn’t have listened to my mum.” Billy said into her shoulder. “I knew deep down that the story didn’t add up, that you weren’t the type of person to do that.” He tightened his grip ever so slightly, as if he was trying to scoop up some of the broken pieces of their past.  </p><p align="justify">When they pulled apart Agatha couldn't resist ruffling his hair. “I like the new look, kid. It suits you.”<br/>He pushed her hand away in feigned annoyance. “I'm not a kid.” </p><p align="justify">They sat in comfortable silence for a moment before Billy spoke again. “I think my mum really wants to speak to you. I think she wants to explain herself, you should try to listen to her.” </p><p align="justify">Agatha scoffed, it was an involuntary reaction but she meant it all the same. “With respect ki- <em> teen. </em> I won't be doing that.” She stood up and wiped the tears from her cheeks. She didn’t want to think about his mother right now, let alone entertain the idea of speaking to her. “Don't you have a lecture to go to? You shouldn't be late, I hear your professor is a real hard arse.” She said with a wink. </p><p align="justify">He laughed. This time it was a real laugh and the smile that went with it reached his eyes. Agatha couldn't help but smile too as he walked to the door. “Agatha?” He said, turning back.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah?”</p><p align="justify">“Thank you for this.” </p><p align="justify">She gave him a nod and he left the room. Agatha let out a strong exhale and ran a hand through her hair, giving him a few minutes before leaving as well.<br/><br/>She knew that this was the first of many conversations they were going to have, and she was looking forward to their relationship being fully rebuilt. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify"><b><em>1 Year Ago</em></b><br/><br/>It was a Thursday afternoon just like any other. Agatha was at work giving lectures like usual and her students were underwhelming, like usual. <em>‘How hard is it for final years to put some effort in?’</em> she thought as she scanned the surprisingly small group of students that had actually attended her lecture. She would never have dreamed of missing classes while she was a student, her need for perfection – and her mother – wouldn’t have allowed it. She had always had a perfect attendance from primary school all the way through her masters, and when she became a lecturer that record was maintained with precision. She prided herself on it, even more so now that she had to rebuild her reputation as a person thanks to her wonderful ex’s lies. Which is why there had been so much shock and awe when she had abruptly left midway through the lecture with no attempt to explain herself.<br/><br/>Her phone had been on the table next to her laptop, silent like usual so that it wouldn’t distract her. But as luck would have it she happened to be standing at the laptop flicking to the next slide when she saw the incoming call. Usually she would have ignored it, she was teaching and she hated her flow being interrupted, but the name on her screen gave her pause.<br/><br/><b>Maximoff</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Agatha knew that there was absolutely no way <em>that woman</em> would attempt to call her, especially not in the middle of a teaching day. This was either a mistake or something that needed her immediate attention. She scowled at her phone and rejected the call, she was not in the mood for her right now. She was never in the mood for her. But as soon as she’d pressed the button, Wanda’s name was back on her screen. <em>Not a mistake.</em> She apologised to the few students that had decided her lecture was worth their time, excusing herself from the room before she answered the call.<br/><br/>“Agatha? Agatha, are you there?” Wanda’s voice came through the phone before Agatha had put it to her ear.<br/>“What do you want?” Her tone was biting. This had better be important or so help her god she would make Wanda regret it.<br/>Wanda’s response came in a fast, panicked voice. “I was driving and there must have been a patch of ice. I hit it and I lost control of the car and hit a tree. He was in the back and there was so much blood and he wasn’t breathing.” She was sobbing now, barely able to form the words she was saying and Agatha was struggling to understand her.<br/>“Wanda I cannot understand a wor-”<br/>“Billy!” She choked out. “Billy is dying!”<br/><br/>Agatha felt her blood turn cold and her heart began to pound so hard that she thought it would break her ribs. “Tell me exactly where you are. I’m on my way.” Wanda gave her the address of the hospital and she went back into the lecture hall beelining for the table. She snapped the lid of her laptop closed, disconnected it from the projector and threw her jacket on. “This lecture is over, you are all dismissed.” She didn’t look at her students as she spoke and immediately went to her car, throwing her bag on the passenger seat and sped out of the car park.<br/><br/>She definitely broke numerous traffic laws but she didn’t care, she was getting to that hospital. She sprinted into the A&amp;E building and up to the reception desk. “Tell me where William Maximoff is.” She demanded.<br/>The receptionist was unbothered, probably used to this kind of unruly behaviour. “Ma'am, as you can see there is a queue. If you could joi-”<br/>“I don’t have time for your queue, I need to know where he is now!” She wasn’t one to be rude to customer service workers unprovoked, but these were extenuating circumstances and she didn’t have the mental capacity for niceties right now.<br/>“I appreciate that ma’am, but I can’t do anything for you right now. You’ll have to join the queue.” The receptionist kept their tone calm and their expression neutral, no doubt from years of perfecting it. Agatha wasn’t stupid, she knew that the receptionist wasn’t doing this to personally attack her, they were just doing their job. She huffed and threw her hands up, reluctantly walking to the back of the queue. “Fine!”<br/><br/>She could feel the eyes of everybody in the waiting area on her after her display. She didn’t care, her boy was somewhere in this hospital in god knows what state and she needed to see him.<br/><em>Her boy.</em><br/>The thought repeated on her as she stood trying to calm her breathing. He wasn’t her boy anymore, he hadn’t really been her boy at all. Wanda had ruined all chances of that happening.<br/><br/>She could feel a fresh wave of anger building in her chest as the queue slowly went down. She hated that Wanda could still make her feel this way a year after their relationship had ended. She hated that she was standing in a hospital waiting room worrying about Billy but still finding some way to let her past with his mother push its way to the front of her mind. She hated that she hadn’t found a way to move on from it yet.<br/><br/>It was finally her turn at the front of the queue and she approached the desk with a much calmer demeanor. “William Maximoff was brought in here after a car accident. Would you be able to tell me where I can find him please?”<br/>“What is your name please?”<br/>“Agatha Harkness.”<br/>The receptionist typed something on the keyboard before saying, “you can go to Family Room B. It’s just down the corridor to your left and it’ll be the third room on the right.”<br/>“Thank you.”<br/><br/>She wanted to run but she forced herself to walk calmly. She had no idea what was waiting for her on the other side of that door and didn’t want to rush into it. She stood outside the room and took a breath before walking in.<br/>The room was small and square with white walls and a few chairs along each wall. There were a few generic canvases hung up, one was of a beach and another was of a blue sky with a couple of clouds dotted around. They were probably meant to be calming and Agatha would later realise that they didn’t achieve their purpose.<br/><br/>Wanda was pacing in the far corner anxiously biting her nails and it wasn’t until the door clicked shut that she looked up. Her face was red and swollen from all the crying she had been doing and there was a long cut across her right cheek that had been stitched back together.<br/><br/>She ran to Agatha and threw her arms around her pulling her into a tight hug and Agatha instinctively wrapped her arms around her in response.<br/>“You came.” Wanda sobbed into Agatha’s shoulder. Usually Agatha would be shouting at anyone who dared to get close to her cashmere jacket, never mind crying on it. But right here, right now, she couldn’t give a flying fuck. She held Wanda close as the sobs wracked her body absentmindedly rubbing soothing circles on her back. It was like muscle memory, just an instinct that took over.<br/><br/>“Of course I came. It’s Billy.” She could feel her own tears starting to prickle the corners of her eyes but she wasn’t ready for them to fall yet. Wanda needed her to be strong. <em>Billy</em> needed her to be strong. She slowly unwrapped herself and stood back from Wanda’s embrace. “Let’s sit down and you can tell me what happened.”<br/>They walked to the chairs and she noticed that Wanda was walking with a limp. “Is your leg okay?”<br/>Wanda winced as she slowly lowered herself into her seat. “Yeah, just badly bruised. The doctor said I need to rest it for a week and come back if it gets any worse.” She let out a quiet, humourless laugh and Agatha sat in the chair next to her. She looked at the gash on her cheek and could now properly see how deep it was. “Shouldn’t that have an extra covering on it?” Wanda looked at her confused for a moment before realising what she meant. “Oh. They tried but I refused to let them do anything else until I saw Billy. He’s in surgery. They said something about a potential bleed on his brain. I don’t know, it was all so much to take in.” She sighed and closed her eyes, dipping her head slightly.<br/><br/>Agatha looked at her, slowly taking in the understandably disheveled state she was in. She was picking at her cuticles, a nervous habit that Agatha had helped her work on while they were together, but now they were freshly bleeding. Agatha slowly reached over, taking Wanda’s hand and lacing their fingers together. She heard Wanda’s breath catch at the unexpected gesture and they met each other's gaze. “He’s going to be okay.” Agatha said, giving her hand a gentle squeeze.<br/><br/>She didn’t know where any of this was coming from. Ten minutes ago the thought of being this close to Wanda would have repulsed her, but maybe she needed the comfort as much as Wanda did.<br/>“Thank you for being here.” Wanda whispered. “I don’t know what I’ll do if he doesn’t make it.” She started crying again and Agatha pulled her into another hug.<br/>“Don’t think about that. He’s going to be fine.” She was more telling herself than Wanda at this point but it didn’t matter, she needed to be the one who was keeping it together right now so she would say and do whatever she needed to make that happen.<br/>“Is his dad on the way?” It had taken her until now to realise that Wanda had been alone in this room until she had arrived. She hadn’t had any idea what she would be walking into when she came to the hospital but she was now thinking that it was strange that he wasn’t here.<br/><br/>Wanda pulled back and ran her hands through her hair, realisation crossing her face. “Oh god I didn’t even think… You were the first person I called. You were the <em>only</em> person I called.” She stood up and began pacing again. “How could I not think to let him know? I’m a terrible person. His son is dying in hospital and I didn’t let him know.” She kept talking and limping laps around the room. Agatha let her do it for a moment thinking that she would talk out her thoughts and sit back down again, but she kept going, spiraling further and further until Agatha spoke.<br/>“Wanda.” Her tone was clipped now, losing the softness she had entered the room with. Wanda needed someone to ground her, to stop her mind from wandering and Agatha still knew how to tell when to do just that. She’d had four years of learning these things about Wanda but she was surprised by how natural it still felt, how in tune she still was to her.<br/><br/>Wanda stopped mid-step and snapped her head towards Agatha, the sharpness of her tone clearly surprising her. “Call him.” She just nodded and pulled out her phone.<br/>Agatha sat silently, listening to Wanda run through the events again. She was a lot calmer this time around, still pacing but no tears and Agatha sat patiently, waiting for the phone call to finish.<br/><br/>Wanda sighed. “He’s on his way.”<br/>“Good. Now sit back down, you need to rest your leg.”<br/>Wanda did as she was told and they sat in silence for a few minutes. Given the circumstances the silence couldn’t be described as comfortable but there wasn’t any awkwardness in it. Agatha thought back to the hug and how she had welcomed it without question, how the hatred she had towards Wanda had faded away as soon as she’d seen how broken she looked. She thought about the gentleness in how she’d held Wanda’s hand, the fact that she had been Wanda’s first port of call and what it all meant.<br/><em>‘No, I’m here for Billy and nothing else. He is my only concern.’</em><br/><br/>It would be easy to read into all, to try and decipher all the hidden meanings, but it wouldn't do any good. It wouldn’t fix anything between them. There was still a deep lack of trust that Wanda had planted and its roots had grown too thick to be pulled out by this one thing.<br/>There was also the fear that if – no, <em>when</em> – Billy woke up, he wouldn’t want to see her. But she couldn’t let herself get hung up on that. She just needed to be there in the moment.<br/><br/>Wanda cleared her throat, breaking the silence. “Will you stay?”<br/>Agatha looked at her, raising an eyebrow in confusion. “What do you mean?”<br/>“When Vis gets here, will you stay?”<br/><em>Absolutely fucking not. I would rather die than be in a room with the both of you. Why would I want to put myself through that?</em><br/>These were all the things she wanted to say, they were the words that immediately came to her mind in response. But she didn’t say any of them, she just nodded. She didn’t trust herself to speak in case she verbalised her thoughts. At the end of the day, she was there for Billy and that was it.<br/><br/>She stayed at the hospital until Billy was out of surgery and played nice with his dad, though it did take some effort to keep her snide remarks to herself. When she said that she was leaving, Wanda gave her a hug goodbye and thanked her again for being there. The hug lingered until Agatha saw Billy’s father watching them and she pulled away. She smoothed out her shirt and cleared her throat. “I’ll come back in a couple of days. Let me know if anything happens.”<br/>Wanda nodded. “I will.”<br/><br/>Agatha managed to hold herself together as she drove home, but as soon as she stepped over the threshold of her house she broke. She couldn’t stop the tears that fell or the way that her knees buckled and she immediately sank to the floor. She sat there leaning against her front door for hours, letting out every single bit of emotion that she had kept locked away all day.<br/>It had been decades since she’d cried herself to sleep, but that night, the counter reset. </p>

<p>Having had a talk with Billy, Agatha felt more at ease. She felt like she was no longer struggling to keep her balance while navigating being his lecturer. It wasn’t easy to knock her confidence, not outwardly anyway, she always had a response or an answer for everything. It kept her two steps ahead, just where she wanted to be. Where she <em> belonged. </em> But she couldn’t deny that the uncertainty that surrounded seeing him again had worried her to the point that other faculty members had noticed that she was slightly off her game. A couple of them had even dared to approach her after a staff meeting and ask if she was okay. That had been the kick in the arse she had needed to talk to him – Lilia and Jen had also had a hand in it but if she had to be fueled by an emotion, she would rather it be spite than anything else.<br/>She couldn’t have the people who had once shunned her for her supposed affair think that it was suddenly okay to check up on her.<br/>No, that simply would not do. So she had spoken to him and felt infinitely better for it.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p><br/>She was sitting in her office waiting for her weekly meeting with Rio to begin, feeling positive that she would be able to devote her full attention to it now that the distraction of Billy was in the process of being righted.<br/>There was a knock at her door at 9am exactly. “You may enter.”<br/>Rio walked into the room with a polite smile. “Good morning, Professor Harkness.”<br/>“Good morning, Miss Vidal.” Agatha returned the smile. “Please, take a seat.” She waited for Rio to sit down and take her laptop out of her bag before continuing. “Why don’t you tell me where your research has taken you this week.”<br/>“Well, after your lecture, I went down a bit of a Hades and Persephone rabbit hole.” She opened something on her laptop. “I’ve always been intrigued by their story and the different ways in which it has been told over time. You know like how some people view it as a great love story and others view it as an abusive relationship et cetera.”<br/><br/>She handed her laptop to Agatha and she lifted her eyebrows in surprise. It was a powerpoint presentation. Rio had actually taken the time to make a slideshow to give to her. She had expected “I read this book…” or “I watched this movie…” but this was above her expectations. It was twenty slides on the variations of the myths surrounding the Gods, compiled from a myriad of sources. She flicked through it, skimming the information Rio had written down. It was almost as good as her own. <em>Almost.</em><br/><br/>“Miss Vidal, this is–”<br/>“I know, it’s a lot. And I know a powerpoint is strange but it helps me arrange my thoughts better.” Her tone was sheepish and she gave a nervous chuckle after.<br/>“I have to say tha–”<br/>“Oh, I know the writing leaves some things to be desired but this is just notes and nothing is set in stone yet.”<br/>Agatha lifted a hand to silence her. It was a gesture that she had perfected and it always worked. The joy she felt being able to control someone with a simple motion never failed to give her a rush.<br/><br/>“Miss Vidal, are you going to let me speak?” She kept her voice carefully neutral, but there was a commanding undertone that suggested she chose to phrase it as a question in a gesture of being nice. She saw the surprise flash across Rio’s face and noticed her throat bob as she swallowed. She felt a satisfied smile tug at the corners of her mouth and let the silence hang for a second. “Thank you.” She waited a beat, before continuing. “This is good work. I can tell that you’ve put effort into this and that you haven’t haphazardly thrown it together.”<br/>She was impressed but she wasn’t going to tell Rio that. “Your list of sources is good and the information is laid out nicely.”<br/><br/>There was a moment of silence before Agatha realised why Rio wasn’t responding. She was waiting to be told that she could. <em>Interesting.</em> Agatha sat back in her chair. “You may speak.”<br/>Rio’s shoulders dropped slightly like she had just released a breath. “Thank you, Professor.” She shifted her position in her chair slightly, and Agatha couldn’t tell if it was because she was uncomfortable or if it was something else.<br/>Rio cleared her throat. “I also started doing some research on Orpheus and Eurydice on the back of this because of the musical Hadestown, and how it links them in with Hades and Persephone. I don’t know if you’ve heard of it, but it's really good.”<br/>Agatha gave a small smile. “I’m familiar with it.” In truth, she loved it. She had seen it three times and – she would never tell another living soul this – she had cried every time.<br/><br/>She handed Rio her laptop and had to fight to ignore the feeling in her chest when their fingers brushed, she also had to fight to not linger. “Do you think you could do it?”<br/>“Do what?”<br/>She moved from her desk to sit in the chair opposite Rio, feeling her eyes on her tracking her movements. “Do you think you could lead Eurydice back to the surface and not turn around?” She crossed her legs. “Or Orpheus, I don’t know your preferences.” She tacked on, nonchalantly. Not that she wanted to know Rio’s preferences, she just wasn’t one to assume.<br/><br/>Rio chuckled before saying, “I would be leading Eurydice.” Agatha felt her stomach flip but she wasn’t about to get bogged down by thinking of why that was. “But I honestly don’t know if I would be able to do it. I think I would be too in my head, like Orpheus was.” Their eyes met and Agatha noticed the way Rio’s shined as she thought about the question, and she began to wonder who Rio was picturing as her Eurydice. Probably a young blonde with bright blue eyes, they were everyone’s type these days.<br/>“What about you?” Rio’s voice brought her back into the room.<br/>She hummed, mulling it over. “I’ve never really thought about it.” Would she ever love someone enough to try? Would this hypothetical person do it for her? Now she was putting <em>too </em>much thought into it. “I suppose if I loved someone the way that Orpheus loved Eurydice I would definitely give it a go.”<br/>“So you would be leading Eurydice too?” Rio asked while raising an eyebrow, a smirk beginning to spread across her face.<br/>“That is an extremely personal question, Miss Vidal. One that has no place in our meetings.” Her tone was back to the cold, no-nonsense one she usually carried. She never shared personal information with anyone, let alone a student.<br/><br/>Rio’s smirk dropped and the teasing sparkle in her eyes faded into something different. She didn’t strike Agatha as someone who liked to be put in her place but she also wasn’t making any moves to defend herself either. Agatha felt a surge of satisfaction rise in her chest at the fact that she had managed to regain her control over their meetings. After the unfortunate way the first couple had gone, it was about time she got her grip again.<br/><br/>Rio now looked incredibly uncomfortable, which Agatha liked. She was used to students doing everything they could to avoid her gaze, it was familiar territory. It reminded her that she was very much in charge and that was where she belonged. However, these meetings would be worthless if Rio was now afraid to speak – much like meetings with her past PhD students had been – so she swallowed some of her pride and apologised. “I like to keep my personal and professional lives separate. I apologise for snapping.” Her tone was still stiff, but it had slightly more warmth than when she had last spoken.<br/><br/>Rio took a few seconds before speaking and when she did, her voice took on a cocky edge. “You didn’t seem too concerned with the separation of personal from professional when you asked me.” There was a hint of smirk back on her lips and Agatha could feel a flush start in her chest.<br/>“I beg your pardon.”<br/>“You asked me what my <em>preferences</em> were. How come personal questions are only off the table when they’re about you?” She lazily leaned back in her chair.<br/>Agatha crossed her arms. Rio was clearly trying to get a rise out of her and she was not going to bite. “You offered that information up freely, Miss Vidal. It isn’t my fault that you didn’t keep it to yourself.”<br/>“I didn’t feel the need to keep it to myself.” Rio’s tone was light but there was something darker in her eyes that Agatha couldn’t quite place. “I’m not ashamed of it.”<br/><br/>She felt the flush rising onto her neck and clenched her jaw, keeping her gaze locked on Rio. “I’m not sure that I know what you’re implying, Miss Vidal.” She was getting irritated now. She still had the upper hand but she could feel her grip loosening. If Rio kept pushing, she would snap. She was not ashamed of who she was, far from it. Her mother had tried her hardest to make her feel like she was born wrong and she would damn well not stand for it again from anyone. But Rio was her student and she did not discuss her personal life with her students. She might have had her share of complaints against her for how she spoke to her students, but her professionalism was never called into question and that was how it would stay.<br/><br/>“I’m not implying anything. I am simply offering information up freely.” Rio stated and crossed her arms. Agatha took a deep breath trying to ignore the way that her pulse had quickened. Rio Vidal was <em>not</em> getting under her skin. The insinuation was absurd and quite frankly, stupid. She was absolutely not trying to claw back control. “We have wondered spectacularly off topic. None of this has anything to do with Greek Mythology, and since that’s why we’re here, I think it would be appropriate for us to continue in that direction. Don’t you agree?” Her tone was clipped and she knew that her eyes conveyed her annoyance because the cocky smile on Rio’s face faltered slightly.<br/><br/>Rio uncrossed her arms and sat straight in her chair again. “Of course, you’re right. My apologies Professor.” The words were sincere but there was an undertone in Rio’s voice that Agatha couldn’t quite work out. Either way she would not rise to whatever this was, whatever game Rio was trying to play with her. She would not lose control of the meeting. “Do you have a structure for your research, or is it just whatever takes your fancy in the moment?” She leaned back casually in an attempt to appear unbothered by the conversation that had just transpired. She didn’t know if it worked because Rio gave nothing away. She just kept her eyes trained on her, watching her every move.<br/><br/>“I don’t have a structure as such, but I’m working on it.” She leaned forwards. “That’s the thing I tend to have trouble with actually.”<br/>Agatha uncrossed her legs and recrossed them the opposite way, watching Rio’s eyes follow the movement before lazily making their way back to her face. It gave her a feeling in her stomach that she didn’t want to acknowledge. “Well that’s why you have a supervisor, is it not? It is quite literally my job to help with things like that.”<br/>Rio laughed “I can send you the chaos that is my notes and you can see if you can save them. But I will warn you, it’s not for the faint of heart.” She punctuated it with a lopsided smile.<br/>“I’m sure my heart can handle the disorganisation of a PhD student, Miss Vidal.” She had to work to keep her voice flat because it was verging on being playful and that was not the tone she wanted to set for her interactions with Rio. She didn’t ‘play’ with her students. She was their superior, that’s the way it had always been and that is how it would remain.<br/><br/>Rio’s tongue glanced over the corner of her mouth and Agatha was acutely aware of how her eyes darted to the movement. What was wrong with her? She felt heat starting to creep into her cheeks and prayed to every deity she knew of that the colour wasn’t showing.<br/>“Okay, I’ll send them to you and you can see what you make of them.” Rio leaned back again. If Agatha was blushing, Rio didn’t seem to notice. Or she did and just wasn’t calling attention to it. Either way, it was a good thing.<br/><br/>“What exactly is it about structuring your thesis that you’re struggling with?”<br/>Rio crossed her legs and folded her hands in her lap. “I’ve never really been good at getting the flow right. That was always the feedback I got on every essay that I turned in.” There was a vulnerability in the way that she spoke and Agatha wondered if it was because she was embarrassed about it. Her CV showed that she was very academically inclined so the fact that she struggled to structure her work might cause some self-consciousness.<br/>Agatha nodded. “When you say flow, do you mean getting all of the information to link together?”<br/>“Yeah, that’s exactly it. The information is correct, it’s just a bit disjointed.”<br/>Agatha hummed. “Okay well, that is definitely something that I can help with. Keep making your notes as you usually would and in our next meeting we will work on organising them.”<br/><br/>“Okay. Are there any particular areas you think I should focus on, Professor?” The way she said ‘Professor’ was strange. It was like she was having to try to appear professional, like it was something she struggled with. Or was it just Agatha that she struggled with and, if so, why?<br/>“Just try to keep it as concise as you can for the time being, you have plenty of time to flesh it out and add more to it. There’s no sense in burning yourself out before you’ve even started.”<br/>Rio nodded and hummed her agreement.<br/><br/>Agatha checked her watch, there was still some time until she had to give her lecture. The meeting didn’t need to last the entire part of her schedule that she had allotted for it, but it would be silly to not use it. “We still have some time left. Is there anything else you want to discuss?” She put the decision of using the remaining time in Rio’s hands. These meetings were for her benefit after all. </p><p>Rio fidgeted with her hands for a moment before responding. “What piqued your interest in Greek Mythology.”<br/>Agatha sighed. “I meant about your thesis, Miss Vidal.” <em> ‘When will she get the hint that I don’t discuss myself with students?’ </em> She thought.<br/>“This is for my thesis.” There was an insistent tone to her voice and Agatha couldn’t deny that she was interested in how Rio could spin this to be relevant.<br/>“Please, enlighten me.”<br/>Rio leaned forwards again. “You haven’t read Percy Jackson which is, to use your own words,  a gateway drug. So what piece of media opened your mind to it?”<br/><br/>Agatha thought before answering. She could be honest and risk inviting further probing questions or she could lie and pick something generic like Clash Of The Titans and be done with it.<br/>“My mother read The Odyssey to me when I was a child.” Not a complete lie, but not the complete truth either. It was safely in the middle.<br/>“Oh wow, one of the OGs.” Rio’s eyebrows were raised in surprise. “How old were you?”<br/>“This is getting personal again, Miss Vidal.” She shifted in her seat, straightening her back and taking on a more authoritative posture.<br/>Rio dipped her head and exhaled in a way that could be interpreted as annoyance. But she wouldn’t dare express that in such an obvious way, would she? If that was the case then Agatha simply would not stand for it. “I am not in the business of discussing myself or my life with my students, Miss Vidal. I am your supervisor and our meetings are in place to work on your thesis and, when it comes to it, your viva.”<br/><br/>Rio raised her head to look at her again and straightened her posture. “I’m not trying to pry into your personal life, Professor. Surely you can see why inquiring as to how you found your interest in Greek Mythology to the point where you wanted to teach other people about it, is relevant to my thesis.” There was no mistaking it this time, there was definite annoyance in the way she spoke. “You don’t have to tell me your life story but a discussion requires both parties to be able to share information that relates to the topic at hand.”<br/><br/>Agatha tensed her jaw and narrowed her eyes, her voice dropping low. “I do not take kindly to being told off by a subordinate, Miss Vidal.” She spoke slowly, enunciating each word precisely. Never before had a student spoken to her in this manner but she would be damned if she let it throw her off.<br/>“And I don’t take kindly to being spoken down to by someone who thinks their title gives them the right to.” There was a fire in Rio’s eyes that Agatha noticed immediately. She recognised it as the same fire that she had herself. This woman was infuriatingly similar to her and it was beginning to cause issues.<br/><br/>“If you cannot respect me as your superior, Miss Vidal, then I suggest that you find a new supervisor.” She could hear the volume of her voice rising. She usually favoured the quiet anger, the kind that strikes fear into people, but Rio Vidal was pissing her off and she could feel the heat burning in her chest.<br/>Rio scoffed. “When you give me a reason to respect you, <em> Professor Harkness </em> , you shall have it.” The callback to their first conversation wasn’t lost on Agatha – and neither was the way that Rio spat her name – she was very aware that she was using her own words against her. Rio stood up and threw her laptop back into her bag.<br/>“Miss Vidal, sit back down.”<br/>“No!” Rio’s voice was raised now as well. “Other people might allow you to speak to them in this way, but I won’t. Your reputation at this university might be good, but it does not give you the right to talk to people like they are beneath you. Like I said before, you aren't the only lecturer that I wanted to be my supervisor so I will gladly go and find her.” She started towards the door.<br/><br/><em> Absolutely. Fucking. Not. </em> Rio was once again wielding the threat of Wanda Maximoff and Agatha would not, under any circumstances, allow that woman to win anything. Even if that thing was an obscenely, irritatingly, impressive PhD student who had managed to rile her up to this extent.<br/><br/>“Wait.” She said, standing up too. Rio’s hand was on the door handle but by the grace of god, she stopped.<br/>“What?” She bit out, not turning around.<br/>It was a good question. What was Agatha going to say? What excuse was she going to come up with to rationalise the way she had just behaved?<br/><em> “Don’t go” </em> was pathetic.<br/><em> “Please come back” </em> was even worse.<br/><em> “Don’t go running to my ex because I can’t seem to keep a grip on myself around you” </em> was absolutely fucking absurd.<br/><br/>The silence stretched as Agatha battled her own thoughts and Rio just stood there, still holding the door handle, but doing as Agatha had asked. She was waiting.<br/>“I’m sorry.” Agatha hated how weak her voice sounded, how weak her choice of words was.<br/>Rio laughed, it was dark and colored with disbelief. “Are you being fucking serious?” She dropped her hand and finally turned around. “You accuse me of prying into your personal life, talk down to me, call me a fucking <em> subordinate </em> and the best you can come up with is ‘I’m sorry’?” She shook her head, still laughing.<br/>Agatha was definitely blushing now. She wasn't used to students, or anyone for that matter, fighting back. People usually cowered under her gaze and flinched at her words – they certainly did not hurl profanities at her. But Rio wasn't like everyone else, she stood her ground. She wasn't afraid to speak to Agatha in the way that she spoke to her and she clearly wasn't going to give her the satisfaction of sticking around while Agatha used her as a verbal punching bag. No, this woman was different and Agatha found her intriguing. </p><p>“Well what do you want me to say?” She threw her arms out in exasperation. “Do you want me to beg for your forgiveness? Because I can assure you, Miss Vidal, that will not be happening.” God this was all so juvenile. Why was she arguing with a student over something as mundane as this? Maybe she should just let Rio go to Wanda because this was clearly not going to work.<br/>Rio took a step towards her, slow and deliberate. “Answer my question.”<br/>“Which one?” Agatha did her best to come across as nonchalantly as possible but she heard the quiver in her voice. Her cage had been rattled and now she was frantically flapping around trying to find her perch again while a flurry of feathers cascaded around her.<br/><br/>“How old were you when you read The Odyssey?”<br/>Was she being fucking serious? Why was she so stuck on this?<br/>Agatha quirked an eyebrow, “Seriously?” The word was dripping with incredulity. What was Rio hoping to achieve with this? What was her goal?<br/>She was just standing there waiting for Agatha to answer her.<br/>Agatha sighed and rolled her eyes. “Ten.” She said, louder than she intended. “I was ten years old. Are you happy now?” She crossed her arms, feeling like a petulant child who had just been forced to admit to breaking a glass ornament.<br/><br/>How had the roles been reversed so easily? How had she <em>let</em> them be reversed so easily? She wouldn’t usually stand for this, she wouldn’t usually allow anyone to come close to this. She <em>always</em> had the upper hand, she was <em>always</em> at the helm of every conversation she was a part of, so how had this managed to spin so spectacularly out of control? How had Rio gotten so under her skin and <em>why did she care so much?</em><br/><br/>The way that Rio was looking at her made her stomach clench. There was something in her eyes. Did she look pleased? Or did she look excited? No, that couldn't be it. She looked smug, and Agatha didn’t like that one bit. She had allowed herself to be backed into a corner by a <em>student</em> and it would absolutely never happen again. “I’m not sure what you hoped to achieve with this, Miss Vidal, but I assure you that this is the first and last time anything like this will happen. I do <em>not</em> share personal information with students and I am the one who gets to determine what classes as personal information.” Her arms were still crossed, but her fists were now clenched on the sleeves of her shirt. “Now stop acting like a child.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows went skyward. “I’m acting like a child? You’re the one that threw a tantrum when I asked you a basic question about yourself.” She took another step towards her. “I get that you want to keep your work and private lives separate, and I am aware that I overstepped when I asked if you would be leading Eurydice so I apologise for that. But, like I said, if we are to be having discussions then some generic information will have to be given on both sides.” There was still a harshness in her voice but it was quieter now and the sharp look in her eyes had softened.<br/><br/>Agatha slowly unclenched her jaw, feeling the dull ache of the muscles complaining about the strain she had put them under. She had been staring intensely at Rio for so long now that she could probably sculpt her face out of marble – not that she would ever want to. </p><p>She began to question why it was that she was so unwilling to give even the smallest piece of herself to another person. Her mother was the obvious answer. Being raised by an emotionally stunted woman had done wonders to influence her self-esteem. There was so little that Evanora Harkness approved of that she learned to hide parts of herself until the parts that were left on show were just a tiny sliver of who she actually was. </p><p>And of course there was Wanda. She'd had relationships before Wanda, but none of them had been that intense, none of them had lasted that long and she wasn't sure she had actually been in love before Wanda. She had opened up to her, told her about her mother, her childhood and she had started to feel like she wasn't broken anymore.</p><p>But when they broke up, she packaged all of that back up and buried it deep inside herself somewhere that it could never be found and opened again. She panicked when she thought that the smallest fraction of herself would be on display because that meant there was a chance that someone could use it to hurt her. Take her vulnerability, turn it into a weapon and cut her down. </p><p>It had taken years to let Lilia and Jen in and even now she didn't show herself to the full extent. She had never let them see her cry, she had never let them see her so angry that she wished she could go wild and destroy things, even the way that she had been after Wanda had broken her heart had been watered down in front of them. Those were emotions that were just for her, the ugliest parts of herself that no other living being would see.</p><p>So something as simple as being asked how she gained her love for Greek Mythology was a threat to her carefully constructed walls that kept her safe and hidden. Rio was a stranger and she wasn't someone that Agatha was prepared to give any ammo to. <br/>But she already had some, she had worked out that Wanda was a button that she could push to get Agatha to act how she wanted and Agatha <em> hated </em> that. God help her if Rio and Wanda ever had a conversation, she would be well and truly fucked. </p><p>She let her head dip and looked at the floor. The worn grey carpet offering a small escape from the way that Rio was looking at her. “You're right.” Her voice cracked which made her cringe. She cleared her throat and looked back up at Rio. “You're right.” Rio's features softened. “I flew off the handle and conducted myself in an extremely unprofessional manner, for which I apologise.” She searched Rio's face for a reaction, <em> any </em> reaction, but she was just looking at her so she continued. “I'm not used to being challenged and it's rare that people have a spine when conversing with me. But it seems that you don't have that problem.” </p><p>Rio laughed, but this time it was light. “My parents raised me to speak my mind and stand up for myself.” She ran a hand through her hair. “I guess they never thought about how it would translate into speaking with authority figures.” She smiled softly and Agatha's heartbeat picked up again, though not because of irritation but she wasn't going to acknowledge the reason. </p><p>Her phone pinged with a reminder that she had fifteen minutes until her lecture was due to start. She smoothed out her shirt and gathered her things from her desk to compose herself. “Well I have some first years to scare so we're going to have to end this here. Once again, you are welcome to attend. I think your presence gives them confidence since you were the first one to speak out.” She allowed herself to give Rio a small smile and went to open the door. “There's no pressure though.” <br/>“I'll think about it.” Rio said jokingly as she headed out the door. <br/>“Don't think about it too hard. Remember what I said about burning yourself out.” <br/>Rio spun on her heel to face Agatha again. “Ha! Fair point, well made.” She turned back and walked away and Agatha absolutely did not catch herself watching her go.</p><p>Would they ever have a normal interaction? Was that even in the realm of possibility? And more importantly, did she <em> want </em> them to have a normal interaction?</p><p align="center">__________</p><p><br/>It was Agatha’s turn to cook Saturday night dinner which meant that her kitchen became a bombsite. Even the simplest of dishes turned into chaos. She was a good cook but her process had a certain drunk-toddler quality to it and, for some unknown reason, she had decided to bake dessert.<br/><br/>She opened the door to Lilia and Jen who immediately burst out laughing.<br/>“Wow, Harkness. I always think that there’s no way you can be worse than last time and yet you still manage to top it.” Lilia beamed as she walked past her.<br/>“Don’t panic, we’re here.” Jen said, walking straight into the kitchen. “Just tell me what needs doing and go shower.”<br/>Agatha told them when to stir the pot that was in the oven and what time to take the cake out and went to her bathroom. She had thought that Jen was overreacting when she had told her to shower but she laughed when she saw the flour on her face and cake batter in her hair.<br/><br/>When she returned downstairs, the kitchen had been cleaned up, the pots had been washed and the table had been set. “You know the whole point of us taking turns is that we each get time off from having to do this stuff, don’t you?” Jen asked.<br/>“Leave her alone Jennifer. We all have our flaws.”<br/>“Thank you Lilia, glad to know one of you has my back.” She sent a pointed look in Jen’s direction in mock annoyance.<br/><br/>Agatha plated up the food and they all sat around the table talking, or more accurately complaining, about various work related things.<br/>“And he just stood there watching it boil over! It fucked up the bunsen burner, it fucked up the table and, more importantly, it fucked up my dress!” Jen very animatedly finished telling them a story from the other day.<br/>“That’s what you get for teaching the kids how to make potions.” Lilia shrugged.<br/>“Medicinal Chemistry.” Jen corrected.<br/>“Same thing.”<br/>Jen rolled her eyes. “I’m not going to dignify that with a response.”<br/>Lilia smiled, clearly satisfied in thinking she had won.<br/><br/>“Anyway,” Jen started, facing Agatha, “you’ve been quiet tonight. You’re usually the first to complain about your students. How is it going with that PhD girl? What’s her name again?”<br/>Agatha took a sip of her wine. “Rio.” She had actively been trying to avoid thinking about Rio Vidal, but she seemed to make her way into her mind at least once a day in one way or another. “It’s going well. She’s … intriguing.”<br/>Lilia leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. “And that’s a bad thing?”<br/>Agatha sighed. Was it a bad thing? She was just a student. An irritating student, but a student nonetheless. “Not necessarily.” She eventually replied. “She’s very sure of herself and seems to enjoy talking back to me.” <em> ‘But I don’t hate it,’ </em> her thoughts finished for her.<br/><br/>Jen raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Has the great Agatha Harkness finally met someone who won’t let her talk to them like a piece of shit?”<br/>“I do not talk to people like they’re pieces of shit.” Agatha shot back. “I am simply preparing them for life in a world that won’t cater to their every need.” She took another sip of her drink. “And if they feel like a piece of shit afterwards then maybe they are one and I have helped them realise it before it’s too late.”<br/>Lilia raised her glass. “Here, here!” They all laughed and cheersed their glasses.<br/><br/>They ate in silence for another few minutes before Agatha spoke again.<br/>“I spoke to Billy the other day.”<br/>Both Jen and Lilia stopped mid chew, their eyes going wide and said their responses in unison.<br/>“You did?”<br/>“What happened?”<br/>Agatha held up her hands. “Calm down! It went well.”<br/>Lilia pointed her finger at Agatha, “details Harkness. Now.” <br/>Agatha rolled her eyes and pointed at her mouth to indicate that she would talk once she had swallowed her food and Lilia tapped her foot impatiently.<br/>“We spoke about why I’d left it so long to reach out to him and how I had thought about trying to talk to him quite a few times over the last two and a half years.” She paused to give the other two a chance to chime in but they were both uncharacteristically silent. “We touched on the lie his mother told about why we broke up, but I didn’t go into detail. Apparently she told him that it was a lie when he got home from the hospital.”<br/><br/>“Good!” Jen said, probably a bit too loudly. “I’m still mad about that. I mean why the fuck did she say that?”<br/>“And why did you just let it go?” Lilia added.<br/>“Why am I now under fire?” Agatha asked, surprised. “You know why I didn’t fight it, it was more effort than it was worth. People had already accepted it as truth and I’m above playing ‘he said, she said.’” She waved her hand dismissively and brought the conversation back to Billy. “ <em> Anyway </em> , I told him that I had visited him while he was in the hospital and he said that he’d seen me through the window but had convinced himself that he was seeing things. And that’s about it really.”<br/><br/>Lilia reached across the table and grabbed Agatha’s hand, squeezing it gently. “For what it’s worth, I’m proud of you. I know that that was hard for you to do.”<br/>Jen took Agatha’s other hand and added, “I’m glad it went well. How are you feeling about it now?”<br/>Agatha smiled at them both and felt a lump start to form in her throat so she pulled her hands free. “Please, we look like we’re about to have a séance.” She ate another forkful of food. “I’m feeling good about it. It feels like a weight has been lifted.” She smiled again, allowing herself to feel the full extent of her happiness before remembering a final detail. “Oh he said that his mother wanted to talk to me, but I shut that down immediately.”<br/><br/>Jen scoffed. “The nerve that woman has to get her son to ask you to talk to her. You’re not going to do it, I hope?”<br/>“Obviously not, Jennifer!” But if Billy asked her again then she might consider it. If he wanted her to do it, could she say no to him? Would she be able to do anything that felt the slightest bit like letting him down again?<br/>She really hoped that he wouldn’t ask her.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p>Agatha was sitting in her office, at her desk when there was a knock at her door.<br/>“You may enter.”<br/>In walked Rio Vidal.<br/><em> ‘Of course. It’s Wednesday.’ </em> She thought. Her days had gotten away from her this week.<br/>Something about Rio was different today though. Her hair was up in a messy bun instead of down, framing her face like it usually was but that wasn’t it. Her clothes were the same: a jacket, a t-shirt and tight jeans – not that Agatha had paid particular attention to the tightness of her jeans in the past.<br/><br/>No. None of this was out of the ordinary. It was the confidence with which she entered the room that was different. Rio usually carried herself well but today was strange. She had captured Agatha’s eyes with her own the second that she had crossed the threshold and, even from a distance, Agatha could see that there was something in them, they were darker, and the smile that matched them was teasing her almost.<br/><br/>Rio walked to her usual seat and dropped her bag on the floor, but she didn’t sit down. She carried on towards Agatha. “You’ve been thinking about me, haven’t you?” She all but purred and Agatha’s breath caught. “Are you going to let me sit down?” Rio motioned to Agatha’s lap but Agatha just stayed where she was, thoroughly confused.<br/><br/>Rio laughed lightly and spun her chair so that her legs were no longer under her desk. She slowly put one of her legs on either side of Agatha’s and gently lowered herself so that she was sitting on her. “That’s better.” She said and smiled when Agatha instinctively put her hands on her hips. “You’re catching up.” She put a hand in Agatha’s hair, running her fingers through the waves before pulling gently at the roots. Agatha closed her eyes almost involuntarily. She felt Rio shift, leaning down close to her ear. Her breath was warm against her skin as she whispered. “Open your eyes.”<br/><br/>Her eyes flew open and she found herself staring at her bedroom ceiling, breathing heavily. She pulled her hands down her face and groaned.<br/><br/><em> Fuck. </em> </p>

<p>It was just a dream, everybody dreams. Dreams don’t mean anything unless you want them to, and she didn’t want it to, so therefore it meant nothing.<br/>Absolutely nothing.<br/>She dreamt about work related things all the time, that’s all this was. Just another dream about work and nothing else.<br/><em> Absolutely nothing. </em></p><p align="center">__________</p><p>Agatha noticed that Billy looked a lot more at ease in her lectures, he stopped tucking himself into a corner and started to sit in the centre more, even answering a couple of questions here and there. This in turn made her feel better, he was warming back up to her and she couldn’t help reminiscing on how close they had been once upon a time.<br/><br/>She remembered his thirteenth birthday. It was during the height of the pandemic, the country was in lockdown and almost everything had ground to a halt. He was upset that he wouldn’t be able to spend the day with his friends so Agatha had organised a zoom call with them all as a surprise. She had gone to all of their houses and picked up the presents they had gotten for him and arranged them all in the living room so that they could still see him open them. She had spent probably more money than she should have getting pizzas for each of them so that they could pretend they were all eating party food together, but the look on Billy’s face had been more than worth it.<br/><br/>The way that he had hugged her so tightly and told her that he loved her would stay with her forever.<br/>“You’re his favourite person, you know?” Wanda had said to her as they watched him from the kitchen and Agatha had laughed. “I’m just doing what anyone else would have.” </p><p align="center">__________</p><p>Rio had taken to attending more of her lectures, branching out from the first years and joining the second and final years as well. She would usually sit in the back corner, if she wasn’t sitting with Billy, which meant that it was all too obvious when Agatha looked at her. She tried to not make a habit of looking in Rio’s direction but it was becoming increasingly more difficult, especially when the events of her dream replayed in her mind every time she caught her gaze. Luckily it had been the only one of her dreams to star Rio Vidal, and for that she was grateful.<br/><br/>Their next meeting was spent structuring Rio’s notes, or trying to anyway. Rio, while being the one that required the help, had a hard time accepting it. They were working from a shared google doc and the idea had been that Agatha would tackle the first half, Rio would tackle the last half and then they would fine tune it. They had managed a good fifteen minutes before Rio had decided to take a look at the edits Agatha had made.<br/><br/>“Miss Vidal I am trying to help you, why must you challenge every damn thing I say?” She had been trying very hard to not let her frustration take over like she had in their previous meeting, but Rio had an incredible talent for fraying the edges of her composure.<br/>Rio casually leaned back in her chair, a sly smile plastered on her face. “When your suggestions make sense, Professor, then maybe I’ll accept them.”<br/><br/>Agatha closed her eyes and took a breath, counting to five. She would not let Rio Vidal get under her skin.<br/><em>She would not let Rio Vidal get under her skin.</em><br/>“Look,” she opened her eyes again and fixed her gaze onto Rio. “I know that you are very precious about your work, I am not saying that you shouldn’t be because it is good work.” She leaned forward resting her elbows on her desk. “However for <em>this</em> to work,” she gestured between herself and Rio, “you are going to have to accept at some point that I know more than you.”<br/>She wasn’t sure that she could actually carry on like this, because Rio was going to give her an aneurysm. Why was talking to her so fucking <em>difficult?</em><br/><br/>Rio tensed her jaw, clearly wanting to voice the retort that she was holding in her mind but thought better of it. “Fine.” She eventually said. “You’re right, I’m sorry.”<br/>Agatha straightened her posture again, satisfied that she had come out on top. “Now go back to your section so that we can finish this.”<br/><br/>Her eyes wandered absentmindedly in Rio’s direction as they worked. She didn’t linger because lingering would imply something and there were no implications in how she felt about this woman. Rio was a student and she didn’t look at students like that. Then again, she also shouldn’t dream about students the way she had dreamt about Rio, but it was just a dream. A dream in which the woman sitting to her right had straddled her and played with her hair. But it was just a dream.<br/><br/>“What?” Rio asked, her brow furrowed in confusion.<br/>“Excuse me?” She blinked, just as confused as Rio looked.<br/>“You were staring at me.”<br/>“No I-” <em>Fuck.</em> “I was looking through you Miss Vidal.” She cleared her throat to stall for a second. “I was thinking of the best way to save this travesty in front of me.”<br/>Rio smiled and licked her lips. “Okay then.” She said before returning her attention to her laptop.<br/>Agatha knew that Rio didn’t believe her, but was thankful that she didn’t press further.<br/>God, she really needed to get a grip. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p>Agatha hated it every time Wanda’s name flashed up on her phone, it always brought her mood down. She would be happy if she never had to hear from her again, but unfortunately they worked at the same university, in the same damn department and she could never fully escape her.<br/><br/><b>Maximoff: Billy told me that the two of you talked the other day. How did it go?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Of course Billy had told his mother that they’d talked, and she couldn’t be mad at him for it because she had expected it. But she hadn’t expected Wanda to ask her about it.<br/><br/><b>Agatha: I’m sure he told you everything you need to know.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>She wasn’t about to engage in this conversation, it was another pitiful attempt from Wanda to get the attention she so clearly still craved from her.<br/><br/><b>Maximoff: He told me how he felt about it. How do you feel about it?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Agatha rolled her eyes. Why could Wanda not take the hint? Surely this was getting embarrassing for her by now. Agatha shot her down every single time she tried to talk to her about anything that wasn’t work related.<br/>She could just not reply, it would be easy to do, but she couldn’t resist a chance to be petty.<br/><br/><b>Agatha: Why do you care?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Was it childish? Yes. Was it satisfying? Also yes. She would be lying if she said that she wasn’t a little bit interested about how Wanda would reply. What lies would she tell? What excuses would she come up with?<br/>A few minutes went by without a reply and Agatha smiled, Wanda usually ran from questions like that. Probably because she could never form an answer that was believable.<br/>But then her phone pinged again.<br/><br/><b>Maximoff: Because I’ve always cared, Agatha. </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Oh, she just <em>had</em> to laugh at that. Wanda was really bringing out the big guns today wasn’t she? Agatha might go as far as to suggest that Wanda was drunk, because there was no other plausible explanation for this level of misplaced bravery.<br/>She shouldn’t reply, she shouldn’t give Wanda the satisfaction. But there were a lot of things that she shouldn’t do.<br/><br/><b>Agatha: Whatever you are trying to do, it will not work. </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Maximoff: I’m not trying anything. I’m being honest, Agatha.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha: Well I’m glad that you have finally learned this basic human trait, but I’m not interested.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Agatha stared at her phone, waiting to see the three dots appear again but they didn’t. Five minutes went by and there was no reply from Wanda, she had finally left her alone for the night.<br/><br/>She tried to sleep but her mind wouldn’t let her. Why was Wanda trying to talk to her so much lately? What did she want? Agatha had made it clear ten times over that she wanted nothing to do with her and yet she was still trying. Maybe she should give her a chance.<br/>“Absolutely not. Get a fucking hold of yourself Agatha.” She chastised herself because why was she considering it? She had gone two and a half years without talking to that woman and she was not going to start now just because Wanda was putting a bit of effort in. She didn’t deserve Agatha’s time or attention so she wouldn’t be getting it.<br/>Except she was getting it. She was getting it right now because Agatha couldn’t get her out of her mind.<br/><br/>Has this been her plan all along? To slowly break Agatha down until she had no other choice but to talk to her, if only to get her out of her head? If it was then Agatha would not give her the satisfaction. She was stubborn and it was going to take a hell of a lot more than this to get her to break.<br/><br/>She closed her eyes and forced her mind to switch gears and think of something, anything, else. She couldn’t – wouldn’t – allow Wanda to bury herself into her brain. Of course her mind was cruel to her, so the next thing it chose to latch onto was equally bad.<br/><br/>She was back in the hospital, stood outside of Billy’s room watching Wanda and Vis standing on either side of his bed. Both desperate to hold him, but not wanting to hurt him, as he woke up from the accident. Her hand was on the door handle, ready to go in but she held herself back. She had managed being with both of his parents when he had first been brought in to the hospital, but the idea of doing it again, even to see him awake and okay, was too much for her.<br/><br/>She rolled over and pushed her face into her pillow with a groan. She had no idea why her brain was deciding to punish her right now. It wasn’t the first time she had thought about Billy’s accident in the last year, it had played on her mind multiple times. The fear, the anger, the pain, the heartache, she was familiar with all of it. But why now?<br/>She knew that there wasn’t really an answer, she wasn’t any more in control of her mind than anyone else was, but she was usually better at blocking things out than most people. It was something she had learned as a child – and it had been a huge help in adulthood – so she put up her mental walls and caged those thoughts in where they wouldn’t bother her for a while so that she could finally get some sleep.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p>It had definitely been a surprise when Billy had asked her if they could have lunch together one day, but a pleasant one. There was a café just off campus that she asked him to meet her at to avoid being seen by other students and staff as much as possible. She wasn’t ashamed of having lunch with him but she knew how fast the rumour mill churned in those halls, having been on the receiving end of it herself, and didn’t want anything to be misconstrued. She also didn’t want it getting back to Wanda before Billy was ready to tell her. She expected him to tell Wanda at some point and for her to then, once again, use it as a way to try to get Agatha to talk to her; but that was his choice and she would accept it if he did it.<br/><br/>“How are you finding your first year? Are you settling in okay?” Agatha asked when they’d ordered their food.<br/>“I’m enjoying it! The lectures are interesting, I’m living in a house with Alice and the student bar prices are nice and low.” He said the last part with a cheeky grin which made Agatha laugh.<br/>“Ahh yes, the main focus of every first year student. The bar.”<br/>“Well first year doesn’t count towards your final grade, so it’s the perfect time to sample all of the cheap beer.”<br/>She shook her head, but was still smiling. “As your lecturer, I have to tell you that I disapprove of this mindset. But as your…” She faltered. What was she to him? How did he see her? She knew how he used to see her but that had long since changed and they were now in a strange limbo of picking up where they left off and getting to know each other all over again. “Friend?” She said the word carefully, reading his reaction. He smiled softly and gave a little nod which made her chest warm. “As your friend, I couldn't agree more. I definitely did the same in my undergrad.”<br/><br/>She laughed when she saw his eyes widen in surprise. “Don’t be so shocked, kid. All students are the same.”<br/>He stuttered for a second, trying to find the right words. “Yes but I mean, you’re my… you.” While it was somewhat comforting to know that he also didn’t know how to define their current relationship, it also saddened her because she could tell what he was going to say before he changed it. What he should call her had never been something that she and Wanda had discussed, they had left it up to Billy to choose as and when he was ready. He had always called her by her name, but for purposes such as parents evenings she was his stepmum – even though her and Wanda weren’t married – and she felt the absence of it in the sentence as he spoke.<br/><br/>She smiled, though it didn’t reach her eyes, and quickly changed the subject. This wasn’t the time or place to start spiralling. “Are you finding it easy to talk to people and make new friends? I know you have Alice, but it’s nice to have a group.” She said, keeping her tone light.<br/>He seemed glad that she had taken the conversation in a new direction and some of the tension left his shoulders. “I don’t have a group yet, that takes time, but me and Alice met someone on the first day of freshers week actually.” He took a bite of his wrap. “Oh I think you know her actually. She’s doing her PhD and she said that you were her supervisor.”<br/>“Rio Vidal.” Saying her name was a subconscious action and as she said it, it dawned on her that this was the first time she had ever said Rio’s full name out loud. It had plagued her thoughts but she had never said it, and now she wanted to say it again.<br/><br/>Luckily, Billy spoke before she could. “Yeah that’s her!” He was oblivious to whatever place she had gone to inside her head.<br/>“Well she’s very smart. She could be a big help for you and Alice.” She took a sip of her drink, feeling her throat going dry at the thought of Rio and Billy spending time together. It wasn’t that she didn’t want them to be friends, she meant what she said about Rio being able to help him with his work, but she had a hard time keeping a professional head around Rio as it was and she didn’t need that to be made harder by Billy telling her things that she would rather Rio didn’t know.<br/><br/>He laughed, still blissfully unaware of the effect of just saying Rio’s name had had on her. “I already asked her if she would write my essays for me and she said no, so I don’t think she’ll be that much help.” He had a cheeky smile plastered on his face and Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, he really hadn’t changed much at all. He was still the same kid that she knew and loved and it made her feel nostalgic for when she and Wanda were together. Not for the relationship necessarily, but for the family dynamic that the three of them had. Eating dinner together every night, going to the cinema, lazy Sunday afternoons, helping Billy with his homework. She missed all of those things and it made her chest tighten to know that she would never have them back. But she now had the opportunity to create a new dynamic with Billy, and the memories that came along with it, and that was something to look forward to.<br/><br/>“I didn’t mean for her to do your coursework for you, I meant she could read it before you submit it. I would know if she had written it for you.” She gave him a stern look but still had a smile in the corners of her mouth.<br/>“Yeah, yeah I know. She said the same thing actually.” He took another bite of his food and his shoulders tensed again. Agatha ate her own food, giving him space to say what he wanted to say.<br/>“So I told my mum about the other day.” He stared down at his plate. “She was happy that we talked.” Agatha stilled, predicting where this was going. “She wants to talk to you too, Agatha.”<br/>Agatha put her fork down and sighed. “Billy, I don’t know what she told you exactly bu-”<br/>“Please Agatha. Talk to her for me.”<br/>There it was, the thing she had been hoping that he wouldn’t do. She couldn’t say no now, no matter how much she wanted to. He was specifically asking her to talk to Wanda and the pleading look in his eyes nearly broke her. How could she turn him down again? It was simple, she couldn’t. She was going to have to talk to his mother.<br/>“Okay.”</p><p align="center">__________</p><p> </p><p><u> <b> <em>5 Years Ago</em> </b> </u><br/><br/>Agatha woke up alone in her bed in her flat and the excitement immediately flooded her, this was the last time that she would be doing that because she was officially moving in with Wanda and Billy today. Her flat was bare because all of her things were already in the new house, <em> her </em> new house. It felt like the first day of the rest of her life and she couldn’t wait for it to start.<br/><br/>She quickly got ready and did one last walk through of all the rooms for nostalgia sake. She stood in the kitchen and remembered the first time that she had cooked dinner for Wanda. It had been a mess, obviously, because she couldn’t cook anything without spilling something or using every utensil available for some reason, but Wanda had laughed and said that her chaos was cute before pulling her in for a kiss.<br/><br/>She went into the spare room that she had turned into her office and remembered the nights that Wanda had spent helping her apply for her professorship at the university. She had been nervous about it and the imposter syndrome had got her in a vice grip, but Wanda had assured her over and over that she deserved it. She had taken Agatha’s hands in hers and said, “darling, you are <em> more </em> than worthy of this. You’re a brilliant lecturer and your results speak for themselves. Believe in yourself as I believe in you.”<br/><br/>She went to the living area where she and Wanda had spent many nights curled up on the sofa in front of the TV, on some occasions Billy had been there too watching a movie with them. She smiled as she thought about the time that Billy had fallen asleep whilst being leant against her. Wanda hadn’t planned on staying over that night since she had Billy with her, but neither of them wanted to wake him so they gently got up, laid him down with a blanket over him and went to bed themselves.<br/><br/>She walked out onto the balcony, the place that she had stormed to after she and Wanda had had an argument. She couldn’t remember what it was about, something small and insignificant now, but she remembered Wanda following her out after giving her a few minutes to calm down. She remembered the gentle way that Wanda touched her arm to get her attention, she remembered the way that Wanda had put her hand on her cheek to make her look at her. She remembered the way that Wanda had kissed her, the unspoken apology evident in the way that she held her, so close and so steadily that her knees felt weak. But more than all of that, she remembered that moment as the moment that Wanda had first told her that she loved her.<br/><br/>It had taken her by surprise, as a confession like that always does, and all she could do was stare at Wanda, her mind blank. Wanda had laughed awkwardly and said, “one typically expects a response to something like this.” worry beginning to work its way into her demeanour.<br/>Agatha had stuttered, not sure what to say. “I… Uhh, I wasn- I didn’t expect you to say that.”<br/>“If it helps, I didn’t expect to say it either.” Wanda had taken her hand and looked at their fingers, weaving them together. “You don’t have to say it back if you’re not ready. I don’t want you to feel forced.”<br/>“No I.. I want to. I just- fuck.” Agatha had looked at the floor and taken a breath. “Let me try again.” She looked back up, locking eyes with Wanda's, the bright green grounding her. “I love you too.”<br/>It was her favourite memory that she had in her apartment and she was looking forward to making new ones in her new home with Wanda and Billy. </p><p>She got to the front door and had a rush of happiness pass through her when she put her key in the lock. She'd had a key to the house for months now, but this was the first time that she was doing it as someone who was a permanent resident of the house. She pushed the door open and walked in to be instantly greeted by Wanda and Billy both hugging her. Wanda kissed her and said, “welcome home, darling.”<br/>Agatha smiled. “It’s good to be home.” </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">Attending the university that both his mum and his ex-almost-stepmum taught at was definitely a choice, but it also happened to be the third best university in the world for Ancient History courses; so it was a choice well-made. He just had to figure out how he was going to handle seeing said ex-almost-stepmum again after a year and a half of hating her followed by a year of wishing that he hadn’t hated her. He had braced for an argument when he told his mum that he wanted to be enrolled on Agatha’s module over hers for his first year, but no argument came. His mum almost seemed happy about it actually.<br/><br/>Moving into the campus housing was easy since he didn’t actually live that far away from the university in the first place, but both he and his mum had agreed that part of the quintessential student experience is living away from home.<br/>“I really enjoyed my time living away.” She said with a nostalgic smile. “It was nice to get some freedom, and I met your father in my first year halls.”<br/>“So you’re saying I could meet my future ex-husband this year?” Billy laughed.<br/>“Well I’m hoping he won’t turn into an ex but essentially, yes.” She ruffled his hair and he swatted her hand away.</p><p align="justify">He was happy that he was sharing accommodation with Alice, they had been best friends since primary school and he didn’t know what he would have done without having her there through everything. When his mum and dad had been fighting he had basically moved into Alice’s house, and when they eventually told him that they were getting a divorce, he spent every weekend there. He had expected his parents to try to stop him, but they just let him do it, giving him the space he needed to come to terms with it on his own. He had been grateful for that.<br/><br/>When his mum had started dating Agatha, he immediately told Alice and they talked it out over and over. It wasn’t that his mother was dating a woman, he hadn’t been raised to see that as a problem, it was that his mother was dating someone who wasn’t his dad. They had been on-again-off-again his whole life so he was just used to them being together, but now there was a completely new person in his mum’s life and subsequently, his. He didn’t know how to feel about it and he had given Alice his every thought as and when they came to him. But when he met Agatha for the first time he could see how happy his mum was – how happy they both were – and he quickly grew to like Agatha and knew that she was the right person to join their mother-son duo.<br/><br/>Then when he came home from school to find Agatha screaming at his mother saying that she would never set foot in the house again, he was confused because this had been the first time they had ever fought. They’d had arguments sure, he wasn’t naïve enough to think that no couple had the odd tiff, but this was very different. Agatha was crying and throwing her clothes into a suitcase telling his mum to stop talking to her because everything that came out of her mouth was a lie, and he was just standing in the doorway without a clue as to what was happening.<br/><br/>Agatha had finally seen him standing there and hugged him saying, “oh kid, I love you so much.” She had pressed a wrapped box into his hands before she left and said, “happy birthday, Billy. We’ll talk soon, I promise.” and walked out of the house with her suitcase in tow.<br/>His mum had tried to explain what had happened and had stopped him from chasing after Agatha, so he went to Alice instead. She had listened to him talking about it until the early hours of the morning when they eventually went to sleep, and had gone back home with him to talk to his mother. Wanda had said that she wasn’t going to talk about it with Alice there but he had said “either Alice stays, or I go.” So she had conceded and told them both her story.<br/>That had ruined his sixteenth birthday.<br/><br/>And then there was the day that he came home from the hospital and his mother had sat him down and told him the true story about what had happened. How she had lied, how she was the reason that Agatha had left and how she wished she could take it all back and fix it. His instinct had been – once again – to go to Alice, but his mum had insisted that he stay home since he had only just been discharged and she wanted to keep an eye on him. So Alice had stayed over at his house that night and he had refused to leave his room because the thought of seeing his mother made him feel sick.<br/><br/>It had taken months for him to be able to look her in the eye again and even then she wasn’t the person that he had once known.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">After making his mum promise that she wouldn’t embarrass him in any way he and Alice set out to enjoy freshers week together.<br/>“Are you hoping things will get better between the two of you now that you’re sharing a campus?” Alice asked.<br/>He thought for a moment. “I guess if I can talk to Agatha and get her version of events, and if they match what my mum said, then maybe. I’m still not sure how much I believe her.”<br/>“So you want to talk to Agatha then?”<br/>He sighed. “I don’t know honestly. She promised me when she left that we’d talk, but we never did so I’m not sure if she wants to talk to me.”<br/>Alice linked her arm through his as they walked. “There’s only one way to find out.”<br/>“I know.”<br/><br/>They walked to the ancient history department to attend the welcome event, the room was filled with fellow first years and some second and final years who would be leading them through the department, and answering any questions that they had. They stood on the outskirts of the group, seemingly the only two who hadn’t already made a few friends, and scanned the room.<br/>He hadn’t been shy in high school, he’d found it easy to talk to people and make friends but something about being at uni felt more intimidating. His grades had always been fine and he had passed all of his exams but he suddenly felt out of his depth among all of these people.<br/><br/>His eyes landed on a girl who looked as out of place as he felt and his ability to talk to people returned. He muttered “wait here,” to Alice and walked towards the girl, offering her his hand.<br/>“Hi I’m Billy, are you studying ancient history too?”<br/>The girl shook his hand with a smile and said, “nice to meet you, I’m Rio, and I’m here to get my PhD but I figured it couldn’t hurt to check out the department and meet some people.”<br/>He smiled back and gestured to where he had left Alice standing by herself. “My friend Alice is over there, we’re kind of on our own at the moment, but if you’re wanting to expand your social circle you’re more than welcome to spend the day with us.”<br/>Rio went with him back to Alice and introduced herself.<br/>“Nice to meet you, Rio. Are you another nervous first year like us?”<br/>Rio laughed. “Actually I’m a PhD student. I’ve already done the nervous first year schtick, now I’m just a jaded post-grad.”<br/><br/>The three of them spent the day together touring the department and Billy tried to look as normal as possible as they passed his mothers office, and again when they passed Agatha’s office. He silently prayed that neither of them would choose that moment to appear and decided that god did in fact exist when his prayer was answered. The person guiding them made a joke about not getting on Professor Harkness’ bad side and he exchanged a look with Alice. It seemed that Agatha still didn’t tolerate fools and it sent a pang of nervousness to his stomach. What would her reaction be to seeing him again? His mum had told him that she would be happy that he was taking her module, but his mum had told him a lot of things that weren’t true lately and he found it hard to trust her.<br/><br/>Over the course of the week, he, Alice and Rio went for drinks a few times and got to know each other a bit better before the first day of the semester came around.<br/>He grabbed Alice’s hand as they got near the lecture hall, feeling uneasy about the fact that their first lecture was with Agatha.<br/>“You’ll be fine.” She assured him, giving his hand a gentle squeeze. “Even if she was going to act like a dick, I doubt she would do it in a room full of people.”<br/>His throat was dry so he just nodded and they walked into the room together finding Rio in the back corner and sitting next to her.<br/>“I didn’t think PhD students needed to attend lectures.” He asked, furrowing his brow in confusion.<br/>“Oh we don’t, but I have a meeting with Agatha today about her being my supervisor so I thought I’d sit in.”<br/>Billy looked at Alice and could see her eyes widening, he gave her a stern look begging her not to say anything stupid.<br/>“Agatha Harkness is your supervisor? You’re a brave woman.”<br/>He swallowed hard and was grateful when Rio didn’t get a chance to say anything else, but that gratefulness was instantly replaced by dread when he saw Agatha walk into the room.<br/><br/>The room fell silent and he couldn’t tell if that was because Agatha had entered or because his brain had started to shut down. He barely heard the words that she said over the sound of his heart beating in his ears and when she looked directly at him, he couldn’t help flinching. Alice noticed and mouthed “you okay?” to him. He just nodded and looked straight ahead, disassociating until the lights dimmed, the darkness offering him some comfort.<br/><br/>He found it easier to listen to Agatha teach in the dim light, though his pulse was still racing. She was a good lecturer and he knew that he would enjoy learning from her if he could get over the discomfort that being in the same room as her again provided. His palms started to become less clammy as the lecture went on until Agatha looked in his direction again and he stilled. No, she wasn’t looking at him, she was looking at Rio who had just muttered something under her breath. Had she really just done that? He couldn't help but look at her in surprise, nor could anyone else in the room.<br/><br/>He watched the interaction between Rio and Agatha play out, instantly forgetting his nervousness and replacing it with admiration for Rio. Maybe he could get her to lend him some of her courage.<br/>The lecture ended and Rio bolted out of the room, he couldn’t blame her as he did the same, unable to stop himself from looking at Agatha as he left and caught up with Rio and Alice outside of the lecture hall.<br/>“Well you’re brave, I’ll give you that.” He said to Rio.<br/>Rio snorted, “stupid is what I am. I never could keep my mouth shut. Come on, I need a coffee.”<br/><br/>They found a table in one of the campus cafés and exchanged small talk until Alice had to say something he didn’t want her to. “You’re gonna have fun with Agatha as your supervisor after that stellar first impression.” She laughed. “Although Billy is grateful that you took some of the heat off of him.” She nudged him with her shoulder. He knew that she was trying to joke with him, but he didn’t want her to do it in front of Rio she he shot her a look which promptly made her stop talking. Thankfully Rio didn’t push for more and left.<br/><br/>He punched Alice on the arm.<br/>“Ow what the fuck?”<br/>“Why did you say that shit in front of Rio?”<br/>Alice rubbed her arm in an exaggerated way. “Well was I wrong?”<br/>“No, but you didn’t need to say it.” She was still rubbing her arm. “Oh grow up, I didn’t hit you that hard.”<br/>She dropped her hand and looked at him softly. “How are you feeling after the lecture?”<br/>He shrugged. How <em> was </em> he feeling? It had only been one lecture and it wasn’t like he and Agatha had actually interacted. “Weird.”<br/>“Oh careful Shakespeare, Billy Maximoff is coming for your job.” Alice grinned at him.<br/>“Shut up, dick.” He said, though there wasn’t any anger in the words. He was glad that Alice was joking like she always did, it helped him feel normal about everything, and he knew that when he needed her to be serious she would be. They knew each other incredibly well and could be what the other needed at the drop of a hat. He was really glad that he had her on his side.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Billy knew that his mum cared about him, she had never given him a reason to think otherwise, but he couldn’t help but be annoyed every time she messaged him to ask how his day was going. He had asked her to give him space once the semester started and she seemed to be having a hard time doing it.<br/><br/><b>Mum: How have your lectures been?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Billy: They’ve been good</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Mum: Are you enjoying them?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Billy: Yeah</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Mum: Is Alice enjoying them too? </b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Billy: Yeah</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Mum: Was Agatha okay?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> That question took him by surprise, he hadn’t been expecting her to ask about Agatha. She had barely mentioned her outside of telling him the truth about their break up and telling him that it was okay to take her class, so why was she asking now?<br/><br/><b>Billy: Why do you care?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b>She didn’t respond, it was probably for the best. He didn’t really want to hear her answer, he wouldn’t be able to trust what she said. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">The first week passed and Billy felt more settled. He was still nervous when in Agatha’s lectures but she didn’t single him out or do anything in particular to make him feel uncomfortable, he was just a victim of his own thoughts. Rio tried to get him to join in and answer questions but the idea of it made his heart pound, though he wasn’t sure if that was because it was Agatha or if it was the act of speaking in a lecture in general. Either way, he wasn’t going to do it.<br/><br/>He was in the bar with Alice when his phone buzzed with an email notification and she noticed when his eyes widened as he read it.<br/>“What is it?”<br/>He didn’t speak, instead he just handed her his phone and let her read it for herself.<br/><br/><b>Billy, </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>I’m glad that you’re taking my module this semester and I would like it if we could talk.</b><b><br/></b><b>If you’re open to it, I’ll be in room C24 tomorrow at 9am. Meet me there?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha</b><br/><br/>She handed his phone back and said, “what are you going to do?”<br/>He sighed and sipped his drink. “I have no clue. I want to but also…” He trailed off, not having an ending to that thought. He wanted to speak to her, he really did, but something was holding him back. Previously it had been wondering if she wanted to speak to him and now that she had shown that she does, he couldn’t help thinking of his mum. What would she say about it? Was Agatha asking him to meet her because his mum had asked her to? Had the two of them started talking again? What would Agatha want to say to him?<br/><br/>All of the questions were swirling around his head and it wasn’t until Alice touched his arm that he realised he’d zoned out. “You don’t have to reply now, we can talk it out for a bit first.”<br/>He nodded. “Yes please.”<br/>Alice leaned back in the chair. “What are all of your thoughts? Hit me.”<br/>He rattled off all of the questions he’d had moments ago and a few more that he had thought of as he was saying them.<br/><br/>Alice listened to him and only spoke when he was done. “I mean, the fact that she’s the one to reach out to you can only be a positive thing right?”<br/>“I guess, but what if she wants to tell me that she hates me?”<br/>Alice scoffed. “And why the fuck would she do that?”<br/>Billy looked down and started picking at his fingernails. “I don’t know. I’m just trying to prepare for the negatives.”<br/>“No, you’re looking for negatives.” Alice said sternly and he looked back up, meeting her eyes. “Sure she hates your mum, but she doesn’t hate you. I refuse to believe that.”<br/>“How do you-”<br/>“Because I do, Billy. Between us I’m the brains, you know this.”<br/>He raised an eyebrow sceptically. “Does that make me the brawn?”<br/>Alice laughed so loudly that other people in the bar turned to look at them. “Absolutely <em>not.</em> I am both, and I think you should talk to Agatha.”<br/>He sighed. “Okay, yes, I’ll do it.” He gulped down the rest of his pint. “Should I tell my mum?”<br/>Alice followed suit before answering. “I’d wait until after, no use in opening that can of worms before you’ve got the information to follow it with.”<br/>“Yeah, you’re right.”<br/>“I always am.”</p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Billy made his way to the room that Agatha had asked him to meet her at. He was nervous, which was a given, but he was also a little bit excited. This would be the first time since she left that they were going to properly see each other, and he missed her. He wished that this had happened sooner, but he was glad that it was happening now and was trying to only think positively about it.<br/><br/>He got to the room and waited outside. Should he knock? Should he just walk in? Would Agatha already be there, or was he the first to arrive? He gingerly pushed the door open and walked into the room, Agatha was already there and any excitement that was working to tame his nerves vanished.<br/><br/>“Hi.” He practically whispered. He tried to walk further into the room, but he felt rooted to the spot where he was standing until he knew the direction that the conversation would take.<br/>“It’s nice to see you again, Billy.” Agatha’s voice was soft and quiet, more like the voice he was used to, not the voice of the professional lecturer he had experienced over the last week. Hearing it took the edge off of his apprehension a little and he was able to take another step into the room. “It’s nice to see you again too, Professor.” He had no idea how to address her now. They weren’t family anymore and this was now unchartered territory for both of them.<br/><br/>“You don’t need to be formal, you can say my name.” Agatha said with a soft laugh. Okay, good, they weren’t using formalities. But what should he say next? He picked at the hem of his jumper and looked at the floor. She had been the one to ask him here and he still didn’t know if it was a good thing or a bad thing. “Why did you ask to see me, Agatha?”<br/><br/>Agatha didn’t reply straight away and the silence was starting to feel heavy around him.<br/>“Because I wanted to check in, see how you're doing.”<br/>This made him look at her and he couldn’t hide the questioning look on his face as he remembered the last words she had spoken to him. <em> “We’ll talk soon, I promise.” </em> He did not count a two and a half years as ‘soon’. There’s not a lot that two and half years could be counted as ‘soon’ for.<br/>“You had two and a half years to <em> check in </em> . Why wait until now?” He didn’t feel that the question was out of pocket, it was perfectly valid. She had promised him that they would talk and she had broken that promise, but he did feel a little bit bad about it when Agatha dropped her gaze and leant back against a table.<br/>“I know. I could make excuses and blame whomever I wanted, or needed, to blame but I'm not going to do that. I should have done this sooner and I'm sorry.”<br/><br/>He slowly moved fully into the room and cautiously sat on the table next to her. In a strange way, the fact that she seemed to feel as bad about the situation as he did gave him some comfort. He wasn’t alone in how he felt and he wasn’t overreacting.<br/>“I'm sorry too. I let my mum get in my head and convince me that you were the bad guy. I hated you for a long time.” He didn’t like telling her that, but the only way that anything good was going to come out of this was through honesty. He was still hurt by her walking out – even when the reason he was told had turned out to be a lie – and the fact that she hadn’t tried to talk to him until now made him feel slightly resentful towards her.<br/><br/>“I am so sorry that you got caught up in this. You didn't deserve it, you were just a child.” Agatha started, looking back up at him. “I can't take back that time and I can't erase the way I made you feel, no matter how much I wish I could. But I can promise that I will do anything I can to make it up to you. I really miss you, kid.”<br/>Hearing her call him ‘kid’ again after all this time felt like someone had reached into his chest and grabbed his heart. He had pretended to hate the pet name every time she had said it, but she knew that he didn’t really mean it which is why she kept doing it. His mother had tried to call him ‘kid’ after Agatha had left but it felt like a twisted version of it, of the relationship that he and Agatha had once had and it had only made him cry.<br/><br/>He smiled at the feeling of nostalgia the word brought up. “I’m not a kid.”<br/>“Oh sorry. Teen.” She nudged him in a gentle, playful way. “I know that we're not going to fix this in one day, but I want you to know that I'm willing to listen to you. You can tell me how you felt and I'll answer any questions you have.”<br/>Now that he had the opportunity to get answers for all of the questions he had had for two and a half years, his mind went blank. Where should he start? Which ones were the most important and needed immediate answers?<br/>“Did you ever think about coming to see me?”<br/>“Of course I did!” He raised his eyebrows in surprise at the harshness of her tone and she seemed to notice it too because she looked equally surprised, but her voice was softer when she spoke again. “I spent ages trying to work up the courage to talk to you but I guess I was scared that you wouldn't want to talk to me. I also didn't want you to feel like you had to talk to me if you didn't want to.”<br/><br/>He saw the tears that were in her eyes and felt his own start to creep in. There were so many unspoken feelings between them and he just wanted to skip to the part where they had fixed everything and could go back to the way that they were, but that wasn’t possible and they had to go through the pain and the hurt if they were going to come out at the other end together.<br/>“At the start I was angry with you. When I came home from school, and mum told me that you'd gone because you'd found somebody else, I wanted to find you, to scream at you, to ask how you could do that to us.”<br/>“Billy you know that isn't true, don't you?”<br/>“I found out about a year later. She told me when we got home from the hospital.” He recalled how it had felt to hear and how his heart had broken for Agatha. “I guess that she felt guilty after I nearly died and told me the truth. Every cloud, as they say.”<br/>He wanted to hug her, wanted her to hug him, but he didn’t know if it was appropriate because they were on campus and she was his Professor. He didn’t want her to get in trouble if anyone happened to pass by and see them, he guessed that it was already a risk that the two of them were alone in a classroom together.<br/><br/>Agatha smiled at him. “I visited you in the hospital, your mother at least had the decency to let me know that you were hurt. I was there when you woke up as well but I didn't want to add to the stress of the situation and overwhelm you, so I didn't go into your room. I watched you from the window for a few minutes and left.”<br/>This took him by surprise because he had sworn that he had seen her there, he was going to ask his mum about it but had forgotten with everything else that was happening around him.  “You were there? I thought I was going crazy! I saw you in the window but when it dawned on me that it was you, and I looked again, you were gone.”<br/><br/>As soon as he finished speaking Agatha started crying, and he didn’t know what to do. The last – and only – time that he had seen her cry was when she left. She started speaking, her voice thick from the tears. “I'm so sorry, Billy. I'm sorry that I didn't go in and see you when you woke up. I'm sorry that I waited this long to talk to you again. I never stopped caring about you.” He couldn’t hold himself back, his own tears started to fall and he had to hug her.<br/><br/>“I shouldn’t have listened to my mum. I knew deep down that the story didn’t add up and that you weren’t the type of person to do that.” He wrapped his arms around her tighter and they stayed there for a bit. It was a nice feeling to be able to hug her again after all the time of uncertainty surrounding how he felt about her. It was nice to know that she didn’t hate him and that she was sorry for not seeing him sooner. It felt good to begin the process of healing and being back in each other's lives.<br/><br/>After they pulled apart, they sat in silence for a moment. It felt comfortable, they were just enjoying each other’s company like they used to but he had a nagging feeling, something that he had to mention. “I think my mum really wants to speak to you. I think she wants to explain herself, you should try to listen to her.”<br/>He knew that it probably wouldn’t get a positive response and Agatha’s unamused scoff confirmed his suspicions. He couldn’t blame her. <em> He </em> was pissed off at his mum so he couldn’t imagine how Agatha felt.<br/>“With respect ki- <em> teen. </em> I won't be doing that.” She stood up and swiftly changed the subject. “Don't you have a lecture to go to? You shouldn't be late, I hear your professor is a real hard arse.” She said with a wink.<br/>He laughed and started towards the door but before he left, he turned back. “Agatha?”<br/>“Yeah?”</p><p align="justify">“Thank you for this.”<br/><br/>He meant it, he truly was grateful that she had asked to see him and he was glad that he had agreed. He felt lighter, happier and he was looking forward to talking to her again.<br/>After the lecture, he went for coffee with Alice and told her about it and he was smiling the whole time.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Billy knew that he should tell his mum that he had spoken to Agatha, he just didn’t know how to bring it up or how much he should tell her. She would have questions but he wasn’t sure what they would be or if he would want to answer them. He considered asking Alice to be there while he told her but he knew that it wasn’t fair to always rely on Alice to be around every time he needed to have a difficult conversation with his mother. She hadn’t been there while he talked with Agatha and he had survived, so he could survive talking to his mum <em> about </em> Agatha.<br/><br/>He picked up his phone and started drafting out a message to his mum asking if she would want to hear about it but he stopped because it didn’t feel right. He knew that his mum would definitely want to know about it but did he <em> want </em> her to know about it? Could this not just be a thing for him and Agatha to have to themselves? Did she need to know?<br/><br/>He threw his phone on his bed and put his head in his hands. He didn’t anticipate this being the thing that stressed him out in his first semester. He thought that the workload would take the gold on that one, but this had crept up in the inside lane and overtaken it just before the finish line. He wished that he could go back in time to before everything was so fucked and find a way to stop it from happening.<br/><br/>He was still caught in the middle of whatever was going on between Agatha and his mother and he wanted to scream because how were they being so childish? Agatha had every right to be angry at the start but it had been two and a half years and she hadn't found a way to be civil with his mum while they were at work. It could be the most fake performance of her life, but it would at least be something.<br/>But on the other hand, his mum didn’t seem to understand that Agatha was under no obligation to talk to her and hear what she had to say. She was trying to push Agatha into doing something that she clearly didn’t want to do, and that had never worked while they were together so why would she think that it would work now?<br/><br/>If he was going to tell his mother then it would be on his terms and in a way that he wanted to do it. He picked his phone back up and texted his mum.<br/><br/><b>Billy: Can I come home for dinner at the weekend? Pot noodles aren’t as sustaining as I originally thought</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Mum: Yes of course you can! Are you wanting anything in particular?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Billy: Can you do the chicken thing that you used to do? </b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Mum: Sounds perfect! Is Alice coming as well?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> He thought about it for a moment and wondered if Alice would be mad that she wasn’t invited. <em> ‘No, she’ll understand.’ </em> He thought.<br/><br/><b>Billy: No it’ll just be me</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Mum: Okay, I’m looking forward to it</b></p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">The weekend came and Billy confidently walked into his home – he had told Alice about it and she had reminded him that she was only a phone call away if he needed her. He could smell the spicy Cajun chicken that he had asked his mum to cook and he could hear the soft music coming from the kitchen. He took off his boots and left his bag by the door before finding his mother at the cooker stirring a pan.<br/><br/>He cleared his throat before saying, “it smells good.”<br/>His mum jumped, startled by his voice, and turned around. “Oh I didn’t hear you come in!” She set down the spoon she was using and walked over to him, pulling him into a hug. “Hi, sweetheart, it’s nice to see you.”<br/>“You too.” He said, returning the hug.<br/>She pulled back and looked at him for a second before ruffling his hair. “Your roots need re-doing before your friends start to suspect that we might be related.” She said with a smile.<br/>He laughed. “Yeah I know. Alice is going to do it for me tomorrow.”<br/>She ruffled his hair again before turning back to her pan. “Can you get the plates out please? The rice is nearly ready.”<br/><br/>He took a bite of his food and had to stop himself from violently swearing in front of his mother. “This is so good! Why did you ever stop making it?”<br/>She laughed. “I’m not sure actually, I learned a couple of new recipes and forgot about this one I guess.”<br/>“Well make sure you don’t forget it again.” He said, eating more.<br/><br/>As they ate, they exchanged small talk. His mum asked questions about his courses and his housemates and he asked questions about her students and lectures. It felt comfortable but he was thinking about how to broach the topic of Agatha. It wasn’t an easy one to work into conversation and would feel out of left field no matter how he chose to do it, so he decided for the head on approach.<br/><br/>He looked his mother in the eye as he spoke, not wanting to seem embarrassed or sheepish about it, because he wasn’t. “I spoke to Agatha the other day and we talked some stuff out.”<br/>He had expected it to take her by surprise but he hadn’t expected her to actually choke on her food. He rushed to the sink to get her a glass of water and she gulped it down.<br/><br/>“Sorry, I didn’t expect you to say that.” She said once she’d gotten her breath back.<br/>“I know but I didn’t think you’d react that dramatically.” He tried to joke but his tone was wrong.<br/>“Billy-”<br/>“I’m sorry, that came out wrong. Are you okay?”<br/>She smiled softly at him. “I’m fine, sweetheart.” She ate some more of her food. “What did you talk about?”<br/><em> ‘Head on approach, Billy.’ </em> He reminded himself.<br/>“We didn’t cover much, it was mostly just apologising to each other actually.” He paused, giving his mum a chance to react, but she stayed quiet. “I told her how I felt when she left, how I was angry for a while before I fou-” He faltered slightly, choosing his words. “Before you told me the truth.”<br/><br/>His mum dropped her gaze, avoiding his eyes. He almost felt guilty but he was right, he hadn’t accidentally found out what had happened, she had chosen to tell him.<br/>She cleared her throat, still not looking back up. “What did she say to that?”<br/>He ate another spoonful, making her wait for his answer. “She said that she was sorry that I ended up in the middle of it and she told me that she came to visit me in the hospital.”<br/>“That’s true!” She cut in, almost too eagerly. “She was the first person I called.”<br/>His brows knit together in confusion. “Why?”<br/>“Because she… I…” She sighed and Billy could tell that she was struggling with figuring out which version she should tell him. “Because I knew how much you meant to her, and her to you, and I needed her there.”<br/><br/>He scanned her face looking for any hint that she wasn’t being truthful, but he couldn’t find one. He wasn’t sure how to respond so he just nodded.<br/>“I’m not lying, William.”<br/>He flinched at her tone and, tripled with the intensity in her eyes and the use of his full name, shrunk into himself. “I know, but you can’t blame me for thinking that you might be.” He spoke quietly but he knew that she heard him clearly.<br/>He expected her to be angry at him for speaking to her that way, he expected her to shout at him for being insolent. But instead she looked regretful and her gaze softened. “Yes, you’re right. I’m sorry.” Her tone was still clipped but her words were genuine.<br/><br/>They finished their food and the tension slowly dissipated as he helped her clean up.<br/>“Could you do me a favour?” She asked as she handed him a pan to put in the dishwasher.<br/>“Sure.”<br/>“Can you ask Agatha if she would talk to me?”<br/>He closed his eyes and clenched his jaw, thankful that he had his back to her so that she couldn’t see his expression. He opened his eyes again and turned to face her. “I don’t want to play messenger boy in whatever you’re planning. I’ve only just started repairing my relationship with Agatha and I don’t want you to ruin that.” <em> Again. </em> It was unspoken but both of them knew that it was heavily implied.<br/>She gave a defeated sigh. “Please Billy. I wouldn’t ask you if I had any other option. I don’t want to use you like this anymore than you want to be used.”<br/>He turned his back to her again, needing a second to take a steadying breath and think about his response.<br/>“I will ask her once.” He said, still not facing her and adding stress to the final word. “Whatever her answer is, I want you to leave me out of anything that comes next.” He turned to face her again. “Thank you for dinner.”<br/><br/>He left the house and stepped out into the pouring rain, letting it soak him through. He hadn’t worn a coat which was a massive oversight for someone used to the British weather, but he didn’t care because the feeling of it was grounding. He couldn’t believe that his own mother was shamelessly using him to get her ex to talk to her. This was the kind of shit that happened in high school, not between grown adults with incomes and mortgages.<br/><br/>He put his headphones on and stuffed his hands into the pockets of his hoodie, balling them into fists. He was so angry that he almost turned around and stormed back into the house telling his mother to go fuck herself, but that would be immature and he knew that it wouldn’t achieve anything.<br/><br/>When he got back to his room he discarded his wet clothes and got in the shower, warming himself back up after his cold walk. He got out of the shower and saw his notification light blinking on his phone, he checked it and saw a message from his mum.<br/><b><br/></b> <b>Mum: I love you</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b>He scowled and swiped it off his screen.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Billy was a lot more comfortable in Agatha’s lectures after they had broken the ice with each other, he and Alice slowly started to sit in a more central spot with Rio joining them when she decided to go to the lectures. His mother hadn’t texted him since he hadn’t replied to her last message, which he was happy about. He was still mad at her and needed to allow himself time to stew before he talked to her again.<br/><br/>He started to get to know his housemates better and they all started to spend more time together, he wouldn’t say they were friends yet per se but they were getting there. He felt like he was really finding his feet and was happy with the rhythm that he had settled into.<br/><br/>Feeling confident after a lecture, he approached Agatha after everyone had left the room and asked if she wanted to have lunch with him at some point. She had happily agreed and he let her pick the day and place.<br/>They met at an off campus café and, other than a few awkward moments where neither of them was sure how to refer to their relationship, it was a good time. They chatted easily, comfortable in each other’s company and it felt natural. He wished that he didn’t have to ruin it by handing Agatha his mothers request, but he needed to do it so that he could remove himself as much as possible from the situation that the two of them caused for him.<br/><br/>She didn’t agree straight away, he knew that she wouldn’t, but thankfully he didn’t have to push too hard. In fact he barely had to push at all, and they were able to finish their lunch with no more awkwardness or tension.<br/>When they went their separate ways he texted his mother. They still hadn’t spoken since the weekend, but he unfortunately had to be the one to break the silence.<br/><br/><b>Billy: She said yes.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Mum: Thank you Billy! I love you</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b>He didn’t reply.</p>

<p align="justify"><u> <b> <em>4 Years Ago</em> </b> </u> <b> <em><br/></em> </b> <b> <em><br/></em> </b> Nervous did not even begin to describe how Agatha was feeling, but she couldn’t find the right words, if they even existed, so nervous would have to do. She had enlisted the help of Jen, Lilia and Billy to make tonight the most special night of her life to date.<br/>It was hers and Wanda’s two year anniversary and she had booked them a table at the Italian restaurant that Wanda had taken her to on their first date. While they were out, it was down to The Three Musketeers – the name Billy had insisted on giving them for the night – to decorate the living room and their bedroom ready for when they got home later. Billy would be spending the night with his dad and promised that the house would be empty by the time she and Wanda got home.<br/>Agatha wasn’t usually one for clichés, but this felt right.<br/><br/>When she went to the bathroom between courses, Agatha thought back to the conversation she’d had with Billy three months prior.<br/>She had sat with him in the living room while Wanda was out with some of her school friends and asked how he would feel about her asking Wanda to marry her. His eyes had immediately lit up and a comically wide smile had appeared on his face. “Are you kidding? I would love that!” He had hugged her with such force that it knocked the air out of her lungs for a second. “I can’t wait for you to be my new dad.” He had said with a cheeky grin and Agatha had responded by pushing him off of her with a hand planted firmly on his forehead. “Cheeky bugger.” She had said affectionately, ruffling his hair for good measure.<br/><br/>“Do you have a ring?”<br/>“Not yet. I was wondering if you’d want to come with me to pick one.”<br/>He stood up excitedly. “Um obviously! The only thing better than one gay picking out a ring is <em> two </em> gays picking out a ring!”<br/>Agatha chuckled, she found his antics thoroughly endearing. “Calm down kid, we need to do this with cool heads so that we get it right.”<br/>He flopped back down onto the sofa. “You’re right.” He said, putting on a calm exterior which lasted about two seconds before he was stood up again. “I’m sorry, I’m just so excited and happy.”<br/>Agatha smiled widely. “Me too, Billy. Me too.”<br/>God she loved this kid.<br/><br/>She took the ring with her to the restaurant to make sure she knew where it was at all times and wouldn’t be frantically looking for it when the time came, and she couldn’t resist taking out to look at it one last time before it was on Wanda’s finger where it belonged. The band was fairly simple, gold to accentuate the colour of the stone with three diamonds increasing in size embedded either side of the centre stone. The stone itself was red agate, polished to perfection and cut into a square with rounded corners. She had chosen agate because of what it represented: inner peace, emotional healing, and courage. All of the things she felt when she was with Wanda and the things that she hoped Wanda felt when she was with her.<br/><br/>She put the ring back in its box, and the box back in her clutch and went back to their table to finish the meal. She kissed Wanda’s cheek before sitting back in her chair, just in time for dessert to be brought out. They shared the huge slab of chocolate cake and finished their wine – Agatha had ordered the most expensive bottle – before Agatha paid and they went outside to wait for their Uber. Agatha sent a quick text to Billy letting him know that they were on their way home and that he had better be out of the house. He responded by sending a picture of him and his dad playing Mario Kart in his dad’s living room and she smiled. It was nearly time.<br/><br/>Knowing that they were going back to an empty house had made them both feel like randy teenagers and they had to fight to not start a steamy make-out session in the back of the Uber. Instead they resorted to playing with each other’s hands and occasionally putting a hand suggestively on the other’s thigh and whispering in each other’s ears.<br/><br/>When they got out of the car they couldn’t resist anymore, Wanda had Agatha pinned against the front door leaving hot kisses on her neck and nipping at her collar bone. “Wanda,” Agatha said breathlessly. “Wanda, we’re still on the outside.”<br/>Wanda groaned but stopped, looking her in the eyes. “Then get your arse through that door.”<br/>Agatha nodded and fumbled with her keys, nearly forgetting the entire purpose of the night. She turned the key but didn’t go in. “After you.”<br/>Wanda planted one last kiss on her lips before opening the door and walking into the house.<br/><br/>She stopped after a few steps and turned back around to face Agatha, her mouth open in awe. “Did you do this?”<br/>Agatha looked past her at the trail of rose petals on the floor, and candles on the end table that they had in the hall to the right of the archway that led into the living room. The only instructions that she had given her helpers were to make the living room the main event and to keep the bedroom classy, other than that they’d had free reign.<br/>“Happy anniversary, baby.” She said, kissing Wanda. “Want to follow those petals?”<br/>“Oh absolutely, but I need to get out of these shoes first.” Wanda said, already bending down to unbuckle them. Agatha laughed, doing the same and she let Wanda go ahead so that she could take the ring box out of her bag and put it into her trouser pocket.<br/>“Oh my god!” She heard Wanda shout from the living room and she quickly followed, eager to see what Jen, Lilia and Billy had done.<br/><br/>The trail of petals turned into a huge heart in the centre of the floor. They had rearranged the furniture to make space, put real candles on the coffee table that was now to the right, and fake tea lights along the bookshelves. They had also draped fairy lights over the bookshelves which bathed the room in a soft, white light. <em> ‘Nice Job, Musketeers.’ </em> She thought.<br/>Wanda pulled her into a tight hug. “Agatha, this is amazing.”<br/>Agatha could hear the waver in her voice, indicating that she was close to crying. She pulled them apart and said, “there’s one more thing.” She spun Wanda around so that her back was to her and pointed to the bookcase in front of her. “Look on there.”<br/><br/>As Wanda walked forward, Agatha bent down onto one knee as quietly as she could.<br/>“There’s nothing there.” Wanda said, confused.<br/>“Oh, my bad. It’s the one on the opposite side.”<br/>She watched Wanda turn around and take a second to find her, but when she looked down and saw Agatha on one knee holding the open ring box, she gasped and covered her mouth with both hands. Her eyes were shiny and reflected the fairy lights. Agatha was close to crying herself, but she had to hold it together for just a moment longer.<br/><br/>“Wanda Maximoff, you have brightened up my life in ways that words cannot describe. You and your son are my whole world and I don’t ever want to be without you both. I love you so deeply and nobody has ever made me feel the way that you do. Will you marry me?”<br/>Wanda sank to her knees in front of her, tears now streaming down her cheeks. “Yes! Of course I will, yes!”<br/>She took Wanda’s left hand and slid the ring onto her finger, it was a perfect fit. As soon as the ring was where it belonged, Agatha’s own tears spilled over.<br/><br/>Wanda spent a minute admiring the ring before looking back up at Agatha and saying through her tears, “I love you so fucking much Agatha Harkness.” She pulled her into a kiss, wet from both of their tears but full of passion nonetheless. When they broke apart Wanda breathlessly said, “Now take me to that bedroom.”<br/>Agatha led her by the hand up the stairs, which were lined with more of the fake tea lights, and into their room.<br/>There were more petals on the floor and on the bed and another string of fairy lights wrapped around the curtain rail. She was definitely going to have to take her Musketeers out for dinner to thank them for this. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify"><br/><u><b><em>Present Day</em></b></u><br/><br/>When Rio had first brought a coffee to their meetings and handed it to Agatha, it had confused her. No other student had done that, probably because they were scared that she would string them up if they got her order wrong… and they were correct. The drink that Rio confidently placed on her desk was, quite frankly, an abomination. It was a joke that besmirched the good name of coffee.<br/>“What in god’s name is this?” Agatha asked, making no attempt to hide her disdain. Whipped cream had absolutely no place in coffee and neither did ice.<br/>Rio shrugged, a smirk beginning to form on her lips. “Well I didn’t know your order, so I had to guess.”<br/>“And you thought that this,” Agatha gestured unamusedly to the cup, “would be <em>my</em> drink of choice?”<br/>The smirk was now full and there was a playful glint in Rio’s eyes to accompany it. “What do you mean? This is a perfectly good coffee.”<br/>Agatha gave a long-suffering sigh, it was far too early in the morning for whatever the fuck Rio was doing.<br/><br/>Seemingly happy with the reaction that she had gotten, Rio dropped the smirk and swapped the cups. “Okay, you got me. This one is actually yours.” She put a handful of sugar packets on the desk next to it and sat down in her usual seat. “You don’t know what you’re missing though. This is really good.” She swiped her finger through the cream gathering it up before putting her finger in her mouth and sucking the cream off. She gave a satisfied hum as she took her finger out of her mouth. “Delicious.” She flashed Agatha a proud smile.<br/><br/>Agatha on the other hand was having a perfectly normal reaction to watching Rio eat cream off of her finger. It definitely wasn’t like a scene in a cheesy rom-com where the conventionally attractive female lead did something mundane that could be twisted into being sexual, and the editors decided to make that moment slow motion. Agatha absolutely experienced it in real-moving time.<br/>She did not feel her pulse quicken or feel the heat starting to creep its way up her neck – and as for crossing her legs, well that was just something she did. There was nothing to read into where that was concerned. Most importantly, she definitely, with one hundred percent certainty, was <em>not</em> staring.<br/><br/>“You’re not subtle.” Rio’s voice snapped her out of the trance that she had slipped into.<br/>“Excuse me?” She asked once she had come back to herself.<br/>“I can tell that you’re jealous.” The smirk was back and Agatha was really starting to hate it.<br/>She took the lid off of her cup needing to do something with her hands. “Of your coffee, if it can even be called that?” She took a sip. “If I drank that, I’m pretty sure the amount of sugar in it would kill me off.” She was well aware of the irony of her adding two sugars to her own coffee.<br/><br/>Rio snorted as she unwrapped her straw but was silent for a moment as she took a sip. The silence lasted all of about three glorious seconds. “I have a question for you.”<br/>Agatha closed her eyes and took a breath. When she opened them again they were met with Rio’s and she swore she could see the sarcasm  that she was about to be met with in them.<br/>“I am sure that I will regret this immediately, but go on.”<br/>Rio smiled and Agatha was correct, she regretted it. “If you were a child of the gods, who would your parent be?”<br/>Agatha just blinked at her. Where did that question come from? Usually there was something to prompt Rio’s ridiculous need to probe information out of her, but this was an odd one. Where was she going with this?<br/><br/>Agatha thought about it, mentally flicking through the rolodex of all the Greek gods she had in her head. There was Oizys the goddess of loneliness and misery but she felt a bit too on the nose.<br/>Nyx the goddess of night who was said by Homer to be feared even by Zeus, Agatha enjoyed the sound of that a lot.<br/>Artemis who was mostly known as the goddess of the hunt, nature and healing but was also known for her stubbornness which Agatha related to. However, Artemis didn’t have any children so technically it wouldn’t be possible.<br/>An obvious one would be Athena, goddess of wisdom, warfare and handicraft, known for her smarts and tactical brilliance.<br/><br/>When she had first read The Odyssey, Agatha had been drawn to the idea of Athena. Having someone watching over her, protecting her and guiding her as she found her way through many dangers was very appealing to her. It might be an obvious answer, but it was the one that she kept coming back to.<br/><br/>The look on Rio’s face suggested that she was expecting some push back to the question, expecting Agatha to shoot her down like she usually did. But Agatha took this rare opportunity to catch Rio off guard.<br/>“Athena. She was my favourite when I was a child.”<br/>Rio’s brows lifted in surprise – she definitely hadn’t been expecting an answer, especially an answer with a shred of personal detail added to it. Agatha pursed her lips to hide the smile that was in danger of showing at her satisfaction.<br/><br/>The feeling didn’t last long because smugness started to settle back over Rio’s features. “Really?” She asked, all too snarky.<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes at Rio’s impertinence. This woman was becoming way too comfortable in the way that she spoke to her and Agatha needed to shut it down before it became a problem. <em>More of a problem.</em><br/>“Miss Vidal, your tone is bordering on disrespectful. You asked me a question which I answered and I shan’t entertain this any further.” Her tone was clipped, asserting her dominance over the conversation but Rio’s face remained unchanged.<br/><br/>She heard Rio mutter something but couldn’t make it out. “Excuse me?”<br/>Rio cleared her throat. “I said that I’d lean more towards Dionysus.”<br/>Agatha crossed her arms and scoffed. “And why would that be?”<br/><em>‘So much for not entertaining it.’</em> She chastised herself. But she couldn’t help it, she couldn’t resist biting.<br/>“Because of your penchant for being dramatic.” Rio leaned back casually, her smile now showing her teeth as she moved her tongue on the inside of her cheek.<br/><br/>Agatha clenched her teeth and exhaled strongly through her nose fixing Rio with a glare, she needed to stop letting this woman, this <em>student</em>, get under her skin. Where did she get her audacity from?<br/>“Let me ask you a question, Miss Vidal.”<br/>Rio spread her arms. “Fire away.”<br/>Agatha uncrossed her arms and adjusted her posture so that she was sitting straighter. “Did you adopt this casual manner when speaking with your previous teachers, lecturers and professors?”<br/>Rio laughed and it ignited a fire in Agatha’s chest and she had to focus on not marching over to Rio, picking up that atrocious drink and throwing it over her.<br/>“I did actually, yes.”<br/>“And they just let you do it?”<br/>“Well they didn’t complain so I’m inclined to say yes.” She crossed her legs and let her hands fall into her lap. “They were a lot more… laid back.”<br/>“Laid back doesn’t achieve my results.” Agatha shot back, probably too quickly.<br/><br/>Rio hummed and gave a small smile. “That wasn’t a personal attack on you, professor. It was just an observation. Their results didn’t suffer for it though, I still got a first.”<br/>Agatha took another sip of her coffee. She had left the lid off and her office wasn’t the warmest so it had quickly cooled down, and she had to hide her grimace as she swallowed the tepid liquid. “Well I am incredibly happy for them, but I think I shall stick to my own methods.”<br/>Rio licked her lips slowly as if considering how she should respond, she nodded and said “fair enough,” taking her laptop out of her bag and turning her focus to that instead.<br/><br/>A couple of minutes passed with them both working and neither of them talking until Rio asked, “how’s the coffee?”<br/>Agatha didn’t look at her as she replied. “It’s gone cold.” She saw Rio pick her own coffee up out of the corner of her eye and take a gratuitous sip.<br/>“See, I don’t have that problem.” Agatha didn’t need to be looking at her to know that that fucking infuriating smirk was plastered on her face.<br/>“Shut up.” Agatha said without thinking. Her eyes immediately went wide and darted to Rio who was stifling a laugh but remained looking at her laptop screen and, by the grace of god, she didn’t offer a retort.<br/><br/>If she had said that to any other student then she would be expecting to be summoned to the Dean’s office for yet another scolding, but since Rio hadn’t put in a complaint about her thus far, she felt that she didn’t need to worry. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify"><br/>The meetings with Rio started to follow a pattern: Rio would bring Agatha a coffee with her two sugars already stirred in, they would have a senseless discussion which would leave Agatha questioning if jail time was a valid option, and Rio would present her with work and research that had no right being as good as it was.<br/><br/>Rio continued her attempts to make Agatha “loosen up” – a direct quote that had made Agatha seethe when she had heard it – and Agatha continued to do nothing of the sort. She had no reason to ‘loosen up’, her way of teaching had worked for her entire career and there was no need to change. If it isn’t broken, why fix it?<br/>She knew that Rio was speaking and acting in that way to get a rise out of her and she became better at not giving in since her usual biting remarks did nothing to dissuade Rio, in fact they only made it worse. If she wanted the upper hand then she was going to have to change her approach.<br/><br/>She had not reacted when Rio had called her “Prof” instead of the full word and delighted in the disappointment she saw in Rio’s eyes. She was becoming more attuned to Rio’s cockiness and was able to plot a path through the field of landmines that was laid at her feet whenever Rio walked into her office.<br/><br/>Not allowing herself to snap at Rio did mean that she had to let that annoyance out in other ways, and on other people. She had made the barista that failed to prepare her midday coffee in time cry when she had said: “as if working in a coffee shop on the campus of a university that you were not smart enough to actually attend wasn’t disappointing enough for your parents, you also cannot do the incredibly simple task of preparing said coffee.”<br/><br/>She earned herself a few more tips to the Dean’s office as the complaints trickled in, which she didn’t mind because she knew how to handle him. It was his secretary that she hated seeing, her shrill voice set Agatha’s teeth on edge every time that she spoke.<br/>“Back again dear?” She basically screeched. “We might have to get you a desk next to mine at this rate so you don’t have as far to walk.”<br/>It was an attempt at a joke that Agatha ignored, barely grunting a response in her direction.<br/><br/>During her Saturday nights with Lilia and Jen, they brought up the increasing amount of time that she spent being reprimanded by the Dean.<br/>“What’s been going on with you lately?” Jen asked.<br/>Agatha shrugged. “What do you mean?”<br/>“I mean that you seem more…” She didn’t finish her sentence, probably unsure on how to phrase it.<br/>“Wound up?” Lilia offered and Jen hummed her agreement.<br/>Agatha took a drink of her wine. “I’m the same as always. People are just getting more sensitive.”<br/>Jen and Lilia exchanged a look and Agatha couldn’t read what it meant which annoyed her. If they had something to say to her, then they should grow up and say it. “What?” She bit out. “Speak your minds.”<br/><br/>They looked at each other again and Lilia shook her head. “Fine I’ll say it then, coward.” Jen said to Lilia through gritted teeth. She turned to face Agatha and tried her best to keep her face neutral but Agatha could see the nervousness in the way her eye twitched.<br/>“Is something going on with you and Wanda?”<br/>Agatha’s eyebrows went skyward. She hadn’t expected that, she would never have expected that. “What on <em> earth </em> makes you ask that?”<br/>Jen shuffled in her chair, looking to Lilia for some help and she finally piped up.<br/>“We’ve just noticed that you’re behaving in a similar way to how you did when you broke up with her and, well, we’re worried about you.” She spoke quickly and Agatha looked at them both, taking in the concern on their faces.<br/><br/>Has she really been that bad? No, surely not. Yes, she had made that one person cry. Sure, she had told her final years that they were a waste of perfectly good oxygen. And yes, she may have walked directly into a student who was in her way as she was walking to her office. But that was normal behaviour for her, she had always been that way.<br/>In the back of her mind, she knew that Rio was the reason that she was acting like this – however that was not a conversation that she wanted to have with them, she didn’t even want to have it with herself – but she was going to have to tell them something to get their minds away from Wanda because she couldn’t have them thinking that any longer.<br/><br/>She angled herself so that she could look at both of them as she spoke. “No, nothing is happening with Wanda. Nothing will happen with Wanda again, I want to make that perfectly clear.” She noticed them both relax a fraction. “I understand that you’re concerned, and maybe I can admit that I have been a little more… harsh of late. But I assure you that I am fine.” Her tone was direct but she kept her voice soft, checking their faces for a reaction.<br/><br/>They both smiled but it was Lilia who spoke first. “Okay so it’s not Wanda, that’s good. I was panicking for a second, I won’t lie.“ She chuckled. “Is it Billy?”<br/>Agatha sighed and dipped her head slightly, she knew that they wouldn’t push if she told them not to. She could stop the questions right now, but she also knew that they were her friends and they were only asking because they cared. “No it’s not Billy. Things with Billy are going well actually.” She smiled at the thought of him. <br/>“But there is something?” Jen asked.<br/><br/>Agatha ran a hand through her hair, trying to think of a way to phrase her next sentence so that it wouldn’t make her sound like a lunatic. “It’s not any one thing. I guess I’ve just had a lot of pent-up… feelings.” It wasn’t incorrect, having to stifle her temper around Rio meant that she had to express it in other ways. She watched them as her words landed and she saw Lilia’s eyes widen comically. “Oh, I understand now!” She exclaimed, pointing at Agatha, and both Agatha and Jen looked at her expectantly, waiting for her to voice her thoughts. “She needs to get laid!”<br/><br/>Agatha groaned at the same time that Jen started cackling.<br/>“Nope, no way. Shut that down right now.” Agatha said, giving them both pointed looks.<br/>“No wait, I think she has a point.” Jen gasped out, recovering from the laughter that took over her. “It makes so much sense actually!”<br/>Lilia reached out and grabbed Agatha’s hand. “Think of it as a research project. ‘Do orgasms help to make me less angry?’”<br/>Agatha ripped her hand away and stood up. “I am done with both of you, I’m going home.”<br/>Jen stood up as well and blocked her path out of the living room. “Hang on.” She said, putting both hands up to stop her and Agatha responded by crossing her arms and exhaling through her nose. Jen continued, “can we at least know who the lucky lady is that’s got you acting this way?”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Goodbye, Jennifer.” She pushed her way past Jen and headed for the door. As she walked out she heard Lilia shout after her. “If you won’t tell us, we have our ways of finding out.”<br/>She looked over her shoulder, firing back “fuck you both,” before shutting the door and getting into her car.<br/><br/>Agatha chuntered to herself the entire drive home and while she got ready for bed. They were both being absolutely ridiculous. She didn’t need to ‘get laid’, she needed Rio to stop pissing her off, she needed people to stop being incompetent, <em> and she needed Rio to stop pissing her off. </em><br/>Rio was the real problem here, not anything else. She needed to find a solution quickly before Lilia and Jen became unbearable.<br/><br/>She decided that in her next meeting with Rio, she would change the narrative. She was done with letting Rio run things. Her office was her turf and it was high time that she reclaimed it. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify"><br/>Agatha started the week strong, she didn’t make anybody cry, she didn’t reprimand her students – not unnecessarily anyway – and most importantly, she didn’t have to hear the vocal equivalent of nails scraping down a chalkboard coming from the Dean’s secretary. She didn’t verbalise her impatience when she had to wait yet again for her midday coffee – she did cross her arms and tap her foot in annoyance, but she wasn’t perfect.<br/><br/>She had decided that the best way to beat Rio was to join her, subscribing to the popular adage. Instead of pretending that Rio’s behaviour didn’t get to her, she simply just wouldn’t let it. If Rio was sarcastic and cocky, then Agatha would be sarcastic and cocky. If Rio acted brazenly, then Agatha would act brazenly. It would be easy.<br/><br/>Agatha sat in her office, but not at her desk like usual. She was sitting in the chair opposite the one that Rio favoured at the coffee table, with her laptop perched in her lap. As soon as the clock showed 9am she heard Rio’s knock at the door.<br/>“You may enter.”<br/>Rio entered the room holding two coffees like usual and held one out to Agatha. Usually Agatha would greet her with a polite “good morning” but Rio’s choice of clothes caught her eye. She was wearing a dark green jacket and black skinny jeans which was normal, but the white button-up was new.<br/><br/>Agatha’s eyes passed over the shirt as she took the coffee from Rio. “Did you put your best shirt on just to see me?”<br/>Rio’s expression hardened. “I’m going to a funeral after this actually.”<br/>Agatha gulped, she hadn't anticipated that. Everything had gone catastrophically wrong in an instant, this is why she wasn’t casual with her students!<br/>The speed of her breathing was starting to increase until she saw the smile spreading across Rio’s face. “Just kidding. I need to do laundry, this was all I had left.” She sat down looking very pleased with herself.<br/>Agatha made her expression neutral despite still feeling the shock. “Hilarious.” she deadpanned. “When tickets go on sale for your stand up comedy show, make sure you reserve a front row seat for me.”<br/>Rio raised her eyebrows. “You’d want to be in the front row?”<br/>“Of course!” Agatha said in mock seriousness. “I’d want to have the best view of you crashing and burning on stage.” She cocked her head slightly and tried her best to recreate the smirk that she’d seen Rio wear so many times.<br/><br/>Rio pushed her tongue against her cheek. “Touché, Professor. Touché.”<br/>Agatha felt pride swell in her chest at the fact that she had managed to match Rio, maybe this would have its benefits after all. She shut her laptop and put it down on the coffee table. “Fortunately for you, comedy isn’t what we’re here to do. Where has your research taken you this week?” </p><p align="justify">Rio reached into her bag and pulled out her laptop. “I think you’ll like this one. You inspired it, actually.”<br/>Agatha held out her hand to take the laptop. “Oh, you flatter me, Miss Vidal.” She set the laptop on her knee and began scanning the work in front of her. It was all about Athena and the various ways that she has been portrayed.<br/><br/>She lifted her eyes to look at Rio again, who was sitting there with an expectant smile, but she didn’t say anything and carried on reading. The list of references was strong but there was one that she didn’t recognise. “What is this ‘Epic The Musical’ that you mention?”<br/>Rio’s eyes lit up and Agatha felt something in her chest that she didn’t want to acknowledge. “You’ve never heard of Epic?” She asked, her eyes widening in disbelief.<br/>Agatha chuckled. “I know that I have a wealth of knowledge that could rival an encyclopaedia, but there are some things that have not yet reached me.” She gave Rio her laptop back and relaxed in her chair. “Why don’t you educate me?”<br/><br/>Rio immediately launched into an explanation of Epic. She told Agatha about the concept of it and how the composer assigned specific instruments and motifs to each character and situation to represent them in the score. She spoke about how Athena was used in the narrative as well as the other gods, and Agatha couldn’t help but listen to her. The way she talked so excitedly about it was endearing and Agatha made a mental note to listen to it when she got home.<br/><br/>When Rio came to the end of her explanation, she sat back in her chair and gave Agatha a thoughtful look.<br/>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “Yes?”<br/>Rio opened her mouth and closed it again before finally saying, “I think that was the longest you’ve ever let me speak without cutting me off. I’m not used to this feeling.”<br/>Agatha scoffed. “You exaggerate, Miss Vidal. Maybe it’s you who is the child of Dionysus.”<br/>“Nah, he’s too obvious. “ She said with a smile.<br/>Agatha hummed her agreement and checked her watch. “There’s still some time left, do you have anything else to show me?”<br/>Rio reached down into her bag. “Actually, I thought I could do more research while I’m here.” She pulled out a book. “If that’s okay with you?”<br/>“I don’t see why not.” Agatha picked her own laptop back up and opened the word file that she was using before Rio got there.<br/><br/>Rio adjusted her position in her seat, getting comfy, and started reading her book. Agatha immediately zeroed in on the title. “Are you reading The Odyssey?”<br/>Rio flipped the book round to look at the cover as if she’d forgotten what she was reading. “Yeah. I figured it was about time.”<br/>Agatha couldn’t stop her mouth from dropping open slightly in surprise. “You’ve not read it before?” Rio shook her head. “You’ve just explained an entire musical to me that is based on The Odyssey but you’ve never read it?”<br/>Rio shrugged. “I’ve never been to Pandora but I’ve seen Avatar.” Her lips quirked into a lazy, half smile as she turned the book back so that she could read it again, but Agatha couldn’t let it go. “The two are entirely different. The Odyssey is one of the oldest works of literature to still be read by a modern audience.” She had to consciously keep her voice at a respectable volume because she had strong feelings about this topic.<br/>Rio sighed and rolled her eyes. “Oh my god will you relax, I’m reading it now aren't I?” She fixed Agatha with a pointed look. “Or at least I’m trying to.” Agatha saw the teasing grin and rolled her own eyes, she put her glasses on and brought her attention back to her laptop.<br/><br/>The time passed with them both sitting in comfortable silence. The only sounds were Agatha typing and Rio turning the pages, making the odd noise at what she was reading. Agatha desperately wanted to know which part of the story she was at and what her thoughts were so far, but she told herself to not distract her. They could discuss it later.<br/>When she was about a quarter of the way through the book, Rio looked up at Agatha, Agatha didn’t see it happen but she could feel Rio’s eyes on her. She could feel the way that they were searching her, taking in all of the detail as they passed over her.<br/><br/>Knowing that Rio was looking at her intently made a warmth start to build in her stomach but she didn’t react to it, she didn’t want to think about it. Instead she said, “can I help you, Miss Vidal?” without looking up from her laptop.<br/>Rio didn’t reply straight away, she shifted in the chair and Agatha now looked at her over the frame of her glasses. Was Rio uncomfortable about the fact that she had caught her looking at her?<br/><br/>“I was just wondering what you were doing.” Rio eventually said. Agatha lifted a brow – it wasn’t believable but she wasn’t going to press further.<br/>“I’m writing the essay questions for the first year students.” She looked up at Rio properly.<br/>Rio smiled. “So what I’m hearing right now is, I can find out what the questions are and tell the kids so that they can get a head start.” She wiggled her eyebrows.<br/>Agatha laughed. “Surely you’re not suggesting that I let you help them cheat, Miss Vidal. As a PhD student there’s no way that would be the case, right?”<br/>Rio leaned forwards, adopting a more serious look. “Oh no, of course not. I wouldn’t suggest anything of the sort, Professor.“ She said, feigning innocence. “But if I found out what the questions were and accidentally told them, I surely wouldn't be at fault for that.”<br/>Agatha hummed in thought, tapping her finger against her lips for extra effect. “No. I’m pretty sure that would still be cheating.”<br/>“And here I was, thinking that you were slowly starting to take a more laid-back approach to teaching.” Rio leaned back and smiled wide, proud of herself for referencing one of their past meetings.<br/><br/>Agatha chuckled. “‘Laid-back’ doesn’t equate to allowing cheating, Miss Vidal. Surely you’re smart enough to understand that?” As she spoke, she realised something. She was enjoying herself. Talking to Rio like this felt… fun? It was refreshing to not feel like she had to push back all the time and it definitely made conversing a whole lot easier. Maybe Rio had a point about being more relaxed, not that she would ever tell Rio that. Her ego didn’t need to be any bigger than it already was.<br/><br/>“Well, how about this?” Rio started, crossing her legs. “What if I wrote all of the essays first so that you had something to compare them to?”<br/>“Oh, that’s not a bad idea actually.” Agatha saw Rio’s cocky, self-assured grin start to creep in before she continued. “Set the bar low so that there’s no way I can be disappointed further.” The way that the smile instantly dropped from Rio’s face gave Agatha a rush. She hadn’t really engaged in banter before, but she could get used to this.<br/><br/>Rio put a hand on her chest and feigned hurt. “Ouch. That’s no way to talk to a student, Professor. What would the Dean say?”<br/>Agatha gave a curt laugh. “I can handle him.”<br/>“I sense that there’s a story there.” Rio said curiously, but it wasn’t intended to goad her. For once it was simply just a statement that wasn’t requiring a follow up.<br/>“Oh, there’s many stories. But we don’t have time for them right now.” She chuckled lightly.<br/><br/>Rio hummed and raised her arms above her head to stretch. As she did, the shirt she was wearing lifted up and revealed a small part of her stomach. If Agatha was staring she would have noticed that the tiny part that she could see was toned, a hint at what Rio’s abs would look like if she could see them fully. If she had been paying attention then the moan that left Rio’s mouth as the stretch set in would have made her stomach flutter and caused her to subconsciously cross her legs. But she wasn’t doing any of that so there was no reason to panic. <em>No reason at all.</em><br/><br/>She managed to regain her composure as Rio settled again. “Comfortable?” She asked, having to force the nonchalance into her voice.<br/>“Very.” Rio said, beginning to read again and Agatha went back to her laptop. “Let me know when we need to leave please, so that I can stop reading this horrible book.” She dead-panned, a hint of a smirk tugging at the corner of her lips.<br/>“I’m glad that you find yourself funny, Rio.” It took Agatha a second to realise that she hadn’t said Miss Vidal and had, in fact, called her by her first name. When it hit her, her head shot up to look at Rio who was looking at her equally surprised. Agatha cleared her throat and corrected herself. “Miss Vidal.”<br/>Rio gave a small nod in acknowledgement and went back to her book, and Agatha tried her best to sneakily check her watch. There was still fifteen minutes left, she could handle fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>Each minute felt like an hour as she waited for the reminder on her phone to ping, she had typed out the same question five times just to make it look like she was doing something while she was very obviously distracted. When the reminder finally went off, she was so far in her own thoughts that it made her jump.<br/>She heard Rio snort. <em>‘Of course she saw that.’</em> She thought.<br/>“I take it that’s our cue to leave?” Rio asked, a hint of laughter in her tone as she turned the corner of her page and closed the book.<br/><br/>Agatha removed her glasses and stared at Rio in disbelief. “I’m sorry, did you just dog ear the page?”<br/>Rio rolled her eyes. “Oh please don’t say that you’re one of <em>those</em> people.”<br/>“By ‘those people’ I’m assuming you mean people who look after their books?” Agatha crossed her arms, getting defensive.<br/>Rio mimicked her pose which made her clench her jaw. “Are you that desperate for an argument right now?”<br/>“Watch your tone.”<br/>Rio scoffed, hurriedly put the book and her laptop back into her bag and stood up, slinging the bag over her shoulder. “I don’t understand you. One minute you’re fine and the nex-”<br/>“Miss Vidal.” Agatha cut her off, her voice low but authoritative, and stood up as well. “I implore you to think carefully about the next words you say.”<br/><br/>Rio shifted her weight between her feet. Was she actually considering what to say next? “How am I supposed to have a conversation with you if you change the rules on a whim?”<br/>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Let me make one thing perfectly clear, Miss Vidal. We are not, and never will be, friends. I am your professor, you are my student and our relationship will remain as such. I am well within my right to put a stop to any conversation if I feel it is inappropriate and I have already let you get away with a damn sight more than I would have any other student.” She saw something settle over Rio’s features but couldn’t place what it was. “Now, are you going to keep questioning me and make me late for my lecture, or are you going to concede so that we both may leave?”<br/><br/>Rio sighed and ran a hand through her hair. The act made her shirt ride up again and Agatha had to force herself to remain looking at her face. “You’re right, I apologise.” She made her way to the door. “I wouldn’t want to make the great Professor Harkness late for a lecture.”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes as Rio walked out and then pressed her palms to her eyes. This woman would be the death of her.</p><p align="center">___________</p><p align="justify"><br/>Agatha wasn’t well, she couldn’t be. She hadn’t been sleeping properly, she was nauseous and her head was pounding. She got herself an emergency appointment with her GP only for him to tell her that there was nothing wrong with her except maybe lack of sleep. He had asked if there had been a new instance of stress introduced into her life recently and she had scoffed and said, “Rio Vidal.” Then he’d had the nerve to ask if Rio was a new ‘romantic partner’ at which she had laughed and said “absolutely not.” What an absurd question to ask.<br/><br/>Anything she had felt when she watched Rio eat the cream or when her shirt had ridden up were perfectly normal things to feel. They were abstractly attractive things and had nothing to do with the person that was doing them, and as for that godforsaken dream? Well it didn’t mean a thing. Her subconscious had picked a random face out of the thousands that she had seen and it could just have easily been any one of them, reading into it was pointless. She was human and these were just things that humans did.<br/><br/>His incredible stupidity aside, her doctor had helped her to identify Rio as her problem and she decided that the best thing to do would be to put a stop to their meetings. They were clearly causing her more stress than she could handle and who was she to ignore the things that her body was telling her? When she got home she sent Rio an email.<br/><br/><b>Dear Miss Vidal,</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Upon much consideration I have decided that you no longer require weekly meetings, so I am terminating them.</b> <b><br/></b> <b>Please feel free to send anything you wish for me to look over and I shall make my best efforts to get back to you in a timely fashion.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Sincerely </b> <b><br/></b> <b>Professor Harkness</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> She felt a sense of relief as the whoosh sound of the email sending played through her laptop speakers – now there was one less thing occupying her mind.<br/>Agatha ran herself a bath, feeling the tension she usually carried in her shoulders ease slightly as she slipped into the warm water, and brought her wine glass to her lips. She allowed herself to close her eyes and have a few moments where her mind was clear and she felt relaxed, the only sounds being the bubbles softly popping and the crackle of the WoodWick candle she had lit on the windowsill.<br/>She hadn’t had a bath in a while and had forgotten how necessary they were to maintain her composed nature. This is what she needed, less Rio and more baths.<br/><br/>She must have dozed off because when she opened her eyes again, the bubbles were gone and the water had gone cold. Now shivering, and her neck feeling sore, she drained the bath and went into her bedroom to dry herself off and wrap herself in her fluffy dressing gown. She looked at her phone to check the time but instead saw a message notification, the name ridding her of her previously relaxed state.<br/><br/><b>Maximoff: Billy told me that you wanted to talk.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> She scowled. She knew that this was going to happen at some point, but she refused to be the one to initiate it. She was surprised that it had taken Wanda this long. Billy better not have phrased it that way though, or she would be having words with him the following day.<br/><br/><b>Agatha: He asked me if I would talk to you and I said that I would.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> She needed to clear that up right away, she needed Wanda to know that this was not her decision, nor was it really her choice. She would be doing this for Billy and that was the only reason.<br/><br/><b>Maximoff: When and where?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> Agatha hadn’t expected Wanda to let her have this much control so she took her time to ponder the question. ‘When’ was simple, getting it over and done with was preferable so tomorrow it was. As for ‘where’, she had no idea.<br/>Definitely not somewhere public, she wouldn’t allow Wanda the comfort of having a crowd there to tame her bite. They could use an empty room like she had with Billy, but that opened up the risk of someone walking in, or walking past and hearing them – and Agatha wasn’t going to let those people that had poked their noses where they didn’t belong, have access to any more gossip concerning her.<br/>They could use her office, but that denied Agatha the chance to make a quick, or dramatic, exit should she need to.<br/>Wanda’s office wasn’t a bad location. It was tucked out of the way down one of the less frequented corridors which meant it was less likely that their conversation would be caught by the wrong ears. Agatha just had to get over the fact that the idea of being in Wanda’s office made her feel sick, and she would be fine.<br/><br/><b>Agatha: Tomorrow 9:30, your office.</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Maximoff: Okay.</b></p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify"><b><br/></b> Agatha woke the next morning with a sense of determination. She had told Billy that she would talk to his mother, she never said anything about <em> how </em> she would talk to her, nor did she make any promises that it would go well.<br/>She put care into her outfit choice for the day, picking out a top that she knew Wanda liked and paired it with trousers that clung to her hips just right. She sprayed herself with perfume that Wanda had once loved and she was happy in the knowledge that she was going to make Wanda suffer.<br/><br/>She strode onto campus and into her office with a smile that showed no sign of wavering. She was going to tackle this head on and finally put to bed any further attempts that Wanda might make to get her attention. This would be a good thing for her and no matter how the conversation went, she would come out as the winner.<br/><br/>She made her way to Wanda’s office, walking the corridors that she had avoided for two and a half years, walking past offices and rooms that she hadn’t given thought to in such a long time. She turned a corner and was face-to-face with the door of Wanda’s office. Now she was faced with a dilemma: should she knock, or should she just walk in?<br/>Wanda knew that she would be there, obviously, so was a knock necessary? If she was to be the victor of whatever was about to happen then she would have to maintain the air of decorum whilst slapping Wanda down with her underhand.<br/>She knocked.<br/><br/>A few seconds passed before Wanda’s annoyingly bright voice was heard through the door. “Come in.”<br/>Agatha took a deep breath and pushed the door open, her smile overly friendly and her voice way too saccharine. “Well, what a pleasure it is to see you Ms. Maximoff.”<br/>Wanda was sitting at her desk, eyes fixed on the door as Agatha walked through it. Her smile was tight before she spoke. “Feel free to have a seat if you would like.”<br/>Agatha looked at the chairs, but remained standing. “I’m fine for now, thank you.” She put her hands in her trouser pockets to hide the fact that she was having to fight against balling them into fists to keep her grounded. “What would you like to talk about?”<br/>She saw Wanda’s eyes follow the movement of her hands and realised that she knew what she was doing. Wanda was still annoyingly in tune with her and Agatha hated that.<br/><br/>Wanda took a shaky breath, clearly making a lot less effort than Agatha was to hide her nervousness. “Given the fact that my son is now one of your students, I thought it would be best if we could try and reach a level of civility to make it as easy for him as possible during his time at this university.”<br/>Agatha could tell that was a front, hiding what Wanda really wanted to say, but she would play this game. “Of course. I would hate for Billy to feel like he’s caught in the middle of our past, Ms Maximoff.” She kept her voice sweet, knowing full well that both her tone and her choice of words would come across as fake. She did mean it though, she didn’t want Billy to be bearing the weight of her and Wanda’s past.<br/><br/>Wanda smiled, it was polite but it wasn’t a real smile. “You can drop the niceties, Agatha. I think we both know that you don’t mean them.” She leant forward and steepled her hands on her desk. “What do you need from me in order to make this work?”<br/>Agatha took a slow step forwards, bringing her a few inches closer to Wanda. “What are you willing to offer?”<br/>“No.” It was only one word, but it was weighted. Wanda was putting her foot down.<br/>Agatha lifted an eyebrow. “No?”<br/>“No.” Wanda repeated. “I’m not playing games, Agatha, not where my son is concerned.”<br/>Agatha had to laugh, she couldn’t help it. Wanda really couldn’t stop herself from telling lie after lie. “The same son that you begged to ask me to speak to you?” Agatha didn’t know if that was the truth, she had guessed that Billy might have had a push from his mother, but Wanda didn’t need to know that. “You don’t seem so bothered about games when you’re the one orchestrating them, Wanda.” She added an extra bite to the way that she said Wanda’s name. She wanted to say more but this was a dance that she was choreographing on the spot, so it had to be done carefully.<br/><br/>A hint of hurt made its way onto Wanda’s face letting Agatha know that her words had landed right where she had wanted them to. “What do you need, Agatha?” She repeated her question, her voice level but betrayed by a slight waver as she said Agatha’s name.<br/>Whoever had done the surgery to reinforce Wanda’s spine hadn’t done a very good job, she was cracking already, and Agatha could feel a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. “Why don’t you start by telling me why you wanted to speak to me?”<br/>Wanda sighed. “I’ve already told you, Billy is-”<br/>Agatha held up a hand, cutting her off. “Yes I heard that, but come on Wanda, we both know that isn’t the truth, don’t we?” She held Wanda’s gaze in her own, daring her to look away.<br/><br/>Wanda tensed her jaw and took a long breath, in and out through her nose. But to her credit, she didn’t look away from Agatha’s eyes. “Okay. Fine.” She spoke each word with precision, clearly unhappy about the fact that her lie had been caught out so quickly. “In order to fix my relationship with my son, I have to at least try to fix my relationship with you.” She sat up straight. “Does that suffice?”<br/>Agatha took another step closer. She was barely having to try and Wanda was coming apart at the seams, this would be easier than she thought. Wanda had left a thread dangling in front of her, she had to see what would happen if she gave it a gentle tug. “Oh so it’s not about Billy at all then, not really.”<br/>“Excuse me?”<br/><br/>She took one of her hands out of her pocket and pointed at Wanda pulling on the thread again. “This is all about making <em> yourself </em> feel better. You want to fix your relationship with Billy for you, not for him.” She tucked her hand back into her pocket.<br/>Wanda stuttered, probably trying to form her next lie. “No that- I’m not- it isn’t-” She clamped her mouth shut and Agatha took another step forward.<br/>“No, no, go on. Talk your way out of it.”<br/>Wanda narrowed her eyes and Agatha felt the satisfaction settling into her, she was getting to her. “I am not going to sit here and let you verbally assault me, Agatha.”<br/>Without missing a beat Agatha said, “stand up then,” and she finally let the smile that she had earlier stifled come to life. It was steeped in smugness that she was making no effort to hide, Wanda was right where she wanted her.<br/><br/>Wanda threw her hands up, exasperated. “What do you want from me? Do you want an apology, do you want me to say that I know that I fucked up and that I wish I could take it all back? Because I do!” Her voice had gotten louder as she was speaking which made Agatha do the opposite. She kept her voice low and controlled, channelling all of her anger into her hands as she balled them tightly in her pockets and took another step.<br/><br/>She spoke slowly, making sure every word was delivered perfectly. “Let me see if I’ve got this right. Not only do you use your son to emotionally manipulate me into speaking to you, you cheat on me, not once, not twice, but three times. You lie to everybody including your son, telling them that the reason we broke up was because of <em> my </em> infidelity. You get to play the part of the woman grieving a relationship and get everybody’s love and support, whilst I am cast into the shadows and made into a social pariah. And you think an apology is going to cut it?” She shook her head and gave a humourless laugh.<br/><br/>Wanda’s face dropped, her mouth hanging open slightly as the shock of Agatha’s words set in. “H- How did you…?” She trailed off, clearly unable to find her words.<br/>Agatha raised her brows. “How did I what, Wanda?” She took a final step forward, now at the edge of Wanda’s desk. “How did I know about the other two times that you slept with someone else while we were in a relationship?” She removed her hands from her pockets and put them on Wanda’s desk, supporting herself as she leaned forward and looked Wanda directly in her eyes. “Well you can thank your darling ex-husband for that. I suppose the guilt weighed heavier on him than it did you.” She gave the surface a tap. “Oh the things this poor desk has endured.”<br/><br/>That was the final tug, the thread had been pulled free and all of Wanda’s lies had been unveiled. Agatha had been holding on to that knowledge for nearly two years and it felt so good to finally get to use it, to finally lay it out in front of Wanda and use it to break her down. “I am curious about one more thing, though.” She said, standing back upright. Wanda didn’t respond, she just gulped so Agatha continued. “You say that you’re desperate to fix your relationship with Billy, but did you tell him the whole story about why I came home that day?” Wanda opened her mouth to respond but Agatha held up her hand, silencing her. “Don’t bother. I already know the truth, and quite frankly I do not trust you to tell it. But maybe <em> I’ll </em> tell him. He has a right to know.”<br/><br/>Wanda shot out of her chair, looking frantic. “Agatha don’t.”<br/>Agatha quirked her eyebrow, a smirk forming. “Are you going to tell him?” Wanda dropped her head, looking at the floor and Agatha shot another barb at her. “Of course not. You’re pathetic.”<br/>“If I have any hope of repairing my relationship with him, he can’t know. It’ll only make it worse.” Wanda’s voice was meek and when she raised her head again her eyes were shiny. “Please Agatha. Don’t do that to him.”<br/><br/>Agatha scoffed and it turned into a dark laugh. “You’re still using him to get what <em> you </em> want.” She jabbed a finger at Wanda. “Can you really not see how monumentally fucked up that is Wanda?”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes when she saw Wanda’s tears starting to fall. “Don’t start with that bullshit, we both know it’s not real.” She crossed her arms. “I won’t tell him but I want it to be perfectly clear that I am doing it for him and <em> not </em> for you. Do you understand?” Wanda nodded. “Good. You can tell him that we are now on civil terms, or whatever the fuck you need to tell him to get yourself back into his good books, but if you fuck up where he is concerned again then he will find out. Am I clear?”<br/>“Yes.”<br/>“Well done. Now you can reflect on why you needed to be blackmailed into being a good mother. Have a nice day, Wanda.”<br/>With that, Agatha turned and walked out of the room. She would be riding this high for the rest of the week.</p>

<p align="justify">Rio was cooking dinner for herself, alone, on a Saturday night. She really missed the big family meals that would happen almost every weekend at home. She missed hearing her abuela telling her cousins that they weren’t allowed in her kitchen because they couldn’t be trusted to boil water, never mind cook a full meal. She missed hearing the Spanglish bullshit echoing around whoever’s house they were in. She even missed it when her uncle would say something slightly homophobic and then ask her if it was still okay to say. He meant well, and he did try – most of the time – but he was also someone who believed everything he read on Facebook, so he had to be taken with a pinch of salt.<br/>Every family has one.<br/><br/>She had facetimed with her friends and her parents a few times and that had helped to fill the void a little bit, but it didn’t get rid of it. She knew that moving to England was a big step and that being so far away from home – from everything and everyone that she knew – would be hard, but she hadn’t expected to miss it this much or this quickly. She had hoped that she would have been too busy to really think about it, but her PhD was starting slowly and wasn’t occupying her mind nearly enough. </p><p align="justify">There was Alice and Billy who she was really starting to get along with and they were the only people that she had really talked to, but at the end of the day they were teenagers and she was thirty. She'd need to find some friends her own age at some point, ones that wouldn't be able to out drink her and put her to shame. </p><p align="justify">During her masters she had become friends with her lecturers more than her fellow students, she would find herself at a bar with them most nights – and woken up next to one of them the following morning – but she couldn't see that happening with any of the staff this time. Not right now at least. <br/>Well, maybe Wanda. Wanda had definitely been flirting with her, right? She hadn't made that up. </p><p align="justify">She was still early in her efforts to get to know Agatha so she couldn't say for certain how that would go. Agatha struck her as the type of person one has to work at. Steadily chip away at the hard exterior to reveal the truth underneath, but would Agatha be willing to let that happen? Only time would tell. Rio was determined to get into her good books either way, it was vital to her survival as one of Agatha's students. <br/>When she had finished eating, she opened her laptop and started doing the research to bring to her next meeting with Agatha. Hades and Persephone had been on her mind since Agatha’s lecture about them so she decided to start there, and it didn’t take long for her to be engrossed in it. She worked until the early hours of the morning and only stopped because her eyes were starting to hurt and none of the words were making sense anymore. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">There was a monotony to the following few days and Rio couldn't help feeling bored. She had taken some more trips to the garden centre and her flat was slowly filling up with the various plants that she had bought to fill the space, adding colour to the otherwise quite bare living quarters that she was spending her time in. During her last call to her parents they had said that they'd send some more of her books and other creature comforts over to help the apartment feel more lived-in, and she hoped that having more pieces of home around her would help to break her out of the slump that she was currently stuck in. </p><p align="justify">She woke up on Wednesday morning ready to have her first official meeting with Agatha. She had arranged her notes on Hades and Persephone into a powerpoint presentation, a study technique that she had adopted during her undergrad. The idea was given to her by her girlfriend at the time and had been the only positive thing that she had taken away from that relationship.<br/><br/>She gave Agatha her laptop so that she could look over her notes and watched her eyes widen as she took it in. Rio hoped that the surprise on Agatha’s face was the good kind and not her realising that she had made a mistake in taking Rio on.<br/>“Miss Vidal, this is–”<br/>Rio spoke over her, feeling the need to defend herself before she even had a reason to. “I know, it’s a lot. And I know a powerpoint is strange but it helps me arrange my thoughts better.” <br/>“I have to say tha–” Agatha tried to continue but again, Rio jumped in.<br/>“Oh, I know the writing leaves some things to be desired but this is just notes and nothing is set in stone yet.” <br/>She stopped speaking when Agatha held up her hand, the universally recognised sign for <em>‘shut the fuck up.’</em> <br/><br/>When Agatha spoke, her voice was commanding and Rio knew that she was keeping her tone neutral on purpose. “Miss Vidal, are you going to let me speak?” <br/>Rio didn’t respond, she wasn’t sure her voice would work if she tried because her mouth had suddenly gone very dry. <br/>“Thank you. This is good work. I can tell that you’ve put effort into this and that you haven’t haphazardly thrown it together. Your list of sources is good and the information is laid out nicely.” <br/>She took Agatha’s praise but remained silent, part of her was waiting for Agatha’s permission to speak, the other part of her was trying to not think about the fact that she was waiting for Agatha to give her that permission. <br/><br/>Agatha was an attractive woman, any creature with eyes could corroborate that fact, but Rio wasn’t usually the type to be made speechless by an attractive woman. If anything she preferred to talk to them, to find out what made them tick and which buttons she could press to elicit the reactions that she wanted – even if they weren’t actually her type and her goal wasn't to sleep with them. Flirting as a general act was fun to take part in. Sure there were things that women could say or do that would cause her brain to buffer, but she wasn’t often left without a clever retort or flirty answer on the tip of her tongue. Had it really been long enough that she had lost her game?<br/><br/>Rio watched Agatha lean back in her chair before saying, “you may speak,” and she dropped some of the tension sitting in her shoulders. “Thank you, Professor.” She forced out and adjusted herself in her seat as a feeling sank low in her stomach. She cleared her throat to try and get her voice to sound normal again. “I also started doing some research on Orpheus and Eurydice on the back of this because of the musical Hadestown, and how it links them in with Hades and Persephone. I don’t know if you’ve heard of it, but it's really good.” She had no idea if Agatha was a musical theater kind of person so this could fall flat, but she felt more at ease when Agatha said that she was familiar with it. <br/><br/>Agatha gave Rio her laptop back. “Do you think you could do it?” She asked.<br/>Rio’s brow creased in confusion. “Do what?” <br/>She watched Agatha stand up from her desk and make her way to sit in the chair opposite the one she was currently in. <br/>“Do you think you could lead Eurydice back to the surface and not turn around? Or Orpheus, I don’t know your preferences.”<br/>The last part sounded like an afterthought and Rio couldn’t help but wonder if Agatha was not-so-subtly trying to figure out her sexuality. <br/><br/>It wasn’t something that she hid, she’d never had a reason to. She knew that she was incredibly lucky to have parents who had accepted her without question when she came out, and her abuela had said <em>“as long as you let me meet your girlfriends so that I can make sure they’re right for my granddaughter, I don’t have any problems.”</em> Rio had made good on that promise and let her abuela interrogate every one of her girlfriends. Upon reflection, that was probably the reason that many of her relationships hadn’t lasted much longer past that point – but if they couldn’t handle her abuela then the relationship wasn’t going to work anyway. <br/>She chuckled at Agatha’s thinly veiled attempt at nonchalance. “I would be leading Eurydice.</p><p align="justify">But I honestly don’t know if I would be able to do it. I think I would be too in my head, like Orpheus was.” Her eyes met Agatha’s and she took in the vivid blue for a second before asking, “what about you?” <br/>Agatha gave the question some thought and Rio patiently waited for her answer. She enjoyed these kinds of conversations, they were a good way to get to know someone, how they think, how they view certain things. Much better than generic small talk. <br/>“I’ve never really thought about it. I suppose if I loved someone the way that Orpheus loved Eurydice I would definitely give it a go.” <br/>The way that Agatha worded her answer caught Rio’s attention. <em> “The way that Orpheus loved Eurydice.” </em> Was Agatha saying that she would be Orpheus in that situation? Rio had been forthcoming with her answer so maybe Agatha was returning that. <br/>“So you would be leading Eurydice too?” <br/>“That is an extremely personal question, Miss Vidal. One that has no place in our meetings.” <br/><br/>Rio’s smirk faded as quickly as it had appeared at the tone of Agatha’s voice. It was the kind of tone that you didn’t argue with, the kind of tone that let you know that she was the one in charge, the kind of tone that Rio couldn’t tell if she wanted to comply with or act against. <br/>One of her exes had called her a brat because of her need to challenge everything, and her ability to always have answers ready – that had led to a wonderfully long night. <br/>But she still had no idea where she stood with Agatha, she was hard to figure out which made Rio want to try harder. She was avoiding her eyes as she could feel them on her, likely trying to read her reaction. <br/><br/>When Agatha spoke, some of the chill had been removed from her voice but it was still hard. “I like to keep my personal and professional lives separate. I apologise for snapping.” <br/>It was a fair statement, one that most professionals followed, however Rio found it slightly odd. Earlier Agatha had basically asked her if she was into men or women, but when she was faced with the same question her reaction had been defensive. Rio wasn’t one to let the ‘one rule for you, one rule for myself’ attitude slide, she never had been, so she had to push back a little. <br/>“You didn’t seem too concerned with the separation of personal from professional when you asked me.” The corners of her mouth lifted slightly knowing that Agatha wouldn’t be expecting this response. <br/>“I beg your pardon.” <br/>“You asked me what my <em> preferences </em> were. How come personal questions are only off the table when they’re about you?” She lazily leaned back in her chair. <br/><br/>Agatha’s attempt to not rise to Rio’s challenge gave Rio a feeling of satisfaction that sat in her chest and warmed her skin, she was starting to enjoy this. <br/>“You offered that information up freely, Miss Vidal. It isn’t my fault that you didn’t keep it to yourself.” <br/>Rio recognised this defensiveness, she had seen it in many people throughout her life; she had seen it in herself. The need to hide, the fear of being known and Agatha wore her defensiveness like armour. But all armour has a weak spot and Rio was willing to work at finding Agatha’s, so she took a wild shot. <br/>“I didn’t feel the need to keep it to myself. I’m not ashamed of it.” <br/>“I’m not sure that I know what you’re implying, Miss Vidal.” Agatha’s jaw was clenched and Rio could see the redness slowly making its way up her neck. The shot had landed, now she just needed to make sure that it stuck. She crossed her arms as she said, “I’m not implying anything. I am simply offering information up freely.” <br/><br/>Agatha took a deep breath and caught Rio’s eyes with her own, her displeasure at the conversation evident in the way that they narrowed. “We have wondered spectacularly off topic. None of this has anything to do with Greek Mythology, and since that’s why we’re here, I think it would be appropriate for us to continue in that direction. Don’t you agree?” <br/>Rio let her smile drop and adjusted her position in her seat to be sitting up straight before replying. “Of course, you’re right. My apologies Professor.” She knew that if she pushed too far straight away, it would end up having the opposite effect to the one that she wanted. This was a delicate game that she had played many times with her professors in the past, though none of them had been this difficult but she liked a challenge. <br/><br/>Agatha leaned back, adopting a more casual posture. “Do you have a structure for your research, or is it just whatever takes your fancy in the moment?” <br/>“I don’t have a structure as such, but I’m working on it.” Rio leaned forwards, resting her elbows on her thighs. “That’s the thing I tend to have trouble with actually.” Her eyes were drawn to the movement of Agatha uncrossing and recrossing her legs. She saw a hint of something black and light blue on her ankle, peeking out over the top of her heeled shoe. <em> A tattoo. </em> Rio filed the information away to ask about at a later date and brought her eyes back up to look at Agatha’s face again. <br/><br/>They spent some time discussing the structure of her thesis and the areas that she struggled with. It was a slight source of embarrassment for Rio, the thing that she always lost marks on. Not enough to make her worry about not getting a high grade, but enough that the perfect mark she strived to achieve was always just out of reach. She had always rejected the help offered to her because she felt that she should be able to do something this basic by herself, if she couldn’t then she didn’t deserve the marks that she got. But Agatha offering to help felt different, it didn’t feel like she was speaking down to her or viewing her as less than because she struggled with this basic concept of writing. It was purely because she wanted to help and wanted Rio to achieve her full potential. <br/><br/>After asking Rio to bring all of the notes that she had made thus far to their next meeting, Agatha checked her watch and asked if there was anything else she wanted to discuss with the remainder of their time. <br/>Rio thought for a minute, she had already stepped too close to the line so she needed to take a few paces back. “What piqued your interest in Greek Mythology?” <br/>The question was innocent enough and could be linked back to her thesis so Rio thought that it was a happy medium. The way that Agatha sighed, however, alerted her to the fact that she was wrong. <br/>“I meant about your thesis, Miss Vidal.” <br/>“This is for my thesis.” Rio insisted. <br/>Agatha spread her arms out. “Please, enlighten me.” <br/>“You haven’t read Percy Jackson which is, to use your own words, a gateway drug. So what piece of media opened your mind to it?” <br/><br/>There was a beat of silence as Agatha thought about the question. Rio wished that she could hear her thoughts, wished that she could know what was going on in Agatha’s head as she formed her response. Would she answer truthfully, or would she just say something to get Rio off of her back and shut the question down? <br/>“My mother read The Odyssey to me when I was a child.” Agatha said in a matter-of-fact tone like she was trying to keep any emotional link out of the sentence. <br/>Rio couldn’t hide her surprise, her eyebrows shooting up involuntarily. “Oh wow, one of the OGs.</p><p align="justify">How old were you?”<br/>She watched Agatha adjust herself, any semblance of a casual nature removed as she straightened her back and hardened her features. “This is getting personal again, Miss Vidal.” <br/><br/>Rio huffed and dropped her head, shaking it. She didn’t care to hide how the way Agatha had spoken had annoyed her – it was no wonder that she had so many complaints against her. At first Rio had thought that it was just people being overly sensitive and not being able to take criticism, or expecting to be mollycoddled through their degrees and being unable to face the harsh reality, but if this was how Agatha spoke to all of her students then she could understand it a bit more. She wouldn’t complain though, clearly the previous complaints had not had the effect that was hoped of them. She wouldn’t be surprised if they’d managed to make it worse, if they’d only made Agatha double down on it and really earn them. <br/><br/>When Agatha spoke again, there was an edge to her voice, a coldness seeping into the words. “I am not in the business of discussing myself or my life with my students, Miss Vidal. I am your supervisor and our meetings are in place to work on your thesis and, when it comes to it, your viva.” <br/>Rio looked at her again and mimicked her straight-backed posture. “I’m not trying to pry into your personal life, Professor. Surely you can see why inquiring as to how you found your interest in Greek Mythology to the point where you wanted to teach other people about it, is relevant to my thesis. You don’t have to tell me your life story but a discussion requires both parties to be able to share information that relates to the topic at hand.” She tried to keep her voice steady and her tone flat but she couldn’t stop the bite that curled around the edges of her words, nor did she want to. She would match the way that Agatha had spoken to her, something she was sure was a rare occurrence for Agatha. <br/><br/>Agatha tensed her jaw and narrowed her eyes, her voice dropping low. “I do not take kindly to being told off by a subordinate, Miss Vidal.” <br/>“And I don’t take kindly to being spoken down to by someone who thinks their title gives them the right to.” Rio didn’t miss a beat in her response, making sure every word landed where she wanted it to. <br/>“If you cannot respect me as your superior, Miss Vidal, then I suggest that you find a new supervisor.” Agatha’s voice was slowly starting to increase in volume and her eyes were starting to burn with intensity.</p><p align="justify">Rio scoffed but kept her voice level when she spoke. “When you give me a reason to respect you, <em> Professor Harkness </em> , you shall have it.” She knew that Agatha would recognise the reference to their first meeting and hoped that the way she spat her name would carry the weight that she intended. She didn’t mind Agatha calling her Miss Vidal, she knew that it was a polite yet professional way to address her, but the way that Agatha used it when she was trying to assert her authority over her made her skin prickle. <br/><br/>Rio was officially done entertaining this conversation – no, this chastisement – so she stood up and threw her laptop into her bag. <br/>“Miss Vidal, sit back down.” <br/>Agatha’s command caused something in Rio to snap. She could no longer keep her voice down, she didn’t <em> want </em> to keep her voice down. “No! Other people might allow you to speak to them in this way, but I won’t. Your reputation at this university might be good, but it does not give you the right to talk to people like they are beneath you. Like I said before, you aren't the only lecturer that I wanted to be my supervisor so I will gladly go and find her.” She was once again holding the empty threat of Wanda Maximoff over Agatha’s head, and she hoped to god that Agatha never called her bluff because then she would be truly fucked. She had no idea what the shelf life of this threat was and she knew that she probably wouldn’t be able to use it again any time soon, but it was the only thing she had at the moment that could give Agatha pause. She was also desperate to know what exactly it was about Wanda Maximoff that made Agatha panic this much, but that would have to wait. <br/><br/>Rio started towards the door, her hand firmly on the handle already trying to prepare her words to beg Wanda to take her on when she heard Agatha call after her. <br/>“Wait.” <br/>She stopped, but didn’t turn around. “What?” <br/>The seconds ticked by as silence stretched between them. Rio refused to turn around until Agatha gave her a reason to, she was ready to just walk out if Agatha didn’t speak soon. <br/>Right as Rio had reached the end of her tether, Agatha spoke, her voice quiet, merely a ghost of the way she had spoken only moments ago. <br/>“I’m sorry.” <br/>Rio’s immediate response was laughter, it was the only way that she could express her disbelief at Agatha’s pathetic choice of words. “Are you being fucking serious?” She dropped her hand and finally turned around. “You accuse me of prying into your personal life, talk down to me, call me a fucking <em> subordinate </em> and the best you can come up with is ‘I’m sorry’?” She shook her head, still laughing. <br/><br/>Agatha was grasping at straws, she had to be. There’s no other way that she would be resorting to a simple ‘I’m sorry,’ if she had anything else to try, any other words to throw out. She made this evident with her next question. “Well what do you want me to say?” It wasn’t a question that was open to a reply so she continued. “Do you want me to beg for your forgiveness? Because I can assure you, Miss Vidal, that will not be happening.” <br/>Rio didn’t want her to beg for her forgiveness, that wasn’t her goal. She just wanted to have a conversation with Agatha, to talk like normal people and get to know each other a little bit – just basic things that humans did when they interacted, especially if she was to spend at least three years at this university, at least three years with Agatha as her supervisor. <br/><br/>Rio slowly stepped towards Agatha. “Answer my question.” <br/>“Which one?” <br/>“How old were you when you read The Odyssey?” <br/>Rio heard the way that Agatha asked if she was serious. She heard the questioning tone, she saw the way Agatha’s eyebrow raised in disbelief but she just waited. If Agatha didn’t answer her then she would leave, and this would be the end of the odd meetings, the strange conversations and the annoying interactions; and Rio would be left without a supervisor, but that was better than whatever the fuck this was. <br/><br/>After some time of the only sound being the faint hum of people talking as they walked past Agatha’s office, and the steady click of the clock on the wall, she eventually answered. “Ten. I was ten years old. Are you happy now?” <br/>Rio felt a wave of satisfaction wash over her and felt the corners of her mouth lift slightly. She had to admit that she did get a certain amount of joy from pushing people and she suspected that Agatha felt the same, which is why she was so unwilling to let it happen to her. Agatha was used to being the one who was in charge, the one who got her way, the one who always came out on top and that ignited something within Rio. Maybe she wouldn’t be beating the ‘bratty’ allegations any time soon. <br/><br/>Agatha clenched her jaw and tightened the cross of her arms. “I’m not sure what you hoped to achieve with this, Miss Vidal, but I assure you that this is the first and last time anything like this will happen. I do <em> not </em> share personal information with students and I am the one who gets to determine what classes as personal information. Now stop acting like a child.” <br/>Rio’s eyes widened in surprise. “I’m acting like a child? You’re the one that threw a tantrum when I asked you a basic question about yourself.” She inched herself closer to Agatha. “I get that you want to keep your work and private lives separate, and I am aware that I overstepped when I asked if you would be leading Eurydice so I apologise for that. But, like I said, if we are to be having discussions then some generic information will have to be given on both sides.” She couldn’t believe that she was having to gentle parent a college professor and teach them the basics of having a conversation. <br/><br/>She didn’t know why Agatha was so against sharing anything about herself, it was a defence mechanism sure but there was something else, something that made Agatha seem almost scared. There was a story to it that intrigued Rio and she was searching Agatha for any hint of what that story was, any crack in the walls that Agatha hid behind but she couldn’t find anything. Even after pushing the way that she had Agatha was still blocked in. <br/><br/>Agatha looked at the floor and spoke in a quiet voice. “You’re right.” She cleared her throat and looked back up at Rio, repeating herself. “You’re right. I flew off the handle and conducted myself in an extremely unprofessional manner, for which I apologise.” She paused waiting for Rio to interject, but Rio just waited patiently for her to finish. “I'm not used to being challenged and it's rare that people have a spine when conversing with me. But it seems that you don't have that problem.” <br/>Rio gave a soft chuckle. “My parents raised me to speak my mind and stand up for myself. I guess they never thought about how it would translate into speaking with authority figures.” <br/><br/>There was a soft ping from Agatha’s phone and it seemed to snap Agatha back into Professor mode. She turned to her desk and picked up her laptop and various papers. “Well I have some first years to scare so we're going to have to end this here. Once again, you are welcome to attend. I think your presence gives them confidence since you were the first one to speak out.” She gave Rio a small smile and went to open the door. “There's no pressure though.” <br/>“I'll think about it.” Rio said jokingly as she headed out the door. <br/><br/>Another confusing meeting with Agatha had been acquired, maybe she should start writing them down and compare them all at the end of the year to see which one was the winner for ‘most absurd interaction with university staff.’ The fact that sleeping with her lecturer during her masters wasn’t even on the list at the minute made her laugh. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Rio did go to the lecture, Agatha was back in teaching mode effortlessly commanding the attention of a hundred students as she spoke about Heracles’ twelve labours. <br/>“Depending on the version of the myth that you come across, the circumstances surrounding his twelve labours differ. In one version, it is a fit of madness, induced by Hera, that causes Heracles to kill his children and wife, Megara. This in turn directs him to serve King Eurystheus for ten years and perform any task Eurystheus required of him – the twelve labours.” She paused to allow time for people to take notes.<br/><br/>Rio glanced to her left to look at Billy’s laptop and whispered. “You’ve spelled Eurystheus’ name wrong, it's a ‘Y’ not an ‘I’.” <br/>Billy made a dramatic show of turning his laptop so that the screen was angled away from her and whispered back in mock seriousness. “I know that you’re not very smart, but can you not copy my notes please?” <br/>Rio snorted. “It’s cute that you think your notes are anything of interest to me.” <br/>He moved his laptop back and amended the spelling. “Happy now, you fucking nerd?” <br/>She nodded, “very.” <br/><br/>Agatha continued. “In some traditions, there was only a divine reason for Heracles's twelve labours. Zeus, in his desire not to leave Heracles the victim of Hera's jealousy, made her promise that, if Heracles executed twelve great works in the service of Eurystheus, he should become immortal. In the play Herakles by Euripides, Heracles is driven to madness by Hera and kills his children after his twelve labours.” She paused again as she changed the slides on her presentation. “Can anyone tell me one of the twelve labours in question?” <br/>Rio watched with amusement as seemingly every student in the room forgot every single one of Heracles' labours. She chuckled and smiled when Alice leaned back to look at her past Billy and mouthed, “help.” <br/><br/>She glanced at Agatha who was standing patiently, waiting for an answer before looking back at Alice and whispering – probably too loudly, “hydra.” <br/>Alice’s eyes widened comically as the realisation that she’d forgotten the most obvious one hit her. She cleared her throat and said, “he had to kill the Hydra.” <br/>Agatha was already looking in their direction, Rio had definitely whispered too loudly, but she smiled and nodded all the same. “Yes, correct.” She typed ‘Slay the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra’ onto the blank slide. “Anyone else?” <br/>Rio covered her mouth with her hand to try and hide the fact that she was whispering to Billy, “Capture and return Cerberus.” But he didn’t hear her properly and drew Agatha’s attention again by leaning towards Rio and asking, “what?” <br/><br/>Agatha cleared her throat and set her gaze squarely on Rio. “Miss Vidal, I take it that all this whispering means that you know the answers.” It wasn’t a question, it was an observation. Agatha was definitely aware of the fact that Rio knew all twelve of them; she would have been insulted if Agatha had implied that the opposite was true. “Would you care to do us the honour of listing them all?” <br/><br/>Rio huffed out a breath. “Gladly, Professor.” <em>But are you sure that you can type quickly enough to keep up with me?</em> The question sat on the tip of her tongue begging to be asked, needing to be turned from thoughts to words, but Rio knew that this wasn’t the time or place for it so she swallowed it and replaced it with the remaining eleven labours. “Slay the Nemean Lion, capture the Golden Hind of Artemis, capture the Erymanthian Boar, clean the Augean stables in a single day, slay the Stymphalian Birds, capture the Cretan Bull, steal the Mares of Diomedes, obtain the belt of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, obtain the cattle of the monster Geryon, steal the golden apples of the Hesperides, capture and return Cerberus.” She paused in between each one, giving Agatha a chance to type them out before saying the next. <br/><br/>When Rio had finished the list, a girl a few rows in front scoffed and rolled her eyes at her and turned to her friend to whisper something, but Rio couldn’t make out what it was. It gave Rio a sense of pride, a feeling of smugness, but she also felt the tendrils of anxiety creeping their way in. It wasn’t her fault that she’d memorised all of this years ago and no one else in the room – except maybe Agatha – had bothered to do so too. She knew that she was in a lecture for first years but this was basic knowledge that everyone should know, right? There was no way that she was still the ‘weird kid’ in a room where time was literally dedicated to speaking about one of her interests. <br/><br/>At the age of thirty she should not be made to feel this insecure by a fucking teenager all because she was smarter than them. At the age of thirty she shouldn't be overthinking it as much as she was.<br/><br/>When the lecture ended she was heading for the door with Alice and Billy when Agatha stopped her. “Miss Vidal, stay behind please.” <br/>Billy and Alice exchanged a look before Alice said, “We’ll wait for you outside,” and they both left the room. <br/>Agatha waited until the last person had left and the door was closed before speaking. “Miss Vidal, I know that these lectures may seem rather pedestrian to someone of your academic expertise, and while I appreciate that you are trying to help your friends, I would also appreciate it if you let me do my job and teach them.” <br/>Maybe she was reading too much into it, but Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that this was Agatha trying to regain some of the control that she had lost earlier, trying to reassert her authority and let Rio know that she was in charge. <br/>The urge to fight back was strong but Rio fought through it and said, “I understand, Professor. My apologies.” <br/>Agatha nodded once and said, “you may go,” then she turned her attention to her laptop as if Rio had stopped existing.<br/><br/>Rio opened her mouth to respond but didn’t actually know what to say so she just turned and walked out of the room. Billy and Alice were waiting in the corridor and both turned to look at her when they saw her walk out of the door. “Well you’re not crying so it can’t have been that bad.” Alice said, feigning concern.<br/>“She told me off for telling you two idiots the answers.” Rio laughed. “So really, this is your fault for not being as smart as me.” <br/>Billy scoffed. “Oh so because we’re not massive fucking nerds, we’re the problem?” <br/>“Exactly.” Rio said, matter-of-factly.<br/><br/>The three of them went to get lunch and then Rio went with them to the rest of their lectures for the day. Being able to do her own research on her own time and on her own terms was the good thing about doing a PhD, but she had to admit that she missed going to lectures and not having to think for herself so much. The first years were basically spoon-fed all of the information they needed and could put in zero effort and still pass. <br/><br/>She remembered her first year well, which was surprising given how much alcohol she drank during it. As a child she had always been fascinated by pretty or cool looking rocks that she had found on the beach, and the time that she found an ammonite fossil had sparked a new interest in her, so studying archaeology had been a no-brainer. The thought of being able to discover history and pull parts of it out of the ground with her bare hands had been extremely exciting to her. <br/><br/>She had met some of her closest friends during her first year, they had lived together throughout all three years at college and had gone on all of their summer placements together, and they all still met up every couple of months – they were all going to Virginia at Christmas to see her when she flew back home for the holidays. <br/><br/>She had also met, who she thought was at the time, the love of her life. Cassidy had been in her final year and they met by chance one night in the campus bar, Rio took Cassidy back to her flat and she never left. Her friends joked about how ‘lady killer Vidal’ had finally been tamed and had gone soft, but they were also very vocal about how much they liked Cassidy and how they were so well suited together. Cassidy had survived the grilling that Rio’s abuela had given her and she was all Rio saw when she thought about the future. Unfortunately, Cassidy had not felt the same way. A week before their two year anniversary, Cassidy messaged Rio to say that she wasn’t “feeling it anymore” and that they should break up. <br/><br/>Rio had tried to fight for them, to fix whatever had been broken, but her efforts were thrown back in her face when Cassidy’s new girlfriend showed up at her student flat and threatened to call the police if she didn’t stop harassing her. <br/><em>“Cassidy doesn’t need some doe-eyed undergrad following her around and holding her back. Get a fucking grip and grow up.”</em> <br/>Rio had been so depressed that she stopped attending her lectures and put little-to-no effort into her coursework which resulted in her nearly failing her final year and, in turn, failing her degree. Her friends had helped her pull herself together in time to save her grade, absolutely knocking her dissertation out of the park and getting herself the first that she knew was easily within her grasp. She did need to beg for an extension on her dissertation deadline, but thankfully that didn’t reflect badly on her.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">As the trio were leaving the final lecture of the day, Rio turned to them and asked, “fancy a pint?” <br/>“Can't right now, we have band practise.” Alice said. <br/>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You're in a band?” <br/>Billy nodded. “Yeah! I mean it's just other students and it's nothing proper at the minute, but we're trying to put a set together to play at the end of year ball that the department has.”<br/>“What's your band name?” Rio asked. <br/>“We don't have one yet.” Billy and Alice replied in unison. <br/>Rio widened her eyes in mock surprise. “What? Everyone knows that a band is only as good as their name. Mine was called Big Gulp.” She laughed as she recalled the memories. “As you can tell from the name, we weren't very good.” </p><p align="justify">Alice put her arm out to stop them all from walking. “Why have you kept this potentially embarrassing information from us? Please tell me there’s videos!” <br/>Rio stepped around her arm. “Yes there are, but you two will never see them.” <br/>“Oh come on,” Alice begged. “At least tell us what instrument you play.” <br/>Rio laughed and shook her head, but told them anyway. “I was the drummer.” <br/><br/>She walked away before Alice and Billy could hit her with their barrage of questions, and went to cut across the car park that she had recently found took ten minutes off of her walk home. Towards the back of the car park she could see someone standing at their car with the hood open, as she got closer she recognised the person. It was Wanda and she was staring at her car looking thoroughly confused. <br/>“So you’re either a powerful witch who is fixing her car with mind magic, or you have no idea what you’re looking at right now.” Rio said jokingly as she got close enough for Wanda to hear her. <br/><br/>Wanda jumped slightly having not heard Rio approaching. “Jesus Rio! I didn’t see you.” She chuckled softly. “It’s most definitely the latter. This has never made sense to me.” <br/>“You want me to take a look?” Rio asked as she moved around Wanda to get a closer look at the car. <br/>“If you know what you’re doing, by all means! It wouldn't start when I tried it just now.” <br/>Rio hummed. “Did any warning lights come up or could it not get to that point?” <br/>Wanda shook her head. “It didn’t get to that point.” <br/>“Do you mind if I try it, just to see what I’m working with?” Wanda offered her keys to Rio and Rio slid into the drivers side and put the keys in the ignition. “Tell me if anything happens when I try to start it.” <br/><em> ‘The English might drive on the other side of the car, but everything else should be the same… I hope.’ </em> She thought as she turned the key. <br/><br/>The engine tried to start and the dashboard flashed for a second but that was the only sign of life that the car gave her so she took the keys out and stepped out of the car again. “Did anything happen with the engine?” <br/>Wanda shrugged. “I’m going to be honest, Rio, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you if it did.” <br/>Rio laughed. “Fair enough. I can have a look under the hood for you, but I can’t make any promises. Do you have any tools on you?” <br/>Wanda walked to the boot and pulled something out of it. It was a small red toolbox that looked like it had never been opened. “My ex husband got me this years ago when he tried to teach me how to fix it myself, but I’ve never used it. I wouldn’t know where to start!” <br/>She gave the toolbox to Rio who put it on the ground and started shrugging her jacket off. “Would you mind holding this for me? I don’t want it to get dirty.” <br/>Wanda took the jacket off of her and her eyes went wide when she touched it. “Is this real leather?” <br/>Rio smiled. “Yeah it is, it’s custom made.” She saw Wanda’s mouth drop open when she looked at the tag. <br/>“This is a custom Ralph Lauren?” <br/>Rio chuckled as she rested the toolbox on the edge of the car and leant over to get a better look inside the hood. “Yes it is. Now you see why I didn’t want it getting dirty.” <br/>Wanda hummed her agreement and watched Rio as she checked a couple of things with the engine; she pulled a rag out of the toolbox and wiped the battery terminals. <br/><br/>She straightened up, wiping her hands on the rag. “Try it again now.” <br/>Wanda gently put the jacket on the passenger seat before getting in the driver's side, and Rio smiled at how careful she was being with her jacket. <br/>The engine roared to life and Wanda got back out of the car. “I don’t know what you did, but thank you!” She pulled Rio into a hug and Rio awkwardly tried not to touch her with her dirty hands. <br/>Rio put on a fake southern drawl. “All in a day's work, ma’am.” <br/>Wanda put her hand on her hip and mimicked the accent. “Well how will I ever repay you for your kindness?” <br/>“No need Darlin’, a true gentleman don’t need nothin’ in return.” <br/>Wanda laughed and dropped the accent. “Seriously though, I want to thank you. At least let me give you a lift home.” <br/>Rio smiled and also returned to her normal accent. “Okay yeah, I’ll take that.” <br/><br/>They both got in the car and Wanda insisted on putting Rio’s jacket in the back to make sure that the remaining grease on her hands didn’t get on it. The drive to Rio’s flat was only five minutes so it didn’t leave any time for conversation but before Rio got out of the car, Wanda smirked and said, “Look at us being able to have an interaction without you trying to kill me.” <br/>Rio pretended to be serious when she replied. “Don’t speak too soon, your car could still blow up.” <br/>“Well actually, you make a good point.” <br/>Rio laughed as she got out of the car. “Thanks for the ride.” <br/>Wanda smiled and said, “Thank <em> you </em> for fixing said ride.” </p><p align="justify">Rio watched Wanda drive away before letting herself into her flat. She set her bag down and took off her shoes before flopping onto her sofa and turning on her TV for background noise as she picked up a book that she had started reading, and settled in for the evening.</p>

<span>As she was getting ready to leave her flat, Rio realised that Wanda had driven off with her jacket still on the back seat. Had Wanda done it on purpose so that they’d have an excuse to see each other again? No, surely not. Rio was reading too much into it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She would just swing by Wanda’s office on her way to the library and ask her to bring it in tomorrow. Or was that too informal? Should she email her instead? She didn’t know what terms they were on. “Fuck it, I’ll go to her office.” She said to herself as she pulled a burgundy hoodie from her wardrobe.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She got onto campus around ten o’clock and veered towards the building that had the ancient history department in it – it was at the opposite end to the library so it wasn’t really ‘swinging by’ but it was her favourite jacket. She took the lift up to the third floor and, when she stepped off, she realised that she didn’t actually know where Wanda’s office was. All she had to go off was the place that they had bumped into each other twice previously, so she started there and followed the corridor round until she saw the plaque that had Ms. Maximoff engraved into it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She knocked four times on the wooden door and waited. Five seconds, ten seconds, thirty seconds, a minute, but no-one answered – she was probably teaching. On her way back to the lift, Rio pulled out her phone and started looking up Wanda’s schedule. She was in back-to-back lectures until one o’clock so Rio decided to try her office again around that time. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She got herself settled in a corner of the library, put her headphones on, and soon enough she had built a protective shield out of all of the books that she had pulled from the shelves. She didn’t have a ‘happy place’ per se but this felt pretty close. Surrounded by books, finding meaning in their subtext, shutting out the world and being in her own little space for a while. It wasn’t quite perfect, it was missing something, but she was yet to figure out what that was. For now though, this would do. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She was so engrossed in her research that feeling her phone buzz on the table made her jump. It was a message from Alice.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Alice: We’re going to the pub after lectures today if you want to join?</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Rio: Sounds good. I’m having a library day so let me know when you’re there.</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Alice: Will do, nerd</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes affectionately, Alice and Billy would both quickly learn not to underestimate the importance of a good library day. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The hours seemed to fly by and when Rio checked the time it was 1:15. She had barely made a dent in the pile of books that she had acquired, so she made notes of all of their titles to make sure that she could find them again easily after she had spoken to Wanda, and returned them all to their respective shelves. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She made her way back to Wanda’s office and knocked on her door.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Come in.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The cheery way that Wanda invited her in was a stark contrast to the way that Agatha did it. Wanda’s was happier, more welcoming, whereas Agatha’s felt more like she was only allowing you access to her space provided that you knew it was on her terms, and she was in charge of how long you would be staying. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio walked into the room and immediately noticed that it looked a lot more ‘lived in’ than Agatha’s office. There were significantly less books, but every wall was covered in pictures and motivational posters. The chairs and table that were in the centre matched Agatha’s and Rio guessed that they were the same in all of the offices in the building, if not the whole university. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda was sitting behind her desk and greeted her with a smile. “Hi Rio, what can I do for you?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio stepped further into the room. “I’m just here to ask you a few questions about a kidnapping that happened last night.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“A kidnapping? I’m not sure I follow.” Wanda’s brow furrowed in confusion.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio moved closer to Wanda adding a teasing lilt to her voice. “Oh you know. A jacket, dark green, </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>expensive. Last seen on the back seat of your car.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda’s eyes went wide as she breathed out a sigh of relief. “You actually had me worried there for a second!”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio laughed and stopped walking in front of Wanda’s desk. It was kept very tidy with the papers organised into different baskets and there was a small picture frame, but Rio couldn’t see the picture that it contained because it was facing away from her. “So are you going to return the poor victim, or do I have to fight you for it?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“As much as I’d love to fight you, I’ll save you the embarrassment of losing and graciously return your jacket to you. I can drop it off tonight if you want?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smirked. “It’s cute that you think you’d win but I’m out tonight so can you bring it in tomorrow and I’ll grab it then?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda offered her hand. “Deal.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio took her hand and shook it. “Pleasure doing business with you, Ms. Maximoff.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Likewise, and please, call me Wanda.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>They pulled their hands apart and Rio gave a small nod. “See you tomorrow, Wanda.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She left the office and made her way back to the library.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio worked until Alice and Billy told her that they were in the pub. She had managed to add a fair few pages to her notes and since Agatha was going to help her organise them, she didn't focus on anything in particular. She just let the inspiration take her wherever it wanted and, if it didn't cause her more work further along the line, she would absolutely do it more often. There was a freedom to working this way, not being tied down by a particular subject, topic or theme but being able to jump between them as and when she wanted. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>She had always preferred that way of being in all aspects of her life, it's why she had so many hobbies – she had managed to make herself somewhat of a jack of all trades through doing this. It wasn't that she got bored per se, but when she started to lose interest in something it was really hard for her to get it back. So instead of having a few fully developed skills, she had a myriad of skills that were underdeveloped but looked good to a layperson.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>It had also caused contention with a couple of her exes, her inability to fully commit to anything had been the reason for the breakdown of most of her relationships. The catalyst for this behaviour in her relationships however, had definitely been the almost-two-years that she was with Cassidy. When Cassidy broke her heart she became more guarded and stopped letting people get so close to her, keeping them at arm's length and pushing them away before they could inevitably do it to her – it was safer that way. She would manage a few months but would then start to distance herself which would lead to an argument which would then turn into a breakup. She had gotten used to the cycle and had a pseudo script that she would follow when the situation arose.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The only things she had managed to stick at were her academic endeavours, having to constantly split her attention between learning all of the various subjects at school had given her the environment that she needed to thrive. Where other students got burnt out with having to study so many different things, Rio was like a duck to water – easily able to jump between all of the different modules and topics throughout her academic career. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>It did provide a hindrance though. It was the reason that she struggled to structure her work because finding a way to link everything together was hard, but now she had Agatha to help with that and she trusted her – and maybe Wanda would be willing to read her work and offer some advice as well. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When she got a text from Billy letting her know that he and Alice were waiting for her, she packed up her things and headed over to the pub. Before she could sit down, Alice let her know that it was her turn to get a round in. She rolled her eyes but asked what they wanted and went to the bar to get the drinks. When she got back to the table she caught the end of their conversation. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I don’t think she’ll want to.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“It won’t hurt to ask.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She set the drinks down and asked, “Do I want to know what you two are talking about?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Billy looked at her. “Probably not, but we’re involving you anyway.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh god.” She said, feeling slightly worried. “Go on, tell me.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Alice slid her pint over to herself and drew a pattern in the condensation on the glass. “So we kind of need a drummer.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio laughed and shook her head. “I knew I’d regret telling you that. I haven’t played properly since high school. I know that for you guys that wasn’t that long ago, but for me it was…” she made a show of counting the years on her fingers, “twelve long years ago.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Billy gave Alice a look that could only be read as </span>
<em>
<span>“I told you so”</span>
</em>
<span> and Alice put her finger up to tell him to wait. “Please just think about it. We’re having another practise on Sunday around twelve, you don’t have to commit to anything yet but just try it.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and sighed. “If I come to this </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> practise, will you shut up about it?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Their replies came in unison.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Yep.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Promise.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio shook her head again and said, “You two are the worst.” She was met with wide grins from the both of them.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The three of them stayed at the pub for a couple more drinks before going their separate ways. Rio zipped her hoodie up and stuffed her hands in the pockets, this really wasn’t an acceptable replacement for her leather jacket. As soon as she got back into the warmth of her flat, she checked Wanda’s schedule for the following day to figure out the earliest time that she could get her most prized possession back. Wanda had office hours between nine and eleven every Friday morning which meant that Rio didn’t need to be up too early. She set her alarm for nine-thirty and got in the shower, starting her process of winding down for the night. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________ </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio woke up to her alarm and spent the first fifteen minutes of her morning scrolling aimlessly through TikTok, she had refused to download it until the pandemic hit and she was forced to spend more time alone, and now she found herself ‘doom-scrolling’ more and more often. She dragged herself out of bed and got ready for the day, hesitating about whether to wear a hoodie again or to brave it in just a t-shirt until she got her jacket back from Wanda. She checked the weather for the day and saw that it was supposed to be sunny for most of it – she still hadn’t quite mastered how to predict the British weather, but she was pretty sure that even people that had lived there for their whole lives hadn’t mastered it either – so she chose to stick to just the t-shirt and started her walk to the campus.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She got to Wanda’s office just after ten-thirty and knocked on the door.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Come in.”<br/>
</span>
<span>The greeting still caught her off guard a little, but she walked in. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Ah Rio, I was wondering when you’d be here.” Wanda said, smiling. “As you can see, the victim has been returned safe and sound without a scratch on her.” She gestured to the wall where the jacket was on a coat hanger that was hanging on a nail. Rio walked over to it, took off her bag, then removed the jacket from the hanger and slipped her arms into it before putting her bag back over her shoulder. “Thank you so much, the past twenty four hours have truly been the hardest of my life. There were times where I didn’t think that I would make it through.” She forced a crack into her voice to fake being close to tears. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda chucked and stood up from her desk, picking up a canvas that had been leaning against it. “I’m glad that the two of you have finally been reunited and I am truly sorry for the part I played in your anguish.” She walked over to the wall and took the coat hanger down, putting the canvas back up in its place. “I have to say though, I’ll miss it.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio tilted her head slightly. “Oh?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda continued. “It was a great conversation piece with the students that have come in to make use of my office hours this morning. It was truly heart-breaking to have to tell them that it wasn’t mine.” She turned and leaned with her back against the wall next to the canvas.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio laughed. “You can always buy one, then you don’t have to suffer such terrible heartbreak again.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You’d be okay with us wearing matching jackets?” Wanda said, raising her eyebrow. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smirked. “They wouldn’t be matching though, this is a custom, remember?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda laughed lightly. “Yes of course. How could I forget that you’re a student who can afford to buy a custom, real-leather jacket? How silly of me.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio looked at her for a moment, taking in her soft features, the way the corners of her mouth wrinkled slightly when she smiled, the way that the red of her hair made her eyes seem like the most vivid shade of green. “Be honest with me for a second?” She asked.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda’s brow dipped slightly, taken off guard by the question. “Of course.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Did you try it on?” She gestured to the jacket.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda sighed and visibly relaxed, her shoulders dropping. “You need to stop worrying me like that! No I didn’t try it on, I will admit that I was tempted though, but I didn’t want anything to accidentally happen to it.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smiled. “It’s not as breakable as you seem to think it is, with the amount I paid for it I’d be mad if it was.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Well, I’ll be less careful in future then.” Wanda replied with a smirk.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio was about to respond but she was interrupted by a knock at the door. Wanda pushed away from the wall and walked to the centre of the room, clearing her throat before she spoke. “Come in.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>A boy walked into the room and seemed surprised to see Rio standing there. “Oh, I’m sorry Ms. Maximoff, I didn’t realise you were with another student.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“No, no, it’s okay Eddie.” She gestured for him to sit in one of the chairs. “Rio and I were done. “ She turned to Rio. “I’ll see you soon.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio nodded and left the office.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>As she walked towards the library, ready to spend another day hiding behind a fortress of books, Rio's mind was doing a deep dive into the last thing Wanda said to her. <br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>“I'll see you soon.”</span>
</em>
<span> <br/>
</span>
<span>What did she mean by it? Was it just the polite, passing statement with the same meaning that it always had? Or was she implying that she </span>
<em>
<span>wanted</span>
</em>
<span> to see her soon? <br/>
</span>
<span>It wasn't like Rio to overthink this kind of interaction, usually she would just lean into the flirting and see where it took her – but then again they were interrupted so the flow was stopped. She and Wanda hadn't had the chance for an actual conversation yet so there was no real way of telling if this was just a bit of harmless flirting or if it could lead in a more interesting direction. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>It was yet another Saturday that Rio was spending in her apartment, alone. Cooking dinner, alone. Watching TV, alone. The past few days when she’d had her meeting with Agatha, gone to the bar with Alice and Billy and the three times she had seen Wanda had been the most consecutive time that she had spent with other people since moving, and now that she had gone a whole day without seeing anyone, she was finding herself wishing she was around other people. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>After she had finished her food and washed her pots, she decided that she was done moping. She wasn't going to sit in her flat feeling sorry for herself any more, so she got in the shower and got ready to go out. She wasn't really one for ‘dolling’ herself up but she could dress well, choosing a pair of black, leather-look trousers and pairing them with a navy blue blouse – she spent some time deciding on how many buttons to leave undone and ultimately making the choice to leave three, just enough to make people look but not enough that anything was on show. She pulled out a black, fitted jacket that fastened with a single button and stopped just below her hips, in case she needed an extra layer in the cool air of the night. The final piece was a pair of black, pleather boots with enough of a heel to give her an extra couple of inches to her height. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When she was happy with her outfit she grabbed her keys and headed out. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She was glad of her jacket when she stepped out of her building and felt the wind biting at her cheeks. She put her hands in her pockets to keep them from meeting the same fate and being coloured with the same red that she was sure had already made its home on her face, and walked until she found the least offensive looking bar. When she first arrived in Cambridge she had visited the pubs and bars in the local area but hadn't been back since, she was hoping to find one that she favoured so that she wouldn't have to spend another weekend being bored. Maybe tonight would be the night. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The bar that she walked into looked nice enough, it wasn't huge but it wasn't tiny and it wasn't overly packed. There were enough people in it to make it look like it was worth visiting, with a good ratio of booths to tables, the lighting was decent and the music wasn't offensively loud. She was happy with her choice. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She spotted an empty stool at the bar and took a seat, the two bartenders were currently busy so she scanned the shelves while she was waiting. There was a healthy selection of booze and she might have to risk mixing her drinks since she was spoilt for choice. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I haven't seen you in here before. I didn't think they made them that pretty on this side of town.” Rio had to stop herself from rolling her eyes when she heard the voice of a man appear to her right. She wasn't a stranger to being hit on by men with misplaced confidence in their own attractiveness while she was out, but it didn't stop it from being annoying. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She turned her head to look at him and spoke flatly. “Does that line ever actually work for you?” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>He lifted his eyebrows and leant against the bar. “You're American? That explains why I've never seen you. What brought you to our side of the pond?” There was a slur in his voice and the scent of alcohol was heavy on his breath. Rio glanced past him to the clock on the wall – it was only eight-thirty. She knew that the British liked to drink but damn. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She looked back to him and continued to speak in the same flat tone. “I'm doing a research project on how mediocre men all around the world seem to have the same level of audacity when speaking to women who are laughably out of their league.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Unfortunately this didn't deter him, he continued speaking in a way that proved her statement.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh so you're a smart girl? Beautiful, smart, independent-” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She held up her hand to cut him off. “And wholly uninterested.” She turned away from him and went back to looking at the bottles on the wall behind the bar. He huffed in frustration and said, “whatever, learn to take a compliment.” before he walked out of the door. She didn't stop the satisfied smile that she felt tugging at her lips, the joy of shitting down a man will never be matched. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Another few minutes passed and one of the bartender's made their way to her, but before she could tell him her order, he gently placed a glass in front of her. “Oh, sorry. I haven't ordered yet.” she said. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He nodded. “I know, this is from the lady in the booth at the back.” He pointed and Rio looked in the direction, taking a few seconds to find who he was talking about, but soon enough the red hair stood out against the dark interior and dim lighting and she saw Wanda looking her way. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smiled and raised her glass at Wanda before taking a sip. She had no idea what the drink was but she assumed that the mixer was coke from the colour, she couldn't tell what the alcohol was but it tasted damn good. She got up off of the stool and walked over to where Wanda was sitting, sliding onto the bench opposite her.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Wow, seeing each other four times in one week. One might think that you're stalking me, Ms. Maximoff.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda hummed. “If I recall, you came to see me two times out of the four and the other two were just pure luck.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I only came to see you after you stole my jacket, so you're still implicated in the orchestration of at least half.” Rio smirked.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda pursed her lips to try to hide her smile. “Touché.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio laughed lightly and took another sip of her drink. “What is this?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Pink gin and diet coke.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio's face dropped. “I'm allergic to gin.” She said and Wanda's eyes widened. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh my god what? I'm- I didn't- do you need to go to hospital?” She stuttered urgently as she was starting to stand up. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio looked at her and slowly let a wide smile spread across her face. “I'm kidding, I love gin.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda stood staring at her for a minute, her mouth hanging open slightly as she processed what Rio had said. When her brain had caught up she sat back down and said, “you're awful, do you know that?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio shrugged. “I've been told.” She had another drink. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Why would you do that to me?” Wanda asked, catching her breath after the shock. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smiled. “I figured I was overdue for another attempt at killing you.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Well you are officially caught up and don't need to try any more.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Noted,” Rio said with a small smile. “Not that I'm complaining about free alcohol, but what have I done to deserve this?” <br/>
</span>
<span>“I wanted to properly thank you for fixing my car. You swooped in and saved the day.”<br/>
</span>
<span>“I'll take that.” Rio smiled and raised her glass, Wanda echoed the movement and they knocked their glasses together. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Talking with Wanda was easy, it was equal parts flirting and actual conversation, and Rio found herself enjoying both the same amount. Wanda was able to keep up with her and match her for turn of phrase, which was something that Rio respected. It had been a while since she had been in a bar with an attractive woman where her goal wasn’t just to sleep with her and move on. Sure they were flirting, Wanda was gorgeous and Rio was human, but they were also talking, getting to know each other. That wasn’t something that Rio did when all she wanted was to add another notch to her bedpost, she wouldn’t usually put in this much effort. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I have to say,” Wanda started, “I enjoyed watching you get rid of that guy. You seem to have that down to a fine art.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio chuckled and played with her glass, spinning it slowly on the table. “I feel like every femme presenting person has a way to get rid of unwanted male attention. Sometimes it takes more and sometimes it takes less, it's all part of the fun.” She gave a half smile. “Unfortunately, just telling them that I'm gay doesn't do the trick.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda sipped her drink. “I've found that telling them I have a son works quite well. Especially since he's more emotionally mature than they are.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio felt the surprise change her features, she couldn't stop her brows from shooting up and her eyes widening, nor could she stop the way that her mouth opened from the shock of the statement.<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda laughed. “Yes, that's the reaction I usually get. I give it about thirty seconds until you walk away.” <br/>
</span>
<span>The noise Rio made was an attempt at laughter but what actually came out was a strangled sound that she tried to turn into a cough but ended up choking on air. She frantically took a drink and Wanda laughed louder. “Well they don't typically die, this one is new.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio took a few moments to even out her breathing again before responding. “Sorry. I just wasn- I mean you don't- you have a son?” She wasn't often speechless, it took a lot to stop her being able to form a coherent reply to something, but she hadn't been expecting Wanda to say that. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda nodded. “I do. What's the cliché line again?” She thought for a second before continuing, “He's the only man I need in my life.” She smiled but it wasn't full and Rio guessed that there was some tension in that area of Wanda's life. She was curious but didn't want to pry so she attempted to bring some humour into the current track of conversation. “Oh so you're fully leaning into the mid-life crisis then?” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda scoffed in feigned offense. “Less of the ‘mid’ please, I'm only forty-one.” <br/>
</span>
<span>“Well the average life expectancy for a woman is eighty so I'd say you're there.” <br/>
</span>
<span>“And I'd say you're one cheeky comment away from wearing my drink.” Wanda levelled Rio with a look but it was more playful than serious, undercutting the sincerity of the words. <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio raised her eyebrow curiously and said, “Is that a threat or a promise?” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda smirked. “Keep going and you'll find out.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>They were there for the following few hours taking turns to buy drinks and trading small talk, with some flirty banter mixed in, in an attempt to get to know each other better. The conversation felt natural, the flow was good and there were no awkward silences – mostly down to Rio's talent of always having something to say, except for finding out that Wanda was a mother, that was an anomaly.<br/>
</span>
<span>The drinks kept coming and they were both at the point of inebriation where finding the straw on the first try was getting harder and harder. They had also moved from sitting opposite each other to sitting side by side, inching closer every time either of them found the opportunity to do so. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda was laughing at something Rio had said, she had brought her hand up to her chest and when she put it back down, she rested it on Rio's leg just above her knee. Rio felt the contact, she felt the instant warmth on her skin even through her trousers. She glanced down briefly and then back up at Wanda's face, trying not to draw attention to it in case Wanda withdrew, she didn't want her to take her hand away. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda moved her hand back and forth but kept looking at Rio's face when she spoke. “These are nice, soft. I like the way they feel.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio licked her lips slowly and she noticed how Wanda's eyes flickered down and watched her tongue and they didn't move back up until she spoke. “Thank you, they were cheap but they look good on me.” Wanda's eyes were shining even in the dim light and Rio leaned closer. It was just a few centimetres but it felt like a big move. “Or so I've been told.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda smiled and her eyes darkened slightly. Rio felt Wanda's hand slowly move up her leg a few inches and settle on her mid thigh, the heat it left behind was more than just the natural warmth of Wanda's skin and it continued to travel upwards past where her hand had stopped and settled in Rio's lower stomach. The air between them felt full, charged with something and it grew when Wanda said, “Do you want to know what I think?” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio nodded and Wanda leaned closer, putting less distance between them. “I think…” She put her face next to Rio's and the warmth of her breath on Rio's ear made the hair at the base of her neck stand on end. “That you need another drink.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda pulled back and smiled at her, she gave her thigh a gentle squeeze before standing up and walking over to the bar. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio watched her walk away, feeling absolutely no shame in the amount of attention she paid to the sway of her hips and she knew that Wanda was definitely exaggerating the movement because she knew that Rio would be watching. Wanda looked back at her over her shoulder for a fleeting moment before giving the bartender her full attention and Rio let her head fall back against the high back of the bench she was sitting on. However this went, it was going to be a long night. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio was woken up by a strip of sunlight crossing directly over her eyes, she tried to roll over to get away from it and grasp at some more sleep but she wasn't able to. She rolled into something and groggily put her hand out to find whatever it was and move it so that she could peacefully return to her much preferred state of unconsciousness, but the thing was bigger than she anticipated. The slow realisation crept in – though the memories were severely lacking in that moment – that it wasn't some</span>
<em>
<span>thing</span>
</em>
<span>, moreover some</span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The person next to her shifted as Rio gingerly opened one eye. Her brain instantly processed who it was thanks to the bright, red hair that was cascading over the pillow, but the last thing she truly remembered was the burning sensation in her throat that could only be associated with swallowing tequila – everything after that was black. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda turned her head to face Rio, her eyes barely open, and said, “Rio, what the fuck are you doing?” Her voice was rough from sleep and her words slurred together. <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio withdrew her hand and shuffled on to her side so that she was properly facing Wanda. “I was, uh- I was just checking that you were still there.” She attempted a smile but it turned into a grimace as a pain settled into her skull. It felt like there was a tiny person trapped in there that was furiously pounding on the bone to break their way out, she shut her eyes again and pressed her palm to her temple. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda twisted onto her side as well and said with a small laugh, “You forgot where you were for a minute didn't you?” When Rio didn't respond and instead started to rub her hand in circles on her head, Wanda continued. “There's paracetamol in the drawer next to you and a glass in the bathroom.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio groaned but didn't move, the mere thought of moving made her entire body feel like it would fall apart. She would just have to suffer through the pain in her head for a little while longer. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda chuckled and Rio felt movement on the mattress as Wanda slowly sat up and left the bed. She slowly opened her eyes again and saw Wanda putting on a robe, loosely tying it at her waist before going into the bathroom. She heard the tap running and Wanda reappeared moments later with a glass of water. She gently placed it down on the chest of drawers next to Rio and opened the top drawer pulling out the box of painkillers, she popped two of the tablets out of their foil casing and put them next to the glass. “There, ninety percent of the work is done for you.” She said softly. “I'm going to get in the shower. Hopefully you'll be more alive when I'm done.” She smiled and disappeared back into the bathroom leaving Rio alone with her thoughts. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio slowly forced herself to sit up, resting her back against the headboard, and took a deep breath. The room was spinning around her so she shut her eyes and focussed on her breathing for a few seconds – she was definitely still drunk. When she felt it was safe to do so, she carefully opened her eyes. The room was finally still so she reached for the tablets and the glass of water, swallowing the pills one at a time and hating the way her mouth felt. She needed to brush her teeth badly, if this was how horrid the feeling in her mouth was she didn't even want to think about the state of her breath. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>She tried to remember the events of the night but everything after the shots was lost. She could tell from the way that both hers and Wanda's clothes were strewn around the bedroom that they had definitely had sex, that didn't take a genius to figure out, but she couldn't remember it and that annoyed her. She hadn't been blackout drunk in years, in fact she'd made a promise to herself that she wouldn't get that drunk again because she didn't like having a black hole replacing her memories. It made her incredibly anxious. She wasn't one to dwell on things that she had done or said, but having no recollection of it was terrifying. She could have said, or done, anything to Wanda and she wouldn't know what those things were, nor could she stomach the embarrassment of asking. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>She heard the shower switch off and anxiously waited for Wanda to walk back into the room. After a few minutes Wanda came back with a towel wrapped around her, her hair flat against her head, darkened by the water. She looked at Rio and smiled. “You're a little less horizontal now, I'm proud of you.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio laughed, the pain in her head starting to ease. “Thank you. It's nice to have my efforts recognised.” She cast a glance around the room. “Have you seen my phone anywhere?” <br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh, um, hang on.” Wanda started searching through the mess of clothes on the floor, picking each item up one-by-one and putting them on the bed. She picked up Rio's trousers and her phone slid out of the pocket landing on the carpet with a dull thud. Wanda brought it over to her and she tried to unlock it only to find that it was out of charge. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio sheepishly looked at Wanda and asked, “Any chance I could borrow your charger?” <br/>
</span>
<span>“Sure. It's plugged in on the other side.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio shuffled to the other side of the bed and plugged the wire into her phone, waiting a moment before turning it on. Wanda was moving about the room drying herself off and getting dressed as Rio was desperately trying to remember what she was meant to be doing that day. She knew there was somewhere she needed to be but her brain couldn't find the information. She checked the time and saw that it was nearly half past ten. What did she have to do today? </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda finished brushing her hair and turned back to Rio. “I'm gonna go make us some breakfast, feel free to have a shower yourself. There's a spare toothbrush in the cupboard under the sink and I can get some clothes for you to borrow if you want?” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio blinked at her as her brain processed all of the words that she had just heard. Wanda laughed softly. “Go shower, I'll get you some clothes, come downstairs when you're done.” She handed her a towel and started to gather up Rio's clothes from the night before and leave the room. “Are you kidnapping more of my wardrobe now?” Rio called after her. <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda popped her head back into the room. “I'm going to wash them for you because I'm an excellent host.” <br/>
</span>
<span>“I'll be sure to give you a five star review on One Night Stand Dot Com.”<br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh please do, my rating needs some help.” Wanda winked and left the room, once again leaving Rio to herself. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio stayed in the bed for another few minutes before forcing herself to leave the comfort of Wanda's thick, winter duvet. She shivered a little as the cool air of the room brushed over her naked body and made her way into the bathroom, craving the feel of a hot shower. She opened the cupboard Wanda had told her to look in and found a toothbrush, immediately thankful as she felt the freshness of the toothpaste cleaning away the aftertaste of the various alcoholic drinks that she'd had the night before. She stared at her reflection in the mirror, her hair was a mess and her eyes were red and puffy from lack of sleep. She looked down at her chest as a red spot at the top of her left breast caught her eye, she studied it to work out what it was. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Were they teeth marks? They were definitely teeth marks. She touched it, gently running her fingertips across it and smiled. She might not remember it happening but she could definitely imagine it. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>She stepped into the shower and turned the water on, cranking the temperature until the room filled with steam. She stood under the water letting the hot stream hit her skin, easing the ache in her joints that she hoped was from the sex and not because she did something stupid in her drunken state like fall off the curb or walk into a lamppost. <br/>
</span>
<span>The longer that she was in the shower the more relaxed she felt and some of her memories from the previous night were slowly coming back. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>
<span>Rio and Wanda had left the bar and Rio had offered to walk Wanda home to make sure she made it safely. She noticed Wanda draw her arms around herself in response to the chilled air and shrugged off her jacket – it took a little more effort than it should have thanks to the amount of alcohol she had consumed. She gently draped it over Wanda's shoulders and Wanda instantly pulled it around herself. “Oh thanks, you're such a gentleman.” Wanda joked, nudging Rio gently with her elbow. </span>
</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>
<span>Rio had to fight to keep walking straight as the nudge threatened to knock her off balance in her inebriated state, luckily she didn't have to keep up the charade for long as Wanda didn't live too far from the bar. Wanda stopped walking in front of a nice looking semi-detached house. The windows in the door had stained glass in the shape of flowers and the bay window to the right of the door had various ornaments and picture frames displayed on the windowsill.</span>
</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>
<span>Wanda turned to face Rio. “This is my stop. Thank you for walking me home, I'm glad we ran into each other.” She smiled and took off the jacket, giving it back to Rio. <br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>“No problem, any time. I'm glad we ran into each other too, I had a good night.” Rio slid her arms into the jacket and started to fumble with the button, the combination of the cold air and the alcohol making it an impossible task. Wanda stepped forwards and took over, looping the button through the hole and then smoothing down the collar of the jacket. “Do you own any jackets that aren't ridiculously expensive?” </span>
</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>
<span>Rio laughed and looked down at it, focussing on Wanda's fingers which were still gently holding the edges of the collar. “It was in a sale I think, I don't really remember, but I promise you that not all of my clothes cost triple digits.” She looked back up at Wanda and met her eyes. There was something in them that Rio couldn't figure out.<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Wanda pouted. “That's a shame.” She leaned closer and dropped her voice to a near whisper. “I like a woman with expensive taste.” </span>
</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>She stepped out of the shower and went back to the mirror, swiping her hand across it to clear some of the condensation. She looked at her reflection once again and was happy that she looked a little more alive. <br/>
</span>
<span>She wrapped Wanda's towel around her body and went back into the bedroom. There were some clothes neatly folded on the bed waiting for her – a faded Arctic Monkeys t-shirt and a pair of black sweatpants. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>When she had gotten dressed Rio went downstairs and followed the smell of cooking bacon into the kitchen. Wanda stood with her back to her tending to a pan that Rio assumed had eggs in it. “Do you cook for all of the women that you pick up in bars?” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda laughed and looked over her shoulder in Rio's direction. “Only when they wake up with amnesia.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio slid herself into a chair that was at the island in the middle of the kitchen. “I'll have you know that my memory is perfect, thank you very much.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda switched the hob off and turned to face her properly, leaning against the counter. “Is that so?” Rio nodded confidently and Wanda quirked an eyebrow. “So if I asked you to tell me what we did last night, you'd be able to do that?” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio crossed her arms and tried her best to appear confident, though she was feeling anything but. “Oh, I could never forget that.” She added a smirk for extra measure and Wanda snorted. Rio couldn't tell if Wanda believed her or not but she didn't question her and instead started plating up the eggs and bacon before bringing the two plates of freshly cooked breakfast over to the island. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
They traded small talk while they ate and Rio couldn’t shift the feeling of unease that had settled within her. She didn’t usually stick around after a hook-up, she would usually be up and out of the door as quickly as she could be but she was enjoying Wanda’s company, enjoying the laid-back nature of the morning – she still had the nagging feeling that she was meant to be somewhere but still couldn’t remember where or what for. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>When they had finished breakfast Rio went back upstairs to get her phone and found many messages from Alice and Billy. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Alice: Don't forget you promised you'd come today </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Alice: Billy will cry if you blow us off </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Billy: She's not wrong, I can feel the tears forming rn</b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Alice: Okay I was joking but your lack of replies has me worried that you're actually not gonna turn up </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Billy: Rio are you dead??? </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Billy: Okay but for real are you alive? </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Alice: 10 minute warning </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Alice: Please actually turn up</b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Billy: It's the music room opposite the physics department</b>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The memory came careening back into her skull and she frantically checked the time: 11:57. </span>
<em>
<span>Shit.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Rio: Yes I'm alive and yes I'm still coming, I just lost track of time. I'll be there asap! </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>A reply came almost instantly.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Billy: SHE LIVES!!! We're still waiting on our singer so you've got a few minutes before the crushing weight of disappointment slowly kills me </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio rolled her eyes at Billy's dramatics and quickly went downstairs. “Hey so please don't read this as me trying to bolt but I lost track of time and am very close to disappointing some bright-eyed first years with my lateness. I don't suppose I can walk from here to campus in…” she checked the time again, “fuck, thirty seconds can I?” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda looked at her, her brow furrowed and her mouth open slightly in confusion. “No. But I can drive you and take the twenty minute walk down to a five minute drive.” <br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh… um…” Rio shifted uncomfortably. She had already stayed longer than she usually would, not to mention used the shower, borrowed Wanda's clothes </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> had breakfast. Accepting a lift on top of all of that felt too close, too personal. She knew that it was irrational but that didn't stop her from feeling it. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda stood up and started towards the door. “I'm offering you a lift, Rio. I'm not asking you to marry me.” She said lightly as she started putting her shoes on. “Are you coming?” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio closed her eyes for a second needing to ground herself before moving to the door and putting her own shoes on. She was about to follow Wanda out the door when she remembered something. “Oh shit wait. Where are my keys?” <br/>
</span>
<span>“In the bowl next to you.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio grabbed them and they both left the house. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>“So what important thing do you have to do on a Sunday?” Wanda asked once they'd pulled away. <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio chuckled. “I, uh, I promised some kids that I'd join their band practise this afternoon. Just a one time deal so that they'd stop badgering me about it.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda laughed like she didn't believe her. “Well I've got to say, of all the excuses I've heard in my time, that is definitely the best one.” <br/>
</span>
<span>“It's not an excuse.” Rio said in mock offense. “Okay well in its nature it's an excuse. But it also happens to be true.” <br/>
</span>
<span>“Okay, what instrument do you play?” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda clearly still didn't believe her and Rio couldn't blame her for it. <br/>
</span>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>used</span>
</em>
<span> to play drums, but I haven't played properly since high school. I'm hoping they'll quickly realise that I suck and I won't have to become a permanent member.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda snorted but didn't press further as she turned into the carpark. “Have fun being a rock star.” She said as the car came to a stop. “We'll sort out a clothes exchange at some point, that's one of my favourite shirts.” <br/>
</span>
<span>“Got it!” Rio said as she basically leapt out of the car. “Thanks for the ride, enjoy your afternoon.” Wanda smiled at her as she closed the door and she started running towards the building Billy had said they were in, her hangover catching up with her every time her feet hit the ground.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>She got to the building and burst through the door causing the four people in the room to turn and stare at her. Two of them were Alice and Billy, Billy had an electric guitar slung over his shoulder and Alice was sitting at a keyboard with a microphone on a boom stand positioned so that she could sing and play. There was another boy, also wearing an electric guitar, standing at a microphone that she recognised from the other day in Wanda's office, and the final person had a bass over their shoulder. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Billy walked over to her, beaming. “Girls, gays and theys, may I present to you our drummer!” <br/>
</span>
<span>Rio offered a wave and introduced herself. “Hey, I'm Rio. Drummer extraordinaire.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Billy introduced Eddie, whom she had already met, and the bassist who's name was Ash. They exchanged hellos and Rio sat herself at the drum kit. It was an acoustic kit in a basic set up and when she sat down she felt her body fire up its muscle memory, picking up the sticks that were resting on the snare and giving them a twirl. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Eddie gestured towards her and said, “oh nice shirt. Strong choice.” <br/>
</span>
<span>Billy jumped in before she could reply. “It shows your age though, my mum has the same one.” <br/>
</span>
<span>She rolled her eyes but smiled as the four of them laughed. “Are you guys gonna play so that I can see if you're good enough for my talents any time soon?” <br/>
</span>
<span>Eddie pressed some of the stomp boxes on his pedal board as he said, “Your shirt has inspired me, does everyone know Still Take You Home?” <br/>
</span>
<span>There were noises of confirmation and Rio groaned internally. She knew the song, sure, but it was fast and she was still violently hungover. This was either going to be torture, or amazing and she was yet to find out which way it would swing. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio surprised herself with how well she remembered the song. She had dropped a few beats and messed up a couple of fills but it went smoothly otherwise. She did quickly discover that the boots she was wearing, courtesy of her unexpected sleepover, were nowhere near as good as her converse when using them for drumming, so she took them off when the song was over. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Ash looked at her, admiration evident on their face. “Okay so you're sticking around right? Because that was amazing!” <br/>
</span>
<span>The others agreed in unison and Rio felt joy start to build in her chest, their validation settling over her, making her feel warm. She hadn't realised how much she had missed playing until she was doing it again, the rush that it brought was almost addictive. Maybe she should just give in to it, it would give her something else to do. “I guess I could make time in my incredibly busy schedule.” She said, unable to stop the smile that took shape on her lips. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The five of them stayed there for a few hours, playing different songs and starting to make their set list for the ball in a couple of months. Rio pulled her phone out of her pocket to make a list of the songs so that she could make sure to listen to the ones she didn't know too well, and saw a message from a number that she didn't have saved. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Unknown: I had a good time last night, I hope you weren't too late! </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>It could only be from Wanda and Rio had a flash of memory, another blank filling in. Wanda had asked for her number under the guise of needing it in case she needed help with her car again and Rio had happily put it in her phone. <br/>
</span>
<span>She saved the contact and took a quick picture of her bandmates with the drum kit taking up the bottom portion of the screen before she replied. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Rio: Likewise. I made it in time and, just because I know that you didn't believe me, here's some evidence 😜</b>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>She sent the message along with the picture and slid her phone back into her pocket, ready to continue playing. </span>

<p align="justify">
<span>Rio found that she was starting to enjoy her meetings with Agatha, she was determined to peel back the layers and find what made her tick. She didn’t like her authority being challenged, that much was obvious, and Rio loved to prod her. She was getting to know which buttons to press to get a reaction and Agatha seemed incapable of not providing said reaction. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha liked control, she liked knowing that she was in charge and that everything that happened to or around her was all her doing. They were her strings to pull, her orchestra to conduct, her script to write and direct, and Rio simply could not resist threatening to crumble Agatha’s carefully constructed walls. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She respected Agatha, that was never in question. She knew that ultimately Agatha was the one with the power in their dynamic, which was exactly why it was so fun to play with that power. She liked catching Agatha off guard and watching her scramble to quickly put herself back together.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She noticed that Agatha wasn’t used to people pushing back, she wasn’t used to people not letting her walk all over them, and Rio was pretty sure that Agatha would implode if she thought for one second that Rio didn’t find her ‘scary’ like everyone else did. She was used to being feared and using that to get the respect of her students and colleagues.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio respected Agatha as her superior but that didn’t mean that she wouldn’t try to have some fun with her from time to time.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She had caught Agatha staring at her a few times now and each time had sent a tingle down her spine. There was a difference between simply looking at someone, and regarding someone with such intensity that you get lost in the curve of their nose, the way their hair falls or the shine in their eyes. Of course she couldn't speak for Agatha, nor could she assign a fully accurate meaning or reason to her actions, but she was well versed in the sapphic urge to stare longingly at any attractive woman that wandered into your field of vision. It didn’t necessarily mean that you wanted to sleep with them – one could look at the menu and not order – it just meant that you noticed and appreciated their attractiveness on a base level. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She didn’t fully know if Agatha was into women or not, Agatha hadn’t exactly been forthcoming with that information, but the way that she had reacted when Rio had asked had, in itself, been an answer. If she wanted to know for sure she could ask Wanda – there had definitely been something between them at some point, she’d worked that out – but she was now trying to keep Wanda at a distance to avoid giving her the wrong impression. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>They had done an exchange of clothes and since then Rio had deflected any attempts that Wanda made for the two of them to spend time together. A one night stand was fine, perfectly normal behaviour, but twice would lead to a third and a third would lead to feelings that Rio would inevitably have to hurt, and it was just easier to cut all of that out. Her memory of that night was almost fully returned, there was just the odd bit that the alcohol had held back but she couldn’t deny that the bits she had regained were good – great, even. Wanda had fucked her in a way that made her legs feel weak just thinking about it, even when she was sitting down, but she knew that she couldn’t let it go further for both of their sakes.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha continued to reject Rio’s attempts to break through her hard exterior, though she had softened slightly when Rio started bringing her a coffee to every meeting. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio had gone to the campus café to find out what Agatha’s usual order was – a latte with two sugars – and had purposefully ordered something that she knew Agatha would hate, just so she could mess with her a little bit. It had worked beautifully and when she made a show of licking the cream off of her finger Agatha’s reaction had been exactly what Rio had wanted. The way her eyes had followed Rio’s finger as she swiped it through the cream and put it in her mouth, the way that her throat bobbed as she swallowed when Rio gave a low hum of satisfaction. She was about as subtle as a brick to the face. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio wasn’t immune to the sapphic urge to stare any more than Agatha was, but she was less shameful about it. The black framed glasses that Agatha wore were a personal favourite of Rio’s and when Agatha looked at her over the top of them she was very aware of the way that her stomach reacted.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She kept catching a glimpse of the tattoo that Agatha had on her ankle and wondered if she had any more, if so what were they and where were they? It was still a question that she wanted to ask but she was waiting for the right way to slip it into conversation.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She enjoyed working in Agatha’s office, it was comfortable enough that she didn’t get distracted but not so comfortable that it had the opposite effect and she’d rather relax than work. She got a surprising amount of work done sitting in that armchair with Agatha either sitting opposite her or at her desk, and she liked that she was able to get Agatha’s input instantly as opposed to having to wait for her to return an email. But her brain did have a limit on the length of time that she could concentrate for – and when that limit had been reached, she usually became curious about what Agatha was doing.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She looked up from her laptop and saw that Agatha’s brow was knitted together in confusion as she was reading something on her own laptop. “Did you accidentally lock yourself out of your emails?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha looked up at her, the confusion still on her face but now aimed at Rio. “What do you mean?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio nodded towards Agatha's laptop. “You were looking very puzzled for a moment there.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh.” Agatha's expression changed to understanding. “No believe it or not, I can operate my emails just fine.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“So what, you changed the language to Mandarin or something and you can't change it back?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha sighed and took off her glasses. “Miss Vidal I am perfectly capable of using my laptop correctly and, last time I checked, your thesis wasn't on my technological skills.” She put her glasses back on and fixed Rio with a look that said what her words didn't. </span><em><span>Stop bothering me with useless questions and go back to your work.</span></em> <span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio did just that and started mentally counting backwards from ten, knowing that Agatha eventually wouldn’t be able to resist telling her what she was doing. Rio had figured out that Agatha secretly liked it when Rio showed an interest in what she was doing. It was subtle and often hidden behind something else but there was a change in Agatha’s demeanour whenever Rio made her inquiries. There was often some surprise at the fact that she had cared enough to ask – Rio guessed that, due to the persona Agatha put out into the world, she didn’t get very many people asking about her – and then a very quick flash of something akin to joy before it was all replaced by the neutral expression she always worked hard to maintain. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio made it down to four before she heard Agatha sigh and say, “I’m looking over some dissertation outlines from the students I’m supervising.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio took a dramatic gasp of air and said with mock hurt, “I thought I was the only student you were supervising! Are you cheating on me, Professor?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha rolled her eyes and breathed out in exasperation, taking off her glasses and pinching the bridge of her nose for good measure. Rio smiled to herself. Eliciting these reactions from Agatha was all too easy, it didn’t take any of the fun out of it though. “I’m kidding, obviously, you can supervise as many students as you like, it’s kinda part of your job description.” Agatha looked back up at her and she caught her eyes, enjoying the annoyance that was evident in them. “As long as you admit that I’m your favourite, that is.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The expression on Agatha’s face hardened and Rio knew that she was dancing on the line between what Agatha would allow and what would make her flip the switch and put Rio in her place. If she was being honest with herself, sometimes she stepped over the line on purpose. There was a certain part of her that liked it when Agatha put her foot down and told her off, but she kept that part of her buried because letting it out wouldn’t serve her well. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When Agatha spoke there was an air of amusement in her voice that didn’t match the stony look on her face. “Miss Vidal I do not play favourites. But if I did, you could be safe in the knowledge that you would be nowhere near the top of that list.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“The lady doth protest too much.” Rio quickly responded and began working her tongue against the inside of her cheek. Agatha rolled her eyes again and turned her attention back to her laptop. </span></p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify"><span>Rio started to split more of her time between Agatha’s office, lectures, the library and the music room, happy that she had more things now to occupy her ever wandering mind. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was really enjoying being part of a band again, the camaraderie between musicians is something that is hard to match. Being able to have a connection with people where you don’t need to use words to communicate, Eddie could just nod at her and she’d understand that he meant ‘half-time’. Or Ash could walk towards her and she knew that they wanted her to make the kick match their rhythm. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>It became a little tradition for the five of them to go to the pub after practise and have a few drinks to wind down – and Rio ended up paying the majority of the time. She didn't mind since she had more money than the average student, and they all drank the cheapest lager so it wasn't the end of the world. There was only so much cheap lager she could stomach though, so she treated herself to a glass of wine on occasion. Usually no one commented but this once, Billy decided to pipe up. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Are you too good for pints now?” He asked with a cheeky smile on his face. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh I'd happily drink this by the pint if they served it.” Rio shot back. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy's eyes lit up. “So what I'm hearing is, Rio is a secret hardcore drinker and we should all go round to hers one night.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio immediately shook her head. “Absolutely fucking not. I am not letting you four loose in my apartment.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy was about to say something else when Eddie cut in. “That's probably a wise choice since this one,” he gestured to Billy, “can't hold his drink like he thinks he can.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy tried to defend himself but was cut off by Alice, Eddie and Ash all jumping in with various examples that proved him wrong, and he eventually stopped and started pouting instead. “You’re all just jealous that I can spend less money on a night out than the rest of you.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio laughed and shook her head, being able to relive her undergrad through her four friends was a nice feeling.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The conversation shifted towards work with Alice asking Eddie if he could give any insight on what she and Billy could expect in their second year. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Don’t expect to get away with the stuff you do now, they really crack down from second year onwards. You already know what to expect from Professor Harkness, she doesn’t really change much.” He took a sip from his drink. “That’s a good thing though because you’re prepared from the off with her. Professor Maguire is okay, he’s just a bit boring to be honest. Ms. Maximoff is a lot nicer and way more lenient, she’s my favourite lecturer by far.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>At the mention of Wanda’s name Rio noticed Billy shift uncomfortably before excusing himself to go to the toilet. When she was sure he was out of earshot, she looked at Alice and asked, “what’s his deal with Ms. Maximoff? He always gets squirrely whenever she’s mentioned.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Alice shrugged. “I don’t know, I’ve not noticed.” She quickly changed the subject by asking Ash what it was like on their course, so Rio dropped the conversation. There was definitely something going on but she wasn’t going to find out that night. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>When Billy got back they had one more drink before heading off on their separate ways. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When Rio was walking across the car park, she felt her phone buzz in her pocket. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Wanda: I know it’s a school night but do you fancy a drink?</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Rio puffed her cheeks and blew out a breath. How many times could she shut Wanda down before it made her angry? Granted Wanda wasn’t constantly messaging her like a love-struck teenage girl, it was just the odd text here and there asking if she wanted to go for a drink or if she needed a lift onto campus or a lift home, but Rio knew with every rejection she had to be hurting Wanda’s feelings more and more – the very thing she thought she was avoiding by shutting her down in the first place. But she still felt like she had to do it. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Rio: Thanks for the offer but I was out last night and I can’t bounce back like I used to</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Wanda: Okay</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Rio slipped her phone back into her pocket and pushed both hands through her hair, she felt awful. Wanda was just trying to be nice but, due to her own damage, Rio wasn’t able to accept it. It wasn’t like she hadn’t had a casual thing with people before, it was just that they’d all ended the same way. The women had agreed to Rio’s terms of it being purely for sex and nothing else which worked fine until they started to ask her why she never stayed over, or why they didn’t spend time with each other outside of sleeping together, and Rio would then have to explain that they knew exactly what they were entering in to and if they wanted more then the arrangement couldn’t continue. She had gained a reputation around her hometown for it and found that many women viewed her as a challenge, like they could be the one to tie her down and tame her ‘fuck boy’ image. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She had been walking for nearly twenty minutes when she felt her phone buzz in her pocket again. She pulled it out and read the message. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Wanda: This feels juvenile to ask but have I done something to offend you?</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Rio groaned into the early evening air. There it was. Even through trying to get it done immediately, this conversation was unavoidable. Maybe she should just become celibate, it would save her so much aggro. She needed to reply, leaving Wanda on read at this point wouldn’t serve anything, but </span><em><span>how</span></em><span> should she reply? How could she do this delicately over text? She groaned again when she realised that there really wasn’t a good way to do it through messages where tone could be misinterpreted. She typed out a message, and even though every fibre of her being was screaming at her telling her that it was a bad idea, she hit send.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Rio: No you haven’t done anything, I’ve just been busy. I’m about to order food if you want to come over?</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>A few minutes went by before Wanda replied during which Rio let herself into her flat, kicked off her shoes and dramatically flopped down onto her sofa. She was definitely going to research the practicality of becoming a nun after this. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Wanda: I’ll be there in 10.</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Rio quickly ordered some food, having to guess at what Wanda might like since all she knew for sure was that she wasn’t a vegetarian. The ten minutes crawled by with Rio watching her front door like a hawk in case Wanda just materialised in front of it. She was so focussed on the door that hearing the buzzer for the main door made her jump, as did the knock at her door when it came. She got off the sofa and took a breath before opening it trying her very best to hide any inkling that she really didn’t want to be doing this. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She greeted Wanda politely and gestured for her to enter the flat. “It’s not quite as nice as your house, but it’ll do.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Don’t try to be humble, I know how much the rent for this building is. You’re not quite the average student, are you?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio laughed awkwardly and scratched the back of her neck. “I guess not.” She went to sit on the couch and Wanda followed suit, sitting at the opposite end to keep space between them. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio cleared her throat, unsure how to start her sentence since this talk usually came much later on instead of after only sleeping together once, but she ploughed on saying the first thing that came to mind. “I’m sorry if I made you feel like you’d done something wrong. The truth is I’m just not really a repeat offence kinda guy.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda’s eyes widened. “‘Repeat offence’? Way to make a girl feel good.” She said with a chuckle. </span><span><br/>
</span><em><span>Fuck. Great word choice you idiot.</span></em> <span><br/>
</span><span>Rio stuttered, scrambling to put the words together to form a coherent sentence. “Oh god that’s no- I didn- that was the wrong-” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda started laughing, cutting her off. “Relax, I know what you meant. I have to say though, I am enjoying watching you struggle to speak. It’s extremely rare for you to not have a clever retort ready to go.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio scoffed. “I’m usually better at this conversation, though I am used to it being a few months down the line.” She shook her head and laughed to herself.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda lifted an eyebrow inquisitively and leaned back into the corner of the sofa whilst crossing her legs. “Oh? Had to have this talk with a lot of women, have you?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio lazily slung her arm over the back off the couch and angled her body more towards Wanda. “Hey, I can’t help it that I’m so good in bed that women become obsessed with me and I have to remind them that I’m a lone wolf.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh yeah,” Wanda started, her tone drenched in sarcasm. “I get major alpha vibes from you, darling.” She smirked and continued speaking before Rio could respond. “Also if you think your ‘performance’ that night was good enough to cause a crazed obsession, then your confidence is </span><em><span>greatly</span></em><span> misplaced.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio gave a scoffing chuckle. “I think the noises you were making beg to differ.” She saw a look flash across Wanda’s face and she instantly knew that Wanda was thinking back to that night. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio began to wonder how many times Wanda had thought about it. Had she thought about it the same amount that Rio had? More? Less? Was this the first time that her mind had gone back to it? Surely not. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Penny for your thoughts?” Rio threw out.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda smiled. “I think you know what they are.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Even sitting with the distance between them, the tension was palpable and the temptation was making Rio’s fingers twitch. She was drumming with one hand on the back of the sofa and the other was playing with the hem of her shirt. She would be a fool to try and deny how good the sex was and Wanda had baited her by implying that her part in it wasn’t as good as she thought it was. But if they did this then it would just get messy and Rio really couldn’t be bothered with the fallout, especially since she would still have to be at the university where Wanda worked. In the same department that she taught in. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio sighed and moved the arm that was resting on the back of the couch to start twisting a few strands of hair, the words that she usually used in this situation coming back to her. “Look Wanda, I don’t want to sound like a dick but there’s no other way to say this. I don’t really do commitment very well and anything that we start will just end badly and probably also end with you hating me, making it awkward since we’ll be in the same building a lot of the time. So it’s just safer to stop it before it can get to that point.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She watched Wanda’s face carefully as she spoke and saw the way that her brows dipped and the way that confusion mixed with something that she couldn’t place settled over Wanda’s features. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda swallowed and seemed to take a moment to choose her words. She uncrossed her legs and leant forwards again, lacing her fingers together and letting her hands rest on her legs. “Rio, I’m not looking for a relationship, I’m a single mother to a teenage boy and I’m trying to navigate that minefield of hormones. And in the interest of being honest, I’m not very good at commitment either.” She looked down at her hands and started to fidget, but Rio sensed that Wanda wasn’t finished so didn’t interrupt. “Also, I work in the same department as my ex. So believe me when I say that I do not want to add another person to that clusterfuck of awkwardness. It’s already hard enough.” She laughed lightly, still looking at her hands. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio relaxed slightly, put at ease by Wanda accepting what she had said. “Your ex-husband works in the department too?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda looked up at that, shaking her head. “Oh no, he works for the government. My, uh, other ex works in the department. But while we’re on the subject of my ex-husband, our relationship was always more of a casual thing which is why we mutually decided that the best thing to do was to get divorced. We can co-parent perfectly fine, but as a couple? We were never meant to work.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio was now very curious about Wanda’s relationship history – she hadn’t expected it to be this intriguing. Wanda didn’t seem like the type to have a scandalous dating life, but then again Rio hadn’t expected her to have a son either so maybe she couldn’t read her as well as she thought.  </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She asked her next questions ready for Wanda to shut her down, which she would respect but she was asking anyway. “What about your other ex? What happened there?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda blew out a breath like she’d been expecting the question. “That one’s a bit messier.” She started tracing a random pattern on the arm of the settee. “The relationship was more full-on which I guess made me panic, or scared me or whatever. I did something that I’m not proud of, they found out and rightfully broke up with me. Rumours flew through the department and now they avoid me at all costs.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio pressed her lips together, unsure of what to say. This is not the direction she had thought that this conversation would go. The best she could manage was a quiet, “yikes.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda nodded slowly. “Yeah. So relationships really aren’t high on my list of things that I’m desperate for right now.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio nodded too and an awkward silence settled in the room, and she couldn’t find anything to say to attempt to shift it.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She couldn’t help trying to figure out who Wanda’s ex was. She hadn’t met a lot of the lecturers at the university, in fact the only two she had spent any time with were Wanda and Agatha. Her brain was trying to form a connection, she was close to something. Wanda’s ex works in the department, it’s probably how they met, the breakup was messy and now they hate her and avoid her. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Oh.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b><em>Oh.</em></b><b><em><br/>
</em></b><span><br/>
</span><span>The look that Agatha had gotten on her face the two times that Rio had mentioned Wanda came careening into her mind. The fact that after their meetings, Rio would take the short way to the lecture hall past Wanda’s office and Agatha would go the opposite direction taking the long way. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>It was </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> obvious but she wasn’t going to mention it, it wasn’t her place to bring it up.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They sat silently for an excruciatingly long time before the door buzzer made them both jump. “Food’s here.” Rio said, hating the way her voice cracked, and jumped up all too quickly, basically sprinting to the door. She collected the bags from the delivery driver and took them into the kitchen, getting plates and cutlery out of the cupboards and drawers. “I had to guess at what to order for you, I hope you like Chinese food.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda joined her, pulling the cartons out of the bags and looking at what they were. “I love Chinese food. All of these are solid choices, well done.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Thank you, I have an excellent palate.” Rio said, passing a plate to Wanda. “Help yourself, there’s probably more than we need to be honest.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh but that’s the beauty of ordering a Chinese, you can feed yourself for at least three days if you know what you’re doing.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>They plated up their food and went back to the sofa, sitting closer than they were when they first sat down, the awkward tension starting to dissipate. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio grabbed the remote, turning the TV on before handing it to Wanda. “Pick something for us to watch.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda raised her eyebrow as she took the remote. “That’s an incredible amount of trust to place in me.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh I’m aware, don’t worry.” Rio smirked. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda navigated the menu and clicked on Disney Plus. When she saw the show that was at the top of Rio’s continue watching section she snorted. “Of course the most recent thing you watched was Percy Jackson.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio quickly chewed her food so that she could respond. “It’s for research I’ll have you know.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda hummed and said, “sure.” Dragging the word out for extra emphasis. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio reached in Wanda’s direction, making a grab for the remote. “Okay, you’ve lost your privileges. Give it back.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda held it out to the side, keeping it out of Rio’s reach. “I’m not judging you! My son loves those books, he got them for his thirteenth birthday and spent every waking minute reading them.” Rio made another attempt to get the remote, knocking into Wanda. “Hey watch it, you’re gonna knock my plate over!” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio pulled back and they were both laughing. Any residual awkwardness from their earlier conversation had gone and they had fallen into a comfortable rhythm. “How old is your son?” </span></p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda smiled fondly. “He’s eighteen. He’s studying at the university actually, but I can’t tell you any more because he made me promise not to tell anyone that we’re related.” She laughed. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio quirked an eyebrow having found a challenge in the subtext of Wanda’s words. “I’ll just keep my eye out for the most vividly ginger boy then.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You do that. Please let me know if you spot him.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda switched from Disney to Netflix asking if Rio had ever seen Derry Girls.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Nope.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda pressed play on the first episode. “I think you’ll like it, it’s your kind of humour.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“We’ll see.” She said with a wink. Wanda rolled her eyes and started eating her food. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>They had made it through three episodes before finishing their platefuls and were now sitting with their shoulders touching, which Rio was all too aware of. She was able to keep quiet about it until Wanda absentmindedly put her hand on her thigh. She shifted causing Wanda’s hand to slide off of her leg and onto the couch cushion and turned so that she was facing her. “Okay, if we’re going to do this then there need to be rules.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda angled herself so that she was also facing Rio. “I’m listening.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio held up her hand and started counting. “Number one: no sleepovers.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda snorted. “Fine by me, you snore very loudly.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I do not. Also that’s irrelevant. Number two: this is just sex and nothing more. We don’t need to spend time together outside of it.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“So what we’re doing right now is-”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio cut her off. “This doesn’t count, this was pre-rules.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda nodded. “Aye aye, captain.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“And finally, the most important one. Number three: do not, under any circumstances, fall in love with me.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>That one made Wanda laugh. “We’re not in any danger of that happening, do not worry.” She gave Rio a pointed look. “You, on the other hand, need to not fall in love with </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I think I can handle that.” Rio smirked. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda then did one of the most quintessentially British things that Rio had ever seen. She slapped her thighs and said, “right,” before standing up and making her way to the door. She put her shoes on before nonchalantly saying, “thank you for dinner but some of us have work in the morning.” She opened the door and stepped out, throwing, “I’ll let you know if I require your services.” over her shoulder before shutting the door. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio sighed. She knew that there was only one way that this could end, the same way they all ended, but maybe Wanda would surprise her. She put the plates and cutlery in the dishwasher, pressing the quick wash cycle and put the leftovers in the fridge before stripping off and getting in the shower, ready to settle in for the night. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Her next meeting with Agatha followed the same pattern as the rest of them. Rio would give Agatha her coffee, Agatha would make a decent effort at engaging with Rio’s banter – a more recent development but Rio took it as a win since it opened up the possibility of Agatha loosening up a bit – and then Rio would blow her mind with her work. The last part was a given, obviously, and Rio was often tempted to hand Agatha the version that was written half in Spanish just to mess with her a bit, but ultimately decided against it.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Her friends used to hate borrowing her notes in their undergrad because they could only understand about forty percent of it. They’d jokingly complain saying that it was discrimination and Rio would tell them that it wasn’t her fault they only spoke one language and she would remind them that Duolingo was free. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio often chose her research topics based on what she knew Agatha liked, that’s why she had previously asked what Agatha’s gateway into Greek mythology was and who her godly parent would be. It helped her narrow down what to work on next and aided her in her attempts to get onto Agatha’s good side. She could tell that it made Agatha happy when she told her that she had been the reason for her most recent deep dive; she could see the pride in her eyes and body language. For a teacher she imagined that one of the best things you could experience is witnessing your love and knowledge of a subject inspiring someone to do their own work on said subject, and knowing that she was providing that for Agatha did give her her own selfish point of pride. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Reading The Odyssey, a book that Agatha had previously named as the reason she took an interest in Greek mythology, for the first time in front of her had been a plan that Rio had had since their argument about it all those weeks ago. She’d been waiting for the right time to do it, waiting for Agatha to curb the defensiveness that she dressed up as professionalism just enough for her to be tempted to have a casual conversation about it. Rio purposefully kept a blasé attitude about reading the book because she knew that Agatha wouldn’t be able to resist showing a little bit of personal interest since the story obviously meant a lot to her – and she was right. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Every time she made a noise of approval or gave a quiet chuckle at something she had just read she could feel Agatha’s gaze snap to her, reading her reactions and trying to decipher her thoughts. She smiled to herself because Agatha was fighting so hard to try and seem as uninterested as she could, but betrayed herself every time. Rio was so close to getting her to open up, she could feel it – Agatha accidentally saying her name instead of calling her Miss Vidal only worked to cement that fact. But just as Rio thought they were finally getting somewhere, Agatha turned everything on its head by starting a fight. Over dog-earing the page of all things. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio could barely believe that it was happening. Had Agatha all of a sudden realised that they’d managed to go the past few meetings without having an argument and now she was desperate to reset the counter? She had the infuriating skill of being able to twist the situation to make it Rio’s fault, like she had been the one to start it. It was childish and thoroughly annoying. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio still went to the lecture, mostly out of spite because she would not let Agatha have any reason to think that she had ‘won’ whatever that was. She was five minutes late in an act of pettiness which prompted Agatha to say, “nice of you to join us, Miss Vidal.” as she ascended the stairs in the seating bank and shuffled into the middle to take her seat next to Alice. She smiled sweetly and added a sugary tonality to her voice. “My sincerest apologies Professor, please continue.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha tensed her jaw and went back to teaching about Daedalus’ Labyrinth. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Alice leaned towards her, the seat creaking from the movement. “I wish I had your bravery. How has she let you live for this long?” She whispered.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You just need to know how to handle her.” Rio whispered back.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>With her back to the seats, using a laser pointer to indicate something on the big screen, Agatha said, “I hope that the whispering coming from the middle is about the Labyrinth and nothing else.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and sat back in her seat, pulling her laptop out to start taking notes – though they ended up being severely lacking due to her annoyance at Agatha still being strong. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She used the band practise that evening to get out the anger that was still there, hitting the snare and crash with more force than was necessary but damn did it feel good. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio really couldn’t figure Agatha out. Every time she thought she was making progress, Agatha would drag them back about ten paces and Rio wasn’t sure how much more she could handle. It wasn’t fair for Agatha to be doing this to her, to change what was acceptable in the middle of an ongoing conversation and to get mad when Rio didn’t immediately follow the new set of rules that were laid before her. How could she possibly keep up when Agatha’s attitude changed with the direction of the wind? </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Was it all some kind of fucked up test? Was Agatha seeing how far she could push her before she broke? If that was the case then Rio wouldn’t allow it to happen, she didn’t care how much it would make Agatha fly off the handle, the next time it happened she would stand her ground and challenge it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The chance to do that never came, however, because on Thursday night Rio received an email from Agatha telling her that their weekly meetings would be coming to an end. It caught her completely off guard. Granted Agatha was hard to read, but this hadn’t been something that Rio had expected. She knew that the meetings would stop eventually because Agatha had said at the start that they would only continue while she deemed them necessary, but Rio had imagined that this information would have been delivered face to face. She could only read this as an overreaction to the previous day. </span>
<em>
<span>Childish.</span>
</em>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She wasn’t going to let Agatha do this without an explanation, this was entirely unfair and was nothing close to the professionalism that Agatha was so desperate to cling on to. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio decided that she was going to catch Agatha after her morning lecture and demand to know what was going on, it was the least that she deserved. Almost every interaction with Agatha had left Rio feeling either irritated or confused and she was done with it. She was finally going to get Agatha to talk to her normally and communicate with her. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Her plan was to get onto campus early and give herself time to properly think about what she wanted to say. She didn’t want to go in half-cocked, speaking erratically. She also wanted to be as prepared as she should be for whatever Agatha might throw at her. She anticipated Agatha to try and brush her off but she wouldn’t let that happen. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>As she started crossing the car park she felt her phone buzz in her pocket.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Wanda: How quickly can you get to my office?</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>This was the first time she had heard from Wanda since Sunday which meant that she was instantly intrigued. She was a little bit thrown by Wanda asking her to go to her office though. The university campus, where she worked, on a Friday morning hadn’t been a time or place that Rio had expected Wanda to ‘require her services’. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She had enough time to see Wanda and deal with Agatha, right?</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: About 5 minutes</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Wanda: Good. Don’t bother knocking, just come straight in</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>The instruction sent heat straight to her stomach and she picked up her pace. The lift ride was the longest of her life and she was tapping her foot in anticipation, which earned her annoyed looks from the other people she was sharing the lift with. As soon as the doors opened, she bolted through them and power walked to Wanda’s office, taking a moment outside the door to steady her breathing.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She walked straight in and saw Wanda sitting at her desk. She looked up and said, “shut the door.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>By the time Rio had completed the incredibly simple task and turned back around, Wanda was standing in front of her and in the brief few seconds she had to look at her face, she noticed the redness in Wanda’s eyes and the way that the skin was slightly swollen around them.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Wanda are you o-” She started to ask a question but was cut off by Wanda pushing her against the wall.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I didn’t tell you to come here so we could talk. That was one of your rules, remember?” Rio nodded and Wanda continued. “Good. I don’t want to hear you unless I tell you that it’s okay.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio was able to comply until Wanda’s hand was under the waistband of her underwear and she couldn’t control the moan that ripped its way out of her throat. Wanda immediately removed her hand and the look in her eyes let Rio know that she had fucked up. “If you can’t behave, then I'll have to ask you to leave.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio absolutely did not want to leave so she mimed zipping her lips shut and Wanda returned her hand to where Rio needed it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio tried her best but the way Wanda was curling her fingers made it impossible to keep quiet – Wanda had resorted to pressing her hand over Rio’s mouth to muffle her moans and whimpers – and when she came she had to bite Wanda’s fingers to stop herself from loudly hurling profanities into the room. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda withdrew her hand and put the middle two fingers in Rio’s mouth for her to clean them off. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio took her time, savouring the look on Wanda’s face as she slowly sucked on her fingers. The redness that was around her eyes had moved into her cheeks, giving them a deep glow and there was a hint of smug satisfaction in her smile. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda took her hand out of Rio’s mouth and led her towards the desk. “I’m not done with you yet. Take your jeans off and sit here.” She tapped the desk like Rio needed clarification. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio looked between the desk and Wanda sceptically and Wanda seemed to read her thoughts. “It’s sturdy, trust me.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>That only gave Rio more questions. How often has Wanda had sex in her office? Who has Wanda had sex in her office with? Was it Agatha? Or was it her ex-husband? How much action has this desk seen?</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She opened her mouth, ready to voice one of them, but Wanda put a finger to her lips, stopping her. “I didn’t tell you to speak, I told you to sit.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smirked around her finger and started to slide her jeans down, making sure to maintain eye contact the whole time, and then perched herself at the edge of the desk. She watched Wanda slowly sink to her knees and let her head fall back when Wanda put her face between her thighs. </span>
</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio had lost track of time, and for a damn good reason. Her legs were shaky, making it difficult to walk, but she still walked with purpose. She still had a mission today and she was going to complete it. She checked Agatha’s schedule and saw that her lecture finished at noon so she made her way to the lecture hall and waited outside until the doors opened and the students came pouring out. She slipped into the room and waited for the last person to leave, and the door to close behind them before speaking – Agatha was busy with her laptop so she didn’t notice Rio standing there. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Professor Harkness.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha didn’t look up. “You know when my office hours are, please use them.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio scoffed and crossed her arms. “I’ve spent enough time in your office.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>That made Agatha look up, and when she saw that it was Rio who was speaking her expression hardened. “What do you want, Miss Vidal?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio’s eyebrows shot up. “I want you to speak to me like your equal for a start.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“In the unlikely event that you become my equal, I shall do as such. But since that is yet to happen I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio tensed her jaw as she felt her pulse quicken in anger. It was a miracle that she had put up with Agatha for so long, but she wasn’t going to continue allowing her to speak to her like shit. “Does putting other people down make you feel better?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The look in Agatha’s eyes sharpened. “Excuse me?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio stood her ground. “You heard me. Answer the question.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha casually returned her attention to her laptop and calmly said, “I’m not taking part in whatever ridiculous game you’re trying to play Miss Vidal. I have another lecture to give in half an hour and I need to prepare.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure what possessed her to do the thing she did next, but by the time she had done it, it was too late. She walked over to the table that Agatha was standing behind, reached out and shut the lid of her laptop, the room was so quiet that the soft click seemed to echo in the space. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha’s head snapped up, her jaw clenched and her eyes wild. “What on </span>
<em>
<span>earth</span>
</em>
<span> do you think you are doing?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio turned and walked to the seating bank, settling into the middle seat of the first row. “You’ve got half an hour, so we’re going to have a conversation.” She crossed her legs and let her hands rest on the desk that was attached to the chair. “You can start by answering my question.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio wasn’t lacking when it came to confidence, far from it. She knew who she was and what she stood for, and she wasn’t about to leave without getting what she came for.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha remained silent, just glaring at her with her arms crossed looking wholly unamused by the situation. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You don’t want to talk now? That’s fine. I can wait until after your next lecture. I’ll just stay right here.” Rio leaned back in the chair and kept her eyes locked on Agatha's. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“What is this really about, Miss Vidal?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Your blatant inability to regard anybody with respect.” Rio said without missing a beat.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha exhaled strongly through her nose. “I offer respect to those who deserve it, and right now Miss Vidal, you do not qualify.” She lifted the lid of her laptop again.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio hummed as she thought. “Okay, let’s talk about that then. Why do you not deem me worthy of your respect? And you can’t say it’s because I’m a subordinate, you’ve already used that one.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I don’t need to explain myself to you, Miss Vidal. But I do need you to leave.” She was forcing her voice to stay level and calm. There was a lot more chance of someone walking past and hearing them in this room than there was in Agatha’s office and Rio used that to her advantage. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Why are you avoiding my questions? What’s </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>really about?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“It’s about you trying to antagonise me and get a reaction, though for what reason I have no idea.” Agatha switched up her tone to a very patronising one. “Are you bored? Lonely? Or are you just a spoiled brat who’s used to getting her own way all the time?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>That made Rio seethe. She leant forwards, feeling the heat starting to rise in her chest. “For a woman in her forties, your immaturity is quite astounding.” She said, her jaw tight and her voice low. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She saw Agatha gasp at her words. It was small, barely audible, but she noticed it. The small rise in Agatha’s chest as she took the breath, the tension that shot into her shoulders, the look of utter disbelief that settled on her face and the way that her neck started to develop a red hue. It was the perfect fuel for the fire that was starting to build within Rio. She wasn't going to storm out this time, she wasn't going to use Wanda as a threat – despite how tempting the new information she had was – and she wasn't going to back down. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She held Agatha's gaze tightly in her own, daring her to respond, to get angry. Agatha continued to scowl at her, her breathing getting heavier as the frustration took hold of her. “You need to leave.” Agatha eventually said, speaking slowly making sure to enunciate every word and crossing her arms tightly. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I'll leave when you treat me like a person and not just some inconvenience dumped into your life with the sole purpose of making your existence difficult. You </span>
<em>
<span>chose</span>
</em>
<span> to be my supervisor, remember?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I do remember, and you have made every effort to make me regret that decision ever since.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio scoffed and crossed her arms. “So that's why you stopped the meetings out of the blue? Because after six weeks you finally came to the conclusion that you regret your decision?” </span>
</p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha's eyes widened and she threw her arms out, laughing humourlessly. “So that's what this is about? You're throwing a tantrum because I decided that you're okay on your own for a bit?” She shook her head in disbelief. “Your codependency issues are not my problem.”</span><span><br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span><span>Rio had picked up on the fact that when Agatha feels threatened, she goes on the attack. Firing at her personality, trying to dissect her actions and boil them down to their simplest form in order to invalidate them. “I’m not throwing a tantrum, I’m asking for an explanation. We had a disagreement, which is far from out of the ordinary for us, and then you ‘terminate’ the meetings without telling me why. Forgive me for wanting to know the reason.” Rio kept her voice steady and calm, she wasn’t going to stoop in an attempt to match Agatha. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. “If I give you a reason, will you leave?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio spread her arms. “That's literally why I’m here.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha walked round to the front of the table and leaned back against it, letting her hands rest on the edge. “The reason is that you don’t need weekly meetings, you never really did.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Then why-”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Do you want an explanation or not?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio held her hands up and pressed her lips together and Agatha continued.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I wanted to see if you could keep up with the demand of constantly finding something to research and always be thinking ahead to the next topic whilst still being able to link them together. A PhD is a lot of work and you proved that you were capable of doing that.” She paused but Rio didn’t interrupt her. “However, I did notice a pattern of you showing work about topics that I had given lectures on – or things that you had asked me about like Athena and The Odyssey – and while that is okay, the inspiration on what to research was still coming from me and you can’t rely on me to tell you where you should look next. It is important that you can do independent work and think for yourself.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio didn’t speak for a moment, she just took the time to process and understand what Agatha had said. It all made sense, but there was something that was still bugging her. “So if that’s the truth, then why couldn’t you have just told me that?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It </span><em><span>is </span></em><span>the truth and I don’t have to explain every thought I have to you.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio slowly stood up and stepped off of the seating bank. “Which brings us back to you not seeing me as someone who ranks high enough for a basic level of decency and respect.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Miss Vidal, I-”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Say my name.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Excuse me?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio stepped towards Agatha. “Say my first name. You did it once and didn’t burst into flames, so you can do it again.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha crossed her arms and sighed. “I address you by your surname for the same reason that you address me by mine.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio continued to slowly walk towards Agatha. “That’s not true though, is it? I address you as Professor Harkness as a gesture of politeness and recognition of your title. You say my surname in an effort to do the opposite. To make me less of a person almost. To show that I’m beneath you. We are not the same.” She stopped about two feet from where Agatha was still leaning against the table. She glanced down to Agatha’s hands and saw that her fingers were twitching, restless. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio was about to speak again when she heard a voice from outside the room, slightly muffled behind the closed door. “The doors are closed, does that mean that we can’t go in yet?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>The voice was enough to startle both of them and Agatha quickly pushed off of the table and walked back around it to her laptop, firing up the projector and loading up her PowerPoint. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Well this has certainly been fun, Miss Vidal, but I really do need you to leave now.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio gave a low chuckle. “Okay Agatha.” She stayed long enough to see Agatha’s head snap up and then turned and walked out of the room.  </span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was standing in Lilia’s kitchen leaning against the counter with a glass of red wine in her hand, listening to her friend sing to herself as she finished plating up their dinner.<br/>“Grab a plate and sit down ladies.” Lilia instructed and Agatha and Jen complied, taking their plates and glasses to the table.<br/>When they were all sitting, Lilia raised her glass and said, “a toast to us surviving the first half of the semester.” The three of them knocked their glasses together and took a sip before Lilia continued. “And another toast to Agatha only being in the Dean’s office five times, I’m proud of you.” She winked at Agatha and Agatha rolled her eyes in response but raised her glass anyway.<br/>“I hate you.”<br/>“I know.”<br/><br/>Lilia and Jen were trading stories about students that had impressed them in both positive and negative ways – the negatives were winning this time around – but Agatha wasn’t paying attention. Her mind had drifted to thirty hours earlier, to Rio standing arms length away from her demanding that Agatha call her by her first name. She had been replaying the whole interaction on a loop since Rio had walked out of the lecture hall, muscle memory guiding her through her lectures for the rest of the day since her brain was occupied by a five-foot-something with a sarcastic attitude and an answer for everything.<br/><br/>When she was younger Rio would have been exactly her type. The way that she carried herself, the effortless way that she existed, that smirk. It would have all made her melt. It would have made her want to follow Rio around, it would have made her want to have any excuse to just be near her, in her space, have any shred of Rio’s attention focussed on her. She would have done anything to be on Rio’s radar.<br/>But that was then, and now she was older, she was more mature, and her tastes had changed with her. She had realised that the reason she liked women like that was because they were exactly the type of women that her mother would hate. Her mother hated the fact that she liked women full stop, but a woman like that – like Rio – would make her mothers head explode, and that made them all the more appealing.<br/><br/>She had spent so long moulding herself into something that would piss her mother off that, when her mother died, she didn’t know who she was anymore. Her entire motivation for being the person that she was had vanished and she was left navigating the world without a map, wandering aimlessly searching for something to latch onto, something to give her purpose again.<br/>Her step-father had been just as bad as her mother. At her mother’s funeral he had pulled her aside and told her that she was a disgrace and that she was dishonouring her mother because she had worn a suit instead of a dress – the fact that it was late November had clearly been lost on him and if it had been a summer funeral then she would have absolutely worn a dress.<br/>Her half-sister – who was ten years her junior – had been standing nearby, watching the interaction and making a show of twirling around in the black dress she was dutifully wearing.<br/><br/>But since she no longer lived at home and she wasn’t actually his child, that was the last time he spoke to her. Twenty two years had gone by where Agatha had grown as a person. Twenty two years where she no longer had to hide parts of herself and she could live her life exactly as she wanted and yet she still struggled to do it.<br/>Her mother’s voice was still in the back of her mind judging her for every little thing that she did. The damage that woman had done had burrowed deep within Agatha and its roots had grown too strong and too thick to just be torn out. It had to be carefully dug out. It had to be gently chipped away at and removed with care to make sure that it wouldn’t cause more damage on the way out or just grow back.<br/><br/>Doing so was a long, arduous process and the idea of it scared Agatha. The idea that someone might see those ugly parts of her, the damaged-beyond-repair pieces that she clung onto like a lifeline. Before her mother had died she proudly stood in front of her trauma, letting it push her into certain decisions, letting it be her motivation and her guide, her reason for being. But after her mother died she hid behind it, let it cover her, protect her. It reminded her why it was there, manipulated her into thinking that she needed it, and relied on it to survive. It was there to make sure she didn’t let those things happen to her again. It wouldn’t let her open herself up to more pain. It was the reason that she hadn’t kept any of the friendships that she had at university or had any form of relationship since her mother passed.<br/><br/>She had fought with it when she and Wanda had begun their relationship and it had been an ongoing battle for the first two years. She had managed to quiet it, to push it down when Wanda had shown no signs of leaving. When she had opened up slightly about her past and it hadn’t scared Wanda off. Or when an argument had triggered her fight or flight and Wanda just let her have some time to cool off and figure herself out before finding her so that they could talk it out and make it better. Wanda had understood that she couldn’t help it and that had made it easier to handle.<br/><br/>But then, of course, Agatha had found out that Wanda had cheated on her. She had come home early to surprise both her and Billy and had found Wanda in their bed with her ex-husband, the engagement ring that Agatha had given her two years prior still sitting on her finger.<br/><br/>The door that she had used to seal off all of the negative thoughts and feelings that her mother had supplied her with was blasted off of its hinges and everything came barrelling forwards, racing towards the surface and devouring her, shrouding her in a thick cloud of smoke that blocked out all the light Wanda had previously been the symbol of. It caged her in and broke her down. <br/>It sat on her shoulder, whispering in her ear, telling her that this was what she deserved, that this was the life she chose and a sinner could never be happy. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha still couldn’t figure out if Wanda keeping the ring on was better or worse than if she’d have taken it off.<br/><br/>Then a few months later, Vision had the bright idea to go to her and tell her that the time she caught them wasn’t the first and that it had also happened two times before. She had been living at Jen’s house at the time, a pit stop until she found herself a new house, so the fact that he knew where she was meant that Wanda had to have told him and that made her skin crawl. Knowing that Wanda knew where she was living, knowing that she had been keeping tabs on her made her feel dirty, too exposed, unsafe.<br/>The new information also added fuel to the ever-burning fire that her mother had left behind. She could have gone her whole life not knowing that it hadn’t only been a one time thing, a ‘small lapse of judgement’ as Wanda had called it.<br/>He told her that Wanda didn’t know that he was telling her and that he was doing it of his own volition. He didn’t need to mention that it was to alleviate his own guilt, that much was obvious. The subtext was so bold that it might as well have just been text.<br/><br/>It still didn’t make any of it better, it did nothing to loosen the grip that her trauma had on her, it made it tighter. It made her pull back more and shrink further into herself, her self worth ebbing away with every passing second. <br/><br/>It took Agatha nearly a full year to get back to herself, to put the blame fully on Wanda where it belonged. To build up her walls, carefully laying each brick and reinforcing them so that they wouldn’t come down again. It was protection, self preservation, a means of survival. A way to ensure that no one would come close to tearing her apart the way that Wanda had, that there was no chance that she would be offered the hope of love and a family to have it ripped away from her and shredded to pieces in front of her.<br/>She resigned herself to the fact that, if she hadn’t managed to find a relationship, a level of love that she deserved by the time she turned forty, then it was never going to happen for her. It just wasn’t in the cards.<br/><br/>Then Rio Vidal swanned into her life, a blunt reminder of who Agatha used to be. The way that Rio was so unapologetically herself, not afraid to voice her thoughts, undeterred by people – by Agatha – trying to put her down and make her fit into a box that wasn’t the right shape or size for her. Rio wore her heart on her sleeve and she didn’t care who saw it.<br/>Agatha was jealous of her.<br/><br/>Rio didn’t have anything holding her back. She was incredibly smart and so self-aware that it almost intimidated Agatha.<br/>The way that Rio asked Agatha questions about herself so casually like giving the answers wouldn’t cause something to break within her, and the way that she was always so relaxed until she’d had enough of Agatha’s bullshit was terrifying.<br/>Agatha was used to being able to intimidate people into silence, she was used to being able to control a conversation and guide it in the direction that she deemed the safest, but Rio didn’t let her. She resisted and didn’t back down.<br/><br/>When Rio confronted her the previous day and sat so casually like she owned the room, demanding that Agatha talk to her like they were on the same level, it made Agatha’s chest tighten with a feeling that she didn’t want to name.<br/>Agatha never had to explain herself to anyone other than the Dean, and even then it was only the most simple of explanations, enough to get him off her back until the next time he summoned her. But Rio had sat herself down and made it clear that she wasn’t leaving until she got what she wanted, she had all the time in the world to stare Agatha down and wait patiently for her to finally fold. To finally show her a part of herself that was real instead of the fake, pre-constructed jargon she usually threw out.<br/><br/>The previous couple of times that Agatha had given information to Rio had been carefully picked, giving just enough to satisfy her incessant need to know things, her desperate attempts to bring a personal touch to their meetings.<br/>The reasons she gave Rio for why she cancelled their meetings hadn’t been lies, they had very much been true. However, it had been a conclusion that Agatha had come to after the third meeting when they were organising Rio’s notes.<br/>Rio definitely didn’t need weekly supervision, in reality she just needed to write her thesis and let Agatha proofread it to smooth it out a bit. But Agatha let the meetings continue and she couldn’t give a reason why, all she knew was that she didn’t want them to stop.<br/><br/>It was only when the stress of being around someone like Rio was starting to affect her sleep that she decided she needed to put a stop to it. She couldn’t keep letting Rio push her boundaries, she couldn’t keep letting Rio burrow her way under her skin and remind her of the confidence and couldn’t-care-less attitude that she had lost when her mother had died. She needed to care, she needed to be cautious, she needed to be sure that she was safe and Rio was a threat to that.<br/><br/>So when Rio was standing there, close enough to touch, challenging her to call her by her name, Agatha had no idea what to do. Her hands were twitching, her fingers restless with a nervous energy that she didn’t understand or know how to sate. Her pulse was hammering, not from anger or frustration, but from something else that she couldn’t place. She had no idea what would have happened had they not been interrupted by the students turning up to attend her lecture.<br/><br/>Agatha was so in her head that the noise of Lilia and Jen talking had disappeared completely, it had faded away while her brain was jumping around, skimming through memories, and she only remembered where she was when she felt something on her arm. She jumped slightly at the contact and looked down at it to see Jen’s hand gently resting there. Her mind snapped back into Lilia’s house, into the dining room where she and her two friends were currently sitting having their Saturday meal together.<br/>Well, the other two had been eating. Agatha had been absentmindedly pushing her food around her plate whilst staring through the table, getting lost in the labyrinth of her own brain.<br/><br/>Agatha looked up, forcing herself to look into Jen’s eyes. They were gentle, shining with worry. “I’m fine.” Agatha said, all too quickly. An answer to a question she didn’t even know if she’d been asked.<br/>Jen smiled, softly, cautiously. She definitely hadn’t asked anything that required the answer that Agatha had hurriedly given.<br/>Jen slowly took her hand away from Agatha’s arm and nodded her head towards her plate. “You’ve barely eaten anything. Where did you go?”<br/>Agatha looked back down at her plate, the roast dinner that Lilia had prepared sitting untouched save for the few carrots and one roast potato that she had eaten before she zoned out. She loaded some chicken and stuffing onto her fork and brought it into her mouth, the texture of it mixing with the fact that it had gone cold was very unpleasant.<br/>“Do you want me to put it in the microwave for you, warm it up again?” Lilia asked. Agatha said that it was okay but Lilia was already taking the plate from her and taking it back into the kitchen.<br/><br/>Agatha sipped her wine while she waited and Jen offered her a reassuring smile but didn’t ask anything else until Lilia had returned with the plate, steam now rising from it, making it look a lot more appetizing. Agatha took another bite, the warmth of it now making her realise just how hungry she actually was.<br/>“You’ve already answered, but it was before I actually asked.” Jen started. “Are you okay?”<br/>Agatha nodded, pushing the food to the side of her mouth so that she could speak. “Yeah I’m fine.” She could hardly tell them that she had been thinking about Rio which had caused a spiral that led back to her mother. They would think she was insane.<br/><br/>She watched Jen and Lilia exchange a look before they both returned their eyes to her. She put her fork down and said, “Okay, you two looking at me like I’m a stray puppy you’ve found on the side of the road is really putting me off my food.”<br/>They exchanged another look which made Agatha roll her eyes. “Come on, out with it.”<br/>Lilia spoke first. “It’s just that we were trying to get your attention for a solid five minutes, but you were really out of it. We were starting to worry.”<br/>Agatha ate some more before replying. “You don’t need to worry, I’m perfectly fine. And I’m sure five minutes is an exaggeration.” She knew that it probably wasn’t given the temperature her food had been when she had tried to eat it.<br/>“Right,” Jen began, speaking slowly, choosing how to navigate the sentence, “but you never usually disappear like that. You don’t have to tell us anything, but we can tell when something is wrong.”<br/><br/>Agatha knew that they were coming from a place of concern as her friends, but she couldn’t tell them what she was thinking about. She didn’t know how to describe it to herself, never mind them, but she needed to think of something before they inevitably started guessing. They always said that she didn’t need to tell them anything, but they could never resist.<br/>“It was just your run-of-the-mill disassociation, nothing to write home about.” That clearly wasn’t enough because they started guessing anyway.<br/><br/>“Is it Billy?”<br/>Agatha sighed. “No.”<br/>“Wanda?”<br/>“No.” That one was sharper, quicker. More out of annoyance at them constantly thinking that she was at the centre of Agatha’s thoughts.<br/>“Another student then? Your final years?”<br/>“Nope.”<br/>“Rio?”<br/>The name made her shoulders tense, just for a split second. Unnoticeable if you didn’t know to look for it, if you weren’t trained in spotting such things. Unfortunately for Agatha, Lilia was a professor of psychology, she had multiple degrees in reading people and spotting behaviour patterns. It had been her job for decades before she decided to take a step back and switch to teaching instead of retiring completely.<br/>Her voice remained level, controlled, but Agatha’s eyes subconsciously flicked to Lilia when she answered. “No.”<br/>Huge mistake.<br/><br/>Lilia made a pointed effort to not psychoanalyse them, she had always said that she didn’t want them to feel on edge around her, that they couldn’t be themselves out of fear that she would read into every little thing they said or did – and the vast majority of the time she stuck to it. But sometimes, when she deemed it necessary, she gave into it.<br/><br/>Jen hadn’t noticed anything, so she continued. “Is it the Dean? No, the Dean’s secretary! I know how much you hate her and honestly I can’t blame you.”<br/>Agatha was actively trying to avoid Lilia’s gaze but the woman’s eyes hadn’t left her face, giving Agatha the chance to say it herself but she knew Agatha was too stubborn to do it.<br/>“You can stop guessing Jennifer. She’s already told us.” Her voice was gentle and warm.<br/>Jen stopped mid-sentence, confusion making her wrinkle her brow. “... Huh?”<br/>Lila turned her head in Jen’s direction, her eyes briefly leaving Agatha allowing her to relax slightly in their absence. “It’s Rio.” She turned her head back to Agatha, the weight of her knowing gaze settling back over her making her feel cornered. “Isn’t it?”<br/><br/>Agatha sighed, closing her eyes and dipping her head in defeat. She couldn’t run from it any more, not now that Lilia was aware of it and had made Jen aware of it in turn. She had no choice but to face it head on in the knowledge that anything she couldn’t voice, anything that she didn’t fully understand, Lilia would be able to figure out and help her figure it out as well. There was no turning back now.<br/><br/>Agatha opened her eyes and lifted her head. Jen was still looking thoroughly confused but Lilia looked calm, her face was perfectly neutral giving nothing away. She was good at this.<br/>Agatha took a deep breath to steady herself before she spoke. “I don’t fully understand it, any of it. It’s all a confusing jumble.”<br/>Lilia smiled gently, her eyes crinkling softly at the corners. “That’s okay. It’s my job to understand it, you just need to talk.” Agatha nodded, picking her fork back up and stabbing it into her food trying to think of a way to start. Lilia now fully in ‘work mode’ picked up on this. “Why don’t you start with what happened earlier? Tell me what your thoughts were.”<br/>Agatha half expected her to produce a notepad and start writing down everything she said, but she knew Lilia didn’t need one. The woman had a memory like a steel trap.<br/><br/>Agatha bought herself a few seconds by taking another bite of her food. “Okay so, I’ve been having meetings with Rio since the first Wednesday of the semester and this Thursday I made the decision to stop them. I sent her an email to let her know and that was that.” She paused, looking at Lilia but she only gave a small nod, encouraging her to keep going. “But yesterday she cornered me after a lecture and demanded that I tell her why.”<br/>Lilia spoke up at that. “When you say that she cornered you, what do you mean?”<br/>“I don’t mean that she physically backed me into a corner and intimidated me. I mean that she waited until the lecture was over and came into the lecture hall. She sat herself down and asked for an explanation. Well, she asked for other things before that, but that was the main point of her coming to see me.”<br/><br/>Lilia waited for her to eat another forkful before asking her next question. “What other things did she ask you?”<br/>Agatha thought back to the conversation, the timeline of it had become jumbled in her memory and she wasn’t sure about the order of the things that Rio had said. “I can’t remember it chronologically but there was something about wanting to know why I was avoiding her questions and why I didn’t see her as an equal who was worthy of being respected.” She scoffed lightly, remembering the smug look on Rio’s face as she spoke.<br/>“Okay, and why don’t you see her as someone worthy of your respect?”<br/>Agatha had been playing with her food again whilst speaking but that made her head snap up. She narrowed her eyes. “Who said that I don’t?” Lilia was meant to be on her side, but she had immediately jumped to Rio's defence.<br/><br/>Lilia’s expression didn’t change, neither did the calm neutrality of her voice. “Rio did. She wouldn’t have asked it if there wasn’t some truth in it. Also your immediate defensiveness as you recalled the memory and then again when I asked you why you don’t respect her.”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes, which was a reaction she was very aware that Lilia would have added to the list of defensive behaviours she had exhibited in the last sixty seconds.<br/><br/>She forcefully assembled the last of her food on her fork and shoved it into her mouth, chewing aggressively. “I do respect her, she just…” She trailed off, not sure how to articulate her thoughts. “She’s annoying. She likes to antagonise me. Forgive me if that pisses me off and lowers my valuation of her.” Agatha knocked back the last of her wine and put the glass back down with a bit more force than was necessary which of course Lilia clocked, but she didn’t mention it thank god. Instead she just asked, “She likes to antagonise you, or you let her antagonise you?”<br/>“I do not let her, she just does it. It’s like her default setting or something. She’s cocky and overconfident.”<br/>“Does she respect you?”<br/>Agatha breathed out a short, humourless laugh. She could provide at least a hundred pages of evidence that would show that Rio definitely did not hold any respect for her. “She claims to but she obviously doesn’t with the way that she tries to push me all the time.”<br/>“Why does that mean that she doesn’t respect you?”<br/><br/>Agatha suddenly became aware of the fact that Jen was still sitting there, watching this evaluation as if she were an audience member watching a film in the cinema. She whipped her head towards Jen. “Are you going to contribute or are you just going to continue sitting there catching flies?” She spat out.<br/>Jen’s eyes went wide but Lilia didn’t give her a chance to respond. “Agatha. Don’t try to deflect your feelings onto Jen, we are both your friends and we’re trying to help you.” Her voice was no longer annoyingly calm, it was a sharp, no-nonsense tone. Agatha had never heard Lilia speak that way and it jolted her. The shock ran through her body and made her brain reset. She turned back to face Jen, slower and calmer this time, her voice softer. “I’m sorry Jen, you didn’t do anything to deserve that.”<br/>Jen smiled, the way it reached her eyes showed that it was genuine. “It’s okay, this is difficult. I won’t take it to heart, don’t worry.”<br/>Agatha returned the smile and gave a gentle nod, a silent ‘thank you.’<br/><br/>Lilia brought Agatha’s focus back to her. “Now, stop avoiding my question. Why does Rio pushing you mean that she doesn’t respect you?” Her voice had slipped back into the neutral tone again.<br/>Rio accusing her of avoiding questions was one thing, but coming from Lilia? It gave her pause. It made her consider that it might actually be something that she did, that there was some truth in Rio’s accusations, and if there was truth in that then what else has Rio been right about? She wasn't ready for that deep dive. She wasn't ready to admit to anything that would favour Rio.<br/><br/>Agatha puffed her cheeks, blowing out a steady breath while she considered how to answer. “Because, if she did respect me, then she wouldn’t be trying to push my boundaries all the time. She would accept it when I say that I don’t discuss my personal life with my students and she wouldn’t ask so many probing questions.”<br/>“What kind of probing questions?”<br/>Agatha thought for a moment, casting her mind back to remember them. “She asked me how I first found my interest in Greek Mythology, what age I was when I first read The Odyssey, who my godly parent would be if I had one,” Agatha paused, considering if she should say the last one or not. Fuck it . “And she asked me about my sexuality.”<br/>Lilia raised a brow. “She asked you what your sexuality is?”<br/>“Not in those words, but essentially yes.”<br/>“How did she phrase it?”<br/>Agatha ran her hand through her hair, trying to remember the exact context of the conversation. “We were talking about Orpheus and Eurydice and I asked her if she thought she would be able to lead Eurydice through the Underworld and pass the test, unlike Orpheus. But I made it clear that I was not asking about her preferences, just about the nature of the test. She said that she didn’t know and offered up the context of her leading Eurydice of her own volition, completely devoid of any prompting from myself. She then asked me the same question and I said something along the lines of if I was in love the way that Orpheus was I could try it and she took that as an opening to ask if I would also be leading Eurydice, which I immediately shut down.”<br/><br/>For the first time since they had started this ridiculous exercise, Lilia’s expression changed. She sighed in exasperation and rolled her eyes, a wholly unprofessional reaction. “Agatha,” She started, her disbelief evident in just the one word. “Rio isn’t asking probing questions. She isn’t even overstepping boundaries. She’s just trying to find something in common with you, something you both share so that she can relate to you a bit. She isn’t challenging you, or questioning your authority, she’s doing a very normal thing called trying to have a conversation. She wasn’t trying to drag some deeply personal information out of you when she asked if you would be leading Eurydice, she was using the context clues from how you phrased your answer to try and find something that you both have an understanding of, something you can both identify with. It’s part of being human.”<br/><br/>Agatha knew that Lilia was very good at her job and that her knowledge of psychology went deeper than anyone could fathom, but it couldn’t be that simple. Rio was sarcastic, she was smug. She saw Agatha as a game to be played and was making damn sure that she would be the winner. “Okay fine, but you haven’t seen her attitude or heard the tone of her voice when she was asking those things. You can't possibly draw that conclusion purely based on the things I've told you.”<br/>Lilia threw her hands up. “Have you considered that it isn’t a personal attack on you? That maybe, that’s just how she is? She can respect you and your authority as her supervisor and also want to get to know you a little bit. The two aren’t mutually exclusive!”<br/>Agatha tried to refute it, she racked her brain for something to say but she couldn’t find anything. The memory of Rio telling her that she spoke to all of her previous lecturers and professors in the same way that she spoke to her flickered through her mind and she hated that it was further proof that Lilia was right.<br/><br/>Lilia, knowing that Agatha had no way of proving her wrong, continued her questioning. “How does she address you?”<br/>Agatha didn’t want to answer, she knew that Lilia was just using anything that she could to drive her point home. “She addresses me as Professor Harkness, the same as everyone else. The way that she should.” She reluctantly said.<br/>“Exactly. She respects your title and I can’t see that stopping unless you give her a reason to, which it sounds like you have been doing. But also, would it be the end of the world if she felt comfortable enough around you to use your name if you gave her permission to? Would it erase any of that respect or control you’re so desperate for?” She gestured between the three of them. “We don’t use each other's titles and yet we all still respect each other.”<br/>“Barely.” It was Jen’s first contribution but it was perfectly timed and Agatha couldn’t help giving into the laughter that Lilia started.<br/><br/>The tension that she had been carrying throughout the whole meal started to fade as she gave into the humour of Jen’s comment. “Well thank you very much for helping me Lilia, you have actually opened my mind a little bit.”<br/>“Oh no, we’re not done.” Lilia said, still laughing.<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You can’t be serious?”<br/>“We’ve barely started, there’s still more that I want to unpack and I’m on a roll.” She shifted uncomfortably in her chair. “We are going to have to move this to the living room though, this chair is starting to fuck with my back.” She stood awkwardly and started limping towards an armchair. “Jen be a dear and fetch the glasses and a fresh bottle would you?”<br/>“You’ve got two hands.” Jen said in disbelief.<br/>Lilia put on a show of holding her back and turning her limp into a shuffle. “Yes but I’m an old woman.”<br/>Jen pointed in Agatha’s direction. “What about Agatha? She’s not carrying anything!”<br/>Agatha shrugged and started making her way to the sofa. “I’m the patient, I can’t be expected to do it.”<br/>Jen threw her hands up. “Ridiculous!” But she got a fresh bottle of wine and gathered up the glasses, bringing them into the living room despite her protests.<br/><br/>Lilia settled into her arm chair and Agatha sat on the sofa opposite her. She felt more at ease about the whole thing now but she was a bit apprehensive about what else Lilia could be interested in.<br/>Lilia had never outright asked any questions about Agatha’s childhood – or, more specifically, her mother – she hadn’t even tried to find out everything about Wanda, she just let Agatha tell her the details as and when she wanted, but Agatha knew that she was interested. It was in her nature to be interested in people's baggage and Agatha had at least four tightly packed suitcases worth, if not more.<br/><br/>Agatha was aware of the fact that Lilia was under no impression that her mind wandering earlier was solely about Rio, she had just been the catalyst for the twisting path that her brain had decided to take her down and Agatha was wary of the things that she might have to confront now that Lilia’s interest was piqued.<br/>She was notoriously a closed book, someone who kept everything locked away, safe from evil hands that might twist it and corrupt it and use it against her. Allowing someone access to that, letting them see it for all it was, letting them reach in and hold it was terrifying.<br/>She knew that she could trust Lilia but it didn’t make bringing her walls down any easier. They were there for a reason, they had a purpose and Lilia was wanting her to bring them down and grant her entry like it was the most simple thing in the world.<br/><br/>Agatha was still processing the revelation that Rio hadn’t actually been doing anything wrong and that she had been overreacting the whole time, she wasn’t sure that she was ready for round two just yet. Especially when she didn’t know what round two entailed.<br/>Jen filled all of their glasses back up and took a seat on the sofa next to Agatha. The three of them took a quiet sip of their wine and Agatha was trying very hard to not show that she was anxiously waiting for Lilia to pick up where they left off. </p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you this nervous before, Agatha.” Lilia finally said.<br/>Agatha took another drink, trying to appear nonchalant. “I’m not nervous, I’m just waiting for you to start again.” She heard Jen hum her disagreement next to her but kept her attention on Lilia. “Is this the part where you tell me to lie down and close my eyes so we can take a mind walk through my tumultuous childhood and unearth some deep repressed memories?”<br/>Lilia lifted one shoulder noncommittally. “We can do that if you want, though it was never my method of choice.”<br/>“Hmm, pass.”<br/><br/>Lilia set her glass down lightly on the end table to her right and Agatha did the same, making sure to get the round base of the glass perfectly central on the square coaster. In that moment she truly understood what Lilia had meant when she said that she didn’t want Agatha and Jen to be on edge and worried that their every move would be scrutinised, because that was exactly how she felt right now. She was second guessing everything she did and wondering if it was a sign of something that Lilia was tucking away to bring up later on.<br/><br/>Lilia crossed her legs and settled back into the chair. “We’ve spent some time on Rio so I want to move on from her for a bit.” Agatha felt a small amount of relief at that. “Let’s talk about your visits to the Dean a few weeks ago, walk me through that.”<br/>The relief instantly vanished.<br/>“We already talked about that and you reduced it down to me, what were your exact words?” Agatha made a show of pretending to think. “Oh yes, ‘needing to get laid.’” She curled her fingers in air-quotes.<br/><br/>Jen snorted quietly next to her which earned her an eye roll from Agatha and Lilia nodded. “I stand by it and I can tell that it hasn’t happened yet.”<br/>Agatha let an annoyed breath loose from her nose. “Well of course it hasn’t happened. You two are unfortunately the only people that I spend a significant amount of time with.” She gestured between Jen and Lilia. “So unless either of you wants to volunteer, then it doesn’t look likely.”<br/>Lilia laughed. “Thanks but you’re not my type. Jen might be down though.”<br/>“No thanks, I don’t shit where I eat.” Jen said whilst shaking her head.<br/><br/>Agatha sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. “I thought we were talking about the Dean.”<br/>Lilia spread her arms and shrugged. “I tried but you deflected.”<br/>“Well I’m un-deflecting, let’s get back to him.”<br/>Lilia laced her fingers together and rested her hands in her lap, her face neutral once again. “Okay, so what was happening to cause you to act in a way that got you pulled into his office so frequently?”<br/>Agatha adjusted herself on the settee, shuffling more into the corner, seeking comfort in the cushion that she pulled into her lap. “I don’t know. I guess I just had some repressed feelings to get out.” As she was speaking she stopped looking at Lilia and instead focussed on a stray piece of thread that was sticking out of the corner of the cushion.<br/><br/>Lilia didn’t do anything to try and shift Agatha’s focus, she just asked, “What kind of repressed feelings?”<br/>Agatha started twisting the thread between her thumb and index finger, watching it spin. “Just feelings, I don’t know.”<br/>“Right but feelings come from somewhere, they’re rooted in something. So what feelings were they?”<br/>Agatha sighed. “I don’t fucking know, Lilia. Frustration? Anger?” She started to pull at the loose thread. “Having to hold myself back.”<br/>She still wasn’t looking up but she heard Lilia shift in her chair, the fabric groaning softly against the wooden frame.<br/>“Why were you holding yourself back?”<br/>Agatha tugged at the thread again and it started to unravel from the seam. Shit. She looked up at Lilia again and saw that she had uncrossed her legs and was leaning forwards, resting her forearms on her legs with her hands still clasped. She looked to her left at Jen who was just slowly sipping her wine, listening intently.<br/><br/>Agatha dipped her head for a second but forced herself to look back at Lilia. “Because I… because…” She trailed off not being able to find her words and even if she could find them, she wouldn’t know how to phrase them.<br/>Lilia’s voice and face remained neutral and calm and Agatha had to admit that it was helping her feel safe. “Because of what?”<br/>She could lie, it would be so easy. She could blame her mother, it wasn’t like she was here to defend herself. Hell she could even say that it was because Billy had asked her to speak to Wanda again. It would fool Jen but Lilia would know, and with Lilia actively looking out for tells, it would only drag the whole thing out and make it worse.<br/>“Because of Rio.” Agatha eventually said.<br/><br/>Lilia raised her eyebrows slightly and leaned back again. “Why Rio?”<br/>Agatha returned her attention to the cushion and its slowly unravelling seam. “I thought you said we weren’t talking about her.”<br/>“We weren’t, but you brought her up again.”<br/>For fuck sake.<br/>Agatha picked at the seam some more, pulling more of the thread away from the cushion. “Okay fine, whatever. I was stopping myself from snapping at her and from rising to her attempts at pushing my buttons, so that annoyance had to go somewhere.” She lifted her gaze once more to give both Jen and Lilia a pointed look. “But none of what I said or did was invalid. Everyone deserved it.”<br/>Lilia smiled. “Oh, I’m sure.”<br/>“Yes I’m sure that poor barista deserved to be told that they were a disappointment to their parents.” Jen added.<br/>Agatha chuckled to herself. “Okay, maybe that one was worded a tad too harshly, but you didn’t see how slowly they were moving, and I was going to be late.”<br/>Jen sighed and shook her head.<br/><br/>Lilia reached for her glass and took a few sips, allowing the levity to sit for a moment before bringing Agatha back. “So the common theme that I’m seeing so far is your feelings towards Rio.”<br/>Agatha picked up her own glass and sipped it before responding. “I don’t have any feelings towards Rio, and she’s only the common theme because those are the things that you’re asking me about.” <br/>“I’m asking about those things because those are the ones that are relevant right now.” Lilia said, a little too curtly for Agatha’s liking.<br/>Agatha scoffed and quirked an eyebrow. “You’re the one that started this whole thing, Lilia. Don’t get snippy with me.”<br/>“I’m not getting snippy, you’re getting defensive.” The calmness that Agatha found comforting five minutes ago was now starting to get on her nerves.<br/>Agatha huffed and crossed her arms. “I’m not getting defensive.” She snapped.<br/><br/>Lilia didn’t speak, she simply moved her eyes down and nodded her head to where Agatha had tightly crossed her arms and then moved them over to Jen and raised her eyebrows. A silent question which Jen answered with a half smile and a nod.<br/>The inaudible exchange annoyed Agatha. They did this too often and it pissed her off. “Okay fuck you both and your ability to read each other’s minds. Just speak out loud like normal people.”<br/>Lilia took a deep breath and steadily exhaled it. “Why are you guarded right now? Which part of you are you protecting?”<br/>“I’m protecting whichever part of me you’re picking at right now.” Agatha said with a sneer.<br/>“I’m not picking at you, you’ve got your back up about something and I’m trying to help you figure out what that is.” Lilia smiled sweetly which only made Agatha prickle more.<br/>“I’ve got my back up because you’re trying to find connections where there aren’t any. But if you’re so wise and all-knowing, why don’t you just tell me what it is?”<br/>“Because it’s important that you work it out for yourself.”<br/><br/>Having not been able to get a rise from Lilia, Agatha turned on Jen again. “I assume that look was her asking you if you’ve figured it out?” Jen looked at Lilia. “What do you need her fucking permission to speak now or something? Did she cast a spell on you to make you silent?”<br/>“Agatha Harkness!”<br/>Lilia’s raised voice and clipped tone instantly got her attention and she could feel the burning sensation start to rise in her cheeks. “I will not tolerate you attacking Jen. This isn’t about us, this is about you not being able to confront your own feelings and using that as a reason to lash out at the nearest person.”<br/>Agatha was startled by the way that Lilia was speaking to her. She had never seen this side of Lilia before and she definitely didn’t like it. She could feel the redness blooming on her face and making its way into her ears but she couldn’t speak due to her shock. All she could do was sit there with her mouth hanging open looking at Lilia and feeling like a little kid enduring one of her mothers many tirades.<br/><br/>Lilia’s eyes were sharp and held Agatha’s in a vice grip. “Rio is the common denominator in your behaviour of late because you like her.” All sense of calm had now left Lilia’s demeanour and frustration had taken over in its wake. She was no longer gently guiding Agatha through this and instead, was shoving her head first into a confrontation with herself that was long overdue.<br/>But Agatha, true to form, dug her heels in. “I do not like Rio. How old are we, twelve?”<br/>The accusation was completely without merit. A suggestion that should never have been given life. Sure Rio would have been her type twenty five years ago, but that was twenty five years ago. She wasn’t the same person she was when she was in her teens – something Jen and Lilia should be very grateful for.<br/><br/>Jen threw her hands up, breaking Agatha out of the hold of Lilia’s gaze. “You like her, you’re attracted to her, you have a crush on her. It doesn’t matter how you phrase it, the meaning remains the same.” She turned to face Agatha fully. “You’re just too afraid of getting hurt to see what’s right in front of you. Rio gets under your skin the way that she does because you like her, and that’s okay.”<br/>Agatha drained the rest of her glass and placed it back on the coaster, once again making sure it was perfectly centred. She could feel Lilia’s eyes on her, watching her adjust the glass until she was happy with the alignment. “I suppose you’re going to say that me doing this is a sign of sexual frustration or whatever Freudian bullshit is your go to.”<br/>“Actually,” Lilia began, the edge to her voice dulling, “I was going to say that you don’t have to feel out of control right now. Lining up the glass like that speaks more to your need to have a tight grip on your surroundings when you don’t feel like you’re in charge of your emotions. You’ve been denying this for so long and trying to push it down that it’s been manifesting in different ways.” She leaned back in the arm chair, adopting a more relaxed posture after sitting in the tension that had just taken over the room. “I do agree that you’re sexually frustrated though, you should really do something about that.” She smirked.<br/><br/>Agatha rolled her eyes and began absentmindedly messing with the seam on the cushion again. They were both being ridiculous and were way off base. Rio was no longer the type of woman that she was attracted to, she liked more mature women – not necessarily older women, but women who conducted themselves in a more grown-up way. Rio didn’t take things seriously enough, everything was either a joke or some sort of game to her and that was something that Agatha did not enjoy in the slightest.<br/>If she was forced to, at gunpoint, then she could maybe admit that Rio was attractive. Only in the conventional sense, it didn’t mean that Agatha found her attractive. They were two very different things. She wasn’t in denial about anything, they were just simply wrong.<br/><br/>The seam on the cushion had fully come undone now and she was gently rolling some of the stuffing into a ball in her palm. The texture of it was somehow soft and wiry at the same time, the kind of fibres that felt like they should make a creaking sound when rubbed together, but she couldn’t hear anything.<br/><br/>Agatha sighed. “I’m not denying anything, you’re just incorrect.” She didn’t look up, but she heard Jen’s gasp and could feel Lilia’s eyes going wide as she took in the words.<br/>“The fact that you couldn’t look at me while you said that implies that you know how wrong that statement is.” Lilia said. “But it’s clear that we’re not gonna get any further tonight so I shan’t rise to it.”<br/>Agatha finally looked up and regarded Lilia with a cautious look. “Great, so does that mean that this topic is dropped and we never have to speak of it again?”<br/>Lilia pursed her lips as she considered the question. “Sure. For now. But you’re going to have to confront this at some point, Agatha. It isn’t healthy to continue on like this.” She raised an eyebrow and pointed at the cushion that Agatha had basically destroyed. “I want that mending as well.”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes and put the cushion back in its spot on the settee. “I’ll buy you a new one.”<br/>“I don’t want a new one. I want you to fix that one.”<br/>Agatha made a noise of malcontent and said, “fine,” through gritted teeth.<br/><br/>She sat up properly and turned to Jen, giving her an apologetic look. “I’m sorry for what I said and how I said it earlier.”<br/>Jen smiled. “You don’t need to apologise. I’m not saying that I like being your target, but it’s better that it’s me rather than some poor, unsuspecting shop worker or student.”<br/>Agatha dipped her head slightly in embarrassment before coming back up to meet Jen’s eyes. “I appreciate that, but I’m doing it anyway.”<br/>“I accept.” </p><p align="center" dir="ltr">__________</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha got home around an hour later, her mind was swimming. Of course that could partially be due to the wine – she really should stop driving to these Saturday night get-togethers. She was rooting through her drawers for a t-shirt to sleep in and was stopped in her tracks. Buried right at the bottom of a pile, pushed so far into the back corner was an old, crumpled, white shirt. The design was so faded that it was barely visible but she recognised it instantly. She pulled it out and laid it on her bed, staring at it.<br/><br/>It was an Oasis shirt from a decades old tour, insignificant in the fact that it was one of many old pieces of band merch that she had collected over the years, wholly significant in the fact that it wasn’t hers. She had never been a fan of Oasis, if one of their songs came on while she just had a playlist going in the background as she was doing something then she wouldn’t turn it off, but she didn’t actively seek them out. Wanda, however, was a very big fan of their music. The shirt was hers. A relic both in age and meaning.<br/><br/>The first time that she had slept at Wanda’s house she had spilled something on the shirt that she had brought to sleep in and Wanda had given her the Oasis one as a replacement. She had taken it home with her after that weekend and kept it the whole time they were together. Wanda often teased her about wanting it back because she wanted to sell it, but she never made any attempt to actually get it back, letting Agatha continue to use the shirt as a pyjama top.<br/><br/>Agatha sat on the edge of her bed next to the shirt. Looking at it now nearly two years after their break -up, she didn’t know how to feel. There was nostalgia attached to it, memories of a better time when she was happy. Memories of living with Wanda and Billy and being the family unit that she never got to experience growing up. Memories of when Wanda made her feel like the most special person in the world. But those memories were tinged with sadness and anger and hatred.<br/>They were blurred by the image of Agatha walking into the bedroom, her bedroom, to see Wanda and Vision tangled in the sheets. The edges of the polaroids that she had turned those memories into were charred from when she had tried to erase them, tried to forget about those four years and put them behind her.<br/><br/>When she had hurriedly packed her suitcase that one afternoon she must have accidentally grabbed the shirt along with her other clothes. It was entirely possible that, since she’d had it for so long and worn it so often, she had forgotten that it wasn’t actually hers and had picked it up out of habit. Either way it had been a mistake and the shirt had ended up being accidentally shoved into the back of her drawer and hidden away.<br/>Until now when the universe decided that it wanted to fuck with her.<br/><br/>She ran her fingers over the fabric and gently traced the faded logo that was printed on it.<br/>“Why now?” She asked to her empty bedroom. There was no answer of course, she would have questioned her sanity if she had heard one. Still, that didn’t stop her from wanting one, needing one.<br/>Every part of Wanda had been erased from her life, save for the ones that she couldn’t actually shift like their jobs and Billy. Now this.<br/>She should throw it away, burn it, just get fucking rid of it. But she stayed sitting next to it just staring at it, completely at a loss for what to do. She could give it to Billy, he had a collection of ‘vintage’ band shirts, or at least he used to – the fact that Oasis were nowhere near old enough to be considered vintage aside – it could be a two-birds-one-stone situation. She’d be able to get rid of the shirt and when Wanda saw him with it, it would fuck with her.<br/><br/>Agatha let herself indulge in the moment of schadenfreude that the thought provided. Knowing that Wanda would recognise the shirt instantly and would also have to hear Billy tell her that he got it from Agatha made her smile darkly.<br/>But she couldn't do it. She couldn't use Billy like that, that was something Wanda would do and she would not, under any circumstances, act the way that Wanda acted. Even if giving Billy the shirt was purely because she knew that he would like it, there would still be some part of it that was about getting to Wanda. She wasn't going to do that to him.<br/><br/>She folded the shirt up and put it on top of her dresser to decide what to do with it at a later date, and pulled a different shirt from her drawer to sleep in. She crawled into bed and pulled her quilt up so that it rested under her chin and let out a long, heavy sigh. Agatha wasn’t a spiritual person, she didn’t believe in fate or destiny but she couldn’t help feeling like finding that shirt now carried some meaning. Finding something that belonged to her ex-fiancée the same night that her friends had unceremoniously shoved her into the realisation that she might like someone else couldn’t just be a coincidence could it?<br/><br/>As she laid there with her eyes open, knowing that sleep wasn’t going to come any time soon, she couldn’t stop her thoughts from wandering through the twisted path that was Rio Vidal.<br/>She couldn’t recall all of their interactions in perfect order but there were ones that stood out more than others.<br/><br/>There was their first official meeting, the one that Rio had shown up to ten minutes late sporting an obvious hangover. Agatha had admired Rio’s confidence in still coming in to face her, despite the potential embarrassment and possible chastisement, but of course Agatha had let her off with a warning. A courtesy rarely awarded to anyone, but that was only because of the way that she had acted previously, it wouldn't have been fair to reprimand Rio. Then again, she never usually cared about what was ‘fair’. If a student acted out of line, they acted out of line and were treated accordingly.<br/>But she was allowed to offer politeness to people when she thought they needed it. Rio was deeply apologetic and clearly embarrassed by the situation so reprimanding her wouldn’t have served any purpose.<br/><br/>There was the day that Rio had decided to start bringing Agatha a coffee for their meetings. No other student had done this, it was probable that no other student had had the confidence to do this, but Rio had. Rio had taken the time to actually find out what her order was and bring it to her. Of course she’d had to play a joke first by offering her that horrid iced coffee before swapping the cups and looking entirely too happy with the reaction that Agatha had given her, but she had still gone out of her way to find out what Agatha ordered and made it part of her routine going forwards.<br/><br/>The time that they’d had an argument about Agatha not wanting to tell Rio the age she was when she first read The Odyssey flashed through Agatha’s brain. Rio had so casually thrown Wanda out as a threat as if she had known that it would make Agatha back down, and it had.<br/>Lilia had helped her realise that she had overreacted and she had to admit that she regretted it. She shouldn’t have flown off the handle the way that she did, it didn’t achieve anything, it only made Rio double down and made the whole situation worse than it needed to be.<br/><br/>But none of this equated to liking her. Using the word like in that context made Agatha’s skin itch. It was immature, juvenile. She was forty two for christ sake, she didn’t like people, it was a very high school way of phrasing things. Even when she was in high school she hadn’t used that phrase, she hadn’t cared enough about the girls that she slept with to get to a point of liking them. She only needed them to be around long enough to piss off her mother and step father.<br/>An argument could be made in favour of her liking Wanda, but Agatha preferred saying things like, ‘I find her attractive’, or, ‘I’m drawn to her personality’. It was more mature and more articulate. It was just better.<br/><br/>The memory of her dream about Rio came careening into her skull and it made her cringe. She thanked every deity imaginable that she hadn’t brought it up earlier that evening, Lilia would never have let her hear the end of it.<br/>She maintained that it didn’t mean anything, that dreams weren’t a representation of your wants or desires. It could have been anybody in that dream, the fact that it was Rio was completely irrelevant; she just happened to be the face that Agatha’s subconscious had randomly picked.<br/><br/>Agatha was officially done with this spiral that she had sent herself on, so she rolled onto her side and tried to go to sleep. She shut her eyes and focussed only on the dark expanse that the back of her eyelids created. She tried to quiet her brain by using an old technique of reciting the phonetic alphabet in time with her breathing, but by the time she had gone through it for the third time, she decided to give it up as a bad job. Her mind wasn’t going to let her sleep.<br/>Why did Lilia have to choose now to remind her how good she was at her job?</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">__________ </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha woke up the following morning very aware of the fact that she hadn't had enough sleep at all. She wanted so badly to go back to sleep and get the rest that she needed. It was a Sunday after all and she had nothing to do, but she forced herself to keep her eyes open and roll out of bed. She drowsily brushed her teeth, noticing the dark circles under her eyes straight away, and did her morning skincare routine. She wasn’t convinced that it even did anything but it was more out of habit than actually expecting results at this point.<br/><br/>She changed into her usual Sunday attire – her old Yale hoodie and a pair of navy sweatpants – and padded downstairs to get some breakfast. Treating herself to a truly lazy Sunday she opted for just a bowl of cereal and glass of orange juice, too tired to even bother making a cup of coffee, and curled up on the sofa. She was part way through a Gossip Girl rewatch, a guilty pleasure that she actually felt no guilt towards in the slightest, so she picked up where she left off as she munched on her cereal.<br/><br/>When she had finished her bowl she retrieved her sewing kit from the spare room and picked up Lilia’s cushion that she had all but destroyed the previous night. She considered taking the easy option and just doing a running stitch along the seam, but it wouldn't match the other seams and she could already feel Lilia’s disappointment at her even thinking about phoning it in. She would have to suck it up and do a ladder stitch. It wasn’t that she couldn’t do a ladder stitch, it was that they were annoying and she often had to restart them at least three times to get it right.<br/><br/>She finished the seam and admired her work. There were no loose pieces of thread hanging out, which had been the reason the cushion had come undone in the first place. If that hadn’t been there, then she wouldn’t have been messing with it and she wouldn’t have had to fix the shoddy sewing work. Technically speaking, the cushion coming undone hadn’t fully been her fault and she would only accept partial blame for it.<br/><br/>She attempted to zone out and only have her attention on the TV, following Chuck and Blair’s numerous antics and trying not to see Joe Goldberg instead of Dan Humphrey every time Penn Badgley was on screen. But her mind couldn’t stay still. It kept wandering off in different directions that ultimately led to the same destination. She was beginning to wonder if she’d ever be able to stop thinking about Rio.<br/>Maybe Lilia and Jen were right…<br/><br/>Agatha had caught herself staring at Rio more times than she wanted to think about. She never intended on doing it, it just sort of happened. Her eyes would subconsciously drift in whichever direction Rio was from her and then they would stay there until Rio caught her, or she caught herself, and she’d have to make up some thinly veiled excuse for why her attention had been focussed on her for so long.<br/><br/>Using ‘I find her intriguing’ as a way to explain it away to herself could only work for so long before she had to admit what was really going on. Despite her detestation of the word, she had to use it. She liked Rio.<br/>She’d liked Rio since she’d first seen her in the crowd of first year students that had attended her first lecture of the year, since she’d called her out on being wrong about the origin of Heracles’ name.<br/><br/>“Which part of you are you protecting?”<br/>Lilia’s question repeated in her head. Which part of herself was she protecting? Her heart was the obvious answer but it was more than that. There was some part of her that was holding back, it had stopped her from realising that she had feelings for Wanda for nearly a year before Jen and Lilia had basically held an intervention for her to make her see it… She was beginning to sense a pattern.<br/>But that apprehension had turned out to be correct. Wanda had cheated on her two times, she had said yes to marrying her, worn the ring that Agatha had bought and still slept with someone else for a third time. Who was to say that this time would be any different? </p><p align="center" dir="ltr">__________</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was finishing up her Monday morning lecture and Rio hadn’t attended. After their last conversation Agatha hadn’t expected her to, but part of her had stupidly still hoped that she would have.<br/>Billy gave her a smile as he walked past her towards the door and she asked him to wait behind. When everyone had left she said, “I was wondering if you’d like to come round for dinner at some point this week.”<br/>“Yeah, for sure. What day did you have in mind?” He replied, an excited smile making his eyes shine.<br/>“Whichever day works for you. You can bring Alice as well if you want.”<br/>“Oh, amazing.” He looked towards the door where she assumed Alice would be waiting on the other side. “I’ll ask her and text you later?”<br/>Agatha ruffled his hair. “Sounds good kid.”<br/><br/>She waited for Billy to leave, giving herself five minutes before following him out, nipping back to her office to pick up the cushion, and walking across campus to Lilia’s office. She knocked on the door and walked in upon Lilia’s approval, holding the cushion up and waving it a little before putting it on one of the chairs.<br/>Lilia smiled and stood up from her desk, making her way over to Agatha and picking up the cushion to inspect it. “This is a lot neater than I was expecting, Harkness. I’m impressed.”<br/>Agatha scoffed. “I am offended that you thought my sewing skills would be anything less than excellent.”<br/>Lilia chuckled. “Well I know your kind are known for their nimble fingers, but this is precision work. Some people just don’t have the talent.”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn't deign to respond to her friend's silly comment.<br/><br/>She stayed standing in Lilia’s office, wanting to say something else but struggling to find the words. Thankfully Lilia picked up on her awkward demeanour. “Was there something else you came to me for, Agatha?”<br/>Agatha swapped her weight from one foot to the other before steeling herself and forcing the words to come out of her mouth. “Yes actually.” She paused to clear her throat. “I realised yesterday that you might have a point… about Rio.”<br/>Lilia laughed and sat in the chair. “Obviously.” She gestured to the chair opposite her. “Sit. I have half an hour.”<br/>Agatha gave the chair an apprehensive look. “Thanks, but I don’t need another session. I’m not in denial anymore.”<br/>“This isn’t a session, it’s two friends having a chat.”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes but sat down anyway. “Nothing is gonna come of it, so I don’t know why you’re so invested.”<br/>Lilia lifted an eyebrow. “Why do you think nothing is going to come of it?”<br/><br/>Agatha thought about it for a moment. Were there any actual reasons that she could give, or was this just self sabotage?<br/>The age gap was a glaringly obvious one. There were twelve years between them and thinking about it like that made her feel uneasy.<br/>“Because she’s a student. She’s my student. Also, she might not be single.”<br/>Lilia nodded her head in understanding. “Fair points, but you don’t know that she isn’t single.”<br/>Agatha made a sound of dismissal. “Please, a woman like Rio? I would put money on the fact that all the twenty-something-year-old queer girls on this campus are falling over themselves to chase after her.”<br/>“Careful Harkness. You’re sounding a little jealous.” Lilia said with a smirk.<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Piss off. Even if she is single, she’s still a student so I would never pursue anything with her anyway.”<br/>“A PhD student.” Lilia corrected. “She’s not a teenager. And it’s not illegal, just…” She waved her hand through the air while she was trying to find the right phrasing. “Morally grey.”<br/><br/>Agatha shook her head. Morally grey was one way to put it for sure. “It’s also fucking embarrassing.” She ran her hand through her hair. “I’m forty two years old with a… crush ,” she made a face like the word left a bad taste in her mouth, “on a thirty year old who also just happens to be one of my students.” <br/>Lilia leaned forwards, resting her elbows on her legs and sitting her chin on her clasped hands. “It’s okay to embarrass yourself a little in the pursuit of human connection.”<br/>She said it like it was the easiest thing in the world, like it wouldn’t get Agatha fired if Rio reported her for unwanted advances or sexual harassment.<br/>Then again Rio hadn’t reported her for anything thus far so maybe she wouldn’t. Maybe she liked Agatha as well, maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to at least try. But of course Agatha had already fucked up any chance of it happening by acting like a prize idiot in treating Rio like shit and cutting off their meetings. Even if she wanted to, she had no way of progressing with this now. She had ruined it like usual.<br/><br/>Agatha sighed. “That may be so, but I’m pretty sure I’ve made her hate me by now.”<br/>Lilia gave a kind smile. “You never know unless you try.”<br/>If only it were that easy. “And how do I do that?”<br/>“You’ve got to figure that one out for yourself, I can’t do everything for you.”<br/>Agatha hated it when Lilia was right, but she couldn’t fight her, she knew that she had to do this by herself.</p>

<span>If someone had told Wanda that at forty-two she would be a divorced mother to an eighteen-year-old, who spent most of her time sleeping with someone who was twelve years younger than she was, she would have laughed in their face and told them that they needed to seek help. Yet here she was in the early hours of Monday morning, coming down from her fourth orgasm in a row, feeling the tears induced by overstimulation roll down her cheeks as she ignored texts from both her son and ex-husband in favour of the thirty-year-old that was currently between her legs.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She collapsed back against her pillows breathless and numb, the noise of her phone buzzing on her nightstand barely making its way through the post-orgasm haze that she was currently in. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You should probably check that, it’s been going off for a few minutes now.” Rio said as she stood up off of the bed. “It almost put me off my game.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda breathed out as much of a laugh as she could manage before saying, “well I’m glad it didn’t, that was some of your best work.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio laughed softly and finished getting dressed, making her way out of Wanda’s bedroom. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda propped herself up on her elbows and shouted after her. “What, no goodbye kiss?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She didn’t need to see Rio to know that she was laughing and shaking her head. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She listened for the soft click of her front door opening and closing, letting her know that Rio had left. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She leaned back again, this time shifting herself so that she was leaning against the headboard. She found herself craving a cigarette, there really wasn’t anything that matched the feeling of a cigarette after sex, but she hadn’t smoked in years and there were none in her house. She would definitely have to remember to buy a packet for next time.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She sighed at the lack of nicotine and picked up her phone, there were six messages. Five from her ex-husband and one from Billy. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Vision: Happy birthday mother of my child!</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>The message was followed by three gifs all portraying various different ways to say happy birthday. One was a cake with a sparkler candle, the second one was a tortoise in a party hat and the final one was a cartoon of a pea that had a smiling face and sticks for arms and legs that said “Hap-PEA Birthday!”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Vision: I didn’t get chance to post your card so I’ll swing by your office in the afternoon to give it to you </b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>She tapped out a quick reply.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Wanda: Thank you! I’m free between two and three </b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Vision: Roger that! 🫡</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>She smiled and opened Billy’s message.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Billy: Happy birthday!</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Wanda: Thank you darling 😊</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>Billy didn’t reply further so she took that as her cue to get ready for bed. Her legs complained as she tried to stand up, though she was thankful that it was a reminder of how tightly they were clenched around Rio’s head rather than a reminder that she was another year older, but she managed to get to the bathroom and back without them giving out and crawled into bed again.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Her Monday morning lecture wasn’t until ten so she would usually get to campus around nine, but given that it was her birthday she knew that the Head of Department would put on a pseudo party in the staff room under the guise of an emergency meeting. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Sure enough when she woke up and checked her phone there was a message on Teams.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Dottie Jones: Meeting in the staff room at 8am sharp. Everyone must attend.</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>Wanda smiled, everyone knew that she did this for people’s birthdays but she clearly enjoyed it so no-one said anything against it. It was also just a kind gesture since she bought some decorations, a cake, candles and a few snacks out of her own pocket for every staff member in the Ancient History department who had a birthday during term time.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda showered, got ready for the day and set off to the campus, making sure to swing by the petrol station first to pick up a packet of Benson and Hedges to enjoy post coitus – and at fifteen Great British Pounds per pack, she would make fucking sure that she enjoyed them. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When she had quit smoking nearly a decade ago it had mainly been because the prices had risen too much and she couldn’t justify paying that much every time she bought a new packet. Oh how she wished for those prices again. Fifteen pounds was an absolute joke. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She put the cigarettes in her bag and walked into the Ancient History building, heading straight for the staff room. She opened the door and was greeted with a cheer of “happy birthday!” and a few party poppers going off, covering her in streams of brightly coloured tissue paper. Though she knew it was happening, the smile that she wore was genuine as she looked around the room and saw the happy birthday banner on the wall with a foil balloon held down by a weight floating next to it. On one of the tables in the centre of the room there was a cake with a pile of cards in envelopes and a few gift bags sitting next to it.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Every lecturer in the department was there, except for Agatha but that was a given, and they all gathered around her as she was ushered towards the cake for the candles to be lit and Happy Birthday to be sung. They all clapped when she blew out the candles and she started opening the cards. A few of them had some money in them and there was one that had an obnoxiously large badge that was pink, sparkly and read ‘birthday girl’ in all caps that she was instructed to wear for the entire day. She tried to put up some resistance but folded pretty quickly and pinned it to her cardigan.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The cake was cut and split between everyone and people started to slowly filter out to go teach their lectures and do whatever work they needed to do, leaving Wanda, Dottie and a couple of stragglers who were making the most of the free snacks. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Dottie turned to Wanda. “I’m sorry it wasn’t much, but I hope you liked it.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda smiled. “Dottie, it’s lovely that you even thought about it. We all appreciate that you do this for us.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Dottie returned her smile. “It’s just a shame that not everyone joins in.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda knew who she was talking about, she was referencing Agatha’s lack of attendance. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha hadn’t gone to a single one of the birthday gatherings since they had broken up and Wanda didn’t blame her. The staff had treated Agatha pretty harshly when Wanda had told them the lie that Agatha had cheated on her, a lot of them judged her from afar and conveyed their dislike of her through their facial expressions and body language, but a few of them had had the courage to actually talk to her about it. They had  asked questions, asked how and why she could have possibly done that to Wanda and told her that she was a terrible person for hurting Wanda like that. Agatha had ignored them and done nothing to defend herself or try and set the story straight. She had just let them believe the lies that Wanda had told them and it had confused Wanda but she was also grateful that Agatha hadn’t pushed back because she didn’t know how she would have handled it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda had gotten everyone on her side so easily, and at first she liked it. People were being extra nice to her, checking on her and making sure that she was never alone with Agatha. They were offering to take a couple of her lectures if she needed some time to herself and offering to have her and Billy round for dinner so that they weren’t alone in the house too much. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She took on the gestures and accepted them all because, while the story they all knew wasn’t true, she was still hurting. She was still going through a break-up and was trying to soothe Billy through it as well.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Billy had been the reason why she had lied. Wanda had loved Agatha, she really had, but it went beyond that for Billy. She realised not long after she had first introduced them that Billy had formed an attachment to Agatha, a bond that connected them more than he was connected to her, his mother, and she had been jealous. Billy went to Agatha with everything, she was his best friend, his favourite person on the planet, his support system.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>After he had come out to the two of them Agatha had later told her that he had actually come out to her first and that she had convinced him to come out to them together so that Wanda’s feelings weren't hurt. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She had seen the break-up as a chance to claim back some of the love that he had supplied Agatha with in the four years that they had been together, a chance to show him that she could be everything he saw Agatha as and more. So when she had lied to him, she’d had to lie to everyone else as well. She had to keep the ruse up so that she could keep Billy. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda had been scared that if he had known the truth straight away he would have followed Agatha out of the door and never gone back. He would have chosen Agatha over her and the thought of it tore her heart in two. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Two and a half years on though, she regretted it. Agatha was always able to take hits and let them roll off her like they were nothing, but after being with her for four years Wanda was able to tell when the jabs had hit their mark. The subtle twitch in her eye, the small beat as she composed herself before responding, the slight downturn in the corners of her mouth. Wanda had seen all of these in every interaction Agatha had had with their colleagues following the split. Wanda was safely cocooned in the web that she had spun and she had left Agatha to fend for herself against the elements.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The fallout had died down and people had moved on from making their remarks but the damage had been done, and any relationships that Agatha had with the other staff members in their department had been destroyed. The window where Wanda could have made things right had long since closed, and she was left looking through it, watching Agatha exist on the outside, forever tarred with the brush that Wanda had painted her with. And now that Billy actually knew the truth, knew that it had been Wanda that had cheated on Agatha and she had manipulated everyone including him, their relationship had been strained. She hadn’t told him why she had lied, but just knowing that she had was enough to make him distance himself and she knew that there was no way that she could fix it.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda moved her gaze away from Dottie's eyes when she replied. “You can’t really blame her though. She never fully recovered from the way that she was treated.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Yeah, I suppose.” Dottie put a reassuring hand on Wanda’s shoulder. “Well anyway, happy birthday. I have to actually go do some work now so I’ll see you later!” Dottie gave her shoulder a squeeze before leaving. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda stayed for another few minutes, gathering up the cards and gifts to take to her office and prepare for her lectures. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Around half past two there was a knock at Wanda’s office door and Vision walked in with a big grin on his face. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Happy birthday!” He sang as he handed her the card he had gotten her. She opened it and affectionately rolled her eyes as she read the front of it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The card read ‘Happy Birthday To My Favourite Ex’ and he had added ‘wife’ to the end of it. “Thank you for clarifying that I’m your favourite ex wife and not just your favourite ex.” She said with a chuckle and she moved to hug him. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He reciprocated the hug and said, “Well I can’t have you being confused, my favourite ex is someone else and she’ll be very annoyed if I mix you up.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh I bet she will.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He laughed and pulled back to give her a kiss on the cheek.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Despite not being able to make their marriage work they were still affectionate with each other, which was the reason why they had continued to sleep together after their divorce. They still cared deeply for each other; they just weren’t in love with each other and that was okay. It was less okay when they had slept together while Wanda was in a relationship but that wasn’t something that they had ever actually talked about. Now though, Wanda had some information that she hadn’t previously known and she had to ask him about it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Did-” She sighed and took a step back. “Did you tell Agatha that we… that </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>cheated on her more than once?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>His smile dropped slightly and he put his hands in his jacket pockets. “Yes I did.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Why?” Her tone wasn’t accusatory, she genuinely wanted to know.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Because I thought that she had a right to know. If she found out some other way further down the line then it would only hurt her more and I’d caused her enough pain already. I didn’t want it to come back at a later date and re-open the wound.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She couldn’t fault him for it, he was a sweet soul and a genuinely good guy. She didn’t say anything, just nodded and looked at the floor. This was the first time that they’d come close to discussing this topic and it was clear that neither of them knew how to broach it. How is that conversation meant to go? </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Vision shifted his weight from one foot to the other in the awkward silence that had taken over the room. “Has Billy wished you a happy birthday yet?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda looked back up at him. “He texted me this morning but I haven't seen him yet. He doesn’t like interacting with me when we’re on campus in case someone figures out that I’m his mum.” She gave a soft chuckle. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Ahh yes, he can’t have you ruining his… do they still call it street cred?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda snorted. “Not for a couple of decades at least.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He laughed and pulled her into another hug, resting his chin on the top of her head as he spoke. “I have to get back to work, enjoy the rest of your day.” He left her office, saying a final happy birthday before he shut the door.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span> About ten minutes passed before there was another knock at her door. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Come in.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The door opened slowly and Billy gingerly popped his head around it. Wanda smiled because she knew that he was checking that the coast was clear. “Hi sweetheart. You’re safe, don’t worry.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He stepped fully into the room and shut the door softly behind him before looking around. He hadn’t been in her office before so this was new to him. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“It’s like a more professional version of your home office.” He said, voicing his thoughts. “Less pictures of me.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda laughed and picked up the frame on her desk, turning it so that he could see the picture. It was of her and Vision with a seven-year-old Billy between them, standing in front of the Lands End signpost from a holiday they went on in Cornwall. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He took the picture from her to get a closer look. “Was this the holiday when we saw the dolphins?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“It was yeah.” She smiled at the memory. “It was also the one where your dad took you out on that speedboat  and you screamed so loudly that you lost your voice.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Billy laughed. “Yeah because he nearly flipped the boat! You would have screamed too if you were on it.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He gave the frame back to her and she put it on her desk again, making sure that it was facing towards her and not out into the room.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You don’t have to do that if you don’t want to. You can have it where people will see it.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda dipped her brows in confusion. “I thought you didn’t want people to know that we’re related.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Billy shrugged. “I’m kinda over it now. People are gonna find out at some point and I suppose there are worse people to be related to.” He flashed a cheeky grin. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She smiled and shook her head. “Are you being nice to me because it’s my birthday?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Maybe.” He drew out the word and reached into his bag. “Speaking of which, happy birthday!”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He pulled out a card and a small box from his bag and gave them to her. She opened the card first. On the front it said ‘Mum, you’re one in a melon’ with a picture of a watermelon drawn with eyes and a smile, and on the inside the melon was chopped into segments and it said ‘I love you to pieces!’ </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She smiled and stood the card up on her desk before picking up the box and unwrapping it. It was a square velvet covered box with a hinged lid. She flipped it up and she gasped lightly when she saw the necklace inside it. It was a gold chain with a red W charm and blue B charm attached to it.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She took the necklace out of the box and laid the charms in her palm so she could get a better look at them. “Billy, this is…” She trailed off, not being able to find the words. It had been nearly a year since she had told him why Agatha had really left that day, nearly a year of him distancing himself from her, nearly a year of their relationship being strained. She hadn’t expected him to buy her a present, she wasn’t even expecting a card. Hell she would have been fine with him leaving it at the text he sent that morning. But he had bought her a card, he had bought her a present and he had gone to her office to give them to her. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She could feel tears starting to gather at the corners of her eyes and she had to blink them away. “Thank you darling, I love it.” She stood up and walked round her desk to give him a hug, but she hesitated before wrapping her arms around him, unsure if he would want her to do it while they were on campus. They might have been in her office but someone could still walk in.  </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Mum you can hug me, it’s okay.” Billy said as he pulled her in, giving her a gentle squeeze. “I’m busy this week because me and Alice want to get a head start on our coursework for the semester, so if you’re good to wait until Saturday we can do something for your birthday then.” He pulled back from the hug. “Maybe go out for a meal with dad?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda smiled and nodded. “Yeah we can do that. I’ll text him and see if he’s free and then let you know if he’ll be there or not.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He returned her smile. “Sounds good. I’ve gotta go or I’m gonna be late for my lecture.” Before opening the door he said, “happy birthday, I’ll see you on Saturday!” and then he left. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Having this moment with her son gave her hope that maybe he was ready to start forgiving her, maybe he didn’t hate her as much as he did eleven months ago. Her attention went back to the picture on her desk and she picked it up again to look at it before putting it back down, making sure that it was facing into the room.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The rest of the week crawled by. Wanda had Rio go to her house again on Tuesday night, she had left a couple of birthday cards and the foil balloon strategically placed in the hall in the hopes that Rio would notice them and give more attention to the birthday girl – not that Rio wasn’t already forthcoming with the attention that she gave Wanda, but there was always room for improvement – and it worked beautifully. She came three times before they even made it upstairs and lost count when they eventually got to her bedroom. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She definitely enjoyed her cigarette afterwards.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Vision let her know that he was able to go for dinner with her and Billy on Saturday evening and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday were spent marking the essays that her first and second years had turned in, which was something that Wanda hated. She liked reading the work but there were only so many times that she could read essays answering the same question before she started to feel her brain turning to mush. She had been entertaining the idea of having one of her students be an unofficial TA for a while. It would help lighten the load a bit and would mean that she didn’t have to read the same thing over and over again.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>There was a time when she and Agatha would have traded their coursework and marked each others for a bit to stop it from getting stale, but that time had passed so she was back to doing it alone.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>By the time that Saturday came around Wanda was ready to have an evening out with her son and his dad. She treated herself to a morning in bed reading her book before begrudgingly leaving the cozy nest that she had made to sort herself some lunch. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She had just sat down to start eating when she heard a key turn in the door followed by boots on the hardwood floor. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Mum are you in?” Billy’s voice floated down the hall.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I’m in here sweetheart.” She replied from the living room. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>After a minute, Billy appeared in the living room holding two comically large bags filled with clothes. “Did you walk all the way here with those? I would have picked you up.” She said as she stood up off the sofa to take the bags into the kitchen. “Jesus Billy, is this all the stuff you moved in with?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He moved to help her put the clothes in the washing machine. “Not everything. Just jeans, hoodies and bedding mostly.” He took the clothes off of her and told her that she could sit down and that didn’t have to help him. She tried to continue helping anyway but he said, “mum, I’m eighteen. If I can’t use a washer by myself at this point then there’s no hope for me.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She couldn’t argue with that so she went to sit back down and continue eating her lunch. “Do you want any food making?” She asked.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“No thank you, I’m saving myself for tonight. That edamame isn’t going to eat itself!” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She could hear the smile in his voice, that kid really did love his edamame. “You might want to throw that hoodie you’re wearing in as well, the smell of it is starting to spread.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She heard him mutter, “rude,” but heard him unzipping it and stuffing it in the machine anyway. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>A few minutes passed before Billy wandered back into the living room and sat next to her on the settee, swinging his legs up to rest his feet on the coffee table. She turned her head in his direction and raised an eyebrow. “Billy Maximoff, I didn’t raise you to do that.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He tucked his hands behind his head as he relaxed back into the sofa. “No but my dad did.” He said with a cheeky grin. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She snorted softly but kept her gaze on him until he took his feet off of the table and shifted so that they were crossed on the sofa. “I guess I won’t get comfortable in my own home then, damn.” He said sarcastically but there was no disrespect in his voice and the grin never left his face.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You can be comfortable in any way you want, except that one.” Wanda said, matching his smile. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>As she continued to look at him affectionately, the shirt that he was wearing caught her attention. She was sure that she recognised the shirt but she couldn’t place him wearing it. It must have been an old shirt though because the design had almost faded into non-existence. “Is that a new shirt?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He looked down at it and pulled it so that there were no wrinkles obscuring the print. “Yeah!” He replied excitedly. “Well, it’s new to me. I think it’s actually from the early two thousands.” He turned his back towards her so that she could read the back of the shirt.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The back wasn’t as faded as the front and the words that were printed on it hit her like a truck. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants Tour</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>1999–2001</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<span>Followed by a list of cities, countries and venues. She told him to turn back around and sure enough, she could now make out the red and orange letters that spelled </span>
<em>
<span>oasis</span>
</em>
<span> on the front. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>There were only two people that he could have gotten that shirt from and she hoped to god that her first guess was correct. “Did your dad give you that?” She asked apprehensively, repeating </span>
<em>
<span>‘please say yes, please say yes’</span>
</em>
<span> in her head as she waited for his answer. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He shook his head and her stomach dropped. “No, I got it from a friend.” He furrowed his brow as he took in the look on her face that she wasn't able to hide. “Why? What’s wrong?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Which friend?” She asked with a bit too much bite.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Billy must have realised that she knew exactly who he meant because he suddenly looked very guilty, which made her heart ache. He shouldn’t have to feel guilty about spending time with someone who used to be so present in his life, not when they used to be as close as they were and not while they were mending their relationship. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He looked down as he spoke, not able to meet her eyes. “Agatha.” He said softly. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda swallowed and tried to even out her voice. “She gave you that shirt?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Mum…” he trailed off and took a deep breath. “I told you that I don’t want to be in the middle of you two. I was at Agatha’s for dinner a couple of nights ago, I saw the shirt in the hall, she said she was giving it to charity and I asked, well begged is more accurate, for her to let me have it instead. I didn’t think that it would be such a big deal.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda leant forwards and took Billy’s hands in her own. “It’s not a big deal sweetheart, Agatha and I are on civil terms now. It just brought back some memories that I wasn’t expecting.” She gave his hands a gentle squeeze and let a small smile form on her lips. “I’m also not sure how I feel about a shirt that I got when I was seventeen, fitting my eighteen-year-old son better than it ever fit me.” She added, attempting to bring some lightness back into the mood. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>It worked a little bit because Billy breathed out a laugh and smiled. “When did you two bury the hatchet?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“We talked last week, it went… It went as well as it could have gone.” The hatchet was far from buried and Wanda was acutely aware of the fact that her conversation with Agatha did not go well by any stretch of the imagination, but Billy didn’t need to know that.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I can go upstairs and change if you want.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda shook her head. “No you don’t have to. If you spill anything on it at dinner though, I will be taking it off you. A shirt this good deserves proper care.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>He put his hand on his chest in mock offense. “Are you implying that I don’t take care of my vintage clothes?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Vintage? That shirt is only twenty five years old! By that logic I’m-” She stopped and thought for a second. “Actually, I don’t want to finish that sentence.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>They picked a random movie to watch while they filled the time until Vision picked them up to take them to the restaurant, but Wanda couldn’t focus on it. Seeing that damn shirt out of the corner of her eye was distracting her. She had assumed that it had gotten lost at some point, or accidentally thrown away since it was so faded, but no. Agatha had had it the whole time. She had taken it with her when she moved out, kept it for two and a half years and now she had given it to Billy knowing full well that he would wear it and Wanda would see it. She wasn’t sure what kind of game Agatha was trying to play, but she was going to put a stop to it.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She picked up her phone and sent Agatha a message.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Wanda: We need to talk</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>She didn’t need to wait long for the reply.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Agatha: I doubt that</b>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Wanda: Let me rephrase. We will be talking on Monday.</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Agatha: Let me know how that goes for you</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>Wanda clenched her jaw and exhaled through her nose. She was going to put this out of her mind until Monday, Agatha wasn’t going to ruin her night with Vision and Billy. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Wanda knew when Agatha’s downtime was on a Monday, she knew when her downtime was every day. Agatha hadn’t changed her schedule since before she got her professorship and Wanda was choosing that Monday as the day that she would make her regret it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda waited outside Agatha’s office for a few seconds to check if she could hear anyone in there with her, but it was silent so she walked straight in. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“It is basic manners to knock upon a door and wait for permission before entering.” Agatha said, not looking up from her laptop. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda smiled and forced sweetness into her voice. “Oh, I think we’re past basic manners at this point. Don’t you, Agatha?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha’s head snapped up at the recognition of Wanda’s voice. She tensed her jaw and slowly removed her glasses, setting them on the keyboard of her laptop before placing her elbows on her desk and resting her chin on her clasped hands. “Well this ought to be good.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda stormed forwards, stopping at the edge of Agatha’s desk. “That’s all you have to say to me?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha leaned back in her chair, a ghost of a smile on her lips. “Oh no, I have plenty to say to you, Wanda. But we are at work so there is an element of decorum that must be upheld.” She ran her eyes up and down Wanda’s form. “Which I see you are doing so beautifully well.” Her voice was low and controlled like she knew that she was in command, and this made Wanda’s blood boil.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She leant forwards and put her hands on the desk to support her, trying to mimic the way that Agatha had done it just over a week ago. “And where does hypocrisy fit into your decorum?” She asked, keeping her voice level. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha looked wholly uninterested in Wanda’s accusation, rolling her eyes. “Wanda, if you have something to ask me please get to it instead of dancing around it. Unlike you, I actually have some work to do.” She sat upright in her chair again and slipped her glasses back onto her face, returning her attention to her laptop.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda reached forwards and shut the lid of the laptop. Agatha threw her hands up and mumbled, “is this becoming a trend?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda had no idea what she meant so she continued on the track she had started on. “You accuse me of using my son to play games with you and then he comes home and just happens to be wearing that shirt? Your sanctimonious display got me for a second, I won’t lie. But now I know that you’re no better than how you see me. Maybe you were just projecting.” Wanda straightened again and crossed her arms over her chest, a satisfied smile spreading across her face.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She watched Agatha’s face, looking for anything that might hint at a crack but she was holding strong. “I assure you Wanda, I have no idea what you are talking about.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Cut the bullshit Agatha. Billy told me that you had him over for dinner and gave him the Oasis shirt. </span>
<em>
<span>My</span>
</em>
<span> Oasis shirt. The Oasis shirt that you took with you when you stormed out of the house two and a half years ago.” Wanda knew that Agatha was just trying to toy with her but she was tired of it. Agatha had attacked her in her own office and Wanda had just let it happen, but she was standing her ground today like she should have then. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes again. “That’s what this is about? It was in a pile of clothes that I was going to give to charity and the kid saw it and wouldn’t take no for an answer. It’s just a shirt Wanda, it doesn’t mean anything.” A look of knowing flashed across Agatha’s face.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha was lying, there was no question. Wanda had zero doubt in her mind that Agatha had found that shirt and come up with this plan to fuck with her. Agatha knew the significance that shirt held to Wanda. It was more than just a simple item of clothing, it was from the concert that Vision took her to on their first date. It was a symbol of her family, of how that date led her into falling in love and having her son, the most important person in her life. It was a symbol of accepting Agatha into said family and having her be present in Billy’s life in a parental role alongside herself and Vision. It was a damn sight more than</span>
<em>
<span> just a shirt</span>
</em>
<span> and Agatha knew that. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda kept her arms crossed, balling her hands into fists but Agatha continued before she could speak. “I’ve never had an interest in Oasis. If you hadn’t spent so much time with your legs wrapped around your ex-husband, you might have known that.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>There it was. Wanda had wondered how long it would take Agatha to go there, it always ended up there.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“This isn’t about that.” Wanda bit out. “This is about you using an innocent teenager, a teenager whose world used to revolve around you, as a way to get back at your ex-fiancée.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha laughed darkly, like she couldn’t believe what Wanda had said. “And now you’re weaponising my past relationship with Billy to try and make me feel guilty for doing something that made him happy. I was giving the shirt to charity in an attempt to avoid,” she gestured at Wanda, “whatever the fuck this is.” She leaned back in her chair again. “Did this make you feel better? Did you get the result that you wanted? Or are you going to admit that any way you happen to be feeling about seeing that old shirt again is a direct result of your own actions?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda could feel her pulse hammering. She had gone into this thinking that she would be able to catch Agatha off guard, to gain the upper hand. But Agatha had managed to stay one step ahead like she always did, Wanda would never be able to match her no matter how hard she tried. She had lost once again and was going to be leaving Agatha’s office feeling defeated. Since they broke up, arguing with Agatha had always been a losing battle, there was very little that Wanda could do now to come out on top and that fact made it very hard to keep a level head.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The heat in Wanda’s chest started to creep into her face, a stark contrast to Agatha’s calm and collected demeanour. If she clenched her fists any tighter, her whole upper body was going to start shaking so she jabbed a finger in Agatha’s direction and snarled, “stop manipulating my son.” before turning and storming out of the office. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Always a pleasure chatting with you, Wanda.” She heard Agatha call after her but she couldn’t respond. She slammed the door and practically ran back to her own office because she didn’t want anyone to see her until she’d had a chance to calm down.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She shut her door and immediately collapsed against it, sliding to the floor and pulling her knees up to her chest. As long as it was hers to wield, Agatha would use Wanda’s mistake as a weapon, and it would work every time. Wanda was powerless against it and that was entirely her own fault. </span>

<p align="justify">Had that actually just happened? Had she actually just spoken to Agatha Harkness like that and lived to tell the tale? How many people could say that? Rio was probably the only one, she had to be. Why had Agatha let her get away with it, and what was that look on her face? <br/>Anger? No, she'd seen Agatha angry and that wasn't it.<br/>Fear? Also no. Agatha wasn't scared of her. The thought was laughable. <br/>So what was it? Arousal? <br/>Okay, maybe Rio's head was still a bit scrambled from being in Wanda's office earlier but could you really blame her? </p><p align="justify">She made her way to the library because she'd walked all the way to campus so she might as well make it worth her while and get some work done. Her favourite corner was free so she set up camp and started perusing the shelves, pulling out five or six random books to start with.<br/><em> ‘It is important that you can do independent work and think for yourself.’ </em> Agatha’s words replayed in her head as she realised that the sections of the books she was focussing on were all about the Labyrinth or the Minotaur, the things that Agatha had been teaching about on Wednesday.<br/>Maybe she had a point, but Rio was too petty to admit that right now so instead she told herself that it was because Theseus’ story interested her and she hadn’t covered it in her research yet.<br/><br/>She managed a few good hours of working before her brain was begging for a distraction, just half an hour of solace before returning to the grind. She opened a new tab on her laptop and went to YouTube to watch some drum covers of the songs the band had narrowed the setlist down to. She had managed to get away with learning the intro and making up the rest thus far, but she knew that she really should try and learn them properly before they had to perform.<br/><br/>She was halfway through a cover of Call Me by Blondie, trying to quietly tap along with it so as not to disturb the other people using the library, when her phone lit up showing a new message in her group chat with Billy and Alice.<br/><br/><b>Billy: Yo Lars are you around?</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> Rio scoffed. You mess up the groove <em> one time </em> and you’re nicknamed after the drummer from Metallica.<br/><br/><b>Rio: I’m in the library</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> <b>Billy: Should’ve known tbh that’s on me</b> <b><br/></b> <b><br/></b> She rolled her eyes and went back to YouTube – her research for the day was definitely over because this was far more interesting right now. By the time the song finished she could see two people approaching her in her periphery. She hoped that they weren’t going to try to share her table but she only turned her attention to them once they were standing on either side of her. It was Alice and Billy.<br/><br/>She took out her earphones and looked at each of them. “Can I help you?”<br/>Billy pulled out the seat next to her and sat down. “You’re coming to the Halloween thing tonight, right?”<br/>Rio hadn’t even noticed what date it was. Usually on Halloween she would be getting dressed up and going out with her friends to the gay bars, drinking god knows what and then waking up god knows where, next to god knows who. But the day had completely slipped her mind this year, and she suddenly felt FOMO about the fact that she wouldn’t be causing chaos with her friends. She hadn’t even factored Halloween into her packing to come to England.<br/><br/>Rio shook her head. “I have nothing to wear so I’m gonna have to pass.”<br/>Alice sat on the table instead of the free chair and started swinging her legs. “We can find you something between us.”<br/>Billy snapped his fingers as a thought came to him. “You could be Reggie from Julie and The Phantoms!"<br/>Rio looked at him confused. “Who?”<br/>“No, fuck that.” Alice cut in. “Danny from Grease!”<br/>That wasn’t a bad idea actually, but she still wasn’t feeling it. “I think I’m gonna sit this one ou-”<br/>Billy and Alice continued talking over her.</p><p align="justify">“My mum and dad were Danny and Sandy when I was like six and I had to stay at my uncle’s house that night.” Billy shuddered slightly as he recalled the memory.<br/>“But your dad’s blonde?” Alice started. “And your mum’s… not blonde.”<br/>Billy shrugged. “He used a temporary dye and she wore a wig. It’s not rocket science.”<br/>Rio put her hands up and said, “okay,” definitely too loudly considering the fact that they were still in the library. The two of them stopped talking and looked at her and she lowered her voice again. “First of all, the two people you suggested for me are guys and I’m not sure if I should be offended or not. Second, my hair is too long to be Danny and I’m guessing it would be for that other one you said as well.”<br/>Alice waved her hand, dismissing Rio’s comments. “You could tie your hair up and quiff it at the front, it would achieve the same effect. I’m assuming you have a white t-shirt and you already have the leather jacket and skinny jeans.” She spread her arms like it was an obvious answer. “Seems like Danny is a done deal to me.”<br/><br/>Rio sighed and looked at Billy who was just staring at her with a goofy grin while nodding his head. She closed her eyes and tipped her head back, sliding forwards in her chair until her head touched the back of it. She took a deep breath and breathed out, “fine,” which prompted a whoop from Billy and earned them all an annoyed <em> shush </em> from the people around them.<br/>Billy and Alice stood to leave. “We’re doing pre-drinks at ours so get there around seven.”<br/>Rio widened her eyes. “Seven? What time does this thing start?”<br/>“Nine.”<br/>Nine? <em> Nine? </em> Either she was getting old or the start times for these events were getting unreasonably late.<br/>The shock must have been evident on her face because Alice patted her on the shoulder and said, “You can’t back out now, see you later.” And with that, they both left, leaving Rio to question her decisions. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Rio was giving herself one last look over in the mirror and she hated that Alice had been right about her hair. It was simple but it really did make her look like a female Danny Zuko minus the curl, and she looked damn good. She twisted to the side to get a view of her butt in the mirror and nodded approvingly. She had found her tightest pair of jeans, these ones were a size too small so they weren’t comfortable to sit in but she’d survive knowing that she looked this good. Finishing the look with a basic black leather jacket – there was no way in hell that she would be wearing her expensive one to a university Halloween event – and a pair of black converse, she headed out the door and towards the campus housing that Billy and Alice lived in.<br/><br/>They had told her to go to the back where the door that opened into the living room was being held open by a fire extinguisher. She walked in and said, “you know any random person could just walk in here?”<br/>The people in the room all turned to her in unison. She recognised Billy, Alice, Eddie and Ash but she had no idea who the other three people were – Billy and Alice’s housemates, she assumed.<br/><br/>Eddie gave a low whistle followed by, “damn Rio.”<br/>Ash nodded. “I second that.” They walked over to Rio and handed her a bottle of beer. “Billy has something for you.”<br/>“For fuck sake, what now?” Rio took a drink of her beer and looked over at Billy who had the same goofy smile as he did earlier in the library.<br/>He proudly held up a large square of black paper that had the T-Birds logo drawn on it in white pen. “Gotta make sure people know who you are.”<br/>Rio rolled her eyes. “You are not putting that on my back.”<br/>Alice held up a box of safety pins and shook it back and forth, making them rattle. “Oh yes we are.” She matched Billy’s smile. “Turn around please.”<br/>Rio was <em> really </em> glad that she hadn’t worn her expensive jacket.<br/><br/>When they had finished pinning the logo to her jacket Billy introduced her to everyone – she almost immediately forgot their names and instead referred to them by the names of the things they were dressed as, but no-one complained.<br/>The pre-drinks were kicked off in style with a game of Ring Of Fire and her bandmates weren’t kidding when they said that Billy couldn’t hold his alcohol. The more drunk he got, the more he kept messing up the rules and having to drink more. Two and half rounds in, Eddie swapped his drink for water. It was unclear if he noticed or not but he kept drinking it regardless.<br/><br/>It had been nearly a decade since Rio had played this game but the muscle memory kicked in pretty quickly. She made sure not to answer anything that was posed as a question, nor did she ever have her drink less than a thumbs length from the edge of the table. Who knew that drinking game rules she learned in her teens would be useful in her thirties?<br/><br/>By the end of the fifth round everyone was pretty nicely buzzed and the two decks of cards that had been spread around the kings cup – which was a fucking stein of all things – were getting thin. Four out the the eight kings had been pulled and the liquid inside the cup was looking horrid. Whoever the poor soul was that had to drink that was, they were in for a nasty time. Rio pulled a seven from the pile and subtly pointed her left index finger upwards, keeping an eye on everyone around the table to catch the person who was last to follow suit.<br/>“Ah bad luck Beetlejuice,” She said, pointing at him, “Time to drink.”<br/><br/>Another couple of rounds later there was only one king left in play, and the likelihood of breaking the circle was just as big as picking up the final king. There were three people before Rio. Alice picked up a five, but the circle remained intact. Lara Croft picked up the final queen, but no broken circle. Ash picked up a four, which meant all the girls had to drink, but somehow the circle was still going strong. Rio’s turn came and she took her time picking her card, standing up to get a better look.<br/>“Clocks ticking Rio.” Eddie said. “Gotta make a choice.”<br/>“Don’t rush me, this is delicate work.” She said, not taking her eyes off the cards as if the right one was going to make itself known to her. About ten seconds later, she made her choice and picked up a card.<br/><br/>Time seemed to slow down as she lifted the card from the table – though that could have been an effect of the alcohol – and gasps echoed around the table as the realisation set in that the card she had picked had broken the circle. She groaned and flipped the card anyway to see what it was. It was the final king, a double whammy.<br/>“Oh fuck me.” She said as she sat back down.<br/>The guy who was wearing a lion onesie looked at her with his eyes full of sympathy. “Yikes bro, that’s a bad do.”<br/>Rio gave herself a final moment to prepare before she picked up the cup. The liquid was a disgusting shade of brown and the smell could not be described in any of the known languages on planet earth.<br/><br/>The seven other people began chanting “We like to drink with Rio, ‘cause Rio is our mate. And when we drink with Rio, she sees it off in eight…”<br/>As soon as the countdown started she put the stein to her lips, immediately screwing her face up at the taste. It was the most vile thing she had ever had in her mouth, but she wasn’t going to pussy out in front of a group of undergrads so she kept going until the cup was drained.<br/>“Joder, quiero morirme.” She muttered before leaning forward and resting her forehead on the table in front of her</p><p align="justify">Billy, now sobered up thanks to the water, asked, “What did that taste like?”<br/>She lifted her head just enough to look at him and managed to say. “Your mom.”<br/>“You’re not her type.” He replied with a cheeky smile and she put her head back down on the table.<br/>“Soy demasiado vieja para esta mierda.” She said to herself when she felt a hand patting her back reassuringly.<br/>“You took that like a champ, dude.” Eddie said before clapping his hands and continuing. “Okay, fifteen minutes to piss, finish your drinks, have a tactical chunder if you’re Rio, or whatever else you want to do before we head to the bar.”<br/><br/>Rio slowly sat back up. She’d only been slightly tipsy due to her incredible retention of the rules, but that cocktail of death had gone straight to her head and the room was starting to spin. She made sure to have some water before they left, though it didn’t do anything to help. It just sat on top of all the other liquid that was moving around her stomach. She knew pre-gaming would be a bad idea.<br/><br/>They set off to the bar and could hear the music coming from it before the building even came into view, the Halloween party in full swing. Beetlejuice offered to buy Rio a drink for enduring the kings cup but she insisted that she just wanted water. The short walk and the fresh air had helped slightly, but she’d done this enough times to know her limits and she’d need at least an hour before she could even think about alcohol again. </p><p align="justify">After some time her head and stomach started to settle so she had a few more drinks and danced with Billy, Alice, Ash and Eddie. <br/>Around midnight she decided that it was time for her to call it a night – much to her friends’ disappointment. They made some attempts to get her to stay a bit longer since the bar was staying open until four, but she stayed strong and said her goodbyes before making her way home. <br/>When she got in she went straight to bed, looking forward to a lazy weekend. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Sunday afternoon band practise was a good one. They drilled the songs over and over trying to make sure they had them as tight as they could be.<br/>“I'm still not sure about Seven Nation Army.” Ash said. “Are You Gonna Be My Girl is a better fit for us I think.”<br/>“That’s just because Seven Nation Army isn't actually played on bass, isn't it?” Rio asked with a smirk.<br/>Ash turned to face her. “It's not just that… but yes that is the main reason.” They said with a light laugh. “I'm also thinking of you, because the drums for Seven Nation Army are boring as fuck.”<br/>“The whole song is boring as fuck.” Alice chimed in and Billy agreed.<br/>Eddie put his hands up. “Okay. Seven Nation Army is out and Are You Gonna Be My Girl is in. Let's run it.”<br/><br/>They finished their practice and went to the bar for a couple of drinks before parting ways.<br/>Rio made herself some food and settled in front of the TV. About an hour later she got a text from Wanda asking, or more accurately, telling, her to go over – which she happily did.<br/><br/>She was happy with her arrangement with Wanda and she tended to let Wanda take the lead on when and where they would be meeting. It was usually in the evening at Wanda’s house, which worked better for Rio because it meant that she could leave and didn’t have to deal with the awkwardness of asking Wanda to leave her apartment after they were done, and Rio was pretty sure she could find her way to Wanda’s with a blindfold on at this point. But there was something about it that she couldn’t quite identify. It felt like there was something missing, though she didn’t know what that thing was. The sex was good, great even. Wanda understood the assignment and was happy with Rio leaving afterwards. She made the odd joke about Rio staying for dinner or giving her a goodbye kiss but they were just jokes.<br/><br/>Wanda was another notch in her bedpost that gave good head, so why was there something that didn’t feel quite right? She had been casually sleeping with women for the better part of a decade and she had never had this feeling before so why was it happening now?</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t the fact that Wanda had a son, Rio really couldn’t care less about that. It wasn’t the fact that Wanda was older than her, she liked older women. So what the fuck was wrong with this situation?<br/>There shouldn’t be anything wrong.</p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Wednesday morning came around and since she didn’t have to be in Agatha’s office for nine o’clock, Rio didn’t bother setting any alarms. But it appeared that her body clock hadn’t received the memo and she woke up at eight on the dot. She groaned and rolled over trying to go back to sleep but it was futile since her brain was wide awake and ready to start the day. She begrudgingly sat up, her mind might be under the illusion that she had things to do this morning but she sure as hell wasn’t going to do anything. She had her Wednesday mornings back and she was going to enjoy it.<br/><br/>She spent the day becoming one with her couch and playing her Switch. Technically playing Hades for ten hours counted as research since it was mythology based, so she was still doing work, she just wasn’t frying her brain by reading massive walls of text over and over again.<br/>She was, however, embarrassingly bad at the game. She could make it to Asphodel pretty easily if she got the right boones, but anything after that and she died instantly. She could almost understand why men threw controllers and broke TVs over losing a game.<br/><em>Almost.</em><br/>She would never do it because she wasn’t that emotionally immature, but after a few hours of dying in exactly the same place the temptation was definitely there.<br/><br/>When it got to the time that she would usually be getting ready to head to the music room, she got a message in the band group chat.<br/><br/><b>Eddie: Remember there’s no practise tonight because it’s bonfire night. </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Eddie: You’re still welcome to come with us Rio!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>She had indeed forgotten. The English tradition had slipped her mind but she remembered them talking about it on Sunday, saying that a local pub was having a huge fire in their car park and that it was open to the public.<br/><br/><b>Rio: Sounds good, I love fire. I’ll meet you guys there!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>“What does someone wear to a bonfire?” She asked to her wardrobe as she was looking at her clothes. She’d sat around her fair share of campfires so this should be the same but slightly bigger, right? She pulled on an old pair of jeans and a slightly worse-for-wear shirt that she didn’t mind the smell of smoke becoming embedded in, grabbed her winter coat and a beanie to keep her ears safe from the cold and set off to the pub.<br/><br/>A crowd had already started to gather in the car park when she got there but her attention was drawn to the massive pile of wood in the centre. It was impressively arranged in a pyramid and had two barriers around the base to stop people from getting too close. She squinted slightly and swore that she could see some bar stools in the mix with the rest of the planks and branches. Maybe this would be a bit more than just a big campfire.<br/><br/>She spotted her friends easily and weaved her way through the people to get to them. They all greeted each other and Rio recognised one of the girls from Halloween.<br/>“Oh hey. Lara Croft, right?” She asked, moving to stand next to her.<br/>Lara Croft smiled and said, “My name is Taylor, but I’ll let you off. My memory would be fucked too if I had to drink the stein mixed by Satan.”<br/>Rio scrunched up her face as the memory of the taste of that drink replayed on her tongue. “Ugh yeah. That was the worst thing I’ve ever tasted in my thirty years on this planet.”<br/>Taylor laughed. “Hopefully this will taste better.” She handed Rio a plastic cup. “It’s warm cider, nice and sweet.”<br/><br/>Rio took the cup and gingerly had her first sip. She wasn’t a fan of cider usually but this was a pleasant surprise. The warmth seemed to dull the sugary aftertaste and she took a bigger drink from it. “That’s not bad actually.”<br/>A voice rang out over the crowd through a megaphone announcing that the fire would be lit in two minutes and a cheer rippled through the throng.<br/>Rio addressed the group. “So run me through this again. Some dude tries to kill your king and you celebrate it every year by drinking and setting shit on fire?”<br/>“First of all, we celebrate <em>everything</em> by drinking.” Alice started. “But this isn’t a celebration of an attempted assassination. This is a celebration of the fact that the assassination was stopped.”<br/>Eddie jumped in. “Sometimes people make an effigy of Guy Fawkes to put on the bonfire, but I’ve never actually seen one of those sadly.”<br/>“Also, there’s fireworks.” Taylor finished.<br/>Rio nodded, still confused but accepting of that fact. “Fire, booze, fun. Got it.” <br/>“Exactly!” Billy said and they all knocked their cups together and turned to watch the fire being lit.<br/><br/>Three people took positions at the base of the fire with barbeque lighters and lit a ring of rags at the bottom. The cloth went up instantly and the people hurriedly stepped away, back behind the protective barriers. A few seconds later the whole pyramid lit up and the crowd roared. Another announcement was made over the megaphone that food was ready inside and to form a queue on the left side of the entrance. There was an assortment of cakes and other sweet treats laid out and they were serving a hot pie that Taylor informed her was a pork pie and that they were delicious. So she took one and they all filtered back outside.<br/><br/>They ate their food and refilled their cups whilst chatting and got onto the topic of the band.<br/>“Do you guys have a name?” Taylor asked, mostly to Rio.<br/>“I’m letting these guys handle that, I’m just there to look hot and hit things.”<br/>“Well, you manage one of the two.” Billy said with a smirk.<br/>Rio patted him on the head. “Aww, thanks for saying I’m hot buddy. But I don’t swing that way.”<br/>He rolled his eyes and pushed her hand away. “Taylor is right though, we should have a name.”<br/>They all went back and forth for a few minutes suggesting and shooting down ideas, ultimately getting nowhere until Taylor spoke. “Why don’t I come to your next rehearsal to watch you guys play and see if I can come up with one from your vibe?”<br/>They all agreed that having a third party make the choice was the best avenue.<br/><br/>Not long after, everyone migrated around to the back of the building to watch the fireworks display that the pub was also putting on. Being away from the direct heat of the fire made them all huddle closer together and Taylor laced her arm around Rio’s. “I’m using the penguin technique and stealing your body heat.” She said when Rio looked at her.<br/>Rio knew where this was going, Taylor had been glued to her all night and now she was initiating touch. Sure it was through the many layers of clothing that both of them were wearing to keep warm, but it was a classic move nonetheless.<br/>Taylor wasn’t Rio’s usual type – she was younger than her for a start – but one night couldn’t hurt.<br/><br/>They watched the fireworks and the first few made Taylor jump and bury herself further into Rio – another classic move – and Rio made a quip about loud bangs not bothering her since she was American which made Taylor laugh harder than it should have. This girl was really pulling out all the stops.<br/><br/>When the fireworks ended some people went back to the food and filled up their plates again or got more cider, planning on staying for a bit longer, but their group decided that they were going to head home. The campus housing was on the way to Rio’s building so she walked with them. Alice broke off and went in the direction of her and Billy’s block of flats but Billy carried on with Eddie towards a different block.<br/><br/>Rio had called it a while ago, she had noticed the way that they looked at each other.<br/>Taylor, still with her arm linked around Rio’s, slowed their walking so that they fell behind Billy and Eddie a little bit until they eventually stopped, and Taylor turned to face her. She gestured in the direction that Billy and Eddie were still walking. “I live in the same block as Eddie. I’m assuming that you live off campus since I’ve never seen you.” </p><p align="justify">Rio inclined her head in the direction of her building. “Yeah I live just up there. I’m too old for campus housing, I think.”</p><p align="justify">“Are you too old to spend one night in campus housing?” Taylor asked, her eyes flicking down to Rio’s lips and back up to her face as she spoke.<br/>Rio smirked. She had no intention of sleeping over but Taylor didn’t need to know that yet. “I suppose I could handle that.”<br/>“Well then, follow me.”<br/><br/>When the time came Rio made her excuses to leave, saying something about having an early PhD meeting in the morning. Taylor tried to get her to stay as predicted, but gave in and Rio walked home pushing down the same feeling that she always had when she left Wanda’s house. Something about it wasn’t quite right.</p><p align="center">_________</p><p align="justify">Rio turned up to band practise on Sunday a little late and walked into the room while they were half way through Pink Pony Club. Taylor was sitting on the sofa at the far end of the room watching them, but waved at Rio when she saw her. Rio gave her a polite smile and a nod of acknowledgement before moving to sit at the drum kit to join the song. When the song was over Ash turned to her with a mischievous smile. “Well the first half of that was good, until Lars eventually showed up and threw us all out of time.”<br/>Rio lightly threw a drum stick in their direction which landed at their feet. “Oops sorry, my hand slipped.”<br/>“It’s okay.” Ash said, giving Rio the stick back. “Your aim is as bad as your drumming.”<br/>Rio worked her tongue against her cheek and flipped them off.<br/><br/>Eddie spoke up to get their attention. “Now that we’re all here, I want to run it again. Rio, we were thinking about giving it more of a pop punk vibe, that cool with you?”<br/>Rio nodded. “Let’s do it!”<br/>They played through the song again, adding more distortion to the guitars and Eddie sang with a rougher tone to his voice. Pop punk was a genre where Rio felt comfortable, it was the type of music that her old band played, so she sent it. Who needs a double pedal when you can do heel-toe?<br/><br/>Taylor clapped when they were done and Billy looked at Rio in awe. “Where the fuck have you been hiding that?”<br/>Maybe she had dumbed down her drumming ability a little bit when she had first joined them. It was safer than going into it being cocky and not being as good as she thought she was years ago. She had also lied a little bit when she told them that she hadn’t played properly since high school. She had continued her lessons through college and she had an electric kit at home that she played just to make sure that she didn’t lose the skill, she just hadn’t been in another band. Playing an instrument by yourself in your own house was different than playing with other musicians.<br/>Rio shrugged. “Maybe you just underestimated me.”<br/><br/>They played through the setlist from start to finish at Taylor’s request so that she could come up with the perfect name for them. The set was quite a mish-mash of different genres, a combination of songs that they all liked and songs that they knew would be crowd pleasers.<br/>Taylor told them all to give her a minute to think and Rio started a drumroll, hitting the crash when Taylor said, “Okay, I’ve got it! How do you feel about Twisted Symphony?”<br/>They looked between themselves for a moment, nodding.<br/>“Wait, why twisted?” Ash asked.<br/>“Well, I’d say Straight Symphony but…” Taylor smirked.<br/>“Yeah, not in this band.” Alice deadpanned and they all laughed. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">The next couple of days passed without much happening.<br/>On Monday afternoon Rio read over one of Eddie's essays and sat in the library with him to help him refine it since the deadline was that night.<br/>In the evening she was at Wanda’s for a few hours and accepted a cigarette from her for the walk home. She breathed the smoke into her lungs, savouring the slight burn in the back of her throat. She much preferred a joint after sex, but since weed wasn’t legal here, she would take what she could get.<br/><br/>She spent Tuesday morning in her flat reading and enjoying some time to herself and in the afternoon she had a group call with her friends to catch up and get updated on the home gossip.<br/>“You remember Natasha from homeroom, the one that bullied you for being gay?” Maddy, her high school best friend asked, and Rio rolled her eyes.<br/>“Of course I remember her, she made my life hell.”<br/>“Yeah well, she got married last week. To a fucking woman.”<br/>Rio sat up from where she was laid on the sofa. “I fucking knew it! I said that she bullied me because she wanted me and you laughed at me. I was fucking right!”<br/>“Yeah I know, your gaydar has always been impeccable. That one's on me.” Maddy said.<br/>“Damn right, I knew you were bi before you did.” Rio grinned.<br/><br/>Chloe, a friend she had made in her final year of her undergrad piped up. “Speaking of being gay, have you found your hot, British, future wife yet?”<br/>“C’mon Chloe, you know me, I don’t want to be tied down. Unless they’re into that.” Rio wagged her eyebrows and her friends made various noises of disapproval.<br/>“Boooo!”<br/>“You always have to bring the tone down.”<br/>“That was such a cheap joke!”<br/>Rio just laughed, fuelled by their criticism.<br/><br/>In the evening she was playing Assassin's Creed when her phone pinged with an email notification. She finished the fight she was in before pausing the game and checking her phone, and lifted her eyebrows in surprise at what she read.<br/><br/><b>Rio,</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Given the nature of our last conversation I understand that this might not be something that you would want to do, but would you be able to come to my office at 9am tomorrow morning (Weds 12th)?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Apologies for the short notice.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>What the actual fuck? Agatha had made it very clear the last time they spoke that she didn’t want to see Rio again, so what was this about?<br/>This was the first time that Agatha had purposefully used Rio’s name and referred to herself as Agatha.<br/>Rio had no idea what Agatha could possibly be wanting, but she wasn’t going to entertain it.<br/><br/><b>Dear</b> <b>Professor Harkness, </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Since you have already acknowledged that you are aware of my possible unwillingness to agree to this meeting, it should come as no surprise to you that I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Sincerely,</b><b><br/></b><b>Rio Vidal</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>P.S. The short notice is not the issue.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>She debated whether she should keep the last sentence or not. She had already been petty enough by not using Agatha’s name and by using Agatha’s own words from their last conversation, leaving that on the end might cause more issues than it was worth. She loosed a frustrated sigh and deleted it before hitting send and throwing her phone on the coffee table in front of her and unpausing her game.<br/><br/>Rio began working her frustration out on some unsuspecting villagers, racking up a bounty that put her on the radar of some high level bounty hunters. About ten minutes, and a pile of dead villagers later, her phone pinged again. She rolled her eyes and paused the game once again.<br/><br/><b>Rio,</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Understood. </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>I would like to have an actual conversation with you regarding the way things were left, so I will be in my office from 9-11am as usual should you change your mind. </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Rio just stared at the email, completely devoid of a response. Why was Agatha choosing now to treat her like a person? Was she only doing it because Rio had forced her to come to terms with the fact that she had previously spoken to her like shit, or was this a genuine attempt at an apology?<br/>Rio couldn’t deny that her interest was piqued. Not at what Agatha could possibly have to say, but <em>why</em> she wanted to say it.<br/>She thought for a couple of minutes about how to reply and ended up sending only one word.<br/><br/><b>Fine.</b></p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">Once again, Rio didn’t bother setting any alarms for the morning. She hadn’t committed to a time and if Agatha was kept waiting, then she was kept waiting. Rio simply did not care. However, just like the week prior, she woke up bang on eight o’clock – betrayed again by her fucking body clock.<br/><br/>She laid in bed, staring at the ceiling, scrolling on her phone, anything to make herself even the slightest bit late. She stayed there for about twenty minutes before she huffed out a groan, dramatically threw her quilt off of her body and swung her legs out of bed. She slowly got herself ready and unhurriedly began her walk to campus, choosing to take the long way to the building where the ancient history department was instead of cutting across the car park like she normally would.<br/><br/>She considered pressing every button between the ground floor and the floor she needed in the lift just to make it take longer, but two other people got in just as the doors were closing so she didn’t want to inconvenience them with her own need to be as petty as possible – though the temptation was definitely still there.<br/>When she got to the door of Agatha’s office she checked the time, 9:17. Late enough.<br/>She knocked on the door three times and waited for Agatha to tell her to go in.<br/>“You may enter.”<br/><br/>Rio took a steady breath, pushing down the annoyance that was already beginning to rise in her chest, and opened the door.<br/>Agatha was sitting at her desk typing on her laptop, her glasses hooked onto her shirt by one of the arms, a stack of papers to her right and a coffee cup to her left. It was childish but Rio allowed herself a moment of satisfaction at the knowledge that Agatha was having to get her own coffee again on a Wednesday morning again.<br/>When Agatha lifted her head to look at her, Rio was expecting to see the usual look of indifference painted on her face, but instead she looked… happy?<br/><br/>Agatha smiled and said, “Rio! I’m glad you could make it,” like they were old friends who had recently reconnected and had agreed to meet for coffee and a catch up.<br/>Rio stayed where she was standing by the door and shrugged. “I was awake.” She wasn’t going to give Agatha anything until she knew why she had been asked to come to her office. “Is this gonna take long? I have some things to do.”<br/>Agatha stood from her seat, picked up her coffee, and walked around her desk to the armchair in the centre of the room. “It can take as long as you want it to.” She sat down and gestured to the chair that Rio usually sat in. “Please, take a seat.” Her voice sounded like the niceness was being forced into it as she spoke. Like she was trying to put on a jovial front in an attempt to make Rio feel more at ease. It wasn’t working.<br/><br/>Rio didn’t move for a moment, she just looked at Agatha sceptically until Agatha dropped the over-the-top smile to a smaller one and asked again, more sincerely this time. “Please?”<br/>Rio shifted her eyes to the side and walked to her chair, dropping herself into it. She didn’t speak, instead she gestured towards Agatha. Agatha had asked her to come here, she could be the one to do the talking.<br/><br/>Agatha understood and cleared her throat before she started to speak. “I know that it won’t mean much at the moment but I would like to apologise. You were right, I was treating you… poorly and I had no reason to do so. So for that, I am sorry.”<br/>It was a start but Rio was going to need more than a lukewarm apology. “You had me come here for that? You couldn’t have said that in your email?”<br/>Agatha’s eyes dropped for a second before making their way back up to Rio’s face. “I could have, but that is only the start of what I want to say. If you’re willing to hear me out?”<br/>Rio leaned back in the chair and folded her arms across her chest. “Go ahead.”<br/><br/>As Rio relaxed into her seat, Agatha seemed to do the opposite. She straightened her back and tucked one ankle behind the other. Her shoulders rose and fell with the breath that she took. “Due to some personal reasons that I’m not comfortable discussing right now, I like to keep certain parts of myself contained and when people try to reveal those parts, however innocent their intentions may be, I can become a bit…” She took a second to find the word, “prickly.” She took a drink from her cup. “I have since realised that you weren’t trying to pry into my life or be nosey, which I know you expressed multiple times, and that I may have overreacted-”<br/>Rio couldn’t stop the scoff that happened in the back of her throat and it made Agatha reconsider her words. “Okay I definitely overreacted. I’m not trying to excuse my behaviour, I’m just trying to offer an explanation, and hopefully an apology that has some weight to it that you can accept.” Her words began to speed up, like she was rambling to fill the awkward silence that would inevitably drop once she finished speaking. “I’m aware that it isn’t that simple or easy but if you have any questions or things you want me to clear up then you can ask them, and I will answer without being defensive or talking down to you.”<br/><br/>A silence did begin to settle but Rio didn’t find it awkward, at least not fully. She uncrossed her arms and straightened herself in her chair slightly as she took in what Agatha had said.<br/>She seemed genuine in her attempt to take accountability for her actions over the past couple of months and Rio could respect that, though it was a long way from accepting it. “Thank you for your apology, Professor.” Even though Agatha had signed her emails with her name instead of her title and surname, Rio still wasn’t sure about using her first name. She couldn’t help but see it as a way to lure her into a false sense of security somehow. She couldn’t trust that Agatha wouldn’t just do another one-eighty and flip out on her again. “As for questions, I do have some. But just to be clear, you are allowed to say that you don’t want to answer them. I’m not trying to make you uncomfortable or accidentally ask you to talk about something that you don’t want to talk about.”<br/>Agatha smiled and relaxed her shoulders. “I know. And if one of your questions broaches a topic that I don’t want to get into, I will let you know. Also, you don’t have to call me Professor if you don’t want to. But that is entirely up to you.”<br/><br/>Rio couldn’t describe how she was feeling sitting in Agatha’s office with a new dynamic being presented to her. She was definitely confused, still a little agitated, but most of all she felt weird. That’s the only word that felt close to being accurate. <em>Weird.</em><br/>It was weird that Agatha had emailed her practically begging her to go back to her office. It was weird that Agatha had suddenly decided that not calling her Professor wasn’t a huge breach of the rules that she herself had been so adamant to set and maintain. Agatha’s motivations were unclear and <em>it was weird.</em><br/><br/>Rio cleared her throat because the silence was now starting to take on an edge of awkwardness. “I guess my first question is: why?”<br/>Agatha raised her eyebrows slightly. “You’re going to have to be more specific.” She took a  sip of her coffee.<br/>“Why did you ask me here? Other than you having this epiphany that your behaviour was out of line, what changed?”<br/>Agatha took a  breath. “I discussed our… situation with some close friends, and they pointed out to me that I had, rather harshly, misjudged you. When I had accepted that, I knew that I needed to try and smooth things out. Make it right.”<br/><br/>Rio pressed her tongue into her cheek. “We’ll circle back to me making it into your home life in a bit but first I want to know why you want to make it right with me. I’m just another student, I’m not the first person that you’ve spoken to or treated this way. So what’s special about me?”<br/>Agatha’s gaze dipped again, her eyeline going over Rio’s right shoulder to the bookcase behind her. “Because…” She trailed off and closed her eyes for a second, opening them before speaking again. “Because you’re not just another student.” Agatha’s eyes moved back to Rio’s face, but not just to the centre like last time, she looked Rio in the eye. “You’re the first person in a long time who isn’t afraid to, umm, ‘call me out’ I think the phrase is? And I can admit that I didn’t know how to handle that since it very rarely happens.”<br/><br/>The explanation didn’t do much to ease Rio’s confusion, it only gave her more questions. The reason why Agatha had come grovelling was because Rio wouldn’t take any of her shit? No, there had to be more. Agatha wasn’t giving her the full story, she was talking around it. She was purposefully omitting bits and pieces, and for what? To save face? To save herself from the embarrassment of admitting the full truth? Why had Agatha needed to talk about Rio to her friends? How much of her brain did Rio take up and why?<br/>There were so many questions, so many things that Rio needed clarification on but she couldn’t ask them all yet. She would have to bide her time and get her answers slowly because she predicted that the answers wouldn’t be straight forward. This was Agatha after all.<br/><br/>Rio shifted in her chair, sitting further back so that she could rest her back without slouching, and crossed her legs. “Well I’ve got plans to start a movement, give the student body more backbone. So you might have to get used to it.” She gave a half smile and Agatha laughed.<br/>“I’ll keep that in mind.” The silence settled again, neither of them in a comfortable enough place to stop it just yet, until Agatha said, “Do you have anything else you want to ask me?”<br/><em>‘So many fucking things!’</em> Rio thought but didn’t voice, instead she said, “I don’t know. Why don’t you tell me some things about you? You know a lot about me and if we’re to build a rapport, it should be equal on both sides.” This was the safest way Rio could think of to try and get information out of Agatha. She didn’t want Agatha to feel like she was being backed into a corner and forced to give explanations to all of the thoughts that were currently swimming around Rio’s head.<br/><br/>Agatha smiled and leaned back, crossing her legs. “Well, my name is Agatha, I’m forty two, I’m a professor at Cambridge Univ-”<br/>“I obviously didn’t mean that.” Rio cut her off with a smile. “I mean like what was it about The Odyssey that made little Agatha want to explore Greek Mythology as a career? Why did you get so bent out of shape when I dog-eared the page instead of using a bookmark? You know, real things.”<br/>“Okay first of all, there is no reason to turn the corner of a page when literally anything can be used as a bookmark. An old receipt, and out of date credit card, a blade of grass if you’re so inclined. If pages and spines get bent through general wear and tear then that’s fine, but to purposefully do it is psychopath behaviour.”<br/>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at how easily Agatha got annoyed at such an insignificant thing. “I’ve been called a psychopath before, but that is by far the stupidest reason I’ve ever been given.”<br/>“As for The Odyssey,” Agatha continued, ignoring Rio’s comment. “All you gave me when I asked you the same question was ‘I read Percy Jackson.’ So if you want tit-for-tat, you’re gonna have to elaborate as well.” A smug smile spread across her lips.<br/><br/>Rio pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and shook her head. Agatha had her with that one. “Touché. My parents got me The Lightning Thief as a late birthday present, because it was released after my birthday, and I became obsessed with the gods. I started researching them on my own time, checking out book after book from the library and when we started learning about it at school I was in my element. I scored top marks on all the tests about it, obviously.”<br/>“Oh, <em>obviously.</em>” Agatha repeated in sarcastic seriousness.<br/>Rio continued. “I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve read the books, but each time a new one was released, I’d get it and re-read them from the start before reading the new one. I did the same with Heroes of Olympus too. And from there it just spiraled really.”<br/><br/>Agatha was still looking directly into Rio’s eyes, smiling softly as she listened. Rio prompted her to tell her side by saying. “Your turn.”<br/>Agatha adjusted the position of the watch on her wrist, breaking eye contact for the first time since it had been established. Her body language made Rio think that she might turn this one down, but she didn’t.<br/>Agatha settled her hands in her lap. “I wasn’t entirely truthful before. My mother didn’t read The Odyssey to me. It was still my introduction to Greek mythology and I was ten when I read it, but I read it of my own accord. I snuck it from the bookshelf in her home office and read it under my covers at night when I was meant to be asleep.” She paused waiting for Rio to interject, but Rio just wanted to let her continue. “I liked the escape that world offered, so I kept hold of it.” She smiled, but it wasn’t full. It looked like it was tinged by the memories that clung to that part of her life.<br/><br/>Rio hadn’t expected that at all. She had figured that Agatha’s story would be similar to hers, and in some ways it was. But Rio’s was a happy one and Agatha’s didn’t seem to hold the same level of childhood joy. She was curious to know more, but now definitely wasn’t the time to ask. Despite what Agatha might have previously assumed, she did know when a question went beyond a simple want to know something and became an unwanted attempt to peek into someone's private life.<br/><br/>Instead of asking anything she just smirked and said, “So we’re both just massive nerds then? Good to know.”<br/>“Oh come on Rio.” Agatha returned the smirk. “We already knew that.” She adjusted herself in the chair for a second and drained her coffee. “What’s next? Hit me.”<br/>Rio thought for a moment, she wanted to keep the conversation light to avoid the risk of it turning sour like so many of their conversations had done in the past. She also wanted to know what the outcome of this meeting would be since it was out of the blue and she still wasn’t a hundred percent on board with Agatha’s reasoning for calling it. “Does asking me to come here today mean that the meetings are back on, or is this a one off?”<br/>Agatha took a breath and ran her hand through her hair. The way that it caught the light coming in through the window made it look almost golden and Rio was nearly mesmerised by it. If Agatha hadn’t spoken, Rio could have happily kept staring at her hair. “We can go back to having regular meetings if you would like, though I wasn’t being dishonest when I said that you didn’t need them anymore. I do have something for us to do today if you’ve got the time. I know that you said you had plans, so it’s up to you.”<br/>Rio had forgotten about the fake plans she had used as her get out of jail free card and made a show of checking her phone. “I hadn’t fully committed to them, so it’s cool.”<br/>Agatha smiled. “Excellent.” She stood up and walked to her desk.<br/><br/>She returned with her laptop and the stack of papers that Rio had noticed when she walked in, and put them in the centre of the coffee table between them. “I thought you could help me mark some essays.”<br/>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You want me to do your work for you?”<br/>Agatha stuttered. “I- Uh- I can see how it would come across that way, but that wasn’t my intention. I thought you might want to try it since we both know that you can do your own work to a high standard, marking someone else's might be fun for- well, maybe not fun. It might be interesting for you. You don’t have to though if you don’t want to, I’m not going to force you.”<br/>Rio tried to suppress the smile that was forming at watching Agatha flounder, but she couldn’t. God damnit, Agatha’s attempt at atoning for her past actions was unintentionally endearing.<br/><br/>Rio leaned forwards to get a closer look at the essay on the top of the pile. “You can stop panicking, I’m in.” She looked back up at Agatha. “Seems like it would be fun. Or would it be interesting?” She smiled and moved her tongue against her cheek.<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Just grab a chunk of them. The marking sheet is on my laptop so you can have that in front of you as you go. Do you want to do the first couple together so you can get a feel for it?”<br/>“You don’t trust me?” Rio asked in mock offense, but she was already standing up to move her chair closer to Agatha. “If I was a weaker person, I’d be offended by that.” She finished as she sat back down. The angle the chair was placed at meant that their knees touched a little bit when Rio sat. It was a tiny thing, there was barely any contact at all, but Rio felt it and she assumed Agatha did too. Neither of them mentioned it, nor did they move their chairs or shuffle themselves away from each other.<br/><br/>They both reached for the top paper at the same time, Rio getting there a fraction of a second before Agatha, which meant that Agatha accidentally grabbed Rio’s hand. They lingered for one second, two seconds, before Agatha quickly pulled her hand away.<br/>“I know I’ve never done this before, Agatha. But I don’t need you to literally hold my hand.” Rio said jokingly as she picked the paper up, testing her use of Agatha’s name rather than her title.<br/>Agatha swallowed, looking slightly uncomfortable. “We’ll see how you feel after you’ve marked this first one.”<br/><br/>Agatha took time to explain the marking sheet to Rio, most of it was pretty self explanatory but she was still grateful that Agatha was covering it in detail. It was better to know exactly how to mark the work to the university’s standard than to wing it and hope that it was okay.<br/>Agatha then went through the first paper with her, pointing everything out and indicating the corresponding guideline on the marking sheet. Of course there were things that they disagreed on, it wouldn’t be an interaction with Agatha if there wasn’t a debate of some sort.<br/><br/>Rio pointed to the marking sheet. “How are you saying that the use of sources is a three? It’s clearly a five!”<br/>“Rio, you can’t be serious. They’ve only got six books and two journals in their bibliography.”<br/>“Okay first of all, they’re in their first year so cut them some slack. Second, they’ve also got four websites which they’ve cross-referenced with the books. And they’ve done it really well.”<br/>If this was how harsh Agatha was when marking the work of her first year students, Rio was having reservations about Agatha reading her full thesis. If she ever got the thing written.<br/><br/>Agatha sighed. “As a source, websites don’t hold the same weight as books. The English Heritage website had the wrong plans for Stonehenge out there for public consumption for so long.”<br/>“It’s the twenty-first century, Agatha. People are going to be using websites now. Just because you had to chisel your college work into a stone tablet, doesn’t mean it’s the right way for everyone to do it.”<br/>Agatha’s eyes went wide and her mouth hung slightly open. <em>Fuck.</em> Rio had spoken without thinking. She definitely, without a shadow of a doubt, should not have said that.<br/>Agatha stared at her for a moment, the surprise at what Rio had said all over her face. Rio’s heart began to pound. Why did she say that? What had possessed her?<br/><br/>Agatha closed her mouth and pursed her lips. “I’ll have you know that I did not ‘chisel my essays into a stone tablet.’” She curled her fingers in air quotes as she repeated Rio’s words back to her. “We had progressed to reed pens and papyrus by then.” She held her stern look for a second longer before a grin started to spread across her face. </p><p align="justify">Rio released the breath that she had been holding and turned it into a relieved, breathy laugh. “You’re right, my bad.”<br/>“Shall we split the difference and mark it as a four?”<br/>“I can agree with that.”<br/>Agatha wrote it down on the paper. “If you keep going like this, I’m gonna lose my reputation as a harsh marker.”<br/>“All I’m hearing is that your grade average will go up, which can only reflect well on you. No need to thank me.” Rio smirked.<br/><br/>Agatha calculated the overall percentage score for that essay. “Looks like this one gets fifty seven percent so it’s a 2:2. Do you agree with this, or would you like to dispute it?”<br/>Rio made a show of scrutinising the score, checking the marking sheet a couple times for extra effect. “Nope, looks good to me.”<br/>“I’m so glad. Do you want to do the next one alone?”<br/>“I reckon I could give it a go.”<br/>Agatha handed her the next essay and turned the laptop so that it was facing her, expressing that she had done this enough times by now to not need the marking sheet anymore.<br/><br/>They made their way through a fair few of the papers, significantly lessening the pile that was in front of them. They got into a rhythm with it, occasionally leaning over to check how the other was scoring certain things. Agatha usually tutting and saying, “You’re too nice.” And Rio pointing and saying, “That’s way too harsh.” But they worked at a good speed, making light work of the task.<br/>Neither of them noticed the time passing, too involved in what they were doing. Their knees touched a few more times as one of them was leaning to get a new essay, or one of them shifted slightly to get more comfortable. It became more frequent, not enough that it was obviously a conscious thing but enough that Rio wondered if there was some part of Agatha that was doing it as a subconscious thing. By the time Agatha’s alarm went off, making them both jump, they had stopped bumping their knees and were just resting them against each other.<br/><br/>Agatha pulled out her phone and silenced the alarm. “We’re gonna have to wrap this up and go to the lecture.” She stood up, grabbing her laptop and her bag. “Are you coming?”<br/>Rio nodded and followed Agatha out of her office.<br/><br/>Instead of turning left like she usually would, she turned right with Agatha.<br/>Agatha gave her a confused look. “You don’t have to chaperone me, I know these halls like the back of my hand.”<br/>Rio shrugged. “I noticed that you always walk this way instead of the short way. I wanted to see what was so great about it.”<br/>“The café is what’s so great about it. I can’t teach without caffeine.”<br/>“A perfectly valid reason.”<br/><br/>They walked together to the café, chatting a little bit but not about anything with substance. It was mostly Rio trying to convince Agatha to expand her horizons and order something other than a white coffee.<br/>“What if I buy it for you, then you technically haven’t lost anything?” Rio tried.<br/>“Nope. I’ll still have lost the caffeine hit that I desperately need.”<br/>“Not if you stop being weird and just drink it.”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes as they approached the café. “If it’ll shut you up, fine.”<br/>Rio moved to join the queue but Agatha stopped her. “We’ll be late if you wait for this.” She gestured to the queue that was only four people long, including Rio. “Just go straight to the front and say it’s for me. They’ll make it quicker.”<br/>Rio’s brows shot up. “You’ve scared them into prioritising your order, haven’t you?”<br/>Agatha lifted her shoulders in a shrug. “I like the efficiency.”<br/><br/>Rio snorted in incredulity but made her way to the collection counter all the same. She gave the barista the order and they looked scared. “Prof- Professor Harkness wants an iced caramel latte?” They stammered out.<br/>Rio nodded. “Yep. With cream on top.”<br/>The barista shuffled awkwardly. “She definitely doesn’t want her white coffee? It’s already done.”<br/>“She’ll take both, but we’re kinda in a rush. Lectures to teach and all.”<br/>The barista nodded and got to work, causing the other people in the queue to roll their eyes. One person mumbled, “We all have places to be, why is she so special?”<br/>Rio would never abuse this kind of power, but she had to admit that it felt good.<br/><br/>Rio paid and the coffees were ready and placed into a cup holder in no time at all. She took them back over to Agatha and pointed to the white coffee. “This was already made and I think that barista would have cried if I told them that you didn’t want it, so you can have it in case your tastebuds are too delicate for a fun drink.” She smiled smugly and they set off to the lecture hall.<br/><br/>They split the coffees up and walked into the room, Agatha going left towards the desk to set up her laptop, and Rio turning right and climbing the seating bank to the spot Billy had saved for her. When she sat down he turned to her and whispered, “That’s not the kind of coffee I expected Agatha to drink.”<br/>She looked towards Agatha who was unwrapping her straw and sliding it into the cup. “Turns out it is when she’s not the one paying.”<br/>Agatha looked at Rio as she took her first sip and Rio had to stifle her laugh when she saw the surprise on Agatha’s face. She liked the drink. She actually liked the fucking drink. She was trying her best to hide it, but the speed that she went in for the second sip gave it all away.<br/>Rio gave a cocky smile and tilted her head in a silent ‘told you so’ which made Agatha roll her eyes and set the coffee down on the desk.<br/><br/>Rio faintly heard Billy speak next to her, but she was too caught up in her silent exchange with Agatha to hear him. “Huh?” She asked.<br/>“I said, why did you buy her a coffee? Are you moving on from second years to the staff now?”<br/>She dipped her brows in confusion. “What are on about?”<br/>He gave her a look that said, ‘you know exactly what I mean’ but continued out loud anyway. “Oh come on, don’t act coy. Me and Eddie heard you and Taylor after the bonfire. Sounded like she <em> really </em> enjoyed herself.”<br/>“All women enjoy themselves with me Billy. It’s just a fact. Ask your mother.” <span>She wiggled her eyebrows at him and he rolled his eyes.</span><br/>Alice joined in. “You slept with Taylor? Nice.” She held up her hand for a hi-five, which Rio returned, reaching across Billy.<br/>He moved both of their arms down as Agatha started clearing her throat to get the class's attention.<br/><br/>When everyone’s attention was on Agatha, she started talking. “I’m sure you’ll all be pleased to know that I have started marking your essays and you should get the results by the end of the month, so keep an eye on your emails. I know some of you might not be happy with the marking,” She passed her gaze over Rio, a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “So please utilise my office hours if you wish to discuss it at all.”<br/>With that out of the way, she started the lecture. </p><p align="center">__________</p><p align="justify">During the lecture Rio started feeling an itch that needed to be scratched in a specific way. It came out of nowhere but she put it down to being due on her period. She always got randomly horny around her period.<br/>After the lecture Rio messaged Wanda.<br/><br/><b>Rio: Are you free tonight?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>The reply came quickly which meant Wanda was either on a break or was using her phone during a lecture.<br/><br/><b>Wanda: I’ll be home around 5:30 so come round any time after that</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Rio didn’t reply, she didn’t need to. She just needed to last until band practise was over. And somehow, she managed. It was rough, she strongly considered not showing up to the music room and making her excuses later, but she stayed strong and saved herself for when she was at Wanda’s house.<br/>She practically sprinted from the practise and got to Wanda's house just after seven and rapidly knocked on the door which Wanda opened within a few seconds. She’d been waiting for her.<br/>Wanda grabbed Rio by the shirt and pulled her inside, shutting the door by pushing Rio against it and immediately kissing her. She undid Rio’s jeans without breaking the kiss and pushed her hand beneath the waistband but over her underwear, feeling the wetness that Rio knew was between her thighs. “Damn,” Wanda whispered against her lips. “How long have you been like this?”<br/>Rio gave Wanda’s bottom lip a gentle tug between her teeth. “Since I messaged you.”<br/>Wanda pulled back enough to look in Rio’s eyes. “You’ve been this wet all that time? And during school too?” She tutted. “Naughty.”<br/>Rio didn’t hate teasing by any means, but right now she needed a release. She wove her hand into Wanda’s hair and pulled it back sharply, making Wanda gasp at the movement. She dropped her voice low, her lust adding a husk to it. “Stop talking and do something about it then.” Rio let go of her hair.<br/>Wanda smiled, the look in her eyes showing exactly what Rio wanted to see. She twisted her hand, grabbed the waistband of Rio’s jeans and began leading her up the stairs. When they got over the threshold of the bedroom, Wanda turned, pushed Rio’s jacket off of her shoulders and lifted her shirt over her head before walking her backwards towards the wall. She told Rio to take her jeans off and sank to her knees, following with Rio’s underwear kissing down her legs as she went. When the fabric was out of the way, she picked Rio’s leg up and put it over her shoulder giving a final kiss to Rio’s inner thigh before she put her tongue where Rio needed it.<br/><br/>It didn’t take long before Rio was close. The leg that was over Wanda’s shoulder was shaking and her other leg was threatening to give out under the weight of her orgasm. Neither of them heard the front door open, but Wanda heard the voice that carried up the stairs. She pulled away from between Rio’s thighs. “Oh fuck.”<br/>Rio whimpered at the loss of contact. “No no no, please don’t stop.” She tried to push Wanda’s head back down but Wanda resisted, hurriedly standing up. “Wha-” Rio started but Wanda cut her off.<br/>“Rio, it's my son!” She said in a harsh whisper, and then Rio heard it.<br/><br/>“Mum, are you home?” A voice that sounded eerily familiar came from downstairs. “I just needed to bring some washing because my bonfire clothes were starting to make my room smell really bad.”<br/><em>Shit.</em> Rio started to quickly scramble around, grabbing her clothes and putting them back on as quickly as she could. Wanda started to leave the room but Rio grabbed her arm. “Wait!” She whispered. “What should I do? Should I hide?”<br/>“I don’t know how long he’s gonna be here for. Just make up an excuse for being here and leave. I'll let you know when he’s gone and you can come back.” Wanda replied and headed downstairs. Rio heard both of them speaking and stood dumbfounded for a minute.<br/><br/>Why had Wanda phrased it that way? <em>‘Just make up an excuse and leave.’</em> Was her son someone that Rio knew? She did recognise the voice, but he could have been in any of the lectures that Rio had attended. Or she could have even heard his voice in the library, at the bar, he could have been one of the guys from Halloween.<br/>She threw her top on and slowly started down the stairs. Maybe his back would be to the hall and she could sneak past them.<br/><br/>She continued to creep down the stairs, avoiding the step that she had come to learn creaked if stood on, catching the end of the conversation.<br/>“... firework display was so good! I don’t think I’ve seen rockets that big before.” The boy finished telling Wanda.<br/>“I’m glad you had a good time sweetheart. Did your friends enjoy it too?” She heard Wanda say from the kitchen.<br/>“Yeah they did. Though I think a couple of them enjoyed each other's company more than the bonfire.”<br/>“Oh? The fireworks worked their magic on someone then?”<br/>He laughed. “They sure did. It was Taylor and… Rio?”<br/><br/>Rio stopped in her tracks and turned in the direction of his voice. <em>No. There's no way.</em><br/>He was looking directly at her, and she him. “Billy?”<br/>Wanda was standing behind him looking apologetic. She had known this whole time that Rio was one of her son’s friends.<br/>How many times had he spoken to Wanda about her and Wanda had just nodded along?<br/>He was about to fucking tell her that she slept with Taylor – not that it was an issue since she and Wanda were not in a relationship. But still, it felt wrong coming from her <em>son</em>.<br/><br/>Billy looked thoroughly confused and Rio no doubt looked like a deer in the headlights. “What are you doing here?” He asked.<br/>It was a perfectly reasonable question for him to ask but Rio’s brain was struggling to process it. She looked over his shoulder to Wanda who just mouthed, “Say something.”<br/>Big fucking help. “I was just borrowing a book that Wand- uh- your mom has. For my thesis.” She choked out as her brain was still lagging behind.<br/>It was lagging very far behind since she didn’t have a fucking book in her hands. Wanda jumped to her rescue. “Turns out that I don’t have it. It must be at your dad’s.” She said to Billy. A beat passed before she cleared her throat. “I’ll let you know when I have it and bring it in for you. It’ll either be tomorrow or Friday.”<br/>Rio nodded. “Uh yeah, that’s cool with me. See you later Billy.” She gave them both an awkward wave and left as quickly as she could. Choosing to sit on the wall outside to put her shoes on rather than doing it in the house.<br/><br/>She sat there and sighed heavily, hanging her head. That could not have gone any worse. She rubbed the back of her neck and noticed something about her shirt. It was on inside out.<br/>That wasn’t noticeable, right? Sure the back of the embroidered logo was obviously facing outwards and looked like a tangled mess instead of the neat pattern that it should have been, and the label was at the front. But he didn’t notice that, <em>right?</em><br/>She ran her hands down her face and rested them on her chest where she could feel her heart beating so fast that it would definitely concern a doctor.<br/><br/><em>FUCK.</em> </p>

<span>Agatha was on her way to her Thursday morning lecture via the café, as usual. She skipped the line and went straight to the front, as usual. The barista looked terrified, as usual. Everything was normal. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Until the barista brought out two coffees. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Good morning, Professor Harkness.” They nervously started. “We, umm, we weren't sure if, uh-”</span>

<span>The barista swallowed. “Since you changed your order yesterday we weren’t sure which we should prepare for you, so we made both.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>They put two coffees in front of her. One was her usual white coffee with two sugars already stirred in, and the other was the iced coffee that Rio had bought for her the day before. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She looked at both of the drinks considering her options. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She could just take both and have both, there were no downsides to that. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She could take both and give the iced one to Rio as repayment for yesterday, but that would mean that she didn’t also get to have the iced one – and she really wanted the iced one. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She could get them to make a second iced coffee so that she could give one to Rio whilst also keeping one for herself. Everyone was a winner in that scenario. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>But there was one problem with that. She had no guarantee that she would see Rio today.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>It was a Thursday and they had no meetings scheduled – they hadn’t even arrived at a conclusion as to whether they would go back to having weekly meetings. Just because they’d had one meeting that didn’t mean that Rio would turn up to her lecture today and accept a coffee from her. This was a complicated, delicate thing that needed to be handled correctly. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Professor Harkness?” The barista’s voice brought her out of her thoughts.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She checked her watch. There was enough time to get a second coffee made and still make it to her lecture on time. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck it.</span>
</em>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“The iced thing. Make a second one, and do it quickly.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The barista nodded and got to work. Agatha would just have to hope that Rio would attend the lecture. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>As she waited she tried desperately to not think about the fact that this was the first time in a long time that she had factored another person into a decision that she had made. If she had just been given her white coffee, she wouldn’t have given it a second thought. The drink that Rio had begged her to try wouldn’t have even entered her mind. She could have gone about her day the same as she did every day but that fucking barista had to ruin it by putting both drinks in front of her and forcing her to think about it.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She paid for the drinks and set off to the lecture hall, coming up with a contingency plan. If Rio wasn’t there then she could give the second coffee to Billy and that would sort out the three-coffees-problem that she was currently having.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She got to the lecture hall as students were still filtering in, walking straight to her table and starting to set up. She scanned the seating bank finding Billy and Alice in the middle where they usually sat, but Rio wasn’t there. There wasn’t a spare seat next to Billy either. That had to  mean that Rio wasn’t coming since he always saved a space for her. She felt a pang of disappointment at knowing that Rio wasn’t going to be there but pulled out her phone to text Billy to come to the front. She had to think of a subtle way to give him the drink so that it didn’t look like he was getting special treatment and cause a rumour to spark. The last thing she or Billy needed were more rumours flying around the department. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She was about to press send when, out of the corner of her eye, she saw the familiar dark waves and leather jacket. Rio had walked in. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>But wait, if Rio was here then why had Billy not saved her a seat like he usually did? Had Rio told him that she wasn’t coming and then changed her mind at the last minute? </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Fuck, none of that mattered right now. She put her phone down and called Rio’s name. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Rio turned to her, briefly looking confused before walking over and holding up her hands. “Whatever it is, I swear I didn’t do it.” </span>
</p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha couldn’t stop the smile that played on her lips. </span><em><span>God damnit.</span></em><span> “Well, that remains to be seen. Are you sure?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio nodded. “Totally. It was, uhh, that guy.” She motioned over her shoulder to a random person and gave an innocent smile.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha looked in the direction that she was pointing at a now confused and slightly worried looking first year who had just taken his seat, and laughed softly. “I appreciate your honesty. And as a token of my appreciation, I want to give you this.” She held up the iced caramel latte and its accompanying straw. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio’s eyebrows raised. “You bought me a coffee?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Repayment for yesterday.” Agatha tried her best to sound nonchalant.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I don’t need repaying, that was a gift.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha started to put the drink down. “Oh. Well if you don’t want it…” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio quickly reached out and took the coffee from her. “Let’s not be hasty now. I said I didn’t need repaying. Not that I didn’t want the coffee.” She took the lid off and dipped her finger into the cream. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha tried to look away, she really did, but her eyes couldn’t stop following the motion of Rio putting her finger into her mouth and sucking the cream off of it again.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio smiled smugly. “Hmm. Tastes even better when it’s free.” She put the lid back on and picked up the straw. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha started to speak but her throat had suddenly gone dry so it came out as a squeak at first, which made Rio chuckle. She cleared her throat and tried again. “I’m glad. Go find a seat please. I have work to do.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio saluted her and said, “Aye aye captain.” Before walking up the seating bank and dropping herself into a free seat in the back. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The start of the lecture was a little shaky because it took Agatha a hot minute to get her head back to where it needed to be, but she soon found her stride again and delivered her lecture without any issues.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When the lecture was over Agatha noticed Alice and Billy leave without sparing a look in Rio’s direction which she thought was strange. They seemed to be rather close until today so something must have happened. She’d have to ask him at some point.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When Rio was on her way out she stopped by Agatha’s desk. Agatha, trying to appear indifferent, didn’t look up. “If you’re here for another coffee I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. I only bought us one each.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“It hurts me that you think I only stick around because you buy me expensive presents.” Rio said in feigned offence. “Though if you were to bring me a diamond necklace tomorrow, I wouldn’t turn it down.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha finally looked up because she had to roll her eyes at that. She was sure that if there was a category in the Guinness Book Of World Records for the strongest eye muscles, she would win it in a landslide with how often she rolled her eyes at the silly things that Rio said.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When she looked at Rio’s face, Rio was wearing the smirk that Agatha had come to have a love-hate relationship with. “You’ve a long way to go before you’re at diamond necklace level. You’ll be lucky to get a second coffee.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio breathed out a laugh. “I can wait, don’t worry. I actually came to ask you if the meetings are back on. We never decided yesterday.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Like I said, that’s up to you. In terms of talking about your PhD, we don’t need to do it as often. You’re very self-sufficient in that regard.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio quirked an eyebrow. “I’m sensing a but.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“</span><em><span>But</span></em><span>,” Agatha continued. “If you wanted to continue helping me mark my essays, that would be greatly appreciated.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio chewed on her bottom lip as she thought. “I suppose I could do that. Wednesday then?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I have a couple of hours free now if you wanted?” Agatha said, probably too quickly. Was that too desperate? Was Rio going to be put off by it? </span><em><span>Shit save it!</span></em><span> “Or you can just check my schedule and pick a day and time. If I have an hour or more between lectures, those are the best times.” </span><em><span>Crushed it.</span></em> <span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio looked at the clock on the wall behind Agatha and then towards the door before looking back at Agatha. “I have something to do right now, I’m not sure how long it will take. If I can be at your office with enough time left then I will, but I can’t make any promises today.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha swallowed down the disappointment she felt beginning to rise. “That’s fine, there’s no pressure.” She returned her attention to gathering her things. “I’ll see you at some point.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“For sure.” Rio replied before making her way to the door and leaving the room.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>As soon as the door was closed Agatha let herself drop into the chair behind her. She rubbed her eyes then sighed and stared at the ceiling, not moving until the lights started to make her vision swim. Talking to Rio was harder now that she was acutely aware of the fact that she liked her. She was able to live in blissful ignorance before Jen and Lilia had forced to reckon with her feelings, but now it was torture.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She wished that she still had the confidence that her younger self had once possessed. Twenty year old Agatha would have had Rio by now, in every sense. But forty two year old Agatha was struggling to talk to her for fear of going too far and scaring her off.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When did talking to women become this hard?</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha eventually managed to pick herself up out of the chair, pack her things away and leave the lecture hall. She had no idea how long she had been sitting there for, nor did she want to know. She had spent too much time lately staring into space and thinking about Rio. She needed to get her shit together. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Since she didn’t know how much time she had left, she decided to take the lift up to her office instead of the stairs. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The reason that she usually gave people for taking the stairs was that the stairs were healthier. It was a good way to get her steps in and make sure she was still getting some exercise in her day. The truth, however, was that taking the lift meant that she had to walk past Wanda’s office and she had a very good reason to avoid going that way. But today she decided to brave it. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She regretted it almost instantly when the door to Wanda’s office started to open. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha practically threw herself around the corner diagonally across from it, hiding from view. She did not, under any circumstances, want an accidental run in with her ex. She had managed to avoid it for the better part of two and a half years and she wasn't going to add a blemish to that spotless record now. She waited for Wanda to leave but was surprised when it wasn’t Wanda that she saw. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio stepped out from the office and closed the door gently behind her, walking in the direction of the lift. Agatha watched her go, her mind swimming with questions.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Why was Rio in Wanda’s office?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>How had Rio and Wanda met?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Was this the first time Rio had been to Wanda’s office?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>What had they been talking about?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Had Wanda spun Rio a tall tale about Agatha?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Was Rio's head now filled with all of Wanda’s lies?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Did Rio know that Wanda was Billy’s mother?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Was this just another one of Wanda’s games?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>There were so many things she wanted, no, </span><em><span>needed</span></em><span> to know.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha got back into her office and her head was spinning, that seemed to be the theme of her day so far. It had been a long time since a woman had caused this many spirals in such a short amount of time. She hadn’t even felt like this with Wanda. Sure there were times when she was overthinking things whilst she was getting to know Wanda in the early stages of their relationship, but nothing on this level. Rio Vidal had knocked her for six and it had left her floundering. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her phone pinged with an email notification.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Agatha, </b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>My thing went longer than expected so I won’t be able to make it today, sorry.</b><b><br/>
</b><b>I’ll be there tomorrow though!</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Sorry again</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Rio</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Agatha had expected as much since Rio had immediately gone towards the lifts after leaving Wanda’s office, but she still didn’t know how to feel about Wanda being Rio’s aforementioned ‘thing’. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>What did Rio even mean by ‘thing’? What were they doing? Did this have something to do with Billy not saving her a seat today?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She knew she should probably reply to Rio’s email but she didn’t know what to say. She spent a few minutes thinking about her response before she just gave up and typed the first thing that came to her head.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Rio,</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>No worries, see you tomorrow!</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Agatha</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>She pressed send before she thought about it too much and found something to keep her busy until her alarm went off, prompting her to go to her next lecture.</span></p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Agatha was sitting in her office with the pile of essays in the middle of the coffee table and the marking sheet already open on her laptop. If Rio had looked up her schedule then she would know that Agatha had two hours of free time starting now, which meant that Rio could show up at any minute. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha had thought about buying them both a drink on her way back from her morning lecture but decided against it. Buying Rio a coffee two days in a row would be strange. Rio bought her one on Wednesday and she bought one for Rio on Thursday. They were even now, no need to turn this into a who-owes-who situation.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>After a few minutes there was a knock at her door and she waited a second before saying, “You may enter.” <br/>
</span>
<span>The door opened and Rio breezed in with an easy smile on her face. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Good afternoon.” Rio greeted her. “I hear that you need someone to show you how to properly mark essays.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio casually sat in her usual chair, pleased with her joke. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha played along. “Oh yes please. I’m so glad you’re here, Professor Vidal.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio’s smile widened, showing her teeth a little bit. “Professor Vidal? I like the sound of that.” She leaned back resting her elbows on the arm rests. “I’m definitely gonna come for your job now.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha smiled and pressed her tongue against her cheek. “If you think you’re good enough then by all means.” She leaned back, mimicking Rio’s current posture. “I’ll happily take an early retirement.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio scoffed. “You professors are so lazy.” She said sarcastically.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Exactly. Why do you think I’ve got you marking my coursework for me?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio’s eyes went comically wide and she pointed her finger in Agatha’s direction. “I knew it! You’re just using me!” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha smirked. “I’m glad we’re finally on the same page.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio shook her head and reached forwards, grabbing a section of the papers in front of her and one of the red biro pens that Agatha had put next to them. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha liked all of her markings to be in red ink, it looked more professional to her. More final. She had expected Rio to make a quip about it on Wednesday, but she had just let it go.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio leant back in her chair again, getting comfortable, but she sat back up again. “Oh I almost forgot.” She said as she reached into her bag and pulled out a medium sized brown paper bag and put it on the coffee table.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha furrowed her brows. “What’s this?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Pastries.” Rio casually replied as she took four different pastries out of the bag and put them on top of it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha’s confusion deepened. “You bought us pastries?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Yeah.” Rio said as she was wiping the crumbs from her fingers. “It’s lunch time. It’s also why I was a little bit late. Without you there to glare at them their sense of urgency is lacking.” She picked up what looked like a cinnamon swirl and settled back into her seat.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha looked at the pastries sceptically, trying to process exactly why Rio had bought them. It </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> lunch time but why had she bought four? She could have just got them one each, but she bought four different ones. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>First coffee, now pastries. What did this mean?</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“They’re not poisoned, Agatha.” Rio’s voice snapped her out of her thoughts and she held up her hand with her thumb and little finger tucked in. “Scouts honour.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha managed a smile and said, “Well my food tester isn’t here so I’m gonna have to take your word for it.” She picked up a pain au chocolat and took a small bite. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio watched her. “Well?”<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha held up her finger. “Give it a minute.” She waited for a bit before saying, “Nope, I think we’re good.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and went back to her stack of essays, mumbling. “See? Dionysus.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha laughed softly and picked up her own section of the papers.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The two of them worked in comfortable silence. They occasionally read sentences out to each other that impressed them in both negative and positive ways, and Rio sometimes asked Agatha to double check the score she’d given the essay. They made light work of the pastries, polishing them off within the first hour and Rio made a comment about needing to buy more next time – which of course made Agatha’s thoughts run a mile a minute.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Next time</span>
</em>
<span> implied that Rio wanted to do this again. </span>
<em>
<span>Next time</span>
</em>
<span> implied that Rio enjoyed spending time with Agatha. Is there a possibility that Rio would want to spend time with her off campus? Would she agree to a date-type scenario? </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha was nowhere near asking her, but the fact that there was the smallest chance that Rio would want to do it made her chest warm slightly.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Agatha!” She was brought out of her reverie by Rio loudly saying her name.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Hmm?” She hummed as she looked up at Rio.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Damn, you’re really into that one. I’ve been saying your name for like a full minute.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat. “Uh yeah, sorry. These sentences are really poorly written, I was trying to make sense of it.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Well now that I’ve got you, will you give this a look over for me? The score seems too high for how I’ve marked it.” Rio handed her the essay that she had just marked and she started adding it together to calculate the percentage mark. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Rio, you’ve given two of these sections a six. The highest it can go is five, and these are definitely not fives. And I can’t tell if this is a two or a three.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“What? No I haven’t.” Rio stood up out of her chair and walked round to Agatha. “Show me.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha pointed at the obvious 6 that was written in the margin. “It’s right there.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio leaned down over Agatha’s shoulder to get a closer look. As she did, some of her hair fell forward and brushed Agatha’s neck. It was light, a featherweight thing, but Agatha felt the tingle that it shot down her spine. This was the closest they had ever been in each other’s proximity and Agatha was very aware of it. She breathed in deep through her nose to steady herself and the once scentless air had notes of the earth that tickled her senses. She could faintly smell pine leaves and a slightly woody undertone. Was it cedarwood or sandalwood? </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Before she could stop herself, she took another breath through her nose. Definitely sandalwood.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She was about to take another breath, suddenly needing to breathe as much of this scent in as she could when she realised what she was doing. She was sniffing Rio. She was literally </span>
<em>
<span>sniffing</span>
</em>
<span> Rio. What the fuck was wrong with her?</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Thankfully Rio didn’t seem to notice. “Oh I see what I’ve done.” She reached out and pointed at the numbers. “These are fives but I’ve written them weirdly and when I was adding it up, I thought they were sixes.” She flipped to the next page while the essay was still in Agatha’s hand. “Yep those are twos but I read them as threes.” She straightened up and took the paper from Agatha, sitting back down in her chair and recalculating the score. “Ahh yeah. This makes more sense.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha was still in her pine and sandalwood infused daze, barely registering a word that Rio was saying. Her body was on autopilot, picking up the paper that was in her lap. Her eyes scanning the page but not taking in any of the words that were written on it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>What was it about the woman sitting across from her that made her lose any and all sense of herself when she was around her? </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> needed to get her shit together.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________ </span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Agatha’s kitchen was a mess. There was sauce on the kitchen counter, a piece of spaghetti stuck to the wall, and the skins of the many cloves of garlic that she had added to the dish were littering the floor. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She wiped her hands on her already stained apron and went to open the door to let Lilia and Jen in. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Jen was covering her eyes with her hand saying, “If I can’t see it, I can pretend that the mess doesn’t exist.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia patted Agatha on the shoulder. “Ignore her, she’s being dramatic. I’ll help you clean up.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I always ignore her, don’t worry.” Agatha stepped to the side to let them both in. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>All three of them filed into the kitchen and Jen spread her fingers slightly to survey the damage. “Oh, it’s not as bad as I ex-” She was cut off by the garlic skins crunching under her feet and scrunched her face in disgust. “I stand corrected.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia handed her a dustpan and brush. “Oh stop complaining Jennifer and make yourself useful.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The two of them were well aware of the fact that when it was Agatha’s turn to cook, they would have to come round slightly early to help with the clean up before they ate. It was part of the routine they had all established when these weekly dinners started. It didn’t stop Jen from making a comment about it every single time though, but Agatha liked the consistency. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha tried to subtly take the spaghetti off the wall and throw it in the bin without either of them noticing but Lilia clocked her. She didn’t say anything, she just smiled and shook her head. Lilia had told her, quite a few times now, that she didn’t have to throw the spaghetti at the wall to test if it was cooked, she could simply try a piece. Agatha was a creature of habit though, so she would continue to do it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Within ten minutes the kitchen was cleaned, the food was plated and they were sitting around the dining room table enjoying the carbonara that Agatha had prepared. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Your process might be sending me into an early grave, but I can’t deny that the results are always immaculate.” Jen said around her mouthful of food. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Thanks. My mother might have messed me up beyond repair, but at least she taught me how to cook.” Agatha said after taking a sip of her wine. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Lilia make a face. The face she makes when she has something to say but is trying to hide it. The woman might be a whizz at reading people and not giving anything away herself, but after all these years Agatha had managed to spot a few tells. Well, the tells that Lilia allowed her to spot anyway. Agatha sighed. “Go on Lilia. Share with the class.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia took a drink of her wine and put the glass down again. “I just don’t believe that anybody is beyond repair, that’s all.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Well I am and I like it that way. So don’t even think about it.” Agatha said in mock seriousness, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth.<br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia pretended to be offended. “Think about what? Doing a deep dive into your childhood and finally getting answers for…” She made a sweeping gesture over Agatha’s form. “This.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha lifted an eyebrow. “You just gestured to all of me.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Did I? Hmm, how strange.” Lilia said, smiling into her wine glass as she took another sip. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The conversation stayed light as they ate their meal and the accompanying dessert that Agatha had bought. She was a little on edge, waiting for one of them to bring up Rio. A topic she both did and didn’t want to cover. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She didn’t want to cover it because nothing had happened. Aside from calling each other by their first names and Agatha basically giving Rio permission to show up to her office as and when she wanted, she had made no progress. There was nothing to report.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>But she did want to cover it because talking things out with Lilia before had actually helped a bit. Not that she would tell her that. She needed to maintain some of her pride. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The trio moved into the living room with a fresh bottle of wine and settled into their usual seating arrangement. They continued talking, though not about anything in particular, and Agatha began to feel comfortable in the fact that neither of her friends was bringing up Rio. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The comfort didn’t last long because Jen just had to ask. “Oh what’s going on with Rio? Any developments there?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha looked down, suddenly very interested in the deep red liquid in her wine glass. <br/>
</span>
<span>Jen snorted softly. “If you don’t answer, Lilia will do it for you.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Maybe that would be easier. Having someone else voice her thoughts for her was preferable at this point, but she was an adult who could do it herself.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“There’s nothing to report really.” Agatha said after taking a sip of her wine and looking back up at Lilia and Jen.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She saw the corners of Lilia’s mouth twitch, but Lilia didn’t say anything. If Agatha didn’t know any better she would think that Lilia could actually hear people’s thoughts. <br/>
</span>
<span>Instead it was Jen that pressed for more information. “Explain ‘really’.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha sighed, though not out of annoyance. It was more out of the lack of information that she had to give them. “We’ve only spoken a handful of times. She’s helped me mark some essays. She bought me a coffee, I bought her a coffee. She bought us some pastries to share because we were working through lunch. Nothing of note.” She listed the mundane things that she had shared with Rio over the last few days. “I wish that I had more to bring to the council but alas, I do not.” She had another drink of her wine. The progress really had been slow, but Rio was talking to her so she would take what she could get.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia finally spoke up. “Despite what you might think, that is something to report.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha furrowed her brows. “How?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Because you’ve re-established contact. You’ve found something that the two of you can do together that still gives you time to talk and get to know each other. You’ve bought each other things. It might only be coffee and pastries but it’s still something. These small acts will add up, you just need to be consistent.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You could casually drop into conversation that you have access to the Harkness fortune. I bet that would speed things along.” Jen mumbled around her glass.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Yes, because buying Rio’s affection would be a stellar thing to do.” She said, the words dripping in sarcasm.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“It couldn’t hurt is all I’m saying.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha kept her financial situation very close to her chest. She had only told Lilia and Jen when she knew that she could trust them. She hadn’t even told Wanda. Whenever Wanda questioned how she could afford the things that she bought her and Billy, Agatha brushed it off with a comment about being good at saving and budgeting. She had been planning on telling Wanda after they were married, but she never got the chance. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>It wasn’t something that she flaunted, the money had come from her mother so she never really saw it as something that she had. It was just a product of her mother dying, and some expensive lawyers to make sure that her mother didn’t screw her over in her will. Her half-sister had gotten a small portion of it but Agatha got the bulk. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>As soon as she’d received the money she had put it straight into a savings account, vowing to only use it on things that would make her mother spin in her grave – like gifts for her long-term girlfriend, an engagement ring for the woman she was planning to marry, or donating to LGBTQ+ charities. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She didn’t like to use it on things like cars or houses because it felt like her mother was the one buying those things for her and, even though the woman had been dead for twenty two years, she never wanted to feel like she was indebted to her mother. If she dipped into it for any of those things, it was out of necessity. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia gave Jen a vexed look. “Once again, Agatha, I’m going to tell you to ignore our dear Jennifer.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha smiled. “Always.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes. “Well what would you suggest is the next step for our loveable but useless lesbian?” She asked Lilia. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I resent that!” Agatha jumped in. “I’m very good at being a lesbian thank you very much.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Not currently.” Jen smirked.<br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia laughed. “Actually, from what I know about how lesbians operate in the dating scene, pining after a woman and doing nothing about it is akin to asking her to marry and start a family with you.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Very true.” Jen raised her glass to Lilia who mimicked the movement, but they were too far away to actually knock them together so they just took a sip in unison.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
Agatha huffed out disgruntled noise. “Neither of you are any help.”<br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia put her now empty glass down on the end table that was next to her chair. “Jen does have a point though. It’s great that you’ve got to a place where you can talk to Rio in a more casual way, but you can’t stay there forever. Other than when you’re face to face, how do you communicate?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“We email.” Agatha stated matter-of-factly. How else did Lilia expect them to talk? Did she think Agatha sent a telegram to wherever Rio was at the moment she wanted to contact her?</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“So do you think you could segue into texting maybe? Remove some more of the formality?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Oh. That made more sense than a telegram. God, she was bad at this.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The surprise at the simple suggestion must have been evident on Agatha’s face because Jen piped up again. “I swear you weren’t this useless with Wanda.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha turned to face Jen. “That’s because Wanda made all of these moves. She was the one who asked for my number and then asked me on a date.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Jen started refilling her glass. “You were the one who got on one knee though. You </span>
<em>
<span>can</span>
</em>
<span> make these leaps.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia held her glass out for Jen to fill and Agatha knocked the rest of hers back before following suit. “And we all know how well that ended.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Glass freshly filled, Lilia settled back into her chair, fixing her eyes on Agatha. “You can’t keep using your past experiences as an excuse to run from future ones. Think of a way to give Rio your number and then work on a way to meet her somewhere that isn’t your office or a lecture hall.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha wished that it was that simple. She wished that could just ask Rio out without any fear of potential repercussions. If Rio wasn’t a student, if Rio wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> student, then it would be easier. She had already had one office romance go bad and was still dealing with the fallout, she couldn’t stomach another. If she, or moreover Lilia, had read the situation wrong and these were unwanted advances on Rio's side, then Rio could report her and end her career. There were more things to consider than just ‘will she say yes to a date?’ </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You’re gonna give yourself a headache if you keep spiralling like that.” Jen said softly.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha sighed quietly. “I know. It’s just hard not to get bogged down by the negatives.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Jen gave a gentle nod and Lilia said, “We can work this out together, but you will need to move forward at some point.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha nodded and smiled, though it didn't reach her eyes.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>A moment passed before Jen broke the silence. “Oh!” She said loudly, making both Agatha and Lilia jump. She smiled sheepishly before continuing. “Sorry, I didn’t realise I’d be that loud. You have that end of year thing right? In December?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Yeah?” Agatha questioned her sceptically.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Ask Rio to go with you!”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia’s expression morphed from the shock of Jen’s loud exclamation to one of excitement at the idea. “That’s a good idea actually. It’s still affiliated with the university so it’s not too far removed to be an out-of-left-field suggestion, but it’s also off campus so you won’t have the hang-ups that come with that.” She looked at Jen. “Well done, Jennifer.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Jen gave a smug smile at the praise.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha pointed in Jen’s direction but kept looking at Lilia. “What happened to ignoring her?” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“That’s only when she’s commenting on the state of your kitchen or suggesting that you should become a sugar daddy. She’s right about this and you can’t deny it.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha took a healthy gulp of her wine. “You both know that I don’t attend those events </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> the reasons why.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Maybe it’s time to move on.” Lilia said gently.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes and carefully put her wine glass down, centring it perfectly on the coaster. She was putting a great amount of effort into not snapping her response at Lilia. “I have told you the hell that my life was turned into when Wanda manipulated every member of staff in our department, including the cleaners.” She spoke slowly, making sure to keep her voice steady, controlled. “I was cast out. Removed from text chains and group chats without a second thought. I was purposefully left out of department events, birthday dinners, bottomless brunches, and you want me to just </span>
<em>
<span>move on</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The suggestion made Agatha’s blood boil. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Jen cleared her throat and looked scared when Agatha’s gaze whipped her way. She took a moment to choose her words. “You can’t take steps forward if you’re always looking behind you, Agatha. What Wanda did was horrible and the fact that she turned everyone against you makes me so angry on your behalf, but you can’t let it rule your life. It’s time that you reclaim some of the things she took from you. There are no written rules that say you can’t attend the end of year ball. Go with Rio and have some fun.” She said in earnest, her voice and eyes soft.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You can’t have a future if you’re stuck living in the past.” Lilia added on.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha knew that they were right. She knew that this was something they’d been wanting to say for a long time, and she couldn’t deny that they had a point</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
<span> She could hold a grudge for as long as she wanted but it wouldn’t achieve anything. It wouldn’t erase anything that had happened and it wouldn’t aid her in moving past it – which she did want to do. She could wait a lifetime for people to come to her and apologise for the way that they treated her. She could live in fear of what people would say if she went to the ball, or she could face it head on like an adult. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She looked down at her hands momentarily before taking a long breath in through her nose and exhaling through her mouth. “Okay.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Jen raised an eyebrow. “Okay?”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Okay.” Agatha repeated. “I’ll think of a way to give Rio my number, and I’ll ask her to go to the end of year thing with me. I’m not sure how though. I don’t think ‘sorry I was weird, I wanted you’ would be the best course of action.” She gave a light chuckle. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Lilia tilted her head. “You never know.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>All three of them laughed and finished the bottle of wine, moving the conversation to a different topic to close out the evening.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Agatha strode into the lecture hall on Monday morning and cast an eye over the students waiting for her to begin the lecture. Billy, Alice and Rio were all sitting together in the centre, the anomaly of Thursday morning seeming to be sorted. Agatha unwrapped her straw and slid it into her iced coffee, her regular order now having changed to a new one courtesy of Rio Vidal. She noticed that Rio had one of her own sitting on the folding table that was attached to her chair and when Rio caught her looking, she raised it with a small smile. Agatha raised hers in return and Billy leaned over to say something to Rio, but she was too far away to catch any of it. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She gave her lecture on the weapons of Greek Mythology and had to stifle a smile when she saw both Billy and Rio’s reaction to the inclusion of Percy Jackson’s sword ‘Riptide’ in one of the slides. She wasn’t originally going to put it in, but she knew that it would make them both happy so she amended the slide on Sunday night.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When the lecture was over, all of the students filed out of the room, Billy smiled at her as he walked past her but Rio hung back. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“You know that you’re a PhD student right?” Agatha asked, walking round her desk to lean against it. “You don’t need to beg for extra credit.” She crossed her arms and smiled.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio gave a low laugh. “Oh believe me, if I wanted extra credit from you I’d get it.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I’m sorry to inform you that it’ll take more than a coffee and a couple of sweet treats to win me over.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“Don’t worry, I have my ways.” Rio said, stepping closer.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>They were in the same position they had been in when Rio had confronted Agatha after her lecture a couple of weeks ago. Except the situation was different. This wasn’t Rio demanding that Agatha explain her decision of cancelling their meetings. This was a conversation between two acquaintances with the lightest amount of flirting mixed in. Agatha’s hands were restless again, but unlike the last time she knew why. She wanted to reach out, to touch Rio. She wanted to pull Rio closer and- </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“So why are you hanging around after a lecture if it isn’t to boost your mark?” Agatha asked before her thoughts could get out of hand. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio pulled out her phone and showed it to Agatha. It was her schedule. “I checked your schedule, you have a couple of hours before your next lecture and, I’m assuming, the essays aren’t going to mark themselves.” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha pushed herself off of the desk and started to pack up her things. “You know, if you keep spending this much time with me, people are gonna start to talk.” She turned back around to face Rio. “They might think you're my favourite student.” She punctuated the sentence with a wink and walked ahead to go to her office. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She had no idea where the wink came from, but she wasn’t going to dwell on it.  </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio fell into step beside her. “Do you want me to grab us some snacks again?” She asked as the café came into view. “Or would that kickstart the horrific rumours that you don’t hate all of your students?” She smirked.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha pretended to think for a moment. “Hmm. I’m sure that my reputation could survive . Also, I’m not gonna turn down free snacks.”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio bought them another selection of pastries, and a coffee each, and they carried on to Agatha’s office. Agatha took them via the lift instead of the stairs, not because she was in a great rush, but because Jen and Lilia were right. She needed to reclaim things, and one of those things was the short way to her office. However she told Rio it was because she didn’t trust her to carry the coffees up the stairs and not drop them.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When they stepped out of the lift, Agatha didn’t hesitate when it came to passing Wanda’s office. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>“You can’t take steps forward if you’re always looking behind you, Agatha.”</span>
</em>
<span><br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>“You can’t have a future if you’re stuck living in the past.” </span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<span>She recalled Jen and Lilia’s words as she walked, keeping her head held high until they arrived at her own office. She unlocked the door and let them both in, holding the door open for Rio to walk through, and they got to work on the essays. Between them they’d managed to get through all of the first year essays – Rio had marked both Billy and Alice's work and Agatha had double checked them to make sure Rio hadn’t padded their marks out because they were her friends, but she had marked them fairly – and were now on to the second and final years. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio was still a little more forgiving in her marking than Agatha would have liked, but it wasn’t going to do any damage so she let her keep doing it. There was no use starting an argument.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Tuesday was the day that Agatha held her office hours. A few of her better final years had taken the time to bring the research designs for their dissertations for her to look over before they submitted them. She had high hopes for these students, they actually put the work in and didn’t leave everything until the night before the deadline. Which was more than could be said for the rest of them. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She had sat through so many presentations on the tomb of Tutankhamun and how the ancient Romans did wonders for modern plumbing in the last couple of weeks that she was starting to regret specialising in ancient Egypt and ancient Rome as well as ancient Greece.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>It was refreshing when she was given a proposal by one student on how Hippocrates had greatly influenced modern medicine, and she was genuinely excited to read the full dissertation when it was written. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She had just finished giving advice to a student who could not have cared any less when her laptop let her know that she had a new email. She dismissed the student and opened it.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Agatha,</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>I know you have office hours today, so I won’t take time away from your other students. Gotta make sure those rumours don’t fly!</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Rio</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>Oh how she wished she was marking essays with Rio instead of dealing with the riff raff that kept trailing its way in and out of her office. Maybe she could rope Rio into helping with this too. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>No, she couldn’t subject her to this, that would be cruel. Also Rio wasn’t her teaching assistant, so there would be no need for her to do it.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Rio,</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Oh please come save me from this hell. I swear there’s barely a brain cell between my final years.</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>She paused in writing her response. Would now be a good time to suggest that they move from emailing to texting? The worst that could happen is that Rio rejects the idea, right? There’s no need to overthink this. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She continued typing.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Also we don’t have to keep using the formality of emails if you don’t want to. </b>
</p><p align="justify">
<b>My number is: 07879871102</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>There’s no pressure though, it’s completely up to you.</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Agatha</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>She pressed send, the </span>
<em>
<span>whoosh</span>
</em>
<span> noise letting her know that she couldn't take it back now. A minute passed, then another, then another. No response from Rio. Maybe it had been too forward. Maybe she felt awkward and didn’t know how to respond saying that she didn’t want to move on from emailing. Maybe she was emailing the Dean and letting him know that Professor Harkness had tried to give her her number. If that was the case then she was screwed. She could say goodbye to her career. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Her phone buzzed on her desk next to her, freeing her from her thoughts. It was two messages from an unknown number.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Unknown: I’ve never been given a number via email before. </b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Is this how you had to date back in your day?</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Unknown: This is Rio btw not some rando who intercepted your email</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>Agatha breathed out a laugh, she could imagine Rio laughing to herself, thinking that she’s hilarious. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She saved the number and replied.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<b>Agatha: Actually back in my day we caught and trained pigeons to carry our mail. Now the government uses them as spies. This is a downgrade if you ask me!</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>Rio: Hey don’t rag on pigeons, they’re hella smart</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b>During both world wars pigeons were used to carry messages that helped save lives and win battles. They were even given medals for it</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile at her phone as she read the message. Of course Rio would know random facts about pigeons. Why would Agatha have thought anything to the contrary?</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>They texted a few more times before Agatha had to go give a lecture and her good mood couldn’t even be brought down by the lacklustre attitudes of her final year students.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________ </span>
</p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha was sitting in her office opposite Rio. They were both marking their own pile of essays in comfortable silence, pastries on the table between them, and an iced coffee for each of them. It felt nice. It felt </span><em><span>normal.</span></em> <span><br/>
</span><span>She saw Rio shift in front of her and stand up, but Agatha didn’t look up at her, she remained reading the essay she was reading – though she had been staring at these papers for so long that the words were no longer making sense.</span><span><br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span><span>Rio walked around the table to where Agatha was sitting and crouched down next to her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Still not removing her eyes from the paper, she asked “Can I help you, Rio?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“You were just concentrating so hard, I had to come and see it for myself.” Rio gently put her hand over the one Agatha was using to hold the essay and tilted it so that she could get a better view of the paper. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>The contact finally made Agatha look at Rio. But Rio wasn’t looking at the essay, she was looking directly at Agatha. Their eyes locked and Agatha felt her breathing start to quicken and how close they were.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio smiled softly. “Your eyes are so blue. I could look at them forever.” She reached up with her other hand and gently brushed a few strands of hair from Agatha’s cheek, letting her hand rest on Agatha’s face. She leaned in by an inch, ever so slightly closing the already small gap between them. “I don’t want to mark these essays any more.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio was now close enough that Agatha could smell the coffee on her breath, but she didn’t mind. It brought her a strange sense of comfort.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She swallowed, trying to calm the feeling in her chest. “What do you suggest we do instead?” She heard the waiver in her voice, felt the weakness in her knees even though she was sitting down.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio’s eyes flickered down to her lips and she slowly leaned in again, but stopped just millimetres away from making contact. “I’ll only kiss you if you want me to.” Rio’s voice was barely above a whisper but Agatha felt it vibrate through her entire body.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her own voice was quiet when she spoke. “I do.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio moved her gaze back up to Agatha’s eyes and smiled. She stayed like that for a few seconds before finally leaning in the rest of the way and filling the space between them.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Their lips had barely touched before Agatha’s eyes flew open and she found herself staring into the darkness of her bedroom. The crushing weight of realisation that it had been a dream sat on top of her, pinning her to the mattress. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She brought her hands up to her face and rubbed circles around her eyes, trying to wipe the dream from her memory. But every second of it stayed printed on the backs of her eyelids.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was fucked.</span></p>

<p>
<span>Rio stood in the shower trying to process the new information that she had found out wholly against her will. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was fucking her friends mom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It definitely wasn’t the first time that she had fucked someone's mom, but it was one hundred percent the first time that she had </span>
<em>
<span>known</span>
</em>
<span> about it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>How the fuck was she supposed to deal with this?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The skin on her hands was starting to prune with how long she had been standing under the water, so she turned the shower off, wrapped herself in her towel and sat on her bed.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was going to have to talk to both Wanda and Billy about this but she had no idea how to navigate that conversation. There wasn’t a rule book for something like this, even though there really should be.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Maybe she could write one if she managed to make it out of this situation alive.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda didn’t text her to let her know that Billy had left. She probably realised that Rio would need time to work through this revelation and left her alone for the night, which Rio was grateful for. She had no idea what she would even say right now. What </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> she say right now?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It would be easy for her to go on the attack and blame Wanda for keeping this secret but Wanda hadn’t actually done anything wrong. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She had mentioned before that Billy had asked her not to let anyone know that she was his mother, all she had done was comply with his wishes. Rio couldn’t hold that against her, it wouldn’t be fair, but she would be lying if she didn’t say that she was a little put out by it. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She forced herself to stand up and dry herself off, getting into her pyjamas and crawling into bed. It wasn’t even ten o’clock but she was so mentally exhausted that she just wanted to get comfy and close her eyes.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When she woke the next morning she felt a little bit better. There was still a pit in her stomach but it wasn’t as bad as it had been yesterday evening. She checked the time and saw that she had about forty minutes until Agatha’s lecture. She hadn’t decided if she was going to go. Would it be too awkward with Billy? </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She had only just started to accept Agatha’s apology so would it be too soon? </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She rolled out of bed and started to get ready. She didn’t actually need to be there so if she wanted to leave then she could just leave without an excuse. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was surprised when Agatha called her over and said that she’d bought her a coffee. Rio had actually forgotten about buying her one the day before, the fact that Agatha would want to return the favour had never crossed her mind. She was grateful that she had though because she hadn’t had enough time to buy one before the lecture.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When she was looking for a seat neither Billy nor Alice looked at her. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>That was fine. She should have known that Billy would tell Alice that he’d seen Rio at his moms house with her shirt on fucking backwards, making lame excuses as to why she was there.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It probably would have been better for everyone if she had said </span>
<em>
<span>“Hey Billy, I’m fucking your mom. Hope that’s chill with you buddy”</span>
</em>
<span> instead of choosing that moment to remember that English is her second language, and struggling to form a coherent sentence.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Midway through the lecture her phone buzzed in her pocket. She slowly took it out, careful to not alert Agatha to the fact that she was using her phone. A habit she had kept from her undergrad days. Of course it didn’t matter now if she was on her phone during a lecture as she didn’t actually have to attend them. She still hid it under the desk that was attached to the seat all the same and read the message.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Wanda: Can we talk in my office later?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>As much as Rio wanted to remind Wanda of the ‘no talking on a personal level’ rule, she knew that she had to break it on this occasion. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: What time?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Wanda: 1ish? </b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>Rio checked the time, one o’clock was when this lecture finished so that worked out pretty well. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: Sure</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>Wanda didn’t reply again so Rio slipped her phone back into her pocket and watched the rest of the lecture.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________ </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was standing outside Wanda’s office waiting to knock on the door. She suddenly felt very nervous about how this conversation was going to go.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She knocked gently and waited for Wanda’s “come in” before entering.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda was sitting at her desk, but there was no work in front of her and her laptop was closed.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Thank you for coming.” She said with a small smile.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio just nodded and walked further into the room. Her eyes scanned Wanda’s desk, once again taking in the differences between her and Agatha’s offices. She found the picture frame that she had seen the first time that she had been in Wanda’s office, except now it was facing outwards. The picture in it there for everyone to see. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It was a picture of three people. One was obviously Wanda, a happy smile on her face and her hair being carried by the wind. Beside her stood a tall man with the sleeves of his shirt rolled up to his elbows and one of his arms around Wanda’s shoulders, his smile just as happy. In the middle of them was a boy, no older than eight, with a wide, toothy grin and the red hue of sunburn colouring his nose. His hair was the same colour as Wanda’s. It was obviously Billy before he had found his first box of black dye.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio pointed towards the picture. “If only I’d seen this sooner huh?” She said in an attempt at humour.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda’s gaze followed her to the picture. “In your defence, it used to be facing the other way.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“True.” Rio took her bag off and dropped it next to a chair before sitting down. She guessed that this conversation was going to take a while. “Still, I should have guessed. He always got this look whenever someone mentioned you.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Am I a topic that comes up often in your circle of friends?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh definitely. I’ve told them all about how in love we are and they’ve been helping me plan the wedding!” Rio said in fake excitement which made Wanda scoff out a laugh. Rio continued. “Billy and Alice have been picking Eddie's brain about what second year is like, and he mentioned you. Said you were his favourite lecturer and everything.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Well, that’s something at least.” Wanda laughed lightly. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio looked down at her hands that were resting in her lap, unsure how to phrase her next question. “Did he, or did you, mention anything after I left?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda sighed and leant back in her chair. “He didn’t say much. He clearly didn’t believe that you were there borrowing a book.” She leveled Rio with a look. “Nice job with that, by the way. You couldn’t have come up with anything else?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh well I’m sorry. I was too busy trying to process the fact that I’ve been sleeping with my friend's mom." She spread her arms in mild annoyance. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“There isn’t much sleeping involved.” Wanda said quietly.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Hence the need for this conversation.” Rio looked at Wanda and saw something flash across her face. Was it hurt? Or was it regret? Rio couldn’t tell. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Knowing that Wanda had a son obviously hadn’t deterred Rio from having sex with her, it didn’t pose any kind of issue for her. But knowing that Wanda’s son was someone that she was friends with, someone that she was in a band with, someone that she spent a significant amount of time with? That was causing a conflict inside Rio’s mind. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>If he had been literally any other first year student, it would not have been a problem. There would be no need for Rio to be sitting in Wanda’s office, fully clothed and talking it out.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They had both agreed that talking wasn’t something that they needed to do. The things that they did do, they were both very good at. And while it may have left Rio feeling unfulfilled in some ways, it definitely hadn’t in others.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>But Wanda’s son wasn’t any other first year student. He was Billy. Rio had made so many ‘your mom’ jokes to him without knowing how true they were. And that was a problem.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda shifted in her seat, feeling the awkwardness of the situation settle over her the same way that Rio did. “I think we both need to talk to Billy. Separately, I mean.” She added on when she saw Rio’s eyes widen. “And then we should reconvene and figure out where to go from there. I don’t want to stop seeing you, but I’d understand if you didn’t want to continue.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio nodded. Wanda was right, they both needed to have a conversation with Billy and see where he stood about it. Rio couldn’t see him being cool with it, but she would be a shitty friend if she didn’t check in with him about it. She could probably get over it and continue to sleep with Wanda, but if Billy asked her to stop then she absolutely would. No questions asked. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The last thing she wanted was to upset him. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I agree. We should speak to Billy.” She reached for her bag but stopped and sat up straight again. “I do have a question though.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda gestured for her to continue.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“You knew the whole time that I was friends with him. I sent you that picture of the band practise and he was clearly identifiable in it. I know that he’s mentioned me to you, he was telling you about the bonfire when he saw me trying to sneak out. Why didn't you say something?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda ran a hand through her hair in thought. “Because he asked me not to tell anyone that we were related. He didn’t want me embarrassing him and also didn’t want any special treatment – or not-so-special treatment. I knew that you’d both find out eventually, I just thought that I’d be able to control it more. But the universe did what the universe does I guess.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“You didn’t think that it was something I should know?” Rio understood that Wanda had been respecting Billy asking her not to tell anyone, but surely there had to come a point where she would have thought about telling her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda let out a heavy sigh. “No, Rio. Clearly I didn’t.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio dipped her brows. Was Wanda actually annoyed at the suggestion? Was she annoyed at Rio for not just accepting it and saying </span>
<em>
<span>“I don’t care, take your clothes off.”</span>
</em>
<span>? Rio had never been in this type of situation before and it was safe to say that she wasn’t a fan of it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda spoke again, filling the silence that was starting to take over the room. “Look, I didn’t intend on the two of you finding out this way, obviously. But it’s happened now and we can’t take it back. It’s not going to do any of us any good if we keep dwelling on it.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“You can’t seriously be suggesting that we just move on from this like nothing has happened.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I’m not suggesting that. Like I said, we both need to talk to Billy and then </span>
<em>
<span>we</span>
</em>
<span>,” she gestured between the two of them, “need to have another conversation.” She leaned forwards and rested her arms on her desk. “Yes, maybe this could have been avoided if I was upfront with you about Billy, but we’re both in this now and we both need to sort it out.” She started picking at her cuticles. “I would just like to mention that you were the one who didn’t want us to talk outside of having sex. It wasn’t like you gave me the opportunity to tell you.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio didn’t like the fact that Wanda was trying to imply that she was a fully complicit partner in this. If she’d had the smallest inkling that Billy was her son then she never would have slept with Wanda. This had all gotten out of hand and there was no way that Rio was going to take equal blame for it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Don’t try to blame me for this. This is information that you purposefully withheld, and the situation we’re in now is a direct result of that.” Rio kept her voice even and calm despite the fact that she was starting to feel the heat rising in her chest.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda’s eyes narrowed. “I’m not trying to play the ‘blame game’ with you Rio. I’m just saying that the line of communication wasn’t exactly open on your end. And forgive me for assuming that ‘my son is actually really good friends with you, now do that thing with your tongue that I like’ isn’t a pick-up line that you would like to hear.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio ran her hands down her cheeks. Wanda still wasn’t getting it. “I’m aware that ‘no talking’ is one of the rules that I have, but that is in regards to having conversations that could make this feel like it’s more than just sex. It doesn’t mean that we should keep things from each other that affect other people, Wanda.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The fact was that this now included more than just the two of them. This shouldn’t have anything to do with Billy, but his involvement had now been forced onto him. He’s just a kid. And while Rio didn’t know the nature of Wanda’s relationship with her ex-husband, or the relationship that came after that, Billy was probably pretty young when it ended and he didn’t need to see his mom bringing random people back to his house – especially people that he had built a completely separate friendship with.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had watched her cousins go through a similar thing and she saw how it had affected them. They were only a few years older than her so they were very close and when their parents were having problems, they basically moved in with her and her parents. Then when her tía and tío finally got divorced nearly a year later, her cousins moved back in with their mom only to have to see whoever her flavour of the month was every time it changed. And those men were not the type to care about someone else's kids.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Her tía had mellowed out in the last decade, but the damage had already been done and Rio didn’t want to be the reason that someone else went through that.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda, who was still picking at her fingers, now looked down at her hands. “I know. You’re right. I should have thought about Billy more and I didn’t. He usually doesn’t come home during the week so I really wasn’t expecting him that day. I could have handled it better instead of putting it all on you in that moment. I’m sorry.” Her voice got quieter as she spoke and her shoulders sank.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio still wasn’t happy with everything but the rising anger that she had felt had simmered down as Wanda talked. “We both need to talk to him and then discuss from there. He’s the most important person in this.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda looked back up at Rio and nodded. “I agree. Let me know when you’re ready to talk to me again.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I will.”  </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>And with that Rio left. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was about to exit the building when she remembered Agatha asking her to mark essays again. She definitely wasn’t in the right headspace for it right now so she emailed her a quick apology and said that she’d be there tomorrow instead. Right now she needed to go home and figure out how she was even going to begin to approach Billy.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When she had kicked off her shoes, she threw herself down on the couch. She had predicted things with Wanda ending badly, they always did, but she hadn’t planned for something like this. She found herself suddenly feeling sorry for Billy. Was it a common occurrence for Wanda to not factor him in? Maybe the things that her cousins experienced were making her overthink this, but she couldn’t shake the feeling. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She remembered her revelation from a couple of months ago about Agatha being Wanda’s ex – it still wasn’t confirmed, but the evidence spoke for itself. Especially when she thought about the fact that Agatha never took the lift. She had told Rio that it was because the stairs took her past the café, but Rio had her suspicions that it was actually because going to the lift meant that she had to walk past Wanda’s office. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She had no idea how long Agatha and Wanda had been together but since it was an actual real relationship, there was no way that Agatha hadn’t known about Billy. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Was that why they broke up? Because of the way that Wanda treated him?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio cast her mind back to the first few lectures of the semester. Billy had been terrified to speak up, to answer questions. Was it because he’d had to witness a messy break-up between his mom and Agatha?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>That poor kid. Rio definitely needed to make this right with him.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p>
<span>The decision to buy pastries for her and Agatha to share on Friday afternoon wasn’t one that required much thinking. In fact, Rio didn’t think anything of it until Agatha seemed confused when she put them on the table.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>This was something that Rio had done with her supervisors during her masters. If they were going to be working through lunch, it was a normal thing for her to do. She should have guessed that Agatha wouldn’t have received this treatment from any of her students – the persona that she had crafted wasn’t very welcoming of things like this – but the way that Agatha looked so stunned by the mere prospect of Rio providing them with food was so cute to her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was slowly but surely thawing out the cold-hearted front that Agatha presented to the world.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio didn’t do much on Saturday. She tended to her plants, clipping back the ones that needed it and making sure they had enough water and light. She gently stroked the long thin leaves of the dragon plant that she had put in the corner next to the doors to the balconette. “Don’t tell the others, but you’re my favourite.” She said in a hushed voice.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Her friends often made fun of her for being a ‘crazy plant lady’ and the first time they had caught her talking to the plants that she kept in her house in Virginia, they had laid into her about it for days.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>All of her plants back home had names and the ones in England were no exception.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She thought about messaging Billy to see if he wanted to talk but was unsure if she should let him come to her first. She had no idea when Wanda was planning on talking to him and what she would say when she did. Would he want to talk to her, or would he rather just pretend like he didn’t know anything?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She decided to message him anyway and give him the option.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: Hey, would you like to meet me before practise tomorrow to talk?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>She wasn’t expecting a quick reply, if anything she thought that it would be a few hours before Billy texted her back, but her phone buzzed just a few minutes later.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Billy: Sure wanna get there an hour early?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Rio: Sounds good!</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>His quick compliance put Rio at ease a bit. Maybe he wouldn’t be mad. Maybe he really hadn’t noticed her inside out and backwards shirt. Maybe he just didn’t care.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a breath as she scanned her student card on the door to the music room – she had finally gotten the access added and the others no longer needed to prop the door open for her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy was already there, plugging in his amp and pedal board and tuning his guitar so that he was ready to go when the others got there.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>He looked up at the sound of the door opening. “Hi!” He greeted Rio with his usual bright smile.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Hey.” She greeted him back as she walked further into the room. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy put his guitar on the stand and turned to fully face her. “What did you want to talk about?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Did he really not know? Or was he just playing it cool?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio sat down on the drum stool and tapped lightly on the snare with her fingertips, not knowing where to begin. “The other night. At your mom’s house.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Ahh.” He nodded like he’d just caught on. “Yes, the night you came over to borrow a book.” He pulled one of the chairs that were at the edge of the room into the centre so that he could sit facing her. “What about it?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio sighed. He was going to make her say it. He wanted to hear it from her. “I wasn’t there to borrow a book.” She stated plainly. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>His mouth fell open and his eyes went wide. “No! Really?” His tone was drenched in sarcasm and he dramatically put his hand on his chest for extra effect.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes at his dramatics. “Oh okay, dickhead. I’m trying to have a serious moment here.” She wasn’t mad, she actually preferred that he was being his usual self about this. It made her feel more relaxed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He smiled. “I’m sorry, but the fact that your shirt was inside out kinda gave you away. Also the fact that you’d come from upstairs. I know my mum keeps some books in her office, but I’m willing to bet that you don’t know what that room looks like, or that it even existed in the first place.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She did know that Wanda had a home office actually, she had bent Wanda over the mahogany desk quite a few times. But he didn’t need to know that.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rubbed the back of her neck. “Are you mad about it?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>He looked at the ground briefly before he replied. “I was, but I got over it pretty quickly. You didn’t know that she was my mum and you’re both consenting adults. There’s not much that I can be mad at really.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>For an eighteen year old boy, he was surprisingly emotionally mature.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio blew out a breath. “Well I’m glad. Is there anything that you want to ask me about?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>He screwed his face up in disgust. “Ew, no thank you. Keep that between you and my mum please.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“No, I didn’t mean about… I meant in general you twat.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I know, I just like messing with you.” Rio rolled her eyes and he continued. “I spoke to my mum about it a couple of days ago and she pretty much covered everything.” Rio braced slightly, not knowing what Wanda had told him. “She said you ran into each other in a bar and went home together. Then you kept going home together. It’s a love story for the ages, actually. People will write songs about it.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She picked up one of the drumsticks that was laying across the floor tom and gently threw it in his direction. “I wouldn’t have…” She trailed off, not wanting to actually say it to him. “If I knew that she was your mom. I don’t make a habit of doing </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> with my friend’s moms.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>He picked the drumstick up and tossed it back to her. “I know you wouldn’t have. That’s why I’m not mad at you, or her.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She twirled the stick around her fingers a couple of times. “Would you be mad if we didn’t stop?” She asked gingerly, testing his response.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>He thought for a moment and Rio waited, letting him take his time. “I mean, if you two both want to then I can’t stop you. I just don’t want to know about it.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It was the best response he could have given and Rio was once again in awe of how emotionally mature he was. “And you said that I wasn’t her type. Guess you’re not as smart as you think.” She smirked.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“You’re not her type based on the two people that I know she’s been in relationships with.” He said as he stood up and picked up his guitar. “One is my dad who is a blonde, soft spoken golden retriever and also a </span>
<em>
<span>man.</span>
</em>
<span> The other is a sharp-tongued woman who commands every room that she walks into. From what I know about you, you don’t fit into either of those categories.” He gave her a cheeky grin and tapped some stomp boxes on his pedal board. “Do you wanna jam until the others get here? I just learned Crazy Train.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio picked up the other stick. “Ready when you are.”</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy had saved Rio a seat again when she walked into the lecture on Monday morning. She shimmied her way down the aisle and slid into the chair next to him. He pointed to her iced coffee. “How have you not developed diabetes from those things yet?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I’m just built different.” Rio shrugged.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha walked in and started setting up her laptop and Rio noticed that she only had an iced coffee this time. She’d fully changed her order because Rio had annoyed her into trying a different one.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio raised her coffee slightly in a silent acknowledgement and Agatha returned the gesture. Billy leaned over to her and said, “So you bin my mum off and move on to Agatha? That’s cold, Vidal.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Don’t talk to me that way, young man. I have access to your essays.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Alice leaned over to join in. “You’ve read our essays? How? What mark did we get?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio put her hands up. “I can’t divulge that information kids, I’m sworn to secrecy.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh come on.” Billy begged. “Put us out of our misery, please.” He drew the vowel out. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio put her hand on her chest in feigned offense. “You want me to betray the trust that the great Professor Harkness has placed in me? I’m ashamed of you both.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They were about to plead their cases when Agatha dimmed the lights and started the lecture. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha was teaching about the weapons used in various Greek myths and Billy and Rio exchanged a very excited look when a picture of Percy Jackson’s sword flashed up on screen and got a special mention. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They had bonded over their shared love of the Percy Jackson books in the pub and had a very in-depth conversation comparing the show and the musical to the book, and also spent a good portion of that time shit-talking the movies.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had checked Agatha’s schedule before she left her flat that morning and knew that she had some time free now to mark more essays. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio enjoyed spending time with Agatha again, especially since Agatha had removed the stick that she used to keep tightly shoved up her ass. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio bought them both another drink and some more pastries and they made their way up to Agatha’s office.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The essay pile had dwindled since they’d marked all of the ones from the first years, but they still had all of the second and final years to do.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had worked through her first chunk and leant forwards to pull another into her lap. “Do you usually do all of these by yourself?” She asked in disbelief.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Yeah, at the end of every semester.” Agatha replenished her own pile of papers. “Having you here is making it so much easier though, so thank you.” She smiled at Rio. A genuine, thankful smile.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Well, not all heroes wear capes, as they say.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha hummed. “That’s true. Some wear leather jackets and converse." She looked at Rio over the frame of her glasses for a second before looking back down at the essay in her hands.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Towards the end of the day Rio messaged Wanda.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: I spoke to Billy yesterday, when do you want to talk?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Wanda: Does tonight work for you? He definitely won’t be making a surprise visit</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Rio: Sounds good, what time?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Wanda: 6ish?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Rio: See you then</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>Rio holed up in the library until she had to set off walking to Wanda’s house. She could see her breath in the crisp November air as she was trying to plan for all of the avenues that this conversation could go down. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy had been fine with her but he might not have been as fine with Wanda and she needed to know exactly what they said to each other. She wasn’t going to let Wanda keep anything important from her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She knocked on Wanda’s door and walked in when it was opened.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Hi.” Wanda greeted her. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It was probably the most gentle way that she had ever been welcomed into Wanda’s home. Usually they were half way up the stairs by now or one of them would be pinned against a wall or the door with their clothes already being removed.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Do you want a drink or anything?” Wanda continued. “I’ve got water, juice, and tea. Or I have some alcohol if you'd prefer that?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio shrugged her jacket off and hung it on a free hook by the door and toed off her shoes as Wanda walked into the kitchen. “I’ve not had a proper British tea yet, so I’ll take that.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda’s head popped round the door frame. “I’m sorry, you’ve been here how long and you’ve not had a proper cuppa yet? I’m glad I can fix that now.” She went back into the kitchen and Rio heard the kettle start to boil. “Make yourself comfortable in the living room, I won’t be long.” Wanda called to her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio walked into the living room and took the space in. She had walked – or been dragged – past this room so many times, but she had never been in it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>There were bookcases lining the wall opposite the door, but they weren’t full. There were random gaps on every shelf, some bigger than others, some had picture frames or ornaments in them to fill the space and some were left empty. Maybe the missing books were ones that Billy had taken into his accommodation with him, or ones that her husband had taken when they got divorced.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>There was a deep blue three-seater couch and coffee table in the centre of the room opposite a TV that was mounted on the wall with a set top box and some games consoles beneath it. In the space behind the couch was a wooden table and matching set of chairs tucked neatly under it that looked like they were made from oak.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio moved towards one of the bookshelves and looked at the photographs that were displayed there.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Most of them were of Wanda, Billy and her ex-husband on various holidays and day trips – a few were more recent because Billy’s hair was black in them. There were some photographs that didn’t feature Billy or his dad. A couple of them were just Wanda by herself and a couple more were of a group in different restaurants. There was one picture of an incredibly young Wanda, she couldn’t have been older than five or six, standing next to a boy of the same age. They had the same features, the same big smile on their faces and the boy was missing a front tooth. Behind them stood two older people, also wearing big smiles, with one arm wrapped around the other's waist and the other hand on the shoulder of the child they stood behind.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The picture was discoloured and worn with age, an old family photo Rio assumed.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>There was one frame that particularly caught her eye, though. It was smaller and tucked at the back of one of the gaps between the books. The reason it was so interesting was because it was turned around so that the picture was facing the back of the bookshelf. Rio cast a glance over her shoulder to make sure that Wanda wasn’t going to walk in and picked it up, turning it around to look at the picture. It was of Wanda and another person, a woman with chestnut hair that had her back to the camera, at a party of some kind. Wanda was wearing a maroon dress and the woman was wearing an eggplant halter style dress. They were on a dance floor and the song they were dancing to must have been a slow one because Wanda’s arms were loosely wrapped around the woman's neck and the woman's hands were on Wanda’s waist. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda was looking at the women with a big, sappy smile on her face and so much love in her eyes.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio noticed something on Wanda’s hand so she leant in a little to get a closer look. On the fourth finger of her left hand was a ring. The picture was too small to make out any details of the ring but it was definitely an engagement ring.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She heard the sound of a tea spoon clinking against the ceramic of a mug and put the picture back as she’d found it, stepping away from the bookcase suddenly feeling like she had seen a part of Wanda’s life that she wasn’t supposed to see. She sat at one end of the end of the couch and Wanda sat down at the other end after handing Rio her tea.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“That’s a proper builders brew, nice and strong.” Wanda said before sipping her own tea. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio gently blew across the cup to cool the liquid down before gingerly having her first taste. It was sweeter than she thought it would be, though it was nowhere near the sweetness she was used to in her coffee. She swallowed the tea and gave an approving hum. “That’s not bad actually.” She went in for another sip. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda watched her with a slight look of amusement ghosting across her features. “I’ll let the people of Yorkshire know that their tea has the American seal of approval.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Forgive my American ignorance but where is Yorkshire? Is it near Cambridge?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed, but it wasn’t mocking. “It’s about a hundred and thirty miles north of Cambridge. The tea discourse was one of the most confusing things for me when I moved to England, but I learned quickly that Yorkshire Tea was the best tea no matter where in the country you are.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio’s brows dipped slightly as she took in what Wanda had said. She’d had no idea that Wanda wasn’t from England. Her accent didn’t betray any hint of being from another country, nor did the way she spoke. Rio had fully believed that Wanda had been born and raised in this country, but then again, she really didn’t know much about Wanda courtesy of her own rules.</span>
</p><p><span>She had another drink of her tea before asking, “Where did you move from?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda gave a sad smile and her eyes took on the emotion as well. “I’m originally from Romania and had to move when I was ten.” She shifted on the couch, tucking her legs underneath herself and pressing herself into the corner. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio didn’t speak, she wanted to let Wanda share the information freely and on her own terms. Wanda looked down at her cup. “Our city was bombed and my brother and I had to crawl over our parents bodies to get out of the rubble of our apartment.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio thought back to the picture she had seen of a young Wanda and her brother with their parents. They had looked so happy and they were torn apart by tragedy.</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda continued. “Anyway Pietro and I were taken from country to country to try and find a place to stay and when we were twelve, we were sent to London. A family took us in. They didn’t really have space for two growing pre-teens but they didn’t want to separate us, so they made it work. Our parents had helped us practise our English by watching American sitcoms with us so there wasn’t really a language barrier to battle with but we were bullied for our accents.” She looked back up from her cup and back to Rio, but she didn’t focus anywhere in particular. “Pietro refused to change his accent because it was all we had left of our home, but I was desperate to fit in so I forced myself to speak with the accent the other kids had. I still spoke Romanian with Pietro so that I didn’t lose it, but when I spoke English I sounded, for lack of a better word, normal.” She smiled again, but it was still filled with sadness.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio vaguely remembered Billy mentioning in passing that he had an uncle but she hadn’t heard anything else of him. “Does Pietro live in Cambridge too?” She asked tentatively. </span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda sighed and looked back down at her tea. “He did. When I met Vision and we decided to move out of London to Cambridge, he came with us. Even as we got older, we were still inseparable. We needed each other. He was present in Billy’s life and happily looked after him when Vision and I wanted time to ourselves. He even started teaching him Romanian.” She laughed lightly at the memory, but it was quickly replaced by sadness again. “But one night, when he was walking home from work, he was attacked by muggers. They stabbed him and left him to bleed out in an alley. It took me weeks to fully process that he was gone. My last piece of home. I eventually stopped crying and learned to navigate the world without him, though I still struggle sometimes.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>A silence settled over them as Rio processed the information. Wanda had already been through so much at such a young age, and then to lose her brother when she had finally built a life and family for herself? Rio couldn’t begin to fathom what that would be like.</span><span><br/></span><span>She thought about her own parents and family. She didn’t have any siblings, but she was so close with her cousins that they were practically her siblings and she had no idea what she would do if she lost any of them. She made a mental note to call them as soon as she could.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Wanda, I’m so sorry you had to go through all of that.” It was a pathetic thing to say, but what does one say after hearing a story like that?</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda sniffed and looked back up at her, focussing on her face now. “It’s okay, I’ve come to terms with it all.” She took another drink. “You should feel honoured, though. You are now one of only three people who know that full story. Even Billy doesn’t know everything.” </span><em><span>He doesn’t need to know.</span></em><span> The unspoken words sat between them and Rio understood why. He knew the basics of his heritage and didn’t need to be weighed down with the full details.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I kinda want to hear your true accent now though.” Rio said, trying to add some lightness back in.</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda gave a short laugh. “Get me drunk enough and it’ll slip out.” She gave Rio a pointed look. “Piss me off enough and I’ll start to speak Romanian.” Her smile started to lose the sadness beneath it.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio quirked an eyebrow. “See, now you’ve given me a challenge. And I don’t back down from a challenge.” A smirk settled on her lips and Wanda rolled her eyes, though there was no annoyance fuelling it.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They finished their tea and Rio made a few attempts to annoy Wanda into speaking Romanian but Wanda refused to give her the satisfaction. When they had both put their empty cups on the coffee table, Wanda said, “You didn’t come here to listen to my tragic backstory, we have something that we should talk about. How did you chat with Billy go?” </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio crossed her legs underneath her and leaned into the corner of the settee. “It went well actually. He didn’t seem to mind all that much. He did mention that my excuses need some work though.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda snorted. “I have to agree with him.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Right, I was put on the spot and you were zero help at all.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda held her hands up. “Okay, I can admit that I was just as useless. You have my sincerest apologies.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio narrowed her eyes. “The jury’s still out on whether I accept them or not. What did he say to you?”</span><span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><span>Wanda shifted slightly but she didn’t take her eyes off of Rio. “He was surprisingly accepting of it. He said that he wasn’t happy that we’d kept it from him and he also warned me that you might not be ‘as into me as I am you.’” She curled her fingers in air quotes. “He didn’t elaborate on what that meant but I assured him that there were no feelings involved so he didn’t have to worry about that.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio couldn’t be mad at Billy for saying that, he knew about her sleeping with Taylor and was just looking out for his mom. He was a good kid. “I did tell him that I wouldn’t have slept with you if I’d have known that you were his mom and he said he knew that so that’s why he wasn’t angry about it.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda’s eyes softened. “And now that you do know, how do you feel about it?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio sighed and ran her hand through her hair. “Truthfully? I don’t know.” </span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda nodded, accepting her answer.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>How did Rio feel about it? Obviously being as close with Billy as she was injected awkwardness into the situation. But did that mean that she wanted to stop sleeping with Wanda? The sex was good, great even, even if it did leave her with a strange feeling every time she left Wanda’s house. It wasn’t like she had girls queueing up to sleep with her but she knew that if she and Wanda did put a stop to it that she wouldn’t be without sex.</span><span><br/></span><span>If they did continue would she need to tell Billy? Would he feel betrayed if he found out that they hadn’t stopped now that Rio knew that Wanda was his mom?</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She didn’t want to be the one making the decision, so she asked, “How do you feel about it?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda lifted her shoulders in a shrug. “I’m not sure either. We’re not in a relationship, and never will be, it’s just sex. But now that Billy knows…” </span><span><br/></span><span>“It’s different.” Rio finished for her.</span><span><br/></span><span>“It’s different.” Wanda confirmed. “Did he tell you that he wanted us to stop?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio thought for a minute, casting her mind back to the conversation with Billy. “I actually asked him if he’d mind if we didn’t stop and he said that if we wanted to keep sleeping together, there wasn’t anything he could do about it. He just doesn’t want to know about it.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda laughed. “Yeah that sounds about right, actually. I’ll leave it up to you to let me know as and when.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio nodded and stood to leave. “He's a really good kid, Wanda. You, his dad and your brother all did a really good job raising him.” </span><span><br/></span><span>“Multumesc.” Wanda said with a smile and when Rio raised her eyebrows inquisitively she said, “It's Romanian for thank you.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio walked home. She was still confused about how to feel, but she felt better for having spoken to both Wanda and Billy and was glad that this hadn’t blown up in any anybody’s face. </span></p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of all the things that Agatha Harkness could do, Rio had never anticipated that one of them would be giving her her number.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It caught her completely off guard and took her a few minutes to rally. Once she had, they texted back and forth for a little while. Nothing exciting, just Agatha complaining about her students and Rio saying something like </span>
<em>
<span>“Well, they can’t all be as good as me now can they?”</span>
</em>
<span> which of course Agatha refuted.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Who do we think could have made our Rio smile at her phone like that?” Maddy’s voice came from the tablet that was propped up on Rio’s coffee table.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Well we definitely know that it’s not a man.” Chloe added on.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“She smiles when I message her.” Jesse, a friend Rio had made in her gap year between her undergrad and her masters, said matter-of-factly. He had only hung out with the full group a handful of times, but they had adopted him in all the same. He was their token straight white man.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio put her phone down and pointed at Jesse’s square on her screen. “You have no evidence of that, sir.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Her phone buzzed next to her on the couch and she picked it up immediately.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Jesse: Fuckwad</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>She snorted and laughed when she read it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Jesse punched the air. “Caught in 4k, Vidal!”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Chloe made a face. “Did you guys see the speed she grabbed her phone at? Spill it, Rio. Who is she?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The three of them began to chant. “Tell us, tell us, tell us…”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio took off her sock and threw it at the camera. “You guys are fucking ridiculous. If you </span>
<em>
<span>must</span>
</em>
<span> know, I was texting my supervisor.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Naturally, her friends took that and ran with it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“You’re sleeping with your supervisor? Remind me to hi-five you when you’re home.” Maddy said.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Chloe had a wide-mouthed grin on her face. “Is she hot?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Is she straight?” Jesse quickly asked.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio pointed at each of their squares as she answered. “No, yes and no.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“So she’s hot but you're </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> sleeping with her?” Chloe asked, raising her eyebrow.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “I can think that a woman is hot and not want to sleep with her, you know.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Maddy laughed loudly. “No you absolutely can’t!”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“It’s why you’re the worst wing woman!” Jessie exclaimed whilst pointing at the camera.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smiled smugly and leaned back into her settee, crossing her arms. “Hey, it’s not my fault that you always try to pull queer women. That’s just poor judgment on your part my guy.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She watched Jessie open and close his mouth a couple of times trying to find a rebuttal, but he eventually conceded. “Shut up.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“That’s what I thought.” Rio pressed her tongue against her cheek and smiled.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The four friends continued to talk for a while longer, mostly catching Rio up on the home news and making plans for when Rio went home over the Christmas holidays.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just before she left her apartment in the morning, Rio sent a text to Agatha.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: Am I getting the drinks today?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Agatha: I think it’s my turn. There’ll be one ready for you when you get here</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>Sure enough when Rio walked into Agatha’s office, a coffee was there waiting for her. Agatha was sitting in her usual chair and Rio lowered herself into the one opposite her. She picked up the drink and unwrapped the straw, sliding it into the cup and taking a sip. “Have I mentioned that it tastes better when it’s free?” She asked, the corner of her mouth ticking upwards. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha hummed. “You might have said it before, yes.” She took a drink of her own coffee.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“It’s still not a diamond necklace, but I guess it’s a close second.” Rio’s smirk was full now and Agatha scoffed. “You’re never getting a diamond necklace from me, Rio. You should let that pipe dream go.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio tried her best to emulate puppy dog eyes. “What if I asked really nicely?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Looking at me like that will get you nowhere. It’s having the opposite effect to the one you intended.” Rio stuck out her bottom lip for good measure but Agatha just made a gagging sound. “Oh that’s gonna make me bring my breakfast up if you carry on.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio snorted and it turned into a laugh. “Well I’ve never had a woman tell me that my face could induce vomiting before.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Maybe I’m just immune to your charms then.” Agatha smirked. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“We’ll see.” Rio said, pushing her tongue against her cheek.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They marked the remaining essays in a comfortable silence, making light work of them. Rio had gotten confident with her marking skills and didn’t need to use the guide anymore. She felt a small sense of pride at this because she liked mastering new skills. Even if this was something as simple as marking undergraduate essays, it was now something that she could say that could confidently do.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>As they returned the final essays to the table, Agatha checked her watch. “We still have just over an hour and unfortunately, we have no more essays to mark. Is there anything you want to do with this time?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio thought for a second before she said, “Can I ask you a question?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha leaned back in her chair and crossed her legs. “Go for it.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio’s eyes dipped to Agatha’s right foot, the blue ink in her skin just visible over the top of her heeled shoe. “What’s your tattoo?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha lifted a brow. “How long have you spent staring at my ankle to notice that?” She asked, but she started bending down to slip her shoe off regardless. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Without the shoe in the way Rio could see that the tattoo was a small blue circle. The way that it had faded and the ink had spread meant that it had to be an old one, but she was still none the wiser about what it actually was. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She looked back up at Agatha’s face. “I ask again, what is it?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“It’s a full moon, obviously.” Agatha said with a slight smile. “I have two others as well. A half moon on my left shoulder blade, and a crescent moon in a place that you will never see.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had a retort ready. </span>
<em>
<span>“I’m sure I could convince you to show me.” </span>
</em>
<span>It was right on the tip of her tongue, but she didn’t say it. She couldn’t say that to Agatha, could she?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Instead she settled for asking, “Why moon phases?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha put her shoe back on and leaned back in her chair again. “My girlfriend at the time suggested it and I was twenty one, thinking that I was in love. So I did it.” She said it so casually, so nonchalantly, like she wouldn’t have bitten Rio’s head off just a month ago if she had asked for that information. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio took a moment to process the fact that Agatha had just freely offered up information about herself and Agatha filled the gap in conversation. “Do you have any tattoos?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio nodded. “I have four. One on my back, just a few vines and leaves. One on the outside of my left leg, it's a Lord Of The Rings inspired one.” She rolled up the sleeve of her jacket to show Agatha the black and white striped tent that was just below her elbow ditch with </span>
<em>
<span>‘Le Cirque des Rêves’ </span>
</em>
<span>written below it in cursive font. “This one is inspired by a book called The Night Circus. It’s an amazing book and I really recommend it if you haven’t read it already.” She rolled her sleeve back down. “And the last one is on my thigh,” she traced the area to indicate the size of the piece. “That one’s a watercolour Spyro The Dragon.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha, who had been quietly listening up to that point clearly couldn’t resist making a comment about the last tattoo. “You have a Spyro tattoo? And women still sleep with you?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio scoffed in mock offense. “The women </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> him, I'll have you know.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha pursed her lips to hide her smile. “I guess it has to be seen to be believed.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smirked, unable to resist making her next quip. “Is Agatha Harkness asking me to take my jeans off in her office? Do you think just because you gave me your number that you can get into my pants now? Scandalous!”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha took her glasses off and pinched the bridge of her nose. “You're infuriating”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. “Have you met you?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and put her glasses back on. “Given how tight your jeans are, it seems like it would be way too much effort to try and ‘get in them.’”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“And Spyro would be your reward for said effort.” Rio leaned back and clasped her hands behind her head, resting her right ankle on her left knee.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha raised her eyebrows questioningly. “Seriously, are they painted on? There’s no way those are comfortable.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It was Rio’s turn to roll her eyes now. She had never heard someone talk about her choice of jeans so much. Even when she wore ripped jeans for the first time and her dad made non-stop comments about how she looked like she’d lost a fight with a pair of scissors. “I promise you, they are real. I could run a marathon in these if I wanted to, not that I ever </span>
<em>
<span>would</span>
</em>
<span> want to but still.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to say something else but was interrupted by the alarm on her phone going off. She stood up and started to gather her things, and Rio followed suit. Or at least she tried to. She brought the foot that had been resting on her knee back to the floor and tried to stand up in one fluid motion but her knee had other ideas. She felt a blinding pain for a few seconds when she tried to put weight on it and immediately collapsed back into the chair muttering, “Motherfucking piece of shit holy fuck.” She screwed her eyes shut as she waited for the pain to pass. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>After what felt like hours – but in reality was a couple of minutes –  the pain finally dulled to a sharp ache, still not great but more manageable and Rio slowly opened her eyes again. She blinked a few times to readjust to the light and Agatha came into focus crouched at her side looking very worried. “Rio what’s wrong?” She asked, concern lacing her voice.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Just an old knee injury that likes to remind me that it still exists every so often.” Rio said as she began to root around in her bag for the painkillers she kept in there for occasions such as this. “And before you say it, no it wasn’t due to lack of circulation from how tight my jeans are, or whatever bullshit you’re thinking of.” She tried to say it jokingly but the pain made that difficult. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She finally found the drugs and popped two of them out, taking them with the bottle of water she also had in her bag. When she had swallowed them, she turned back to Agatha who was still crouched by her side. “Why are you looking at me like I’m on my death bed?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Because you fell back into the chair and started speaking only in profanities. I had no idea what was going on.” Her eyes were searching Rio’s face and her eyebrows were dipped in worry.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Aww, I never knew you cared so much. I’m touched, really.” Rio managed a smile and was able to inflect sarcasm again.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha started to stand up. “Okay, well you’re clearly feeling better now. Do you need help getting up?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The urge to make an inappropriate joke was once again on the tip of Rio’s tongue, but once again she decided against it. She just shook her head and began to try and push herself out of the chair, putting all of her weight on her left leg and her arms. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha stood and watched her struggle with a look of slight amusement on her face. She crossed her arms and said, “It’s okay to ask for help, you know.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio flopped back down into the chair, defeated. “Okay fine. Can you help me stand up please?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha stepped towards her. “Well, since you asked so nicely.” She bent down and put her arm around Rio’s waist as Rio wrapped her arm around Agatha’s shoulders. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio leaned all of her weight against Agatha as Agatha pushed her forward and lifted her upwards at the same time. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When Rio was finally upright, Agatha handed her her bag and shouldered her own. “How are you getting home?” She asked and she reassumed her position at Rio’s side, arm wrapped tightly around her middle.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio began slowly limping towards the door. “I usually walk.” She huffed as she focussed on the effort of the simple task of putting one foot in front of the other.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha propped Rio up against the wall as she opened the door and repeated the action on the other side when she locked the door.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When they were back on the move towards the lift Agatha said, “Well that’s not happening so what’s the alternative?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio gave a pained laugh as her right heel hit the floor, jarring her knee. “Crawling?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha sighed in exasperation. “If you can survive until the end of the lecture, I can take you home.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“You don’t have to do that.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I know. That’s what makes me so nice.” Agatha said in a high-pitched, airy voice. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio scoffed as they stepped into the lift. “Did you just get possessed by Glinda?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha glanced at her, as she settled herself into the corner of the lift, the corners of her mouth curved upwards slightly. “Does that make you my Elphaba?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio breathed out a laugh as the jerk of the lift jolted her. “That depends. How much do you loath me?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The smile was fully formed on Agatha’s lips now. “C’mon Rio. We both know that ‘loathing’ is not the feeling those two had towards each other.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Ahh, so you’re a fellow Gelphie truther then?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The lift arrived at their floor and Agatha waited until she had gotten Rio out of the lift to reply. “I have no idea what those words mean, but if you’re asking if I think those witches are gay, then the answer is yes.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They didn’t talk much more as they focussed on getting Rio to the lecture hall. The painkillers were starting to kick in now and Rio could put a bit more weight on her right leg, but Agatha didn’t remove her arm from Rio’s waist, nor did Rio unwrap her arm from Agatha’s shoulders. If anything Rio found herself leaning more into Agatha. She felt a sense of comfort from Agatha holding her, Agatha’s grip was strong but gentle and it felt grounding.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The two of them walking through the corridors like this earnt them a plethora of looks and hushed comments from passing students and faculty alike, but Rio didn’t particularly hear what they were saying, she just noticed them staring. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When they arrived at the lecture hall they were ten minutes late, which was very unlike Agatha. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Just before they got to the door, Rio removed her arm from Agatha’s shoulders and Agatha unwrapped her arm from Rio’s middle. An unspoken agreement passed between them that they shouldn’t walk in wrapped in each other’s arms.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The students that were diligently seated watched them walk into the lecture hall with a mixture of expressions on their faces.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio limped her way over to the seating bank fully prepared to struggle with the steps and awkwardly shuffle into her seat next to Billy, but Agatha announced, “Rio has a knee injury and needs to sit at the front today.” When she was just met with confused stares, including Rio, she continued. “So if a space could be made for her, I’m sure she would be very appreciative.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>A boy who was sitting in the seat nearest the door silently stood up and moved himself to the row behind. Rio gave him a quiet “thank you” and settled herself into the chair.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was glad that Agatha had made sure she could sit at the front because she wouldn’t have been able to keep her leg stretched out if she was sitting in the middle like usual. The painkillers had done their job and the pain had mostly subsided, it was just the embarrassment that remained. Her injury hadn’t flared up like that in years, and when it flared up in the past it was due to putting strain on her knee. She tried to think of what she could have done to cause it, but was coming up blank.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She was pulled out of her thoughts by Agatha apologising for her lateness and dimming the lights to get straight on with the lecture.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio felt her phone vibrate in her pocket so she pulled it out to check it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Billy: What the fuck happened to you?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Rio: Old knee injury came back to haunt me</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Billy: Why was Agatha late too?</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Rio: Said knee injury attacked me in her office so she helped me get here. She’s a hero</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>Billy: Never knew she cared about you so much </b>
<span>😜</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<b>Rio: I’m a very likable person, you little shit. Now get off your phone, you’re in a lecture!</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
<span>He didn’t reply so Rio slid her phone back into her pocket and focussed on the lecture, or at least she tried to. The phantom feeling of Agatha’s arm around her sat in her mind and she absentmindedly rubbed the spot on her stomach where Agatha’s hand had been. She hadn’t held Rio tight enough to leave a mark yet the feeling would be etched into her skin for the rest of the day.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely noticed the time passing and the end of the lecture sneaked up on her, the lights coming back to full brightness momentarily dazing her. The students moved around her, packing their laptops and notepads away and leaving the room. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy and Alice appeared in front of her, neither one of them looking concerned. Alice spoke first. “I know you’re old, but I didn’t think knee problems started at thirty.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio flipped her off. “My knee problems started at sixteen actually. I was a promising basketball star who had it all ripped away from her in a fatal accident. It’s a tragedy and I can’t believe you don’t care.” She forced a crack into her voice and faked a quivering lip.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy rolled his eyes. “You’ve been through so much, you truly are an inspiration to us all.” He offered her a hand as she started to stand up, which she took. “For real though, are you good?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio tested her knee by gently putting weight on it. It was still painful, but she no longer needed to be held up. “Yeah I’m good, I just need to rest for a few days so I won’t be at practise tonight.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Alice nodded. “Understandable. After all, we’re only as good as our drummer.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They told her to let them know when she was home and to take it easy before they left the lecture hall.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio slowly made her way over to Agatha who was leaning against the table, patiently waiting for her to finish talking to Alice and Billy.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Are you ready to go?” Agatha asked.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Yep. I will warn you though, you might struggle to keep up with me.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha laughed. “I shall keep that in mind.” She offered Rio her arm but Rio shook her head saying that the painkillers were doing their job and she could manage on her own.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The two of them walked to Agatha’s car, Agatha making sure to stay directly at Rio’s side – and then insisting that they link arms when Rio got a bit too confident and tried to walk with a normal gait, only to immediately regret it. They made small talk about the lecture and when they got to the car, Agatha made sure to push the passenger seat as far back as it could go so that Rio didn’t have to bend her knee too much.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The small talk continued in the car and Agatha apologised profusely when Rio hissed in pain after she ran over a pothole a little too fast. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The car ride was short and when she pulled up outside of Rio’s building, Agatha asked, “Do you want me to help you up the steps?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio looked at the steps, sizing them up. There were only five of them, she could manage five steps, and Agatha had helped her enough. “No thanks, I should be good.” She replied, undoing her seatbelt and slowly getting out of the car.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She had just managed to stand up and shut the door when Agatha was in front of her again. “Rio, I used to live here. I know how difficult these steps were after I’d had a bit to drink, never mind with an actual leg injury. Let me help you.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio wanted to protest, but the look Agatha was giving her told her that it would be futile so she begrudgingly accepted the help.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When they had made it up the steps – which Rio definitely could not have done alone – and Rio was searching for her keys in her bag, she asked, “When did you live here?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha leaned against the wall. “I moved here when I was offered a permanent lecturing position at the university, which was twelve years ago.” She blew out a breath and chuckled. “God I’m old.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio found her keys and unlocked the door, pushing it slightly ajar. “Nah, I’d say you’ve got at least another year before you’re officially considered old.” She said with a half smile.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha shook her head. “Of course you would.” She started walking back down the steps towards her car but turned to face Rio again as she said, “Promise me you’ll use the lift.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes but promised anyway, walking into the building and letting the door shut behind her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She sent Agatha a selfie in the mirror of the lift for good measure and let Billy and Alice know that she’d made it home. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She got straight in the shower – which was entirely more effort than it was worth – and put on her pyjamas, resigning herself to spending the rest of the day rotting on the couch with her knee brace on and her painkillers within reach.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p><span>The following morning her knee felt a lot better, though she knew that she still shouldn’t be walking around too much and that she needed to give it at least three days of proper rest. </span><span><br/></span><span>She sat on the sofa with her toast and fired up her Switch, another day of being a couch potato ahead of her. </span><span><br/></span><span>Before she started her game, she messaged Agatha.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Rio: Hi, I know we don’t have any more essays to mark but I thought I’d let you know that I won’t be coming in anyway</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><span>She wondered if there would be any reason for them to spend time together now that all of the essays were done. She didn’t want to stop spending time with Agatha, she enjoyed it. They had found a rhythm now that Agatha was more chilled and Rio liked talking to her. She liked being around her because they were quite similar in a lot of ways.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She thought back to the previous day, the way that Agatha had looked at her with such worry and concern. She remembered the look in Agatha’s eyes when she was crouched down beside her and she hadn’t thought about it at the time due to the amount of pain she was in, but now she was retroactively surprised. She didn't think that Agatha was heartless by any means, but she hadn’t expected her to care so much. And as much as Rio protested the help, she liked that Agatha had looked after her and made sure she made it home.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Agatha: I was going to tell you not to come in today so I’m glad you’re not, you need to rest. Also, I was going to ask you this in person but, how would you feel about giving a lecture?</b><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio giving a lecture? She had honestly never thought about it. Did Agatha think she was capable of giving a lecture? She must do otherwise she wouldn’t have asked, right?</span><span><br/></span><span>Professor Agatha Harkness had just asked PhD student Rio Vidal to give a lecture in her place.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Rio: Me? Really? </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha: Yes, really! I think you’d be good at it. You like talking and everyone would have to listen to you. Also it would give you a different angle for your research</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Rio: Okay, sure! What on? Also when?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha: I can email you the topics I still need to cover and you can choose from that if you want. I was thinking Monday, but if that’s too short notice then you can pick another day.</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><span>Rio hadn’t thought of a reply when she got the email notification. She opened it and browsed the list that Agatha had sent her. It wasn’t super long since the semester was nearly over but there were still a few to choose from.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Rio: Could I do it on Medusa? Also Monday should be fine, which time slot?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha: I had a feeling you’d pick Medusa, of course you can. I thought about the early lecture on Monday since it would be the first years, less pressure. But if you’d prefer a later time then you can</b> <b>do that instead</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><span>Rio took a moment to think about it. If she did the early lecture then, like Agatha said, it would be less pressure because it would be for the first years. Also Billy and Alice would be there and that would make her feel less nervous. If this one went well then Agatha might let her give another lecture which she could do for the second years. The idea was starting to seem exciting.</span><span><br/></span><b><br/></b><b>Rio: I’m good for the early lecture! Would I be doing both hours?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha: That’s up to you. If you want to do one hour and I do the other, we can. Or you can do both. It’s entirely your decision</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Rio: Pencil me in for both hours and I’ll see what I come up with. If I don’t think it’ll be enough for two, I’ll let you know by Sunday so that you can handle the other hour?</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Agatha: Sounds like a plan. You can send me your slides to look over if you want, but I trust that you’ll be fine</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Rio: Will do</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><span>She retrieved her laptop from her bedroom and returned to the sofa, turning off her Switch in favour of the new task she now had.</span><span><br/></span><span>She immediately dove into the research, making sure she had as many sources as possible to properly do Medusa justice. Her story had been twisted and told in so many different ways but Rio wanted to be as accurate as she possibly could be whilst still keeping it appropriate for a university lecture.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She lost track of how long she worked on the lecture for, creating slide after slide and finding pictures to go with them, truly getting lost in the research.</span></p>

<span>Agatha and Rio had agreed to meet at the café before the Monday morning lecture to get their drinks, before making their way to the lecture hall together. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had sent Agatha her lecture slides to look over on Friday night and Agatha had been impressed at how quickly Rio pulled the lecture together. The slides were concise but covered all of the main points and Agatha had no doubts that Rio had plenty of notes to expand on the bullet points that she had put on each slide. She was looking forward to seeing Rio give the lecture, especially because Rio had clearly made her presentation to last the full two hours.</span>

<span>When Agatha got to the café Rio was already waiting in line. She sidled up to Rio, casually standing next to her in the queue. “Have I not taught you that you don’t need to wait for drinks?” <br/></span>
<span>Rio turned her head to look at her, a small smile playing on her lips. “Unlike you, I choose not to abuse that power. I thought you British people enjoyed queueing anyway. Isn’t it an integral part of your culture?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Yes actually. When I applied for citizenship, one of the tests they gave me was seeing how long I could stand patiently in a line of other people.” Agatha spread her arms. “Clearly I passed with flying colours.” She grabbed Rio by the wrist and started pulling her towards the collection counter. “However, I no longer need to prove that I can do it.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes but ordered her drink all the same and paid for both coffees.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They got their drinks and their accompanying straws, and started walking towards the lecture hall, being close enough that their shoulders brushed as they were walking.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Are you nervous?” Agatha asked, regarding Rio out of the corner of her eye.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Not really. I’m basically just info-dumping for two hours, and that’s a skill I already excel at.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha turned her head fully to look at Rio, the corner of her mouth curving upwards slightly. “Well, you do like hearing yourself speak.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio scoffed. “Oh yeah, like you got into this profession for the satisfaction of a job well done.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha made a noise of mock annoyance. “I have no idea what you could possibly be implying, Rio.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They arrived at the lecture hall early, no students in sight, and Rio started setting up her laptop on the desk in the centre of the room. Agatha watched Rio get prepared, loading up her PowerPoint and flicking through it to check that everything worked properly before moving on to the controls for the lights.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She continued to watch as Rio went through the different settings and took notice of the way her face lit up when she realised that she could change the colours of the lights.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio turned to her, open mouthed, with excitement on her features. “You’ve been able to change the colours this whole time and you’ve never done it?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha smiled, breathing out a laugh. “I never saw a reason to, but if you want to do it then feel free. This is your lecture after all.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I’m starting to see the appeal of this.” Rio said as she continued to figure out the lighting controls.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha checked her watch, they only had a few minutes before the students started to arrive and she began to feel nervous on Rio’s behalf. She remembered the first time she had given a lecture. She had gone into it so confident and so sure of herself that she didn’t think she could possibly fumble it. But when the students were all seated and staring at her, her throat closed up and she couldn’t speak. The senior lecturer that she was shadowing had to do the introduction for her and it was one of the most embarrassing moments of her life. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She started scanning the room for a place to sit. She didn’t want Rio to feel like she was watching her, but didn’t want to be so far away that she couldn’t jump in should Rio need her to. She also didn’t feel like the students would feel comfortable with her sitting on the seating bank with them. She decided to leave the decision up to Rio, asking, “Where would you like me to sit?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio turned and leant back against the desk. “Wherever you want.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Helpful.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<span>“It’s your lecture so you decide.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio looked around the room for a moment before saying, “I assume you’re gonna be taking notes so that you can give me feedback, so would the corner give you a good enough vantage point?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha suppressed a smile. She had thought about treating this similarly to the teaching demonstrations that she’d had to give when she applied to be a lecturer at Cambridge, but she didn’t want to add that pressure. Since Rio had assumed that it was going to happen anyway, what harm could it do?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha nodded. “The corner sounds good. I’ll introduce you then go sit down.” She pulled a notebook and pen from her bag.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The students started to file in and take their seats, Billy and Alice sitting in their usual spot with an extra space left for Rio, clearly unaware that she wouldn’t be taking it this time.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha waited for all of the students to get settled before she stepped in front of the desk and addressed them.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Good morning everyone. The lecture this morning is going to be a little bit different. I’m sure by now that you’ll all have seen Miss Vidal,” she gestured behind herself to where Rio was standing, “usually sitting up there with you. Well this morning, Miss Vidal will be the one giving the lecture so please afford her the same respect that you would myself. I’ll still be watching you so don’t think that you can get away with being on your phone and not paying attention.” She gave a sweeping gaze over the students, narrowing her eyes slightly to drive the point home and having to hide the smile that was tugging at the corners of her lips when she saw the shocked looks on Billy and Alice’s faces. “I will now leave you in the capable hands of Miss Vidal.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She went back around the desk to pick up the chair and her notebook to take them to the back corner of the room, whispering “You'll be great,” to Rio before she went.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She got settled in her seat as Rio dimmed the lights and fired up the presentation onto the blank slide that would soon have text and a picture filling it. She watched Rio take a deep breath before she started speaking, exhaling out the nerves that Agatha knew she was trying to hide.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Thank you Professor Harkness for the introduction, I will try my best to instil fear into the hearts of these students the same way that you do.” Rio began, eliciting a chuckle from the crowd of students before her. “Speaking of women that instil fear, today we’ll be covering Medusa.” She tapped on the remote that was linked to her laptop and a picture of one of the many stone statues of Medusa popped onto the slide.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Okay so, I want you guys to tell me what you know about Medusa and I’ll add it to the slide.” Rio drew a text box ready for people to shout things out.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“She’s a baddie!” One boy shouted from the back, much to the joy of his peers. Agatha wouldn’t have entertained something like that but Rio took it in her stride, laughing and saying, “She’s a baddie? Okay I can get behind that. Someone clearly has a type”, as she typed it into the text box. She looked back at the students waiting for the next person to offer a suggestion. A girl in the front row spoke up next. “Athena turned her into the monster we know her as.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio added it to the slide as Billy jumped in “Only because Poseidon assaulted her in Athena’s temple. It wasn’t Medusa’s fault.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio looked up at him, her smile evidence of how proud she was of him for knowing that and having the courage to say it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Before long the empty space around the picture of Medusa was filled by the information that the students had shouted out, and Rio was looking extremely happy that they had engaged and joined in.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha was happy that Rio was getting to experience this. Trying to save yourself after you’re met with blank stares is something even she hadn’t quite learned how to do properly, even with all of her years of experience.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio’s next slides were on points that the students had mentioned and she effortlessly delivered the information, walking in front of the desk and standing to the side to talk about what was on each slide. She covered various versions of the myth of Medusa and Agatha couldn’t take her eyes off of Rio. The way she moved with ease and adjusted the tone of her voice to keep people’s attention. The way that she gave large amounts of knowledge in easy to understand chunks and managed to add humour in, making jokes that were typical Rio things to say whilst still keeping it appropriate for a lecture. The way that she was using her thesis research to talk about different ways that Medusa has been portrayed in various mediums over the years.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha was captivated by all of it. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>As Rio was starting to segue into the solemn side of Medusa’s myth she cast a glance back towards Agatha. Their gazes met and Agatha could tell that Rio was looking for reassurance. Reassurance that she could do justice to this interpretation of Medusa and that it was okay to talk about it in a lecture. Agatha gave a small smile and gentle nod letting Rio know that she had Agatha’s full support. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio returned the smile and changed the slide. “Okay so this has been quite light so far, but there is a darker side to Medusa’s story. Billy touched on it at the start, but I want to go a little deeper into it. During this part I will be talking about sexual assault. I won’t be going into detail but if anybody needs to leave please do. I’d rather you look after yourself than force yourself to sit through this. I also will not be tolerating any jokes made during this section, is that understood?” The students mumbled their agreements.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha respected the fact that Rio added the disclaimer before going into this section of the lecture; it was mostly the reason why she hadn’t covered Medusa yet herself. It was always a sticking point for her every year – how to broach this topic, and if she should include it at all. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio stood in front of the desk, leaning against it. “In some versions of the myth, Medusa was the only mortal one of the three Gorgon sisters. She was a beautiful, alluring young woman who was a priestess of Athena. Medusa devoted herself to a life of celibacy in the name of Athena. However, despite her origins of beauty, Medusa’s name quickly became synonymous with malevolence, hatred, and monstrosity.” Rio clicked the remote and a painting of an olive skinned, brown-haired young woman appeared on screen next to one of the stereotypical Medusa with snakes for hair. “One of the requirements for being a priestess of Athena was that the women should remain virgins and devote their lives to the goddess, which Medusa did. One day Poseidon, a rival to Athena, caught sight of Medusa and was enthralled by her. He tried to seduce Medusa but, being a loyal priestess of Athena, she rejected him. Poseidon didn’t take that too well and I’m sure that I don’t need to say what happened next.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio pushed herself off of the desk and slowly walked around the other side. “Poseidon decided that the best place to do that to Medusa would be in Athena’s temple. Afterwards he disappeared, leaving Medusa vulnerable and weak. The perfect way to let Athena know that he hated her, and Athena directed all of her anger at Medusa despite Medusa praying for guidance and forgiveness. Athena looked down on Medusa with nothing but feelings of betrayal because she had broken the biggest rule that came with being a priestess of the goddess. Whether consensual or not, Medusa was no longer a virgin. So Athena cursed her to become the snake haired, insane monster that we know of today.” Having completed a lap around the desk, Rio settled against it once more.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha figured that discussing a topic like this made Rio feel restless, unsure of how to hold herself, what to do with her hands, where to direct her gaze. Those would be the things that Agatha was feeling if it was her giving this lecture. Rio was doing a fantastic job and Agatha was proud of her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Having been exiled to an island, the only contact Medusa had with any other living being was the men that were sent to kill her. At first, Medusa was angry with the gods for cursing her and she was scared of her ability to turn people to stone – who wouldn’t be? But soon enough anybody who took one step on her island was now marked for death at the hands of the Gorgon Medusa. The more research that I’ve done into Medusa, the more Athena’s reaction to her being sexually assaulted troubled me.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio changed the slide to show pictures of the earliest books to depict the stories of Greek mythology, and the names of the authors with the years the works were published written below them. “My personal belief for why Athena didn’t side with Medusa, help her and punish Poseidon, is simply because she was written by men.” There was an awkward murmur that rippled through the students, unsure if they should laugh or not. “If these myths and stories were written today, by women, then Medusa’s story might have been told differently and Poseidon might not have gotten away with it.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio glanced up at the wall behind the seating bank and Agatha followed her gaze to the clock that hung there. There were only five minutes left of the lecture. </span>
<em>
<span>‘Has it really been two hours already?’</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha thought to herself. She was shocked at how the time had flown, not that she thought Rio’s lecture would be boring, it had just been a while since she’d sat through a lecture that someone else had given.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio made her way back around the desk and she changed to the last slide which was just a reminder about essay marks being sent out. “On a lighter note, Professor Harkness has finished marking your essays and you should get your marks by the end of the week, so keep an eye on your emails. As the professor mentioned a couple of weeks ago, should you want to contest your mark at all you can email her or make use of her office hours, which are on Tuesdays. I would like to thank you all for sticking with me and giving me your full attention, I really appreciate it.” She brought the lights back up and the students started packing up and making their way out of the room.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha remained in her seat, watching Billy and Alice approach Rio. “You better be bringing me an apple or a ‘worlds best teacher’ mug.” Rio said with a smirk.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Well we would have if we knew that this was happening!” Alice said.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Why didn’t you tell us about this yesterday?” Billy added.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio folded her arms across her chest and leaned her hip against the desk. “I have to keep </span>
<em>
<span>some </span>
</em>
<span>mystery.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy got a cheeky look on his face as he spoke. “Actually yeah, some mystery from you would be nice. I know </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> too much about you.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “Okay, scram you two. You’ve got more lectures to attend.” <br/></span>
<span>Billy saluted her saying, “Yes Miss Vidal, sir,” and Alice pushed him towards the door, throwing a “bye Rio!” over her shoulder.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When the door was closed again Agatha stood up and brought the chair back over to the desk and pushed it under. “Well I can’t speak for anyone else, but that was definitely the best lecture I’ve ever sat through.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio was in the process of unplugging and shutting down her laptop and snorted, saying, “If this is part of your attempt to see Spyro you’re gonna have to work harder than that.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha picked up her bag and slipped her notebook and pen back into it. “Do you just assume that everyone is flirting with you?” She folded her arms across her chest and leaned her hip against the desk, raising an eyebrow.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I can’t help that I’m blessed with this level of charm and good looks.” Rio replied, putting her laptop in her bag and a cocky smile spreading across her face.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and shook her head. She had been charmed by Rio but she couldn’t let Rio know that, not without knowing if Rio felt the same way. She had to continue playing it off. “Have you ever felt the sting of rejection?” She asked jokingly.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio breathed out a short laugh and looked up at her. “I have actually. But I don’t dwell on it, I just move on.” She shrugged and threw her bag over her shoulder, Agatha followed suit and shouldered her own bag.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio started to turn so that she could leave the room but Agatha reached out and put her hand on Rio’s upper arm, stopping her. “I meant it, by the way. You did a really good job this morning and you should be proud of yourself.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio glanced down at Agatha’s hand but it was fleeting and she looked back up at Agatha’s face just as quickly. “Careful, you’re in danger of being nice to me.” She said softly.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Oh don’t worry, this is a one-time event.” Agatha gently squeezed Rio’s arm before letting go.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They stayed there for a moment, just looking at each other. Rio’s expression was unreadable and there was a look in her eyes that Agatha couldn’t figure out. Time seemed to stretch and what was, in reality only a few seconds, felt like hours. It would be so easy for Agatha to reach out again. To grab Rio’s arm and pull her in. What would happen after, Agatha wasn’t sure. But if she made that first move then she would get an answer to the question that had been on her mind for the past month.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She wasn’t ready to do that, however, and when Rio took a small step towards her, she panicked. “There’s gonna be another lecture that needs to take place here soon, so we should go.” She quickly said, walking past Rio to the door. She didn’t stop to check if Rio was following her, she just let the door swing shut behind her and continued to her office. She didn’t even think about the fact that she hadn’t offered to give Rio proper feedback on the lecture, or that the two hours of downtime that she had right now would be the perfect time to do it. She just marched to her office, focussing only on putting one foot in front of the other. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When she got into her office she threw herself down into her desk chair and leaned her elbows on the desk, letting her face drop into her hands.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Jen was right, she was useless at this.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>There was a time where she wouldn’t have hesitated. A time where she would have kissed Rio, repercussions be damned, and she wouldn’t have thought twice about it. But that time had long since passed and she was now in her forties, desperately pining after a woman who was twelve years younger than she was and trying to figure out how to navigate that.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Her phone pinged with an email notification, pulling her out of her thoughts. She opened the app and scowled at the latest unread email when she saw who it was from. It was the Dean summoning her to his office the following morning. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>What the fuck had she done now? She hadn’t made anybody cry, she hadn't insulted any students or staff members, so what did he want?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>This meeting would be cutting into her office hours so it better be fucking worth it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She sent off a quick email to all of her students informing them that she was having to cancel her office hours due to an urgent meeting, and sat thinking about what the Dean could possibly be telling her off for now.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha went to her office first to drop her bag off and then went to the café to get a drink before making her way back up to the Dean’s office. She was muttering to herself the whole time about how much of an inconvenience this was and how he better not just be on a power trip or finding some nonsense to pull her up on because he was bored. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She rounded the corner into the waiting room that came before his office at exactly nine o’clock and rolled her eyes when her vision was unfortunately filled by the Dean’s secretary.</span><span><br/></span><span>She greeted Agatha with a bright smile and said, in her nasally voice, “Oh there you are dear! They’re both waiting for you inside.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha was so desperate to get away from her that she just said, “Whatever,” and went straight to the door. </span><span><br/></span><span>She didn’t bother knocking, she gave up on that a long time ago, and just pushed the door open, walking into the office. </span><span><br/></span><span>It was only then that the secretary’s words sunk in. </span><em><span>“They’re both waiting for you.”</span></em><span> <br/></span><em><span>Both?</span></em> <span><br/></span><span>The Dean was sitting behind his desk, eyes trained on her as she entered, but sitting in front of him was another person. A person with dark hair wearing a dark green leather jacket who turned around to look at her when they heard the door open.</span><span><br/></span><em><span>Why the fuck was Rio here?</span></em><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio gave her a confused look which she returned as she walked towards the vacant chair on Rio’s right.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Nice of you to join us, Agatha.” The Dean said as she sat down.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Cut to the chase, Herb. Why am I here?” The corner of her mouth twitched when she saw him tense his jaw at the way she addressed him. He hated being addressed as anything other than Dean Collins, and he especially hated it when Agatha used his middle name.</span><span><br/></span><span>She cast a sideways glance towards Rio who was looking at her with raised eyebrows and an expression that she couldn’t read.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Herb cleared his throat to get their attention back on him. “It has been brought to my attention, by some faculty members, that the two of you may have engaged in a relationship that goes beyond the standard teacher-student relationship that the university expects you to uphold.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha jumped straight in. “Excuse me? Who-”</span><span><br/></span><span>“You know that I cannot disclose names, Agatha.” Herb cut her off. “While Miss Vidal may be a PhD student, and there is technically nothing illegal about the two of you being in a relationship, it is frowned upon and advised against in the university code of conduct.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha clenched her jaw. “What information have you been given, exactly?” She asked through her teeth. She didn’t look at Rio, she kept her eyes forwards, only on the Dean.</span><span><br/></span><span>Herb inhaled sharply through his nose. “I have been told that, on Wednesday last week, yourself and Miss Vidal were seen walking through the building with your arms around each other, and there have been some reports of you walking arm in arm with Miss Vidal and getting into your car together.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha’s eyes went wide and she heard Rio scoff in disbelief next to her. That's what this was about? Did people really have nothing better to do than make up rumours about her and escalate it to the Dean? Were they really that dissatisfied with their own lives that they have to make every attempt to ruin hers?</span><span><br/></span><span>Before she could respond, Rio spoke up. “With respect Dean Collins, that is just rumour and speculation. The reason that Professor Harkness and I had our arms around each other, as you put it, is because of a knee injury that flared up when I was in the Professor’s office. She was helping me get to the lecture.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Herb narrowed his eyes, but not at Rio. He was still looking at Agatha. “I’m sure that there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for the two of you getting into your car after said lecture as well?” He asked, clearly trying to goad her into misspeaking.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha relaxed her jaw slightly and schooled her features into a more neutral expression. “I offered to take Miss Vidal home after the lecture so that she didn’t have to walk on her injured knee, or stand and wait for a taxi to get her. As for being arm in arm as we walked to my car, Miss Vidal had taken some painkillers that lessened the pain in her knee but she was still unstable as she walked, so I helped her stay upright. Would you rather I just left her stranded with no way of getting home?” Her voice was even but there was an underlying challenge. A challenge for Herb to deny that she was doing anything other than being a good person.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Herb looked between the two of them for a moment before asking, “Can you provide any evidence of this?” He asked, smugness and disbelief covered his voice and expression.</span><span><br/></span><span>Was he being serious? Asking for evidence of an injury that Rio sustained god knows how many years go that randomly comes back without warning? If she wasn’t already certain at this point that he was looking for literally any excuse to fire her, that just cinched it.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha was still making an effort to not look at Rio too much during this but she saw out of the corner of her eye Rio silently bending down and rolling up the right leg of her sweatpants.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha turned her head then because she was shocked at the fact that Rio wasn’t wearing jeans.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Once the leg had been rolled up past her knee, Rio stood up and walked around Herb’s desk slightly so that he could see her better, and pointed at the brace that was on her leg. “I’m not sure what kind of evidence one could present in this scenario, Dean Collins, but hopefully this brace that I got from the hospital when I originally sustained the injury will suffice.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha knew that Rio was well spoken, her writing reflected that, but hearing her speak in this way and using it to take the Dean down a peg sent a tingle down her spine. </span><span><br/></span><span>She watched Herb look down at Rio’s knee, the brace wiping the smug look from his face.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I can show you the painkillers that I was prescribed to take as well, should you require further proof of the unfortunate accident that befell me when I was sixteen.”</span><span><br/></span><span>He cleared his throat once more before saying, “No that won’t be necessary, Miss Vidal. You may take your seat again.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio walked back to her chair and her eyes locked onto Agatha’s, though her expression gave nothing away.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Herb looked between them again. “I can see that the things I was told were in fact rumour and speculation, as Miss Vidal previously stated.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “Is that it?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Herb clenched his jaw. “I would like to apologise to both of you for any inconvenience this may have caused and I shall endeavour to ensure that such gossip will not result in this outcome in the future.” He didn’t look at Agatha though, he spoke to Rio.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha couldn’t hold back the scoff that happened in the back of her throat. She had heard that one before and yet here she was again, sitting in Herb’s office, being reprimanded for something that wasn’t even true, and he couldn’t look at her as he offered his fake apologies.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha plastered a fake smile on her face and said, “Well this has been a pleasure as always Herb, but I actually have some work to be getting on with. And I’m sure Miss Vidal has better things to be doing right now than sitting in your office.” She stood up and started towards the door. “Let’s not do this again any time soon.” She held the door open for Rio before letting it slam shut behind her.</span><span><br/></span><span>She ignored the secretary’s attempt at conversation and silently stalked out of the waiting room. Once she had turned the corner into the corridor she turned to Rio whilst still walking. “That man has vendetta against me. I’m sorry you got dragged into it.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“It’s fine Agatha, don’t worry about it. Hey…”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha felt a hand wrap around her wrist and she stopped dead, turning round to see Rio’s outstretched arm as she caught up. “I’m still not up to full speed, I can’t keep up with you if you walk that fast.” Rio finished with a light chuckle.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha felt a heat blooming on her cheeks from the feeling of Rio’s skin on her own. “Sorry,” she said quietly as she looked down at their hands. “You probably shouldn’t try to hold my hand in the corridors though. Being summoned back into his office five seconds after leaving wouldn’t be a good look.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio laughed and dropped Agatha’s arm. “Very good point. You really weren’t kidding when you said that people would talk if we were seen together, huh?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“It’s not often that I dislike being right, but in this case I’m annoyed that I was.” Agatha dipped her head slightly and caught sight of Rio’s trousers again. She pointed at them and said, “I was beginning to think that you didn’t own anything other than skinny jeans. How are your legs doing now that the blood is able to flow properly?” </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio crossed her arms and lifted an eyebrow. “What is your issue with my jeans? These are easier to fit the brace under if you must know.” She grabbed some of the fabric and wiggled it to demonstrate the baggyness. “And before you ask why I didn’t wear them yesterday, I didn’t think sweatpants would be the correct attire to be giving a lecture in. Now come on before someone reports us for talking in the corridors.” She walked past Agatha and gave her a smirk. Agatha waited for a few seconds before falling into step beside her.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They walked to Agatha’s office in comfortable silence, careful to not walk too closely. Agatha unlocked the door and let them into the room, closing it gently once Rio had walked in, and then sat in her usual chair with a sigh. “Every interaction with that man makes me need a drink, I swear.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio lowered herself into her chair, her knee wasn’t causing her as much discomfort as before. “If you want to whip out a flask, I won’t tell anyone.” </span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh I know </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> wouldn’t, but the last thing I need right now is for someone to report me for drinking on campus. It would be like Christmas for Herb.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio looked at her for a second, face neutral apart from a slight furrow in her brows. “Why does he have it out for you so badly?” </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha sighed and straightened her posture a little bit. She definitely wasn’t going to tell Rio the whole story, or mention any names, but if she was now being involved in the pedestrian drama that the situation created, then it’s only right that she knows the basics.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Some years ago I dated a faculty member and to keep a much longer story short, it ended badly. The other faculty members took her side which led to me being reported for many stupid things, like today, and it made Herb’s life more difficult than it needed to be. There came a point where he decided that it would be easier to fire me, but since he can’t do it without a plausible reason, he takes every one that he’s given until he can find one that works. It’s a rare occurrence when someone defends me with him, so thank you for doing it today.” Agatha kept her eyes on Rio’s, watching for her reaction. </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio licked her lips. “Men like that just enjoy swinging their dicks around, and I enjoy shutting them down.” She said with a sly smile. </span><span><br/></span><span>“You enjoy proving that yours is bigger.” Agatha said, a statement not a question.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio gave a nonchalant shrug. “It usually is.” She said and pushed her tongue against her cheek.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha cleared her throat, not sure how to move on from the current topic of conversation. “I believe I owe you some feedback for your lecture.” She stood up and retrieved her notebook from her bag before sitting back down again.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms. “Ahh yes, tell me how brilliant I was.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Your cockiness will be your downfall one day.” Agatha said as she found the right page and slipped her glasses on. “Your introduction was good, I liked that you had them engaging right away by asking what they knew about Medusa and you handled it well. The information that was on the slides was concise and you elaborated on it well without being glued to your notes the whole time.” She looked up at Rio. “Actually, I don’t think you looked at your notes once.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio tapped her temple a couple of times. “Steel trap.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha smiled. “Of course, how could I have assumed anything else?” She went back to her notebook. “You filled the time well and kept their attention which is a difficult thing to do, especially when you get to the final years, and there was a good balance of humour mixed in with the facts to keep it flowing.” She shut the notebook and took her glasses off, focussing on Rio’s eyes. She changed the tone of her voice from the matter-of-fact one to a softer one. “I was really impressed with how you approached the final section of the lecture. Giving the disclaimer before you started it showed good forethought and compassion. There’s not a lot of experienced lecturers who would have thought to do that. </span><span><br/></span><span>The way you worded everything was probably the best it could have been done and it was a strong decision leaving that part until the end so that, if anyone did need to leave, they wouldn't miss the rest of the lecture.” She set her notebook down on the coffee table. “Overall? Yes, you were brilliant.” She gave a full smile and sat back again.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio sat forwards again with a lazy half smile on her lips. “What was that you said yesterday? Being nice to me was a one time event?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Okay fine, you were absolutely terrible and you have no future in the world of teaching. Is that better?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“No, no. I’m fine with you being nice to me, I just don’t want you to spontaneously combust because of it.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha sighed. “Have I told you that you’re infuriating?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smirked. “You might have mentioned it. Does this glowing review mean that I’ll be allowed to do it again?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha leaned back and crossed her legs. “I don’t see why not. It gives me less work to do, and since it’s nearly the end of the semester, we just need to focus on giving the students as much information they can use on the January exams as possible.” Before Rio could respond, Agatha continued. “Speaking of the end of the semester.” Now was her chance to bring up the ball and gauge Rio’s interest. “You’ve probably already heard about it, but every December the department throws an end of year ball. It’s usually a good night, and it’s an open bar for the first two hours. You should go. It’ll be a good way to get to know people off campus.” She chose her words carefully so as not to outright ask Rio to go with her. It was safer that way.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“You know, you’re the fifth person to mention the ball to me. I might have to turn up and see what all the fuss is about.” Rio said.</span><span><br/></span><span>Fifth person? </span><em><span>Fifth?</span></em><span> Had four other people asked Rio to go with them? Agatha should have expected as much. There was no way that Rio hadn’t gotten the attention of multiple other women at the university. Had she left it too late? </span><em><span>Shit.</span></em><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha’s alarm went off to let her know that she needed to go to her first lecture of the day. Saved by the bell, as it were. She stood up and moved to her desk to get her bag. “Well I’ll hopefully see you there then. Fifth in line apparently.” She kept her voice light and humorous to hide the hurt that was lying just underneath.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio gave a short chuckle. “I don’t think you’ll have any trouble making it to the front of that line."</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha didn’t pause her movements but her mind got stuck on that sentence.</span><span><br/></span><span>What did she mean? Had she rejected the other offers? Or was she now deciding to reject them in favour of her?</span><span><br/></span><span>Was Rio saying that she specifically wanted to go to the ball with her?</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha moved on autopilot as she headed for the door, saying words that she didn’t realise her brain had formed. “Do you want to come sit in on the third year lecture, or do you need to go home and rest your leg?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio walked through the door and turned back around to face Agatha. “My leg’s mostly fine now, I’m just keeping the brace on for a week to make extra sure really. And it’s a good job I did, otherwise you might have spent the last hour packing up your office.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha locked the door and they walked towards the lift together. </span><span><br/></span><span>They rounded the corner that took them past Wanda’s office and just as they were passing the door, something that Agatha had been wishing would never happen, happened. </span><span><br/></span><span>The door opened.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda stepped out and collided with Rio, knocking her into Agatha. Agatha put her arms out and caught Rio as Rio put her own arms out and stopped Wanda from falling over.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh my god I am so sorry!” Wanda started immediately apologising and Agatha helped Rio stand upright properly, trying to process what was happening.</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda looked up at Rio’s face and recognised her. “I thought we were done meeting like this, Rio.” She said with a laugh, not yet noticing Agatha standing behind Rio.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Well I’m just lucky that Agatha was here to stop me from hitting the deck.” Rio replied, stepping to the side so that Wanda could see Agatha.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda’s smile fell and her face started to pale as she looked at Agatha. “I didn’t realise that you were- you don’t usually-” She cleared her throat as Agatha gave her an unamused look. “Where are you going?” </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha gave a tight smile. “I’m going to give a lecture, Wanda. That is our job after all.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda looked down and smoothed out her shirt that was wrinkled where Rio had grabbed her. “Right, of course. Stupid question.” She looked back up at Agatha. “You usually take the stairs.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha’s gaze flicked towards Rio who was watching this interaction with a look that Agatha couldn’t read, and then back to Wanda. She didn’t owe Wanda any explanations and technically, Wanda hadn’t asked a question, so there was no need to even respond. She could just walk away and leave this unfortunate moment behind her. Instead she simply stated, “Rio has a bad leg, stairs aren’t an option.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Wanda immediately turned to Rio, concern on her face. “What happened to your leg? Are you okay?” Agatha’s eyes narrowed as she watched Wanda instinctively start to reach out towards Rio but stopped herself before she touched her.</span><span><br/></span><span>How well did they know each other for that to be Wanda’s reaction? Those weren’t the actions of someone who had only met a person once or twice. They knew each other on more than a base level. What were they to each other? </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha had hoped that every time Rio had threatened to go to Wanda that it was empty, just words with no meaning, but this made her think differently. They </span><em><span>knew</span></em><span> each other. They’d spent time together. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“An old injury got aggravated again, but I’m fine. Just taking it easy.” </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha barely heard Rio’s response through the noise in her head. Her thoughts had gotten so loud in the last thirty seconds that she could feel a headache coming on. She needed to get out of this hallway, she needed to get out of this building. But she couldn’t just run, she had a job to do.</span><span><br/></span><span>She checked her watch, ignoring the slight tremor in her hands, and cleared her throat. “Well, I hate to leave so suddenly, but I do have a job to do.” She had to force her voice to stay even as it threatened to shake like her hands. “Let’s not do this again.” She said for the second time that day.</span><span><br/></span><span>She started towards the lift again, her body on autopilot as her head was still swimming.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She stepped into the lift and slumped in the right corner, letting out a breath and letting her body deflate with it. She dipped her head and closed her eyes, waiting for the doors to close and the lift to start moving, but the sound of the doors opening again made her open her eyes.</span><span><br/></span><span>She saw the shoes first, black converse with small lightning bolts that were in the colours of the pride flag. Then her eyes moved up and she saw the grey sweatpants. They moved up some more and she saw the black t-shirt and dark green leather jacket, an arm outstretched to stop the doors from closing fully. Then finally, she saw Rio’s face. Her eyes were fixed on Agatha, soft and full of worry.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio silently walked into the lift and pressed the button to close the doors once more.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha sighed and said, “I’m not answering any questions.” She definitely wasn’t in the right headspace to be having this conversation right now. She didn’t even know what she would say. How does one begin to talk about what that was?</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio settled herself into the left corner of the lift. “I’m not gonna ask any. Except one.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha leaned her head back against the wall of the lift, bracing herself for whatever Rio was going to say next.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Are you okay?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha whipped her head in Rio’s direction. That hadn’t been what she was expecting. “What?” Was all she could say, probably more sharply than she should have, but she was too surprised.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio gestured towards the now closed doors of the lift. “I don’t need details, but that didn’t look like a normal conversation between co-workers. So, are you okay?”</span><span><br/></span><span>It was a simple question, one that should be easy to answer. But when it came to Wanda Maximoff, things were never easy. “It’s nothing I can’t handle.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“That’s not an answer.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Well it’s the one you’re getting so you’ll have to live with it.”</span><span><br/></span><span>The remaining minute of the lift ride was spent in silence, as was the walk towards the lecture hall. The silence was only broken when Rio started to veer off and Agatha asked, “Where are you going?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio turned so that she was walking backwards. “You go on ahead, I’ll catch up.” She turned back around and continued on her way.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha got to the lecture hall just as the last few students were walking in. She quickly got her laptop set up and dimmed the lights to start the lecture, forcing herself to focus on the task at hand instead of the thoughts that were bombing around her skull.</span><span><br/></span><span>About ten minutes into the lecture, the doors opened again and in walked Rio. Agatha watched her but didn’t stop speaking. There was a slight murmur that ran through the students, but no real disruption caused by the latecomer.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio quietly walked up to the desk in the centre of the room and softly placed a drink and a brown paper bag on it before walking up the seating bank and taking her seat next to Billy.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha, still not breaking from her lecture, watched Billy raise his eyebrows at Rio but she just smiled, shook her head and sat down.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The lecture passed by in a blur, muscle memory guiding Agatha through it. She had a few sips of the coffee that Rio had bought for her as she was changing slides but ignored the bag until the lecture was over.</span><span><br/></span><span>All of the students, including Rio, left the room when the two hours was up, and the next wave of students came in to take their seats.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha took the few minutes that the changeover gave her to see what was in the bag. She pulled out a cinnamon swirl and a pain au chocolat. A napkin fell out with them, but she paid it no mind as she took a bite of the cinnamon swirl. It was only after she had swallowed that bite that she noticed there was something written on the napkin. She picked it up to see what it said.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><em><span>I know you have back to back lectures until the end of the day, so I hope the coffee and pastries make it a little easier for you - R</span></em><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she read it. She looked towards the door like she expected Rio to be standing there watching her, but all she saw were her final year students still filing into the room. She put the cinnamon swirl down next to the pain au chocolat on the bag and loaded up the relevant PowerPoint. She dimmed the lights and tapped out a quick message on her phone before starting the lecture.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Agatha: Thank you</b></p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The rest of the day didn’t exactly pass quickly, but it wasn’t as excruciating as Agatha had expected it to be. She savoured the food and drink that Rio had bought her, making them last as long as she could. The beauty of the iced coffee, as Rio had once pointed out, was that she didn’t have to worry about it going cold, so she was able to make it last a good couple of hours before she finished it. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When she got home at the end of the day she got straight in the shower. She did her normal shower routine and then sat on the floor, just letting the water pour over her. She rested her back against the cool tile wall and pulled her knees up to her chest, finally allowing the events of the morning to flood her mind. She thought about phoning Lilia to help her work through them but she couldn’t move. She was frozen.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The meeting with Herb really wasn’t anything that she would dwell on, she was used to that by now. But everything that happened after? That wasn’t anything that she knew how to process right now. Seeing Wanda outside of a pre-arranged meeting wasn’t something that she ever wanted to do, and then she literally bumped into her. That in itself would have been enough, but there was the fact that Rio and Wanda recognised each other. From that limited interaction Agatha could tell that they had some kind of bond that they had built up. A friendship of some kind.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha knew that it was silly to get wound up about it. Rio and Wanda were free people who could meet and talk to whoever they wanted, and Rio was friends with Billy so it’s entirely probable that they met through him. But the concern on Wanda’s face and the way she reached out towards Rio when she found out about Rio’s leg went beyond just being her friend's mum. There was something there, something between them that Agatha didn’t want to think about. Was Wanda one of the four other people that had asked Rio to go to the ball? Had Rio said yes? Did Billy know? She could ask him about it, but that would be tough to bring up organically.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>‘Hey kid, how’s your first semester going? Also what’s going on with your mum and Rio?’</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<span>That definitely wouldn’t work. Also she didn’t want to use him just to get information, the thought made her feel sick.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Then there was the fact that Rio chased after her into the lift, stopping the doors just in time to get in with her. She hadn’t asked any questions about the very tense and awkward interaction that she had just witnessed, she had only asked if Agatha was okay.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha thought about the way she had responded to it and winced when she remembered how short and sharp her voice had been. But it hadn’t seemed to deter Rio. Rio had understood that she didn’t want to talk about anything and had just let her have her silence. Then Rio had bought her a drink and some food and left a note with it. She had actually thought about the fact that Agatha clearly wasn’t okay with seeing Wanda, and instead of pressing for information she had just bought something that she thought would comfort her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha truly didn’t know what to make of it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She had no idea how long she’d been sitting in the shower for, but the ache in her back and hips when she tried to stand let her know that it had been too long. She dried herself off and put her pyjamas on before going back downstairs to order some food. She would usually cook something, but she was too exhausted to fathom standing in the kitchen for half an hour physically making food, and then having to wash up afterwards. So ordering pizza it was.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>After some deliberation, she also bought her ticket to the ball, scoffing at the limited menu choices. It might have been a few years since she attended one of these events but she swore the options used to be better. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When she had eaten, she went upstairs and started her nightly skin care routine – all products that Jen had picked out for her over the years.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When she was done she crawled into bed and picked up the book that was on her nightstand, </span>
<em>
<span>The Night Circus </span>
</em>
<span>by Erin Morgenstern. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She had bought it a few days after Rio told her about it and was thoroughly enjoying it. She hoped that reading it tonight would quiet her mind, and it did to some extent. The fact that the book jumped around both in place and time meant that she had to concentrate on it more than she usually would if she wanted to follow it, and that gave her something else to focus her mind on.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio hadn’t responded to her text from earlier but she wasn’t reading into it, Rio was probably just giving her space – and she was actually thankful for it.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>After reading a few chapters, she set the book back down and laid on her side to attempt sleep.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She tossed and turned for a while before her brain finally slowed down and she drifted off.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The next month passed pretty easily. Rio gave another lecture, this time about the Underworld and the different layers it had. She used her PhD research to highlight a few different depictions of it, pulling information from books, TV shows, films and even games. She was good at keeping the attention of the first year students and continued to impress Agatha with how well she delivered the lecture.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio continued to go to Agatha’s office whenever she had downtime and they traded who would be buying the food and drinks each time. Since there were no essays to mark, they just talked. Getting to know each other and deepening their friendship. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had started referring to these meetings as dates which absolutely did not make Agatha panic whatsoever. She had a completely normal reaction the first time Rio had said it and definitely didn’t nearly choke on her pastry.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Damn, you really know how to bruise my ego.” Rio had joked.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Well I can’t in good conscience let your head get too big. You’re insufferable enough as it is.” Agatha had replied once she could breathe again.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They still walked to and from lectures together, but they maintained a distance so as not to invoke more rumours and visits to Herb’s office. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio didn’t bring up their run-in with Wanda, and Agatha started to push it to the back of her mind. She did avoid the lifts for a week before remembering what Lilia and Jen had said about not living in the past. If she was to truly move on from it, then she needed to accept that these things would happen and she couldn’t hide from them forever.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha invited Billy and Alice over for dinner another couple of times, she was tempted to ask about Rio’s involvement with Wanda but decided against it. She could ask Rio herself, it wasn’t fair to use Billy like that. If she did then she would be no better than Wanda, and if there's one thing that kept Agatha going, it was knowing that she </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>better than Wanda.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Her weekly dinners with Lilia and Jen were spent fielding questions about Rio, and telling them that she did not need a ‘game plan’ for the ball. She did mention the fact that she and Rio had bumped into Wanda on their way to a lecture and that Rio and Wanda seemed to know each other, but Lilia and Jen just confirmed what the rational part of her brain already knew. Rio and Wanda were both adults who frequented the same areas of the university, they were allowed to meet and even become friends. And should anything start with Agatha and Rio, then she should tell her about her relationship with Wanda and why it ended. But until that point, she would just have to deal with it and continue as normal.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Throughout December decorations went up around the department and the university as a whole, and Agatha added the obligatory singular rope of tinsel around her television that Jen and Lilia insisted that she put up.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Her Christmases as a child after her dad had died had never been happy ones. Her mother always went on a religious tirade, blaming Agatha for all of the bad things that had happened to her that year, saying that her evil nature had made god angry and he was punishing her for not killing Agatha when she was born.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When her step-father came on the scene he only strengthened the tirades, joining in with them and supporting Evanora’s delusions.</span>
<span>

</span>
<span>When she had been with Wanda she began to find ways to enjoy Christmas. Decorating the tree with Billy, baking mince pies with Wanda even though she couldn’t stand them, and getting to see and experience the joy that both Wanda and Billy felt at the season as a whole.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>But since all of that had been taken from her, she had no reason to feel the Christmas spirit anymore, and this December came with a new memory. The 3rd marked one year since the car accident that nearly killed Billy. One full year since Agatha got that call from Wanda and she raced to the hospital. One full year since she was reminded that through all of the heartbreak, sadness and rage she had felt at Wanda cheating on her, the worst, hardest to face part of it was losing Billy.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>December was Agatha’s least favourite month of the year, and she had plenty of reasons for it, but as the night of the end of year ball approached, she hoped that that would no longer be the case.</span>

<p align="justify">
<span>Getting called into the Dean’s office was not on Rio’s bingo card for the year. Yet there she was sitting across from him with Agatha beside her, listening to him tell them that rumours were spreading about their involvement with each other.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The amusing thing was that she was, in fact, sleeping with a member of staff. Just not the member of staff that everyone apparently assumed she was sleeping with.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The less amusing part was the Dean’s tone when he spoke to Agatha, the way that he spoke down to her and clearly had no respect for her. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha was clearly used to this, clearly used to being pulled into his office for stupid things that had no weight to them, but Rio wasn’t. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had never been in a Dean’s office in any capacity, good or bad. This was entirely new to her but she would be damned if she let him sit there with a smug grin on his face while he tried to frame them for having an inappropriate relationship and asked for evidence of an injury.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Thank god Rio was cautious and kept her brace on even after her knee was fine again, because the satisfaction she got from watching his face drop when he saw it was a high she would be riding for some time.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>He was obviously unhappy that he had to dismiss them and couldn’t take any action in favour of the baseless chatter that had made its way to him, but dismiss them he did.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Again, it was clear that Agatha was used to this. But the way that she stalked out of his office and into the hall showed Rio that it affected her more than she would ever let on.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio knew that Agatha wouldn’t be open to questions, especially not mere seconds after the fact, so she followed Agatha’s lead in terms of conversation. It stayed light and small – mostly about her jeans, which she was happy to comply with – until they got to Agatha’s office.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Watching the way Agatha deflated and dropped some of the ‘Professor Harkness’ persona that she upheld where people could see her let Rio know that Agatha viewed her office as a safe space. A place on campus where she could go after meetings like that to decompress and just take a few minutes to herself where she didn’t have to be switched on. And the fact that she was letting Rio witness it meant that she trusted Rio to some degree. Trusted that she wouldn’t judge or make fun of her in this small moment of vulnerability that she was experiencing.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Once again Rio let Agatha lead the conversation, only asking a question when Agatha mentioned the Dean.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Hearing Agatha say that the Dean is just looking for any excuse to fire her and that her fellow staff members aid in this, made Rio feel equal parts sad and angry. Did Agatha have any friends among her colleagues? Did she have anyone that she could go to when something like this happened?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Suddenly Agatha’s need for control, her demand for respect, started to make sense. Her peers had written her off and treated her as less than – all because of a relationship that went wrong. She had lost their respect so she took it back from her students. She wasn’t in control of how her colleagues saw her so she took control of how her students saw her. The Dean looked at her as someone who was beneath him and treated her as nothing other than an inconvenience, so she took that feeling and projected it onto the people that were beneath </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It was a vicious cycle.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio wasn’t expecting Agatha to mention the ball, it didn’t seem like her thing – especially after realising that pretty much the whole department had something against her – but she spoke about it like she regularly attended the event. And she seemed almost sad when Rio told her that she was the fifth person to mention it. Was Agatha trying to ask her to go with her? As her date? No, that couldn’t be right.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha had asked her the other day if she assumed everyone was flirting with her and maybe there was some truth to it because there was no way that Professor Agatha Harkness was asking her on a date. Either way, Rio felt the need to point out that the other people weren’t a threat.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They talked about the upcoming lecture whilst they walked the familiar path to the lifts, when Rio suddenly felt the wind being knocked out of her. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>A body crashed into hers and sent her sideways, but she didn’t fall. She reached out and grabbed the other person to try and steady herself, and also keep them upright as she felt Agatha’s arm wrap around her waist, squeezing gently to stop her from tumbling to the floor.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Once her brain caught up, she registered the red hair and green eyes that belonged to Wanda and felt Agatha pushing her fully back onto her feet.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span><br/>“Oh my god I am so sorry!” Wanda said before she realised that it was Rio that she had just very nearly knocked to the floor. </span>
<span>She laughed lightly. “I thought we were done meeting like this, Rio.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smiled, recalling the two times that this had happened previously. It felt so long ago now. “Well I’m just lucky that Agatha was here to stop me from hitting the deck.” She said as she stepped to the side.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The smile Wanda was wearing was immediately erased when she saw Agatha and Rio watched as Wanda floundered, trying to find something to say. “I didn’t realise that you were- you don’t usually- Where are you going?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio immediately felt the tension settle between the three of them. The panic on Wanda’s face, the tightness of Agatha’s smile. It all furthered Rio’s suspicion that they were each the ex that the other had referenced – and if that was true then that meant that Wanda was the reason that Agatha was a target for the Dean.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio cast her mind all the way back to the time she and Wanda had eaten Chinese food in her apartment, and tried to recall what Wanda had said about the ex that wasn’t her husband. She couldn’t remember the conversation fully as it was months ago, but she swore Wanda had mentioned something about being scared and that it made her do something she regretted.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio had zoned out and only came back to the corridor when Agatha mentioned her name.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Rio has a bad leg, stairs aren’t an option.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda turned to her, looking worried, and started to reach towards her. Rio took a small step back, not enough to be out of Wanda’s reach – not even enough that it was noticeable – but enough that it had been an involuntary reaction to seeing Wanda trying to touch her.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“What happened to your leg? Are you okay?” Wanda asked, stopping her hands before they made contact.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“An old injury got aggravated again, but I’m fine. Just taking it easy.” Rio briefly flicked her eyes towards Agatha and noticed the subtle shake of her hand as she checked her watch. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>As if having to face the Dean this morning wasn’t bad enough, Agatha had now been forced into an interaction with the person who was potentially responsible for it – albeit indirectly responsible, but if what Agatha said about everyone taking Wanda’s side was true, then she was still implicated.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio truly didn’t know how to feel as she watched Agatha walk away. She had no real hard evidence that supported her theory and therefore couldn’t react properly. There was a high likelihood that she would never know the full story, at the end of the day it wasn’t any of her business. She had no loyalties to either of these women, she had known them both for the same amount of time.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Sure she knew them in different ways – </span>
<em>
<span>very different ways</span>
</em>
<span> – but still, she knew each of them minimally. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Wanda’s voice pulled her from her thoughts. “Are you sure your leg is okay?” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio blinked a couple of times, her mind still not fully back. “Yeah it’s nothing, really." She started walking towards the lifts again, following Agatha. “See you later,” she threw over her shoulder, picking up her pace as much as the slight limp she still had would allow. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She got to the lift just in time to throw her arm out and stop the doors from closing. When the doors opened again, she settled herself into the corner across from Agatha.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha huffed out a tired sigh and said, “I’m not answering any questions.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio expected as much. She hadn’t planned on asking any questions, she didn’t even know what she </span>
<em>
<span>would</span>
</em>
<span> ask. She didn’t know how to begin to broach this subject right now, so instead she said, “I’m not gonna ask any. Except one.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She watched Agatha lean back into the corner of the lift and take a deep breath.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Are you okay?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Judging by the speed that Agatha turned to look at her and her tone when she asked, “What?” she hadn’t been expecting Rio to ask that. She had definitely been expecting something more invasive.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I don’t need details, but that didn’t look like a normal conversation between co-workers. So, are you okay?” Rio wasn’t lying, she really didn’t care for the details right now. All she cared about in that moment was making sure Agatha was alright.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“It’s nothing I can’t handle.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio blew a breath out of her nose. “That’s not an answer.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Well it’s the one you’re getting so you’ll have to live with it.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>That was fair enough, Rio supposed. She said that she wasn’t going to ask questions and she stuck to her word.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>On the way to the lecture hall, Rio made a decision and told Agatha that she would catch up. She made her way to the café and picked up the two pastries that she noticed Agatha favoured along with the iced coffee. Whilst she was waiting for the coffee to be made she scribbled </span>
<em>
<span>‘I know you have back to back lectures until the end of the day, so I hope the coffee and pastries make it a little easier for you - R’</span>
</em>
<span> on a napkin and tucked it into the bag with the food. When she received the coffee she carried on to the lecture hall, arriving ten minutes late thanks to the queue. She had hoped that it would only take a few minutes, but once again she was without Agatha’s privileges so she had to wait with the commoners. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>To her credit Agatha didn’t let Rio’s late arrival interrupt her flow, she kept on teaching whilst Rio placed the food and drink on the table and then took her seat next to Billy.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy looked at her with raised eyebrows, his question evident on his face, but she shook her head. He could ask later.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>When the lecture was over Rio left with Billy and Alice, she didn’t want to add anything on top of what Agatha was already feeling about the morning. As soon as they rounded the first corner away from the lecture hall Billy asked, “Please tell me that you didn’t make yourself late just so you could butter Agatha up with food.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smiled and shrugged. “I didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>intentionally</span>
</em>
<span> arrive late. The queue was just long.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“I’m hearing no denial of an attempt to become the teacher's pet.” Alice joined in.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio stepped in front of them and turned so that she was walking backwards. “I don’t need to try to be the teacher’s pet, it just naturally happens.” She turned back around and fell back into step with them. “Besides with the marks you two got on your essays, you might want to try giving gifts to your lecturers once in a while.” </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“What?” Billy and Alice asked in unison.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy grabbed Rio’s arm. “Did we really do that badly?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio looked at him and shrugged. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Dude!” Alice moved in front of her, making her stop walking. “Don’t fuck with us.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“You’ll just have to wait for your grades to see if I was lying or not.” Rio said nonchalantly as she moved around Alice. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Dick.” She heard Billy mutter behind her. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>__________</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The next month passed with more of the same. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio still went to Agatha’s office and she enjoyed watching Agatha panic when she started to call the meetings dates, but since there was no real work to do they just talked. Sometimes they would just keep each other company whilst they read in comfortable silence, trading books and opinions. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>At the start of December, Rio gave her second lecture to the first years.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Okay so as I’m sure you’re all aware, religions tend to have their own version of the afterlife. For Greek mythology it was the underworld – a kingdom that Hades and Persephone ruled over. The earliest idea of the afterlife in Greek myth is that, when a person dies, that person's essence – or psyche –  is separated from the corpse and transported to the underworld.” She changed the slide so that the bullet points matched what she was going to say next. “In the earliest works like Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey, the dead were kinda just lumped together to live a post-existence as shadowy figures. However in later versions of the mythology, the forms of judgement started to make an appearance. It was then believed that there were sections within the underworld where someone's psyche would be sent depending on how they lived their life on top.” She changed the slides again to one that had pictures of the three sections with their names underneath.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“The most unpleasant one is Tartarus. This is where the wicked received divine punishment. Most famously, it’s where the Titans went after they were defeated by Zeus. It also happens to be the easiest part of the game Hades, which seems backwards to me.” That last part got the laugh that she was hoping it would. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Next is Asphodel, the meadows where the vast majority of the dead go. It’s believed to be the place where the normal people went. The people who hadn’t committed any atrocious crimes, but also hadn’t done any outstanding good deeds. And then we have Elysium, the good place. Elysium is a utopian afterlife reserved for specially distinguished individuals where life is easiest, a paradise that heroes could go to as a reward for all the good work they did on earth. So why it’s also the hardest level on Hades, I have no idea.” Once again, the reference to the game got a laugh from the students.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>After giving an overview of the different sections she spoke about the rivers that were contained within the underworld, giving their names and functions. She also touched on the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, which was just an excuse to talk about Hadestown for a few minutes – something Agatha mentioned when giving feedback.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She ended the lecture by talking about the different notable residents of the underworld. Namely Hecate, Charon, Thanatos, and finally, Cerberus.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“The ultimate guard dog and overall goodest boy. He’s depicted as having three heads and is often shown as a Rottweiler, Doberman and sometimes a Molossian hound. But if you ask me, a three-headed Chihuahua would be the most terrifying dog to have chasing you down.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The students laughed as she brought the lights back up, signalling the end of the lecture.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Band practise was focussed on running the setlist until they could all play and sing it in their sleep. There were a few last minute changes in terms of the order of the songs, and one song was swapped out for a different one that they thought would be more of a crowd pleaser, but they were all confident that they were going to absolutely smash the gig.<br/></span>
<span>Taylor joined them in the pub a couple of times, and Rio went home with her. Always leaving instead of staying the night.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Billy made a joke about not wanting to see her when he went home for dinner one weekend and she laughed it off. Rio saw Wanda a handful of times throughout the month and only because getting herself off wasn’t satisfying enough. Wanda was good at it, so why wouldn’t she use what she had at her disposal?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio was a big fan of Christmas and found herself getting more and more homesick as the holiday approached. She bought herself a small tabletop tree and strung some Christmas lights around her apartment to celebrate the season as much as she could by herself. Her friends and family had sent their Christmas cards to her so she put them on her bookcase and windowsills to add to the decorations.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Her flight home was the morning after the ball so she made sure that she had her bags packed and ready to go to avoid rushing around too much. She had a few calls with her family and friends to make arrangements for her being picked up from the airport and to make sure that her time at home was filled with seeing as many of the people that she missed as possible.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>As the night of the ball drew closer she started to feel more nervous. She hadn’t played an actual gig since high school, and playing in a practise room was vastly different to playing in front of an audience. If the other guys fucked up they could catch back on pretty quickly, but if she fucked up then it was a lot more noticeable and that’s what she was worried about the most.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The night before the ball she struggled to sleep. She hadn’t had any more issues with her knee, but it was in the back of her mind. What if she hurt it again before or during? She had no idea how she would recover. She made sure to put her painkillers in the bag she was taking just in case and eventually drifted off to sleep.</span>

<p align="justify"><span>Agatha was pacing around her house, she had already picked out the dress that she was going to wear and knew what she was doing with her hair, so she was just trying to fill the time until she had to get ready. She still had a few hours so she did various bits of cleaning that she had been putting off and got a head start on some of the admin needed for the new semester that started in January.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Jen and Lilia had offered to come over and help her get ready but she turned them down – something she regretted as she was trying to pin her hair up in her bathroom mirror. After some time of fighting with the unruly mane that lived on her head, she was finally happy with it and moved on to her makeup. She wasn’t really one for getting glammed up, nor did she really know what she was doing, so she kept it light. She chose an eyeshadow colour that matched her dress and went with a light lip, finishing with a small amount of blush and highlighter.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The dress that she chose was one that she hadn’t worn in years. It was once a favourite of hers but it had been tainted by bad memories that she was hoping to erase tonight. She slipped it on over her head and tied the halter style neck into a bow at the back, admiring herself in her full length mirror.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The dress stopped just above her ankles and had a slit that went up to the middle of her right thigh. It still clung to her hips the way that it did four years ago and the plunge in the front was modest. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was happy with her choices and ordered an Uber to take her to the hotel that the ball was being held in. She slipped on a pair of black heels and went outside to wait for the car.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio, Ash, Billy, Alice and Eddie, all arrived at the hotel to set their instruments up and run through a sound check, around three hours before the event was due to start. They were all half dressed in the clothes they would be wearing later on, and half dressed in comfy clothes so that they wouldn’t have to rush around so much to get ready after the sound check.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Since they had the time, they ran through the setlist in full so they could hear how each song sounded in the room and adjust the levels accordingly.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When they had finished the final song, Ash said, “I don’t want to jinx us, but that might be the best we’ve ever played.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Well Ash has now guaranteed that we’ll suck tonight.” Eddie joked.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio snorted. “Don’t worry, we can just drown our sorrows afterwards. We’ll still have half an hour of free bar time.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“What about the free bar time before we play?” Billy asked, only to be immediately followed by the four remaining people saying, “Not for you!” in perfect unison. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>With Billy’s incredibly low tolerance, there was no way they were letting him drink before they went on stage. The rest of them though, they would definitely take advantage of the free bar.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They had agreed that they’d all get ready together in the flat that Billy and Alice lived in to make sure that none of them lost track of time and so that they could all arrive together.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The boys and Ash had gone for suits with matching ties, the three of them looked very dapper. Alice had gone for a shirt and skirt combo, keeping it simple whilst still putting in some effort.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When Rio walked into the living room the others were all waiting for her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“You’re cutting it close, Vidal. The Uber is a minute away.” Eddie said, holding up his phone for her to see.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Well what are we all standing round for? We have a gig to play.” Rio replied with a smirk and they all headed for the door. </span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>As the taxi pulled up outside the building, Agatha began to feel nervous. She hadn’t attended a university event in nearly three years, she hadn’t spoken to any of the staff members here in nearly three years. And on top of that, there were also students in attendance. The whole evening was set to be a clusterfuck of awkward interactions, but she had committed to it and she wasn’t one to back down. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She thanked the driver and stepped out of the car, taking a deep breath before going up the steps and into the building.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She followed the signs leading to the function room that the university had hired and as she got closer people started to do double takes when they saw her. She heard a few of them whispering to each other as she walked past.</span><span><br/>
</span><em><span>“Is that Agatha?”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>“What’s she doing here?”</span></em><span><br/>
</span><span>She ignored them and headed past the bar that was just outside the room. It was swarmed with students that were trying to make the most of the fact that it was free so she decided to find her seat first and let the crowd die down before she got a drink.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>There was a board just inside the entrance that showed the seating plan. The tables that were reserved for students were in the front half and the tables for faculty were in the back half. She scanned the board and found her name on table twelve – a table in the back corner of the room – but paused when she saw who she was supposed to be sitting next to.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Was this some kind of sick joke? Had the person that made this seating plan had a stroke half way through? That had to be the explanation. There was no other way that someone could have thought sitting her next to Wanda would be a good fucking idea.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She quickly looked around the room checking to see if Wanda had arrived yet but she saw no sign of her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Good, there was still time to fix this.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She headed towards her table and found her name card checking her options to see who she could swap with. Her choices were thin, she didn’t want to sit with any of these people, but any of them would be better than sitting next to her ex-fiancée. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She picked up her card and was about to slyly swap it when she heard someone behind her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Agatha, is that you?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She cursed under her breath before placing the card back down, putting on a fake smile and turning towards the voice. It was Dottie Jones, the head of the department.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“It is you! Oh my, it’s wonderful to see you!”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Before she could stop it, she was pulled into a hug. She awkwardly wrapped one arm around Dottie and waited for her to pull back again.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I can’t believe you came this year, it’s been so long.” Dottie said once she released Agatha.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha made sure to maintain her smile while she spoke. “I figured it had been long enough, it’s about time I reintegrated myself.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I couldn’t agree more! And look, we’re sat next to each other.” Dottie pointed to her own name card that was sitting in the place next to Agatha’s.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha did her best to convey happiness in her features. “That’s great, that’ll be one friendly face at least.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Dottie placed a hand gently on her arm. “Oh you don’t have to worry about that, everyone will be glad to see you.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha knew that Dottie was just trying to keep the peace but it was a lie, and she was not looking forward to having her every move scrutinised by the people who still carried their vendettas.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Dottie lightly squeezed her arm. “I’m going to say hi to some more people, but we’ll catch up properly later.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“You bet.” Agatha said as Dottie walked away.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She blew out a breath and dropped her smile. Well she couldn’t swap the name cards now that Dottie had pointed out that they were sitting together could she? She would just have to suck it up, she could do that. With enough alcohol she could definitely give it a good go.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She looked towards the door and saw a group of students walk in, a lot of them already tipsy, and decided to take her chances at the bar. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The crowd had thinned and the remainder parted once they saw her. The corners of her mouth ticked upwards. Her reputation worked off campus it seemed and she still made it to the front of the queue.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She ordered two large glasses of wine and took them back to her table as people continued to filter in.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The five band mates arrived at the venue and made a beeline for the bar. As they were waiting in the queue, Rio addressed them. “Okay kids, remember we still have to play so don’t go too hard right now.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They all looked at Billy who rolled his eyes. “You’re all bullies.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Four of them ordered two pints each and when Billy’s turn to get served came, he also ordered a pint for himself, much to the displeasure of his friends.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They all groaned.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“This is gonna ruin the tour.” Alice said, pinching the bridge of her nose.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I can handle </span><em><span>one</span></em><span> pint you dramatic fucks.” Billy said in an exasperated voice as they walked into the room. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They checked the board to find their table, they were on table one, and went to find their seats.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Are you sure you can play in those heels?” Ash asked Rio.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio pointed at the stage. “I’ve put a pair of Converse next to the kit to change into.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“And the corset?” Eddie asked with a raised eyebrow.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio gestured to her torso. “The corset makes me better actually. I could fight a war in this corset.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her phone played the message tone.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Alice looked at her, confused. “Where the fuck did that come from?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio reached below the top edge of the corset and pulled her phone out. “It’s multifunctional.” She said with a smile as she checked her phone.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Wanda: You have no idea what that outfit is doing to me</b><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio looked up and craned her neck to sweep her eyes around the room. It took a few seconds but she spotted Wanda at the back of the room, talking to a woman that she didn’t recognise. Wanda wasn’t looking at her, she was just engaged in the conversation.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Rio: You shouldn’t message me things like that when I’m sat next to your son</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Rio put her phone face down on the table and tuned back into the conversation her friends were having.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“... remember, the bridge is E minor and B minor twice, then it goes to F and then C.” Eddie was telling Billy.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Then D minor, B flat, G minor, then A, I know.” He took a swig of his lager. “As long as Rio doesn’t start us off too fast, we’ll be fine.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Learn to keep up with me.” Rio said with a smirk. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Out of the corner of her eye, Rio saw a woman walk into the room holding two glasses of red wine. </span><em><span>She’s got the right idea</span></em><span> she thought and it took her brain a moment to register who she had just seen.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She turned her head in the direction that Agatha was walking and got a strange sense of déjà vu as she watched Agatha make her way to her table, though she couldn’t place what it was in that moment.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her eyes travelled down Agatha’s back taking in the mark that was on her left shoulder blade. Was that one of her tattoos? Rio had now seen two out of three, but where was the other one? </span><span><br/>
</span><em><span>“A place that you will never see”</span></em><span> was what Agatha had said and Rio was sure that she could collect them all if she tried.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her eyes continued their route downwards to where the dress that Agatha was wearing moulded to her hips before becoming more free-moving thanks to the slit that went up the right side.</span><span><br/>
</span><em><span>“So she’s hot but you're </span></em><span>not </span><em><span>sleeping with her?”</span></em><span> Chloe’s question from over a month ago replayed in Rio’s head. Agatha was definitely hot, so why </span><em><span>wasn’t</span></em><span> she sleeping with her?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Earth to Rio.” Alice’s voice brought her out of her thoughts, along with a balled up napkin to her chin. “You’re acting like the distracted boyfriend meme.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio realised that she had been staring at Agatha for longer than could be considered normal. She blinked a couple of times and cleared her throat. “Sorry, what were we talking about?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Alice laughed and shook her head. “I swear you’re no better than a man. We were talking about the after-party.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Rude and I’m not going to the after-party, my flight home is tomorrow morning and I want some sleep before I have to be trapped on a plane for twelve hours.” She took a drink of her pint and cringed at the length of her flight.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her friends continued to make plans for after the ball and Rio couldn’t resist looking over her shoulder towards Agatha again. Would it be weird if she went to talk to her? </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wait, since when did Rio Vidal overthink talking to an attractive woman?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She pushed her chair back and stood up. “I’ll be back.” She said to the group before setting off in Agatha’s direction. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She heard Eddie say, “Hey Arnold Schwarzenegger, we go on in half an hour, don’t get distracted!” behind her and she waved her hand dismissively.</span></p><p align="center"><span>*~*</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha was sitting alone at her table sipping one of her glasses of wine. She had seen Wanda talking to Dottie when she walked back through, but neither of them had approached her yet thank god. She was beginning to regret her decision to come when out of the corner of her eye she saw someone walking towards her. She closed her eyes for a second and took a deep breath, trying to prepare for whatever was about to happen.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“You got me a glass of wine? You shouldn’t have.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha immediately opened her eyes again as she recognised the voice. The low tone and accent that she had come to enjoy hearing. The constant underlying sarcasm that had once been a source of annoyance but had since started to have the opposite effect. The voice that could only belong to one person.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio was casually standing next to her, hands in the pockets of her trousers and a lazy smile on her face. The trousers were loose fitting, the bottoms kept off the floor by a simple pair of black heels. But what caught Agatha’s eye was the top part of Rio’s outfit. A black, over bust corset, with gold vines woven into the brocade. The vines snaked around the corset and disappeared beneath the waist-length black jacket that was sitting on Rio’s shoulders. The top and bottom edges of the corset had a dark green lace that extended just beyond them and the gold studs on the busk glinted as Rio breathed, catching the light. Her hair was in soft waves, falling gently down her back and over her chest.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she took in the person standing before her. This was another dream, it had to be. She would wake up in her bed and it would still be the night before the ball. Of course that would mean that she dreamt about a conversation with Dottie – which would never happen – so maybe this wasn’t a dream. This was really happening. Rio was really standing in front of her, wearing that and making a sarcastic comment about the amount of glasses of wine she had.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha cleared her throat to make her voice work. “It wasn’t my intention, but they’re free so go ahead.” She picked up the full glass and held it out to Rio, doing her best to match Rio’s smile.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio wordlessly took the glass. She briefly looked at the liquid and gently swirled it around the glass, smelling it before finally taking a sip. She held the wine in her mouth for a few seconds before swallowing it. “Is that Crianza Rioja?” She asked as she pulled out the chair next to Agatha and sat down.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha lifted her eyebrows in surprise. “It is. How did you know that?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio shrugged. “My parents like their wine. We used to test each other when I was younger, though I’m better with reds than I am whites.” When Agatha’s surprise didn’t falter, she added,  “I told you that Dionysus was too on the nose.” The wine tasting game had started when she was sixteen. That’s when her parents deemed her old enough to start drinking, the legal age limit be damned.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio took a proper sip of the wine and put the glass back down on the table. “I expected you to have more expensive taste.” She smirked.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha laughed. “And I expected you to be a lot more inebriated. Are you not taking advantage of the open bar?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“We’re pacing ourselves. Not every student is solely interested in getting wasted, you know.” She had another drink of the wine.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha rolled her eyes. Of course Rio would have a sarcastic reply to that question, she shouldn’t have expected anything else. She took a sip out of her own glass. Now that Rio was sitting down, Agatha noticed the shimmer around her eyes. A subtle amount of eyeshadow to match the gold pattern on her corset.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She hadn’t thought about what Rio would wear tonight, in fact she’d made a pointed effort to not think about it. Rio had never fully confirmed that she would be here so Agatha didn’t want to get her hopes up. She didn’t want to pin her experience of the night entirely on Rio’s attendance, but now that Rio was here – and it definitely wasn’t a dream – Agatha felt herself relaxing a bit.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio shifted slightly in her seat, nudging the chair closer to Agatha by an inch at most. It was subtle, but it was enough that their knees touched and Rio let her leg rest against Agatha’s. “That dress is gorgeous by the way. The colour suits you.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>The compliment, though true, wasn’t intended for any purpose other than being a compliment. She had a feeling that Agatha hadn’t received the warmest reception, and the fact that Agatha was sitting at her table alone whilst everyone else milled about, chatting and mingling, solidified the thought.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha blinked, her brain struggling to register what Rio had said.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Had she just given her a compliment? Why had she just given her a compliment? She should say something back. That’s how normal people behaved.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“You don’t look too bad yourself. I’d ask how you’re functioning in that corset, but I already know that you like tight clothes.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio looked down at herself and then back up to Agatha, giving a light chuckle. “I’m not doing too bad at the moment. Ask me in a bit and I’m sure I’ll be regretting my choices.” She moved the leg that was resting against Agatha’s so that she could point at her shoes. “It’s the heels that might cause the most issues. I don’t know how you do it every day.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh it takes years of practice and a rigorous training schedule. I can teach you if you like?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Nah, I’m good. I’m not insecure about my height.” Rio smiled and pushed her tongue against her cheek, enjoying the way Agatha reacted to her teasing.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha huffed and drank her wine, finishing the glass. “No, you run your mouth enough to make up for what you’re missing height wise.” The corner of her mouth curved upwards slightly, a hint of a smirk.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio put her hand on her chest and gasped in feigned offense. “Professor Harkness insulting a student? And in front of all these witnesses as well?” She leaned forwards and dropped her voice, keeping it low and quiet. “You’re quite the rebel.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha leaned in, dropping her voice as well. “Oh Rio, you have no idea.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They were now mere inches apart, the noise of chatter around the room seemed to disappear, and Rio’s eyes flicked down to Agatha’s lips. They lingered for a brief moment before flicking back up to Agatha’s eyes. The colour of the dress she was wearing somehow made them brighter, more captivating. The temptation to lean in the remainder of the way was almost too much. For months they had been getting closer. An accidental hand touch here, a flirty comment there. It somehow all felt like it had been leading up to this night.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha felt her pulse spike when she realised just how close she and Rio were and her breathing started to quicken when Rio looked at her lips. It would be so easy to close the gap. It would be so easy to just lean into the remaining space and do what she’d wanted to do for months now. She thought about how Rio’s hair would feel when she wove her fingers into it, how soft Rio’s skin would feel as she cupped her cheek. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>They were close enough that Agatha could smell Rio’s perfume. It was the same intoxicating scent that had taken over her senses that day in her office. She wanted to bury her face in Rio’s neck and breathe it in.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Neither of them got a chance to act on their impulses because they were interrupted by Billy appearing at Rio’s shoulder, making both of them jump with his sudden presence. “Rio, we need you dude.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio practically sprang out of the chair. “Right! Just give me one more minute.” Upon seeing the exasperated look Billy gave her, Rio added on, “I’ll be quick, I swear.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy started walking away. “Sixty seconds. I’m counting Vidal.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha was now standing too, looking thoroughly confused. “What was that about?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio started shrugging off her jacket. “Don’t go anywhere and you’ll see.” She handed her jacket to Agatha. “Can you keep hold of this for me?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Sure, but-” Agatha stopped talking as she watched Rio pick up her glass of wine and down the remainder.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“We’ll talk more when I’m back.” Rio spun around and walked with a brisk pace towards the stage where Billy, Alice and some other students that Agatha didn’t really recognise were picking up instruments.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>As Rio was walking away, Agatha saw the tattoo that Rio had mentioned was on her back. Extending past the corset, and curling so that it stopped on her shoulder blades, were the lines of a vine with some leaves sprouting off of it. Did it go down the full length of her spine?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha sat back down in her seat, laying Rio’s jacket over her lap. She subconsciously reached for her glass only to be disappointed when she remembered that she had finished it. She wanted to go get another but Rio had asked her to stay so stay she would.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She barely registered the person who sat on her left, eyes still on Rio as she sat behind the drum kit. Since when did Rio play drums? Since when was Rio in a band with Alice and Billy?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>A realisation dawned on her. Rio had said that four other people had mentioned the ball to her, there were four other people in the band. Agatha wouldn’t have any trouble being at the front of the line because the line consisted of her friends.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha had been jealous of undergraduate students, one of which had basically been her son for four years. Oh she was stupid.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I’ve been looking forward to this.” The person sitting next to her said, snapping her from her thoughts.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha turned her head towards the person and rolled her eyes when she saw who it was. “What do you want, Wanda?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I want to watch my son play the songs that he’s been rehearsing for months.” She slid a glass of wine across the table towards Agatha. “The son that thinks we’ve reached a point of civility, so please afford me the next half an hour of pretending that you don’t still hate me.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha considered it for a moment before picking up the glass and taking a sip. She could survive thirty minutes for Billy.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio had changed into her sneakers, feeling the familiar grip that her converse gave her on the pedals, and was waiting for Eddie’s signal to start the drum fill that began Call Me.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She spared a glance in Agatha’s direction and was surprised to see Wanda sitting next to her, giving her a glass of wine.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Eddie addressed the room. “Good evening Cambridge University Ancient History department!” There was a cheer from the students and some of the staff. “I hope you’ve all been making use of the free bar, it’ll make us sound better than we actually are.” Laughter rippled through the crowd. “You’ve got us for the next half an hour and our first song is our drummer’s anthem so make sure you take her up on it.” He looked over his shoulder and winked at Rio.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>He’d promised that he wouldn’t actually say that, dickhead. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio mouthed ‘fuck you’ before playing the triplet fill that opened the song.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha gave a small laugh at the joke Eddie made once she recognised the song. It was very Rio to ask him to say that. Maybe she would have to make sure she was first in line after all.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When the song reached the bridge, Wanda said, “I have to admit, they’re better than I thought they would be.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha scoffed. “Billy ought to be. I paid for his first lot of guitar lessons, remember?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda hummed. “You bought him that guitar too.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha thought back to Billy’s thirteenth birthday.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><em><span>Agatha and Wanda had been together nearly a year and had been talking about Agatha moving in with her and Billy for a few months. But they had agreed that they’d wait until after Billy’s birthday so as not to overshadow the day for him. Billy had been talking Wanda’s ear off about wanting to learn to play guitar ever since the three of them had watched School of Rock towards the end of the previous year, and Wanda had told him that if he still wanted to learn by his birthday then she would get him lessons as a late birthday present. </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>In February, about a month before his birthday, Agatha had convinced Wanda to let her buy Billy the guitar lessons for his birthday. They did their research and found a local guitar teacher with good reviews and Agatha paid for ten lessons up front to start on the weekend a week after his birthday. She also bought him a pack of guitar picks in a range of thicknesses and a capo to get him started. Since the instructor had guitars for the students to use, they had decided to hold off on buying him an actual guitar until they were sure that it was something he would actually stick at.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Agatha designed and printed an A4 certificate saying </span></em><span>“Congratulations! You are now the owner of 10 weekly guitar lessons starting on the 16th of March 2019!” </span><em><span>She put it in an envelope and put the envelope in a box, along with the plectrums and capo, which she wrapped and gave to him.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>He nearly cried with happiness when he opened it and pulled her into a tight hug saying, “I’m so glad my mum asked you out.” </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Agatha and Wanda laughed, both taking turns to ruffle his hair once he pulled away from the hug.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Wanda said, “You should thank Agatha for saying yes.” She pressed a quick kiss to Agatha’s lips before continuing. “Okay, go get dressed. You still have to go to school.”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Billy dramatically rolled his eyes. “It should be illegal to have to go to school on your birthday.” But he got up off the couch and went upstairs all the same.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Agatha chuckled. “I know kid, they’re monsters.”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>When Billy was safely upstairs, Wanda kissed Agatha again. This time it was deeper and more passionate. “For the record,” Wanda started, slightly breathless, “I’m really glad I asked you out as well.” </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Agatha pulled Wanda into her lap and brushed her hair behind her ear. “For the record, I’m really glad I said yes.”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>They kissed again, quickly breaking apart and giving each other a look that said ‘we’ll continue this later’, when Billy started to come back downstairs.</span></em></p><p align="center"><em><span>__________</span></em></p><p align="justify"><em><span>They were driving Billy to his final lesson of the ten that Agatha had bought and this was the fourth week in a row of Billy telling them that his instructor said that he should really have his own guitar so that he could practise between his lessons.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Wanda said, “I’ll think about it,” like she always did and they both told him to have fun before driving back home.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>“Have you?” Agatha asked, looking at Wanda briefly before making sure her eyes were back on the road.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>“Have I what?”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>“Thought about it?” </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Wanda sighed. “I have and I’ve done some looking online. It’s very expensive to just get him the basics. The guitar, a case, a strap, a stand, an amp, cables, extra strings. And then there’s the fact that he’ll probably want a bunch of effects pedals as well.”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>“What has his dad said about it?” Agatha asked.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Agatha had only met Vision a handful of times when he’d come to pick Billy up for weekends at his or the days out that they’d planned, but he seemed like a nice guy and a decent parent considering he and Wanda were divorced. Billy enjoyed the time he spent with his dad and that’s all that mattered to Agatha. If that ever changed, however, she was ready to fight for Billy’s independence from him.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Wanda had started discussing more things about Billy with Agatha since she had moved in but as it stood right now, Vision and Wanda were still the main decision makers in Billy’s life.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Wanda ran a hand through her hair. “He said the same thing and that it’s only just been Billy’s birthday and Christmas is a while away.”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Agatha thought about it. The kid seemed to be working hard and really enjoying his lessons. He was getting good marks at school and was well behaved, never in trouble barring the odd teenage-hormone fuelled outburst.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>She put care into how she phrased the next thing she said, speaking cautiously so that she didn’t overstep any boundaries. “We could leave the choice up to Billy as to whether he wanted it to count as an early Christmas present, or whether he’d rather wait. But what if I bought him the guitar and the rest was split between you and Vision? The effects pedals can come later, but this would cover the basics for him.” She remained facing forwards, focussing on her parking out of fear of seeing a look of disgust or disapproval on Wanda’s face. </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>When she had finished her parallel parking, she chanced a look over at Wanda. But what she saw wasn’t disapproval or disgust. Wanda looked… sad? </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>No wait, she was smiling. Those were happy tears filling her eyes.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>“You would do that for him?” Wanda asked, voice shaky.</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Agatha cupped her face, wiping away a tear that had dropped with her thumb. “Of course I would, my love. He’s as much my family as he is yours.”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>Wanda leaned in and kissed her. “I love you.”</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>“I love you too.” </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span>It was moments like these with Billy and Wanda that allowed Agatha to feel like she could be good, that she had something to offer other than misery. That she was worthy of happiness.</span></em></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio was glad that she’d taken her jacket off and given it to Agatha because just that one song had made her start sweating. She pushed her hair behind her shoulders in the time they had whilst Eddie changed to his acoustic guitar. They had dedicated some rehearsal time to planning out how they would transition between songs to make sure there wasn’t a bunch of silence whilst Eddie swapped guitars for a couple of songs. They had even timed themselves to get the time that it took as low as they could. Too many bands suffered from stage death because they hadn’t had this foresight.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When Eddie was ready they went straight into the next song. Since it was more simple for her, Rio found herself looking back at Agatha. Agatha was watching Billy but she was too far away for Rio to make out her expression. She did notice Agatha’s mouth moving slightly in time with the words. Rio smiled at the fact that Agatha was singing along and her eyes moved to Wanda, who </span><em><span>was </span></em><span>watching her. Rio didn’t need to be able to properly see Wanda’s face to know what it looked like. She had seen that look from Wanda many times. It was a look that told Rio that there was only a limited amount of time that she would be staying clothed for.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Usually that look would have brought Rio to her knees, in more ways than one. But tonight it wasn’t having an effect on her. She wasn’t interested in Wanda right now. She was interested in the woman sitting next to her. She brought her attention back to the drums as she did a fill and then it went to Agatha again. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha was looking at her now, still too far away to read her features, but she was definitely watching her. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>It was probably innocent, the whole room was looking at them, but just knowing that Agatha was watching her made a heat settle low in her stomach.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Focus Vidal,” she muttered to herself. “We’re only on the second song.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was thankful that she was sitting behind the wall of sound that the band were creating and nobody could hear her talking to herself like a crazy person.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She didn’t look in Agatha’s direction again until the song had ended. It was the safest option given how her body was reacting. It wouldn’t be a problem if she didn’t still have seven songs to get through, but she didn’t exactly have the time to quickly run off and sort herself out right now.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Eddie addressed the room again as the applause died down. “Thank you! I hope we’re doing these songs justice for you. This next one is gonna require a little work from you guys so if you could get your phones out and put your torches on and wave them in time, that would be great!”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When he finished speaking, the lights in the room dimmed. They had asked during soundcheck if this could happen and were given “maybe” as an answer, so it was nice that it had.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Alice and Billy started the intro and there were some people who recognised it immediately, either smiling or rolling their eyes. Some people took until the chorus to catch on, but there was a sea of phone lights waving in the room nonetheless.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Both Agatha and Wanda recognised the song instantly. Agatha groaned whilst Wanda gave an excited gasp. Billy looked over and smiled at Wanda, knowing that this song was one of her favourites. He probably made sure this one was included because he knew it would make his mum happy. It was sweet, but it didn’t make the song any more listenable. At least it was someone else singing and not that awful Gallagher man, that was something. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda had her phone in the air and was singing along. She had once asked Agatha if this song could be their first dance – which Agatha had immediately vetoed. She had dodged a bullet in that regard.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda nudged her with her elbow and gestured to Agatha’s clutch then to her own phone. Agatha rolled her eyes and took a gulp of her wine. It was already half gone and it had to last the full set, but for this song, she needed it. She begrudgingly opened her bag and took her phone out, switching the torch on and holding it up like everyone else.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha started to subconsciously sing along, only catching herself when the entire band dropped out after the guitar solo – which Billy did incredibly well – and let the audience sing the first line of the final chorus. She noticed Rio looking at her and laughing. Her disgust with herself for singing along to Oasis must have been evident.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The song finally ended – five minutes was an egregious amount of time for that song to last – and the lights came back up making Agatha blink at the readjustment. She turned her torch off and put her phone on the table. The singer was changing his guitar again whilst the others continued playing to fill the silence. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha turned to Wanda who still had a sappy smile on her face. “How many guitars does Billy have now?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda seemed shocked that Agatha was speaking to her and took a moment to reply. “Oh, uh, he has four. The electric and acoustic ones that you know about, and he’s bought two more electric ones since then.” She nodded towards him. “That one’s still his favourite though. Something about the quality of the pickups or the style of the neck or something, I don’t really understand it but he seems to know what he’s talking about.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha smiled fondly, she missed hearing Billy talk to her about his guitars and music in general. He used to ask her to put a random song on and watch as he figured out how to play it by ear. He always had it down by the time the song was over and she’d put it on again so that he could play it from the top.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>He had played and sang at her and Wanda’s engagement party. That had been the first – and last – time that she had actually seen him perform, apart from now. It also happened to be the last time that she had worn the dress that she had chosen for tonight. She wasn’t sure if she liked this coincidence yet. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The next song had started but Agatha wasn’t paying attention. She was finding herself enjoying this short walk down memory lane of her time with Billy. “Do you remember the weeks he spent learning that song from the end of School Of Rock?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh do I? If I never hear that song again, it’ll be too soon.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They both laughed at the memory. “He was so proud when he called us into his room to watch him play it.” Agatha said.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“It’s still one of his favourite movies, he watches it at least once a month. At least he did before he moved onto campus, but I’m sure he’s kept it up.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha smiled. “I don’t think he’ll ever let that movie go, it showed him how cool being a rockstar could be.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She turned her attention back to the band, more specifically, back to Rio. She was concentrating but still adding some flair to her playing, twirling her drumsticks between beats but never missing them. The whole band was a cohesive unit, interacting with each other and having fun. It made them enjoyable to watch.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>On the lyric “long brown hair,” Agatha swore Rio looked at her. It was brief, but she was certain.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She had finally tuned into what the song was at the end of the chorus when she heard the title lyric and Rio looked at her again. Even from this distance she could see her smirk.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Was Rio using this song to flirt with her? </span><span><br/>
</span><span>They had been very close earlier and not just in distance. There had been an energy that Agatha knew she wasn’t making up, she could tell that Rio had felt it too from the way she was looking at her. It was definitely mutual.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The realisation made Agatha’s heart start to beat faster. Lilia would be loving this if she was here.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>As if she could sense what Agatha was thinking, a message from Lilia made Agatha’s phone light up.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Kooky Bitch: How’s it going? </b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Agatha: Ask me again in the morning.</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Kooky Bitch: That’s my girl!</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Agatha put her phone down and looked back up at Rio in time for the end of the final chorus. She was still looking at her, still smirking, but as the final lyric was sung, Rio winked. Agatha’s brows shot up and she couldn’t stop the smile that pulled at the corners of her mouth.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Four songs down and the crowd was loving them. Ash high fived Rio and said, “Dude, that was so clean!”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“We’re crushing this!” Billy leaned over the kit to say.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Eddie was once again working the crowd. “Are there any Swifties in the house?” This got the loudest cheer so far. “This next one is for all of you!”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Alice used the drum pads on her keyboard to start the beat for Anti-Hero and Rio started to regret not bringing any water on stage with her to quickly gulp down.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She had planned to, but she had gotten a little distracted before they went on stage so she had forgotten. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The beat looped while Alice played some synth lines and Rio did some light cymbal work through the first verse and pre-chorus and then the beat dropped out when Rio fully started playing on the chorus. This was something they’d only decided on in their last rehearsal so Alice and Rio exchanged a happy look when it went smoothly.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The rest of the song also went smoothly as did the transition into the next song. They all had so far and with each song they did, their collective energy grew. They’d had energy when they were rehearsing but actually being in the room with an audience and watching people singing along and dancing around was a whole different thing. Being able to not only feed off of the vibes from each other but the crowd watching them elevated the feeling. It gave them a boost.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy had said that he didn’t want to sing, he just wanted to focus on playing, but Rio loved seeing him not being able to resist leaning into Eddie’s microphone and singing along with Alice’s harmonies. Eddie didn’t let it throw him off, he just stepped to the side when he saw Billy walk towards him so that they both had space to sing. And the way that they looked at each other was so cute, it made Rio happy to see it.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>It almost made her miss being in a relationship. </span><em><span>Almost.</span></em> <span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Sure relationships were good in the beginning. You had your person, your constant. But when that all went away, the readjustment to being by yourself was tough. Having to relearn how to be you wasn’t something that she wanted to go through again.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She hoped that Billy and Eddie wouldn’t have to do that, she hoped that they had found their forever. Because if they could, then maybe she could too.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha wasn’t super up to date with the newer pop music, she knew a few Taylor Swift songs and didn’t hate them, but the one the band played after was completely lost on her. Wanda seemed to know it though, singing along to every word. She stopped to say, “Eddie’s an incredible singer isn’t he?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>That’s who Eddie was? She had heard Billy mention him when he and Alice had been round for dinner a few weeks ago, and seeing them on stage now that she had a face to put to the name, she could see it. The way that Billy looked at him, the kid was in love.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>He had downplayed it when he told her about him, but he was probably trying not to rush into anything.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy had seen his mum go through two relationships in his life, she had almost been married twice, and he was probably trying to avoid making her mistakes. Especially now that he knew the truth about why her last relationship had broken down.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha couldn't see Billy following in his mothers footsteps in that regard, the boy had a good head on his shoulders and, despite her current feelings towards them, Wanda and Vision had done a good job raising him. She couldn’t fault them for the way the kid turned out.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha had been in his life for four years but she had never officially been his parent. After she moved in with Wanda and Billy, her involvement in the decisions regarding Billy grew. Wanda would often turn to her instead of Vision for things and Agatha would have to remind her that he had a dad and that Vision should be involved as well.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She didn’t really know what Vision did for work, she just knew that it kept him busy and there were times when he was out of the country. He tried to be as present as he could, but Agatha was the one living with them. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha was the one who was there in the morning before Billy left for school and the one that he greeted at the door when she came home from work. Agatha was the one Wanda called from the hospital when she didn’t know if Billy would ever wake up again.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy still had a good relationship with his dad, Vision never missed his birthday or Christmas, or any important events in his life. But Agatha was the one that was </span><em><span>there.</span></em><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Watching him perform with his friends, seeing how good he had gotten at guitar – even more so than when she and Wanda were together – she was so proud of him. She still loved him the way that she did nearly three years ago and she was so happy that she got to have this second chance with him and rebuild what Wanda had broken.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha nodded. “He is. Billy speaks very highly of him and I can see why. He’s besotted with him.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Wanda turn her head to her and wrinkle her brow. “When did he tell you that?” She asked.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha turned to face Wanda as well. “He’s been over for dinner a few times. Did he not tell you?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“No. No he didn’t.” Wanda said after a moment.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha hummed but didn’t say anything else. If Billy wasn’t telling his mum then he must have a reason and Agatha had clearly already said too much, she wasn’t going to say anything else that would cause difficulties for him.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The awkward silence that had settled between them was broken by the applause and cheers that went round the room, both of them joining in out of obligation.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Eddie spoke to the room again. “For this next one I don’t want to see anybody sitting down. There’s a dance that goes along with it and if you don’t know it, I’ll give you the first step. It starts with a jump to the left.”</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Time Warp was always a crowd pleaser and people were singing along right from the first line. They had split it so that Eddie would be doing Riff Raff’s parts, Alice would be Magenta and Ash would jump in and sing Columbia’s bit. They had tried to convince Rio to do it but she refused saying, “If I tried to sing, it would probably cause an avalanche.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Everyone was on their feet. Everyone except Agatha, stubborn as ever. It was getting towards the end of the first verse and Agatha still hadn’t gotten out of her seat.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio started playing the groove with one hand so that she had a free one that she could use to point at Agatha and gesture for her to stand.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She couldn’t see it, but she knew Agatha was rolling her eyes as she reluctantly stood up and joined in.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio had to laugh at the half-arsed way Agatha did the steps the first time round, but by the second time, she was into it.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>If Rio thought she was sweating before, Time Warp was a whole different story. The fast fills that she had put in were fine when they were practising because she didn’t put in nearly as much power as she was now that they had an audience.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was out of breath when the song finished and there were still two to go. She was desperate for a drink and got Ash’s attention whilst Alice played and sang the opening for the next song.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Ash, can I have some water? I’m dying.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Ash handed her their glass. “This is why your focus shouldn’t have been on your own personal after party.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio downed the water in time for the full band to kick in. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The energy from Time Warp carried over into Pink Pony Club, especially with the version that they were playing. Agatha had sat back down, but Rio could see that she was singing along to the chorus . Even Agatha wasn’t immune to Chappell Roan.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda cheered and clapped when Billy started his guitar solo, it was weird seeing her act like his mom. Rio had managed to separate the two in her mind when she slept with Wanda again over the past few weeks, mostly because she never saw them together. But having them in the same room was a constant reminder.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>With eight songs down and one to go, Eddie spoke to the crowd for a final time. “Thank you everyone for joining in and having a good time!” The room cheered . “We have been Twisted Symphony and this is our last song, so make sure you give it your all!”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>He started playing the intro to the anthem of drunk British people. Rio hadn’t believed them when her friends had told her the effect this song had on people over here, but the reaction from the audience proved her very wrong.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She thought they had peaked with Time Warp, but Mr Brightside blew it out of the water. She had no idea why this song had the effect that it did on the crowd, but the four other band members had been right when they said that it should be their last one.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The students lost their minds, jumping around and singing along so loudly that Rio could hear them all the way at the back of the stage.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The song ended to a rapturous applause and they all left the stage to people high fiving them and telling them how good they were. This was a feeling that Rio hadn’t known she had missed.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha was thoroughly impressed with Rio and Billy. She was impressed with them all, but mostly those two. She wanted to go to them and tell them, but she was still trying to keep a distance from Billy in public until he told her otherwise, and she didn’t want more rumours to fly about her and Rio.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They might not be on campus but it was still a university event, and they had already almost kissed in front of everyone. They needed to be careful.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha stood from her seat and Wanda followed suit asking, “Do you want another drink?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Yes but not with you. Your thirty minutes are up, Wanda.” She put Rio’s jacket on her chair and headed for the bar, wanting to get there before a gaggle of students inevitably swarmed it.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She joined the small queue that had already formed and took the time to decide on her next drink. Did she want more wine, or did she want something stronger? There was still half an hour before the drinks stopped being free so she decided to stick with wine, it wasn’t like she couldn’t afford the top shelf anyway.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She got two more glasses of wine, but this time one was actually for Rio.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>When their little group of fans dispersed, Rio and her friends made their way to the bar to finally make use of the fact that it was free.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh actually, could one of you grab me a pint? I’m gonna go to the toilet first.” Rio said as she carried on towards the bathrooms. Ash said that they would and Rio headed into the toilet.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She stood in front of the mirrors surprised that she didn’t look worse than what she did. She had sweated her makeup off, there was a redness on her cheeks and her hair was less tame, but she didn’t look nearly as bad as she thought she would have. She ran the tap and dabbed some of the cool water on her face, being careful to not get any on her corset.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her eyes were closed as she was wiping the water away with a paper towel, not thinking anything of hearing the door open behind her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Way to go, rockstar.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio jumped at the unexpected voice and spun around to see who it was.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda was standing behind her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Fucking hell Wanda, you scared me.” Rio said once her breathing had slowed a bit. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda pushed herself off the wall and walked towards her. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Did you follow me into the bathroom?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Well when you say it like that, you make me sound like a stalker. But no, surprisingly I came to the toilet of my own accord.” She stepped closer to Rio. “I’d be lying if I said that I’m not glad I finally have a moment with you though.” She lifted her hand and ran a finger down the studs on the busk of Rio’s corset. “This is beautiful. How much did it set you back?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio swallowed. “I don’t remember, honestly.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda stepped towards her again, putting her hands on Rio’s hips, and leaned forwards, her torso now flush with Rio’s. “I’d love to get you out of it, but that’ll have to wait until later.” She whispered, her breath tickling Rio’s face. She pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek, then her jaw, then she started kissing her way down Rio’s neck.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio instinctively closed her eyes and tilted her head to give Wanda more access to her neck.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When she felt one of Wanda’s hands leave her hip and begin to reach under the corset in search of the waistband of her trousers, she remembered where they were.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She grabbed Wanda’s wrist to stop her. “Wanda, wait.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda pulled back from her neck enough to meet her eyes. “Don’t tell me you’re too good for sex in a bathroom.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio wasn’t at all. But this bathroom, on this night, with this woman? It wasn’t what she wanted, despite what her body might be telling her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“It’s a bathroom that any number of students could walk into right now. We’re incredibly lucky that no one has already.” Rio was keeping her voice low in case anyone passing by could hear them.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda stepped back, her wrist slipping out of Rio’s hand. “You weren’t worried about students walking in when we had sex in my office.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Your office door locks, Wanda. And people generally knock before they try to go in, they don’t do that for a bathroom.” Rio said, her voice still a whisper but taking on an edge of harshness. “Also your son is out there waiting for me to go back to our table.” She huffed out a breath and ran her hand through her hair. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and nodded slowly. “Okay, you have a point. I’ll wait for you to text me.” She said before turning and leaving the bathroom.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio leaned against the counter and rested her head against the mirror, letting out a heavy sigh.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She wouldn’t be texting Wanda, but Wanda didn’t need to know that.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She took a moment to actually use the toilet before heading back out to her table and taking a healthy swig of her pint.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Agatha re-entered the room and did a quick scan of the seating chart, looking for Rio’s table. She looked in the direction of table one, but no one was there. She must have just missed them as they went to the bar.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She looked over to her own table and, much to her annoyance, Dottie and some of the other people that were assigned to it had taken their seats. Wanda wasn’t there though so every cloud, as they say. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She went to Rio’s table and put one of the glasses down in front of her name card and took a deep breath before walking to her own table. She knew that she would have to interact with her colleagues at some point during the night and she had already survived Dottie and even endured half an hour of sitting next to and talking to Wanda. She could do this.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She put on her best fake smile and walked with confidence towards her seat. The food would be served soon and then she could go back to avoiding them all. She just had to hang on a little bit longer.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She draped Rio’s jacket over the back of her chair, took her seat and had a sip of her wine before picking up her phone and sending two messages.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The first was to Billy.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Agatha: You did great up there kid!</b> <b>You all did. It was a nice surprise and I’m glad those guitar lessons paid off</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>The second was to Rio.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Agatha: Okay wine taster extraordinaire, impress me. What’s this one?</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>She had just sent the second message when Dottie turned to her. “Agatha! We were just saying how great it is that you decided to come this year.”</span><span><br/>
</span><em><span>Sure they were.</span></em><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha forced sweetness into her voice. “Well, it’s like I said to you earlier. It’s time I started to get involved again, it’s been far too long.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The woman sitting next to Dottie – after reading her name card Agatha remembered her name was Lisa – smiled. “It was nice to see you and Wanda sitting together earlier. She’s been saying how she hopes that the two of you could be friends again.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Had she? When the fuck had she said that?</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha hummed, tightening her smile at this new information. “Yes. With Billy being at the university for at least the next three years, we agreed that it would be best for him if we could find a way to put the past behind us.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>If it kept these vultures off her back, she would fake any hakuna matata shit that she needed to.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She took part in the idle chit chat, and every time someone else came to take their seat it was a repeat of: “Agatha, it’s great to see you!”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I know, it’s been too long.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Each one more fake than the last.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy, Alice, Eddie and the other one had all come back in, drinks in hand, but Rio hadn’t been with them. She was starting to think that Rio and Wanda’s combined absences were more than just a coincidence.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Before she could start spiralling, her phone buzzed on the table.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Billy: Thank you, I’m glad you were able to watch. You’re kinda the reason I play guitar</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Agatha: I just paid for the lessons and the guitar. The talent is all you, kid. </b><b><br/>
</b><b>I would have come if you’d told me. You know that don’t you?</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>If Billy had told her that he was playing at this thing she would have bought her ticket straight away, no question.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Billy: I know but I didn’t want to make you feel like you had to come. I know these people aren’t your biggest fans</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Her heart clenched. Billy hadn’t told her because he didn’t want her to feel like she had to put herself through this just to see him play. He’d rather her not come to watch him and be happy, than be here and suffer. He really was still every bit of the kind and caring kid she had known.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Agatha: You don’t have to worry about me. The only thing you have to focus on is having a good night with your friends</b><b><br/>

</b><span>He didn’t reply but she saw him and his friends all knock their glasses together and take a drink, probably celebrating their great performance.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio walk back in. She was alone.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She beelined for her table and knocked back about a quarter of her drink in one gulp before sitting down and properly joining them.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha desperately wanted to pick up where they had left off, preferably not in a room full of people, but with everyone seated and the first course being brought out, she couldn’t do that yet.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda rushed in and got to her seat just as the waiter was putting her starter down. “Thank you so much.” She said to him as she sat down. “Looks like I made it just in time.” She said to the table.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The scent of cigarette smoke hit Agatha’s nostrils. Is that where Wanda was? When did she start smoking again?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wait, why did Agatha care? If Wanda wanted to fall back on old habits, she could do so.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha wished she didn’t have to smell it though because god damnit it was making her want a cigarette.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was half way through her first course when she got a message.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Rio: I can’t believe you would make me drink Pinot Noir. That’s pure psychopath behaviour!</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Agatha had to stifle her laugh and turn it into a cough. It still baffled her that Rio could tell what wine it was. She looked up in Rio’s direction but Rio was talking to Alice about something as they were eating their food.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><b>Agatha: Too grown up for you? Maybe you’ve ruined your palette with all that cheap lager you’re drinking 😉</b><b><br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><span>Agatha put her phone down and continued to eat her starter, tuning back into the conversation that was happening around her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Billy was fantastic Wanda! You must be so proud.” Percy, the person sitting next to Wanda, said.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>He was probably the only person sitting at this table that Agatha didn’t hate. He had remained impartial in the office drama that followed the break up. They weren’t exactly friends but they did greet each other whenever they passed as they were walking through the building, which is more than can be said for the rest of them. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda nodded, finishing her mouthful before replying. “I really am. It always amazes me whenever I see or hear him play. He really took to it like a duck to water.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“And good on you and Vision for nurturing that creativity and providing him with the means for it.” Percy said, giving her a gentle nudge with his elbow.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha subtly rolled her eyes. It had been her that provided the means. It had been her that convinced Wanda to let him have the lessons for his birthday. Hell, it had been her that suggested they watch that fucking movie in the first place.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was keeping her head down, just finishing her last mouthful when Wanda said, “Well actually, we can’t take all the credit.” She set her knife and fork on her plate as she had finished her own food. “Agatha bought him that guitar.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha looked up at that and saw everyone’s eyes on her, expressions varying. Except this time it wasn’t because they thought she was the one who had cheated six months before her and Wanda were due to be married. It was because Wanda had said something positive about her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She cleared her throat. “I did.” Was all she could say, too shocked to form any more words.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“She also bought him his first lot of guitar lessons.” Wanda added on, which Agatha nodded at.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She didn’t know how to handle this. It had been over two and a half years since she had heard Wanda speaking truths about her to their colleagues and she didn’t know how to react. The lies and the hatred she could handle. She knew how to take that and how to respond, but she wasn’t used to this anymore.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Percy lifted his glass up. “To Agatha, for helping create this generation’s newest rock star.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Everyone raised their glasses and said, “To Agatha.” in unison before knocking their glasses together as much as they could with the table between them.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They all took a sip of their drinks and Percy smiled at Agatha. It was a genuine smile, like he was happy that she was finally getting the recognition she deserved.</span></p><p align="center"><span>***</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio drained the last of the wine, it might taste like acid but it was free, and checked the time. “We only have a few minutes left before we have to start paying for drinks, shall we get one more round in?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her friends made varying noises of agreement and they all stood, making their way to the bar. As they were waiting to be served, Ash turned to Rio and said, “You probably don’t need to be rushing, mysterious glasses of wine just seem to appear for you.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio shrugged and smiled. “Don’t hate ‘cause you ain’t me dude. My fans know the way to my heart.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Ash scoffed and shook their head.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio was the last to be served and was technically over the time limit, but she charmed the female bartender into letting her have her drinks for free and the bartender threw in a shot of black sambuca as well.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha might get to the front of the queue quicker, but Rio knew how to make it count.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She knocked back the shot at the bar and then took her pints back to the table. The plates from their first course had been cleared and the main course was starting to be brought out.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio cast a glance towards Agatha, she looked uncomfortable but didn’t look like she was having a horrible time and that was as good as it would probably get.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio wanted to talk to Agatha again, but that wouldn’t be possible with all of the seats currently filled. She would have to wait until she could get Agatha alone. Not for any lustful reasons, but just so that they could talk without the risk of someone making a stupid report about their ‘relationship’.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio wondered if some of the people that were currently being pally with Agatha had been the source of the rumour. She also wondered what the conversations could be about with both Wanda and Agatha sitting next to each other.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The rest of the meal passed relatively quickly, Rio and her friends having a constant source of chatter as they ate. They talked about things each of them did well during the gig – Eddie hitting a note that he had been worried about, Ash nailing the chorus of a particular song etcetera – they talked about the upcoming semester and the marks that they got on their essays.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I’m still mad at you for saying we failed by the way.” Alice said whilst eating her dessert.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I never said that you’d failed. I </span><em><span>implied</span></em><span> you’d failed. Two very different things.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy pointed his spoon towards her. “Whatever, you’re still a twat.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh, I’m not denying that.” Rio said with a laugh.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>When the dessert plates were cleared there was some time where people remained seated, finishing drinks and conversations before people slowly started to leave their tables and begin to mingle again. Some people swapping tables, some going to the bar. Everyone from Agatha’s table left except Agatha. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Wanda walked past Rio on her way out of the room. She didn’t say anything, she didn’t even look in Rio’s direction – probably because Billy, Alice, Eddie and Ash were all still sitting there – but Rio could tell that Wanda wanted her attention. She probably wanted Rio to follow her, to give in and let her fuck her in a public bathroom. But that wasn’t what Rio wanted. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She let Wanda walk past her and continue on to wherever she was headed. Billy said he was going to the toilet and Eddie, Alice and Ash all said they were stepping out for some air, leaving Rio alone.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She looked over at Agatha again and she noticed that now she was by herself, Agatha’s shoulders had dropped slightly and the smile that Rio had seen her wearing earlier was gone. She didn’t have to hide behind the pretence right now.</span></p><p align="center"><span>*~*</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio finished one pint off and picked up the full one, crossing the room towards Agatha. She sat in the same chair that she had earlier, angling it so that she was fully facing Agatha.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha looked at her with a half smile, glad that she was able to talk to Rio again after enduring an hour and a half of fake niceties, and sipped her wine. “Not a fan of Pinot then?” She asked, her voice lilting with the small chuckle that carried it.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio screwed her face up. “Absolutely not, it just tastes like acid. I don’t know how you’re still drinking it.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha looked at her glass. “Oh I’m not, I can’t stand it. I agree wholeheartedly with your review.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Then why make me drink it? That’s pure evil work.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha laughed. She immediately felt more at ease with Rio sitting beside her. “I needed to check that you had good taste. I can’t associate with someone who likes bad wine.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio snorted. If only Agatha knew that she was literally raised around wine. “And what about me would suggest that I don’t have good taste?” She asked before taking a drink of her Coors.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow and waited for Rio to put the glass on the table again. She pointed at it. “The fact that you’re drinking </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> for one.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio looked at her pint then back to Agatha. Of course Agatha would turn her nose up at lager. "There's nothing wrong with this, it’s a perfectly good drink actually. Also I’m a student, we don’t all have jobs that pay us a top shelf salary.” She smiled and ran her tongue along the inside of her cheek.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>It wasn’t a total lie. Rio didn’t earn a salary as high as Agatha’s, she never had. She wasn’t earning anything at the moment since she was studying. But her parents had taught her how to save her money since she had been old enough to understand it. They had drilled in the importance of knowing that just because they had money from their business and could afford to get Rio whatever she wanted for her birthdays and Christmases, not everybody had that privilege. Her family, and by extension her, having money didn’t make them any better than people who had less.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They had helped her apply for all of the minimum wage jobs that she had worked and helped her budget so that she could put some of her pay check into her savings and still have enough left over for her immediate needs.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>This was a huge help when it came to buying her house.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The inheritance she got from her abuela on her dad’s side also helped, but she had already got a significant amount saved up by the time that was added.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha made a noise of disbelief. “Rio, you’re living in a building where the rent for the year costs more than the loan you get for your PhD. You also afford your flights to and from America, which have gotten a damn sight more expensive than when I last went back there.” She picked up her glass. “Don’t try to tell me that you can’t afford a more expensive drink.” She drank the remainder of her wine. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha had no idea what Rio’s money situation was, but from what she had gathered, Rio was nowhere near the ‘struggling student’ that she made herself out to be.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She wasn’t going to force Rio to tell her though, if Rio was keeping it close to her chest then that was her business.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio pursed her lips then rolled them inwards. “Touché.” She said before taking another healthy drink from her glass. “When were you last in America?” Agatha had alluded to not being from England before, but her accent was so close to the one she had gotten used to hearing around Cambridge that she couldn’t place it. There was a hardness to her Rs and a slight lilt to some of her vowels, but nothing specific that Rio could assign to a particular country.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha took a deep breath and leaned back in her chair. She could just tell Rio that she did her undergrad over there and cover the conversation off but, for a rare moment, she wanted to tell her more. “I’m actually from there. I lived in Salem until I was eight and my mother moved us over here to Kent. Then I went back to study Classics at Yale and when I finished my degree in two thousand and five, I came back to Kent for a bit before I moved to Cambridge to get my masters and PhD and basically never left.” Agatha reached for her glass only to be disappointed once again to find it already empty.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio pushed her pint closer to Agatha and Agatha held her hand up. “I’d rather drink from the toilets.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio smiled and shook her head. “Yeah the prices have gone up a little bit since then, it’s ridiculous actually. But it’s the life I’ve chosen.” She gave a quiet laugh.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha smiled. She was always hesitant about telling anyone anything about her life because she didn’t want the questions that followed. But Rio just accepted what she had told her and didn’t push for more, it gave her a sense of safety, it offered her some comfort. Knowing that she could give Rio these little nuggets and she would only have to give the amount that she was comfortable with.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She thought back to their first few meetings and how she was dead set against Rio knowing anything about her. Now she trusted Rio enough to start opening up to her. She wasn’t about to go into detail, but sharing the basics didn’t make her feel like she would crumble.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Do you want a proper drink?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio took another small sip from her glass. “The bar's not free anymore. That’s why I’m nursing this one so much.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha picked up her bag and stood from her chair, smoothing out her dress. “Well how about we put my top shelf salary to good use then?” The corners of her mouth twitched as she held out her hand to Rio.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio slowly rolled her tongue over her bottom lip. Far be it from her to refuse to let an attractive woman buy her drinks. She took Agatha’s hand and stood up, letting the touch linger. Agatha slowly let her arm drop, their fingers slipping apart except their pinkies which they both subconsciously locked together.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio let her eyes drop slowly, taking in how Agatha’s dress sat on her frame now that she was standing and Rio could see the full thing up close. She wanted more contact than just their little fingers. She wanted to know how soft Agatha’s lips felt. She wanted to hear the soft moan Agatha would make as she kissed down her neck.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha swallowed as she noticed Rio’s gaze travelling down her body. The way Rio was looking at her made heat start to creep into her stomach and made her breathing quicken ever so slightly. The last person who looked at her like that was Wanda, and Agatha really didn’t want to think about Wanda right now.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She wanted to grab Rio by the waist and pull her close. She wanted to thread her fingers through Rio’s hair as she brought their lips together. She wanted that breathless feeling that came from a kiss so electric that the only reason it ended was because you needed to breathe.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Neither of them moved, hyper-aware of the fact that they were still in a room full of people. Rio noticed her jacket on the back of Agatha’s chair and dropped Agatha’s hand as she moved to grab it. She took a deep breath in as she pulled it over her arms. “Bar?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha took a shaky breath and nodded. “Bar.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha let Rio walk a couple of steps in front of her, needing the few moments that it took them to get to the bar to try to collect her thoughts.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio almost wished that she had taken Wanda up on her offer earlier because god did she need it right now. Her whole body was warm and not from the alcohol, though that certainly wasn’t helping matters.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They got to the bar and the queue was almost non-existent since it was no longer free. There were only two people in front of them, both currently being served so it only took a couple of minutes until the bartenders were free.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The one that Rio had flirted with earlier gave her a smile but switched her attention to Agatha when she presented her card.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha looked at Rio. “Glasses or a bottle?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio thought for a moment. A bottle could be dangerous, but glasses would mean that they would have to keep getting up. </span><em><span>Fuck it.</span></em><span> “Why don’t we go for a bottle?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha nodded. “Which one would you recommend?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio began to scan the bottles that lined the shelves as the bartender started speaking. “Well I’m not much of a wine drinker myself, but our most pop-”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Oh no, sorry.” Agatha cut her off. “I was asking Rio. She’s a connoisseur.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio rolled her eyes and addressed the bartender. “Ignore her, she likes to exaggerate.” She said before turning her attention back to the bottles.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The bartender raised an eyebrow as she looked between them, a knowing smile starting to appear on her face.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio pointed at a bottle, having made her decision. “That Merlot is a good one.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The bartender picked it up. “This one?” She asked sceptically and when Rio nodded, she added, “This is our most expensive bottle.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “That’s the one she wants.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The bartender smiled again and began to remove the cork from the bottle. She put it on the counter along with two glasses and said, “Enjoy your night, ladies.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha took the bottle while Rio took the glasses and they both thanked the bartender before making their way back to Agatha’s table. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio saw that Wanda and a few other people were sitting at the table so she stopped walking. Her table was free but probably not for long. “It’s actually getting kinda warm in here. I know it’s December, but do you wanna sit outside for a bit?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha too had noticed that the table was no longer empty and was glad when Rio offered the alternative. She agreed and they made their way outside.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The garden of the hotel was expansive and there were plenty of tables littered around the edges. The majority of people who had made their way outside stuck to the patio, including Billy, Alice, Eddie and Ash. They motioned for Rio to go over to them so she handed the glasses to Agatha and said, “Go find a table, I’ll be over in a minute.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha took the glasses and nodded, moving from the patio proper to a part that still had flagstones but it was away from the crowd. There was no way she was walking on the grass in these heels.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio joined her friends at the table. Billy had a glass of water in front of him, the rest of them all had fresh pints and looked relatively sober. “I didn't think you guys could afford drinks outside of the campus bar or the student nights at the clubs.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Our bank accounts can handle one special occasion.” Eddie said with a laugh.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Ash rolled their eyes. “Billy’s mum gave him her card. In other news, Ms Maximoff is Billy’s mum”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy snorted. “She already knows.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Alice pushed his glass of water towards him and said, “Sip that you lightweight.” At the same time Eddie asked, “How did you already know?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio gave a short laugh at Billy and turned to Eddie. “I figured it out. I can’t believe you guys didn’t actually.” She turned to Ash. “Especially you. I had high hopes for you.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Ash flipped her off and they all laughed.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio was surprised that Billy had told them considering how secretive he’d been about it, asking Wanda to keep it quiet. Maybe the booze had given him the confidence. She addressed the table. “Please tell me he wasn’t at the point of needing water when he introduced you.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Eddie shook his head as he was taking a drink. “No thank god, he was passable then. It was the drink </span><em><span>after</span></em><span> that that sent him over the edge. Is this how I imagined meeting my boyfriend’s mum for the first time? No, but I’ll take it.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio smiled at Eddie calling Billy his boyfriend. They really were cute together.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio stood to leave. “I’ve got someone waiting for me so I’m gonna go find her. Alice remember, I’m leaving you and Billy in charge of my plants while I’m back home.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She was about to leave when Eddie asked, “Was that Agatha we saw you with? You’re having drinks with your professor?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio scanned the garden looking for her and saw her sitting partway into the garden. “I can be friends with my professors.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Billy snorted again. “Like you’re friends with m-”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Alice's eyes went wide. ”Water!” She said, cutting him off.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio gave her a small smile before pointing at Eddie. “Don’t let him die.” She switched arms and pointed at Alice. “Don’t let my plants die.” Then she spoke to the table. “I’ll see you all after the holidays.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She walked away in Agatha’s direction.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She had asked Billy and Alice if they would go to her flat once a week over Christmas break to water her plants and gave Alice the spare key. She had written a list of instructions of how much water each plant would need and how to tell if they needed cutting back and exactly how to do it. She hadn’t long since done it herself so they shouldn’t need it, but she wanted all bases covered.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The wooden awning that was over the patio extended about a quarter of the way into the garden and Agatha picked a table that was just on the edge of it. The heat lamp that was mounted on one of the beams was the main selling point, but it also gave them a view over the lake. Well, it did if they both sat on the same side. There were fairy lights that were wrapped around the beams as well adding an ambiance to the otherwise lightless garden. The sun had long since set so the warm glow cast by both sources of light would have to do. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She filled the two glasses while she waited for Rio and smiled when she saw Rio approaching her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Sorry, they can’t survive if they’re away from a responsible adult for too long.” Rio said as she sat opposite Agatha on the picnic-style bench.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha pushed one of the glasses towards her. “Oh so they still need someone to go over there then?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“You’re hilarious.” Rio deadpanned and took a sip of the wine. “Damn this wine is nice. I’m good.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow sceptically as she tried to mimic the movements Rio had done with the wine earlier. She swirled it around, looked at it, took a sip and smelled it.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio grinned, finding the display very endearing. “You have no idea what you’re doing, do you?” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha sighed. “Not a fucking clue, no. But it’s gorgeous.” She smiled as she took a proper drink. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio laughed as she realised that she had never heard Agatha swear before. It was odd, but not in a bad way. “Okay, I’ll walk you through it. It’s all about the five S’s: see, swirl, smell, sip, and savour.” She picked up her glass and motioned for Agatha to do the same. “The first step isn't really possible because it’s dark and the glass isn’t supposed to be full, but first you have to look at the wine and check the colour. Red wine loses colour over time. You also want to check for bubbles if it’s non-sparkling, which this one is. But again, we can’t really do this right now so we’re just gonna assume that it’s fine.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio began to gently move her glass, causing the wine to move around it. “So this is to bring oxygen into it which helps to elevate the smell.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha was intently watching her glass, making sure she didn’t send any of the liquid over the edge.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Now you can smell it. Tell me what scents you pick up.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha brought the glass to her nose and took a slow and gentle breath. “There’s cherries I think.” She took another breath. “And maybe blackberries?” She did it for a final time. “You’re probably gonna laugh, but I can kinda smell chocolate?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio opened her mouth in surprise and it turned into a toothy smile. “You’re dead on! The chocolate smell comes from it being aged in an oak barrel. Not a lot of people can pick that up straight away, you’ve impressed me.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha smirked, unsure if it was the heat lamp that was making her face warm or if it was because she was blushing. “I’m not just a pretty face.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio chuckled. “In this instance maybe. The next steps are to sip it and let it sit in your mouth for a moment to see what the taste is like before either spitting it out or swallowing it, then you savour it. Let it linger and see which flavours stick around; that’s called the finish. And the longer the finish lasts, the more complex and enjoyable the wine is. But since we’ve both already drunk it, there’s not much point doing that bit.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha did it anyway, wanting to complete the process. Either Rio was an incredible liar or she really did know her stuff when it came to wine. Either way Agatha liked seeing her talk about something she had a passion for, other than her PhD. Seeing the way her smile brightened and the way her eyes shined, even in the red glow of the heat lamp, it made Agatha’s chest feel warm.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She couldn’t deny the word any more. She</span><em><span> liked </span></em><span>Rio</span><em><span>.</span></em><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They finished their first and second glasses and got just over half way through their third and final glass whilst talking and laughing, the alcohol making the conversation even easier than it already was.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha gestured to Rio’s torso. “How’s the corset feeling by the way?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio looked down at herself. “Oh, I’d actually forgotten about it. I guess the company is enough to put it to the back of my mind.” She gave a half smile and Agatha was definitely blushing this time.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“I have no idea how you managed to play in it. You were amazing, I should have said so earlier.” She dipped her head slightly in embarrassment at forgetting to let Rio know what she thought of the performance.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio dismissed the comment with a wave of her hand. “The other guys are the talent, I’m just there to hit things and look good.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha lifted her head again, locking her eyes onto Rio’s. “Well you excelled at both.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>There was a silence that settled between them but it wasn’t awkward, it was full. Full of all the unspoken things neither of them had said throughout the night. Full of all the thoughts they’d had, the desires. There was an invisible wire that connected them, pulled taught, just begging to snap. Desperate for one of them to cut it. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio moved her leg and rested her ankle against Agatha's. Neither of them broke eye contact but Agatha pushed her leg into Rio’s. Not in an attempt to push her away, but to deepen the touch. After the way they were so close at the beginning of the night, and the way that neither of them wanted to let their hands separate earlier, they were both welcoming the feeling of their bodies touching. Even if it was just their ankles.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio slowly lifted her leg upwards, gently rubbing it along the side of Agatha’s calf which sent a shiver up Agatha’s spine. She shuddered which made Rio drop her leg. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Why the fuck did she do that? She had never wanted the feeling of someone's leg on hers so badly before in her life.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio interpreted the shiver as Agatha being cold and immediately stood up, taking her jacket off.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She moved round to Agatha’s side of the table and draped the jacket over her shoulders. “If you’re cold we don’t have to stay out here. I’m happy to go back in.” </span><span><br/>
</span><span>She started to pick up the bottle and glasses but Agatha put her hand on Rio’s arm to stop her.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio looked at Agatha and Agatha smiled. “I’m fine.” She said, motioning for Rio to sit. Which she did. “It’s nice out here, I like the quiet.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Neither of them had noticed the soft din of chatter slowly fading out as people went back inside, until now.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Really?” She asked as she softly sandwiched Agatha’s hand between her own. “Because your fingers feel like icicles right now.” She finished with a gentle laugh.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha put her other hand on top of Rio’s. “How are yours so warm?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio shrugged. “Must be my Puerto Rican blood.” She moved her hands and laced the fingers on her right with Agatha’s left. “Either that or the alcohol.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>It was definitely the alcohol.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha looked down at their hands, flexing her fingers slightly as if checking it were real. If this was a dream, it was the most in depth one she’d ever had.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio lifted her free hand and gently placed it beneath Agatha’s chin, lifting her head again. Their eyes met and the tension returned. Rio moved her hand from under Agatha’s chin to the side of her face, letting it rest there. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>They were finally back to where they were at the beginning of the night, except this time no one was around. There were no eyes except their own. No one who could report them or start vicious rumours that could get Agatha fired.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They had nothing to stop them.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The warmth of Rio’s hand on her cheek made Agatha’s breath catch. This was it. This was her moment. She slowly started to lean in, forcing herself to stay aware of Rio’s reactions. Yes they were close. Yes Rio was showing signs of wanting this too. But Agatha didn’t want to do anything that made Rio uncomfortable.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Her heart started to hammer against her ribs when she noticed that Rio was leaning in as well.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They were close enough to feel the warmth of each other’s breath against their lips.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They closed the gap between them further, fingers still intertwined, Rio’s hand still cradling Agatha’s face.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Their eyes had closed and their lips had barely brushed when a noise behind Agatha startled them both, causing Agatha to practically jump backwards even though she was sitting down, and making Rio drop her hand from Agatha’s cheek.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They ripped their hands apart and both looked towards the source of the noise.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>It was the bartender who had cleared her throat to get their attention.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She looked at them apologetically. “I’m really sorry to interrupt, but the event is over and we need to close.” She awkwardly scuffed her shoe against the flagstone that she was standing on.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Both Rio and Agatha took a moment to regain their composure, Agatha getting there first. She cleared her throat and said, “Yes, thank you. We’ll leave in a minute.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>The bartender nodded and turned to leave but quickly spun back round and looked at Rio. “Your shoes are behind the bar, by the way. Just swing by and grab them on your way out.” She turned again and walked away.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio furrowed her brows in confusion for a second. Her shoes? She was wearing her shoes. What shoes was that woman talking about?</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Then it dawned on her. She’d brought two pairs of shoes. Actually, she’d never changed out of her converse and had left her heels on the stage. It’s a good job </span><em><span>someone</span></em><span> remembered because she sure as hell wasn’t going to. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha stood up, filled with rage. </span><em><span>Of course</span></em><span> the event had to be over at that moment. </span><em><span>Of course</span></em><span> that fucking bartender had to show up right then. </span><em><span>Of. Fucking. Course</span></em><span>.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio stood up too and picked up the glasses and bottle, not quite having recovered from their second almost-kiss of the night. This one had been a lot closer than the first, but still hadn’t been able to happen. </span><span><br/>
</span><span>Maybe the universe was trying to send her a sign. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She had already gotten into a situation with a faculty member at the university. It hadn’t quite blown up, but it was close enough. Maybe this was a message to not do it again.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They silently made their way back to the bar, Rio dropped the bottle and glasses off and the bartender passed her her shoes.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>They walked towards the exit and stopped when they got to the steps.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Rio turned to Agatha. “How are you getting home?”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>Agatha pulled Rio’s jacket around herself, feeling the loss of the heat lamp. “I live just around the corner from here actually.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“Let me walk you then.” Agatha started to protest but Rio cut her off. “Agatha, it’s cold and dark. Let me walk you home.”</span><span><br/>
</span><span>She held out her hand and after a moment of deliberation, Agatha took it and started to lead them in the direction of her house.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span>Rio and Agatha walked hand in hand with Agatha taking a slight lead given that Rio didn’t know where she was going. They didn’t walk with any sense of urgency despite the cold air biting at their exposed skin.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio swung her shoes in her hand slightly as they walked, extremely glad that she wasn’t wearing them right now.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha looked down at them. “Couldn’t handle them for the whole night, huh?” She asked.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio chuckled. “I changed into my sneakers when I went on stage. There was no way I could have played in these.” She lifted them up slightly as if she needed to make it obvious that she was talking about her high heels. “After we finished I just forgot to change back. Converse feel a lot more natural for me.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha smiled. “Well I’m proud of you for lasting as long as you did.” She led them down a street that branched off from the main road they were walking along. “How long have you been playing drums?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Since high school, but this is the first time I’ve actually played in front of people since my senior year. I was nervous as fuck.” Rio breathed out a laugh.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha was surprised that it had been that long since Rio had played in front of an audience, she looked so natural on that stage. “You hid your nerves well and the whole band worked so well together. I could tell that you all put the time in to get it that good.” She gave Rio’s hand a gentle squeeze.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled, the compliment making warmth work its way into her cheeks. “Thank you.” She returned the squeeze on her hand. “I would never have done it if it wasn’t for Billy and Alice. They practically begged me to go to a rehearsal, and I’m really glad I did. I didn’t know how much I’d missed it until I did it again.” She laughed lightly as she remembered the first time she joined them in the music room. “I could have done without being as hungover as I was that first time though. That was </span><em><span>rough</span></em><span>.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha laughed with her and moved herself closer to Rio so that their shoulders touched as they walked.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They spent the remainder of the walk with Agatha telling Rio what her favourite song from the night was and complaining about Oasis being on the set list, which Rio actually agreed with. It confirmed her suspicions that Billy had asked for that song to be included for Wanda.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha stopped walking when they reached the short path that led to her front door. “I made it safe and sound, thanks to you.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“I’m glad I could help.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Please don’t tell me that you’re walking home. It’ll take you the best part of an hour.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio hadn’t actually thought about it, but that walk did not sound good. “No, don't worry. I’m gonna order an Uber.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha looked to her door and then back to Rio. “Come in while you wait? I don’t want you to freeze to death.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled and nodded and they walked to the door still holding hands, only breaking apart when Agatha needed to get her keys out.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha let Rio go in ahead of her, locking the door again once they were both inside.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio put her heels on the floor and was thankful for the immediate warmth that passed over her once the door was closed. She had no idea how they’d managed to sit outside for as long as they did, even with the heat lamp.</span><span><br/></span><span>The drastic temperature change made her bladder suddenly feel like it was about to burst. “Would I be okay to use your bathroom before I order the cab?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Of course,” Agatha said as she was putting her own shoes in a cupboard. “Turn right at the top of the stairs and it’s the last door.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio toed her converse off and went upstairs.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha took the time that Rio was using the bathroom to hang Rio’s jacket up and start unpinning her hair. She wasn’t used to having it up and the pull of it was starting to give her a headache. She released all the strands and ran her hands through it to shake it out, making it feel more normal.</span><span><br/></span><span>A few minutes later, Rio reappeared. “Thank you,” she said. “I’ll book the Uber now and then I’ll be out of your hair.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha felt a pang of sadness. She didn’t want Rio to leave. The fact that they </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> hadn’t kissed was killing her. She wanted it. No. She </span><em><span>needed </span></em><span>it. She needed to kiss Rio. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>But again, she didn’t want to force Rio into it. She wanted to know that Rio felt comfortable. So instead she said, “You don’t have to if you don’t want to. Do you want a warm drink at least before you go?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio considered it for a moment. She knew that the ball ended at ten so it was definitely after that and she needed to be up early to get into London for her flight home. But fuck it, she could sleep on the plane. </span><span><br/></span><span>She nodded. “That would be nice, yeah.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha smiled and pointed to the door on the left. “The living room is just there if you want to sit down. How do you take your tea?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio thought for a moment, trying to remember what Wanda had called it. “I think it’s called a builder’s brew?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha laughed. “Okay, one builder's brew coming up.” She went into the kitchen to start making the drinks.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio headed into the living room and flicked the light switch on, blinking as she adjusted to the light. The room was bigger than she expected it to be but she somehow had expected all of the shelves to be filled with books, which they were. There were only two bookcases but they were floor to ceiling and they were stacked. They were filled a lot less chaotically than the ones in Agatha’s office and Rio noticed that they were alphabetised by the author's surname, like a book store would be. She smiled to herself. Of course this was how Agatha would organise her books.</span><span><br/></span><span>Each one looked to be in pristine condition which, given the way Agatha reacted to her dog earing a page, was very on brand.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She craned her neck to look at the books on the very top shelves wondering how Agatha reached them, when she felt her foot nudge something hard. She looked down and saw a foldable step stool positioned in front of the bookcase. Resourceful.</span><span><br/></span><span>She moved to the second bookcase, scanning the titles, and stopped when she saw a particular one.</span></p><p align="justify"><em><span>The Night Circus</span></em><span> sat on the shelf.</span><span><br/></span><span>Had Agatha bought it after Rio told her about it?</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She continued to look at the books until one set caught her eye.</span><span><br/></span><span>There were five books in a row that each had spines so cracked and worn that she couldn’t tell what they were.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>There was no way that Agatha ‘use a fucking bookmark’ Harkness had allowed books to get to this condition.</span><span><br/></span><span>These were obviously books that Agatha had </span><em><span>loved</span></em><span>. She had read and re-read them until the spines were bare. There were just flecks of colour where the title and cover art had once been.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio gently pulled the first book loose and flipped it over to see the cover and her mouth dropped open when she saw it. </span><span><br/></span><em><span>Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians Book One The Lightning Thief</span></em><span> was staring right at her. Not only that but it was the original paperback cover. She gingerly opened the first couple of pages to find the edition number – careful not to damage the spine any more than it already was – and sure enough, it was a first edition.</span><span><br/></span><span>She put it back and repeated the process with the other four books. All of them were first editions which meant Agatha had to have bought them when they were first released.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“I was wondering if you’d find those.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio jumped slightly, having not heard Agatha come into the room. She put the final book back and took the cup that Agatha was holding out to her. “I thought you’d never read them?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Actually I said that I was too old for them when they were released, I was about ten years older than the target age group. I never said that I hadn’t read them.” Agatha gently blew across her cup to cool the liquid enough to take a sip. “As you can see, I got over that and thoroughly enjoyed them.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio laughed. “You definitely did. I thought my copies were worse for wear, but you’ve put me to shame.” She also gently blew into her cup before taking a sip. “I have to say though, I’m surprised you let them get that bad. You nearly had an aneurysm when I folded the corner of a page.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha rolled her eyes and moved to the sofa to sit down. “The pages are pristine, just a little yellowed from age. The spines unfortunately didn’t survive the many re-reads.” She put her cup on the coffee table in front of the settee.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio followed suit and went to the sofa, her thoughts at war inside her head.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Should she sit at the opposite end? Or should she sit closer?</span><span><br/></span><span>Each time they had been interrupted they had seemed to start again from the top, so she didn’t want to presume that they would just jump right back in – no matter how much she wanted to.</span><span><br/></span><span>The couch cushions were big enough that they could both fit on one, so she sat next to Agatha, sideways so that she could face her. She kept her cup in one hand and rested her free arm on the back of the sofa.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha shifted herself so that she was also sitting sideways to face Rio, resting her own arm on the back of the sofa. They were close enough that she was able to lace their fingers together again. Maybe the third try would be the one that stuck.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio drank some more of her tea and put the cup down on the table in front of the couch. “Did you have a good night?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be actually.” Agatha said, gently moving her thumb across Rio’s. “What about you?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Considering how nervous I was at the start, I’m happy with how it turned out.” Rio glanced at their hands. “It wasn't as eventful as it could have been though.” She looked back at Agatha and felt her breath catch in her throat at the way she was looking at her.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha was staring at Rio’s lips and she no longer cared to hide it. She wanted her and she was sick of not being able to have her.</span><span><br/></span><span>They were in her house now. No loud, drunk students were around. No bitchy colleagues. And no fucking bartenders.</span><span><br/></span><span>Her door was locked – not that anyone would be turning up at this time anyway and, if they did, she wouldn’t hesitate to kill them where they stood.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha moved her eyes back to Rio’s. “Rio?” Her heart was pounding.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Yeah?” Rio’s breathing sped up.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Just fucking kiss me.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio didn’t need telling twice.</span><span><br/></span><em><span>Fuck the universe!</span></em><span><br/></span><span>She surged forwards, the tension finally snapping.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio crushed their lips together, using her free hand to thread into Agatha’s hair to deepen the kiss. She bunched the hair in her fist and pulled. Not enough to pull them apart but enough to cause Agatha to release a low moan against her lips and Rio took the opening to slide her tongue against Agatha’s.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha unlaced their fingers so that she could put both hands on Rio’s hips and pull her closer. Rio didn’t resist and let Agatha move her until their bodies were as flush as they could be. Agatha let Rio lay her back against the arm of the couch, feeling Rio’s other arm snake around her waist with her palm flat against the small of her back to increase the pressure of their bodies against each other.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio desperately needed to breathe but didn’t want her lips to not be touching Agatha so she moved her head to kiss along her jaw, allowing her to take shallow breaths as she moved, and started making her way down Agatha’s neck. She nipped at Agatha’s collarbone, causing another moan to escape Agatha’s throat. That noise alone would be enough to make Rio lose control. But she continued taking her time, savouring every sound that Agatha made.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha felt Rio’s hand leave her hair and begin to trail down her side, the lightness of the touch making her squirm as Rio glanced over a ticklish spot that she had on her ribs. Rio tightened the arm that was around Agatha’s waist to keep her still as her mouth worked along her collar bone and into the v neck of her dress.</span><span><br/></span><span>The hand that was trailing down her side stopped at her thigh and started to pull the skirt of her dress upwards.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio licked along the small part of Agatha’s breast that was exposed by the dress before pulling back slightly to look at her face again. Agatha’s cheeks were red and her pupils were wide, her chest rising and falling quickly.</span><span><br/></span><span>“How far do you want this to go?” Rio asked. She was happy to go all the way, but that didn’t mean shit if that wasn’t what Agatha wanted.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha hadn’t been expecting Rio to ask that – no one had ever asked her that before – the woman continued to surprise her. </span><span><br/></span><span>But it was a good question. How far </span><em><span>did</span></em><span> she want this to go? She truly hadn’t thought that she would reach this point with Rio but now that she was here she didn’t want it to stop, she didn’t want Rio to stop touching her.</span><span><br/></span><span>She brought both of her hands up, cradling Rio’s face. “I want you to make me forget my name.” She stated, her voice low but every word was clear.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>A look flashed across Rio’s face. The kind of look that told Agatha that she would get exactly what she had asked for. She pulled Rio down and kissed her, moaning when she felt Rio slip her hand underneath the skirt and lightly drag her nails down her thigh.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio pulled back again and removed the arm that was around Agatha’s waist so that she could ruck her dress up around her hips. She started moving backwards, placing hot, open-mouthed kisses down Agatha’s thighs as she went. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Each one made Agatha grow more and more desperate but Rio was determined to take her time. She sunk her teeth into the soft skin on Agatha’s inner thigh and then ran her tongue over it to soothe the bite, relishing how Agatha squirmed. She had no idea what Agatha liked, but damn did she enjoy learning.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio was slowly working her way to where Agatha needed her, each touch making the pool of heat in Agatha’s stomach deepen. Each kiss bringing her closer to the edge, even though Rio was still avoiding the one part of her that craved contact.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio hooked her fingers under the waistband of Agatha’s underwear and Agatha immediately lifted her hips so that Rio could slide them down her legs.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio discarded the underwear, throwing them somewhere in the room, the corner of her mouth ticking upwards when she saw Agatha’s damp curls. She took in a small breath and gently blew it across Agatha’s clit and the sensation made Agatha’s toes curl as she whined Rio’s name.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio looked up at Agatha and her need was evident on her face. Rio dropped her voice low, a near whisper as she said, “Teach me how to please you, Professor.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha’s breath caught at Rio’s words and it took her brain a moment to start working again. Rio was already making her mind buffer and she hadn’t even done anything yet.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha threaded her hands through Rio’s hair, letting her nails scrape along her scalp. She guided Rio’s head back down between her legs and said, “Use your tongue for something useful,” before pulling Rio’s head forwards.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio gladly let Agatha put her where she needed her and she laid her tongue flat against Agatha for a moment, slowly increasing the pressure until Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s hair.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio moaned and she began to move her tongue in lazy circles.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The noise Rio made was a low, deep sound that vibrated against Agatha and sent shockwaves along every nerve in her body. The slow pattern of Rio’s tongue built upon the feeling that had already coiled low in her stomach but she needed it to be faster, she needed the pressure to be deeper. </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha gave Rio’s hair a sharp tug towards herself and Rio got the message. She increased her pace and hooked her arm under Agatha’s leg, lifting it over her shoulder. Agatha started moving her hips to match Rio’s rhythm, the feeling in her stomach threatening to spill over. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio put her hand on Agatha’s other thigh and pushed her leg off of the sofa, spreading her legs as wide as their current surface would allow. She flicked her tongue over Agatha’s clit once, twice, three times before she pursed her lips and sucked, flicking her eyes up to watch Agatha’s face.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha couldn’t hold on any longer, her eyes falling closed. She managed to stutter, “R-Rio. Rio I’m-” before her orgasm came crashing over her. </span><span><br/></span><span>She tried to close her legs, an involuntary reaction, but Rio tightened her grip on her thighs, keeping them right where she wanted them. The heel of the leg that Rio had put over her shoulder dug into Rio’s back as the waves continued to crash.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio continued to work her tongue, bringing Agatha through her orgasm. She would never not love the feeling of making a woman come. It was one of only a few good things about being on this planet. Knowing that the breathless sounds that were coming from Agatha’s mouth, knowing that the tremble of her legs, the way that she was gripping Rio’s hair as tight as she was because she needed </span><em><span>something</span></em><span> to hold on to, were all because of something that she had done? It made her feel powerful. It made her want more.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio felt Agatha slowly release her grip on her hair and move her hands to cradle her face again. “Fuck you’re good that that.” Agatha said once her breathing had started to even out. </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio let Agatha gently lift her head, guiding her back up to kiss her again. </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha slid her tongue against Rio’s, tasting herself in Rio’s mouth.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio broke the kiss, pulling back just enough to say, “I’m just getting started.” She started kissing her way down Agatha’s throat making her way back to her breasts, stopping only to ask, “What’s your name?” She looked up, locking her eyes onto Agatha’s.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha smirked and rolled her tongue over her bottom lip, eager to know what would happen after she said her next words. “Agatha Harkness.” She said boldly.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled. Obviously she knew that one orgasm wouldn’t be enough, but it was a way to check that Agatha hadn’t changed her mind, that she was still giving her consent.</span><span><br/></span><span>She dipped her head and nipped at each of Agatha’s breasts. They were still covered since she was still wearing the dress, but there was enough exposed skin to pull between her teeth. She sucked on the flesh as she moved her hand between their bodies.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She let her middle finger rest on Agatha’s clit, unmoving save for the gentle way that she pressed. She felt the low growl of the moan reverberate through Agatha’s chest, moving her head to kiss her sternum.</span><span><br/></span><span>She let her hand continue down, gathering Agatha’s arousal before pressing her finger in, up to the first knuckle. The breathy whimper that left Agatha’s lips made Rio’s stomach clench.</span><span><br/></span><span>She watched Agatha’s reaction when she curled her finger and straightened it. The way that Agatha’s eyes grew darker, the way that she pulled her bottom lip between her teeth.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha ground her hips down, trying to get more friction only for Rio to withdraw her finger. Agatha furrowed her brow in confusion. “Why?” She all but whined.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio leaned down to her ear, her breath hot against Agatha’s skin. “Tell me what you want.” She pressed her finger in again, slowly. </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha gave a wanton sigh. “Deeper.” </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio complied and pushed her finger in all the way. “Good. Keep going.” She kissed the side of Agatha’s neck, feeling her pulse hammering against her lips.</span><span><br/></span><span>“More.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio added another finger and groaned at the feeling of Agatha stretching around her. She had both fingers up to the hilt and curled them, stroking along Agatha’s front wall.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio’s face was still buried in Agatha’s neck and Agatha needed her attention. She wove her hand into Rio’s hair once more and gave a sharp pull, dragging her head away from her neck so that she could look her in the eyes. Once she had her gaze, she gave her one simple instruction.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Fuck me.”</span><span><br/></span><span>The look in Rio’s eyes grew wild and a dark grin spread across her face. She began moving her hand, keeping a steady pace and keeping her fingers curled.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>It wasn’t long before Agatha could feel her orgasm building. She writhed beneath Rio, matching the speed of her fingers with her hips. She had released her grip on Rio’s hair, but Rio hadn’t moved her head. She wanted to watch Agatha come undone. The way that Agatha was moaning and moving under her, the way that her breathing became more and more erratic. It all let Rio know that she was close. Rio increased the speed of her fingers.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh fuck.” Agatha breathed as she shut her eyes and tilted her head back.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio cradled Agatha’s chin, bringing her head forwards again. “Eyes on me.” </span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha obeyed the instruction without realising. Her body responded to Rio like it was the most natural thing in the world.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>It was only a few more seconds before Agatha came around Rio’s fingers, her back arching off the couch. She tried to keep her eyes open but as the feeling washed over her she couldn’t do it any more. Her eyelids fluttered closed and her head fell backwards again.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio slowed her movements as Agatha came down and she gently removed her fingers.</span><span><br/></span><span>She brought them up to her mouth and licked them clean, savouring the taste on her tongue.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she’d had an orgasm like that. In fact, she didn’t think she’d </span><em><span>ever </span></em><span>had an orgasm like that.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She shifted herself on the settee, trying to sit up. “We’re gonna have to move this upstairs. The sofa isn’t the most comfortable place.” If Rio was going to keep doing that to her, then they needed more room.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio stood up. “Well if you can still walk I need to try harder.” She smirked as she held out a hand to help Agatha up. “After you.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha led Rio up the stairs, admittedly it was more difficult than it should have been because her legs were weak. She stopped once they reached the top so that she could press Rio against the wall and kiss her. She pushed her thigh between Rio’s legs and lifted it slightly, feeling a rush at how Rio instinctively started to move her hips.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha dragged Rio into her bedroom and turned the lamp on before kissing her once more.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio put her hands on Agatha’s hips and spun her so that Agatha’s back was pressed against her. She swept Agatha’s hair to one side and kissed the tattoo on her shoulder blade before undoing the bow that was keeping Agatha’s dress up.</span><span><br/></span><span>She watched as the fabric peeled away from Agatha’s body. She gathered it in her hands where it had stopped at Agatha’s waist and gave it a gentle tug. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The fabric pooled at Agatha’s feet and she kicked it aside, turning around to face Rio again. </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio ducked her head and took one of Agatha’s nipples in her mouth. She swirled her tongue around it while she palmed the other breast, her free hand roaming across Agatha’s back.. She moved her head so that she could give attention to the other nipple, making Agatha whimper when she scraped her teeth over the sensitive skin. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She started to sink to her knees, kissing down Agatha’s stomach when Agatha put her hand under Rio’s chin, stopping her. </span><span><br/></span><span>She brought Rio back to her full standing height again and when she saw Rio’s confusion she said, “It’s your turn to forget your name.”</span><span><br/></span><span>She ran her finger down the busk of Rio’s corset like Wanda had earlier in the evening, except this time Rio wanted it to happen. Agatha began popping the studs out of their grips and Rio ran the backs of her fingers down Agatha’s arms. Her touch was warm but Agatha still got goosebumps on her skin in the path that Rio’s hands were trailing.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The corset was nearly undone when a thud on the carpet made them both jump. Rio looked towards the source of the noise and saw her phone laying on the ground.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You put your phone in your corset?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio shrugged. “These pockets are shit and I didn’t wanna bring a bag.” She kicked it out of the way and Agatha chuckled as she undid the last stud, letting the corset drop.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha took a step back to look at Rio’s body and her breath was taken away. She’d had no idea that Rio was this toned. She ran her hands down Rio’s stomach, letting her nails scrape over the skin and feeling the way Rio’s muscles twitched at the light touch. She settled her hands on Rio’s waist and spun them both around, walking Rio backwards towards the bed.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio felt the backs of her legs touch the mattress and let Agatha sit her down.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha used her knee to nudge Rio’s legs apart so that she could stand between them and she slowly sank to her knees. She hooked her fingers beneath the waistband of Rio’s trousers and underwear and started to slowly pull them down, with Rio lifting her hips to make it easier.</span><span><br/></span><span>Once Rio’s thighs were uncovered, Agatha smiled. The purple and yellow ink that coloured the tanned skin and made up the Spyro tattoo was now fully on display.</span><span><br/></span><span>She pressed a kiss to it and continued to bring Rio’s trousers down her legs, tossing them aside when they were finally off.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She rose back up and brought their lips together once before trailing a line of kisses down Rio’s neck, stopping to nip at the skin then soothe it with her tongue. The light, breathy noises that Rio was making added to the wetness that was already between her legs as she continued her path downwards.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha put her hand on Rio’s sternum and pushed her backwards, laying her down, and dragged her hands down Rio’s torso. Her hands rested on Rio’s hips, fingertips digging in slightly.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Fuck, your body is amazing.” She breathed before she kissed over Rio’s breast. When she got to her nipple she pulled the skin between her teeth and gently held it while she moved her tongue over the sensitive area.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio released a low moan and her back began to arch into the sensation as Agatha brought one of her hands up to roll the other nipple between her fingers.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio felt her orgasm begin to build. Agatha had barely touched her and it was taking her to the edge, but she needed more. She needed to feel Agatha inside her.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha felt Rio’s hand circle around her wrist of the hand that was palming her breast. She felt Rio move her hand lower and switched her mouth to the other nipple.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha let Rio guide her hand between her legs.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I need your fingers.” Rio practically begged once Agatha started to tease her entrance.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha lifted her head so that she could see Rio’s face. “How many?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio was moving her hips to try and get something, anything, from Agatha’s hand but Agatha increased the pressure of her hold, steadying Rio. </span><span><br/></span><span>“Start with two.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha nodded and leaned down to kiss Rio as she pushed two fingers in all the way to the second knuckle. She immediately picked up her pace and she felt Rio wrap her arms around her, pulling their torsos impossibly closer. Agatha’s free hand made its way back to Rio’s breast and started teasing her nipple.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio drew in a quick, sharp breath and dug her nails into the muscles of Agatha’s back. “Shit. Shit, don’t stop.” She moaned.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha buried her face in Rio’s neck, nipping at her pulse point before resting her tongue on it, feeling Rio’s heartbeat. She was glad that she had the only fully detached house on her street, because Rio was </span><em><span>loud</span></em><span>.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio was desperately trying to hold on, to drag the feeling out. But when Agatha started circling her clit with her thumb, she snapped.</span><span><br/></span><span>Her orgasm slammed into her and the noise she made left her throat feeling raw. </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio’s whole body was twitching but Agatha didn’t stop, she was fuelled by the sounds that Rio was making and wanted to keep hearing them. She added a third finger and sighed as she felt Rio stretch around her fingers. She curled them and felt Rio’s nails drag down her back. She would definitely have marks for a few days, but it was worth it.</span><span><br/></span><span>She kissed Rio’s lips, drinking in the noises that she was making.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio had no idea where her first orgasm ended and the second began, every nerve in her body was on fire and every ounce of breath was drawn from her lungs as Agatha kept up her speed. She had no idea what she had said, or if she’d even been able to form words at all, she just knew that her throat was sore and her limbs were heavy.</span><span><br/></span><span>Feeling Rio start to go limp, Agatha slowed down and withdrew her fingers. She pressed a final kiss to Rio’s neck and brought her head back up.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio’s eyes were closed and her chest was still heaving as she was trying to catch her breath. Agatha moved so that she was lying next to her on the bed. She licked her fingers and wiped the remainder on her quilt – this bedding was due for a wash anyway.</span><span><br/></span><span>She moved her head to the side to look at Rio, her eyes were open now and her breathing had slowed a little. “What’s your name?” Agatha asked softly, smiling.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio let out a breathy laugh and turned to face Agatha. “Whatever the fuck you want it to be.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They both laughed and Agatha brought her hand up to Rio’s cheek, kissing her softly.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled. “Give me a sec for my legs to start working and I’ll go.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Confusion flashed across Agatha’s features. “Go?” Sure this hadn’t really been the plan, but that didn’t mean that she wanted Rio to leave.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio’s chest started to tighten. Here it was, the moment that she had pushed as far back in her mind as she could. She didn’t do sleepovers.</span><span><br/></span><span>Sleepovers lead to sleepy cuddles and lazy mornings, and those things lead to relationships, and relationships lead to heartbreak.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The only difference this time – that she was currently aware of – was that her excuse was actually legitimate. “My flight home is tomorrow and I have to be in London early. I need to sleep at my own place tonight to make sure I have any chance of not missing my flight.”</span><span><br/></span><span>The hurt that had begun to creep into Agatha’s chest dissipated. The thought of Rio having to fly back to America for Christmas had never crossed her mind. It was just bad timing that the first time they slept together was on the eve of her flight home.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha nodded. “Understandable. I don’t want to keep you from your family during the holidays.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They laid there in comfortable silence for a few moments before Rio started to feel her eyes grow heavy. “Okay, I’m in danger of falling asleep so I need to make a move before that happens.” She chuckled as she started to pick herself up and shuffle off the end of the bed.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha propped herself up on her elbows and watched Rio put her clothes back on, only fastening the top and bottom two studs of the corset so that it would stay on, rather than doing it up all the way.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha stood up and grabbed the robe that had been thrown over the back of the chair that was tucked under her dressing table. “I’ll walk you to the door.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio shook her head. “No need, I know the way. I’ll see you in the new year.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha smiled and nodded. “See you in the new year.”</span><span><br/></span><span>She watched Rio walk out of her room and turn in the direction of the stairs before moving to pick up her dress.</span><span><br/></span><span>The dress, her duvet cover and the covers on her couch cushions would all need a wash but that was tomorrow Agatha’s problem.</span><span><br/></span><span>She saw her phone on the floor near her dress – she wasn’t sure when her phone had ended up on the floor, but she picked it up to check the time.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The lock screen flashed up and the first thing her eyes were drawn to was a message.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Wanda: I didn’t wear this underwear for no one to see it</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><span>The message was followed by a picture, but there was no preview.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha’s blood turned to ice as the realisation hit her.</span><span><br/></span><span>This wasn’t her phone.</span><span><br/></span><span>Her phone was still in her bag downstairs.</span><span><br/></span><span>This was </span><em><span>Rio’s</span></em><span> phone.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio was the one receiving suggestive pictures and messages from Wanda.</span><span><br/></span><em><span>Why</span></em><span> was Rio receiving suggestive pictures and messages from Wanda?</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The memory of the time that she and Rio had bumped into Wanda in the corridor came careening into her skull. </span><span><br/></span><span>The way that Wanda and Rio were on first name terms with each other. The concern on Wanda’s face when she heard about Rio’s knee. The way that Wanda reached for Rio to offer comfort for her injury.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha had had a feeling that they knew each other but she had hoped it had been through Rio being friends with Billy, and not something else.</span><span><br/></span><span>This was definitely </span><em><span>something else.</span></em><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Her breathing was shallow, her heart was pounding, her head was spinning.</span><span><br/></span><span>How could this be happening?</span><span><br/></span><span>The woman that she had spent months building up to this night with had been sleeping with her ex fiancée.</span><span><br/></span><span>If Rio had seen this message earlier would she have even bothered going home with Agatha?</span></p><p align="justify"><span>If she saw this message now would she go straight to Wanda’s?</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Her spiral was interrupted by a knock at her front door. Her fist closed around the phone as she let her body move on autopilot down the stairs and to the door.</span><span><br/></span><span>She opened it and Rio was standing on the other side, hand raised to knock again. “Oh good, I was worried that you’d fallen straight to sleep. I left my phone in your room, can’t order an Uber without it.” She smiled.</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha looked at the phone in her hand and lifted it up to Rio. “Yeah, I just found it. Here.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Agatha’s voice was uneven and Rio chuckled. “Okay, you sound like you need some rest. Merry Christmas Agatha.” She took the phone out of Agatha’s hand and Agatha forced a smile.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Merry Christmas Rio.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio turned away and Agatha closed the door.</span><span><br/></span><span>Yeah, she fucking </span><em><span>hated</span></em><span> Christmas.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio ordered her taxi and waited for it on the corner under the glow of a street lamp. She wouldn’t realise it until much later, but that feeling that she usually had when she left Wanda’s house, or after she’d slept with Taylor – the feeling that something was missing or not quite right – she didn’t feel it as she sat in the car leaving Agatha’s house, setting her alarms for the morning. </span></p>

<p align="justify"><span>Rio was sitting in the airport waiting for her connecting flight and fighting to keep her eyes open. She hadn’t gotten much – if any – sleep the night previous, for obvious reasons.</span><span><br/></span><span>She had showered when she got home so that it was one less thing to do in the morning but after that she was too wired to settle down. She had managed maybe half an hour of sleep before her alarm went off and she had to drag herself back out of bed.</span><span><br/></span><span>Now she was sitting in the airport regretting not having gotten any sleep. She didn’t regret the reason but god damn was she tired.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She was blasting heavy music into her ears in the hopes that the heavy distortion, fast double pedal and roaring vocals would keep her awake long enough to board her next flight. She watched the other people milling about in the airport. Some were families with small children that saw the wide open space as a huge playground, and were running around whilst their parents tried to corral them.</span><span><br/></span><span>Some were young couples going on their first holiday together.</span><span><br/></span><span>Some were people that looked just as tired as she felt who probably also had multiple flights to catch on the same day and were just trying to make it to their destinations in one piece.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio had resorted to closing one eye for a few seconds at a time and then switching in an attempt to rest them enough without fully closing both eyes and risking drifting to sleep, whilst also watching the board so that she can see which gate she needs to head to in a few minutes.</span><span><br/></span><span>After what felt like hours of desperately trying to stay awake, the board finally changed and showed her gate. She groaned softly at the fact that she now had to move and stood up, slinging her bag over her shoulder and made her way in the direction that the arrows were pointing.</span></p><p align="center"><span>__________</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio didn’t know exactly when she lost her fight with sleep, but she was woken up by a gentle nudge on her shoulder. She slowly opened her eyes and saw the smiling face of the little girl that was sitting next to her.</span><span><br/></span><span>“My mommy told me to tell you that you need to put your seatbelt back on because we’re landing soon.”</span><span><br/></span><span>It took Rio’s brain a minute to process what the girl had said, but when it had caught up she replied. “Oh. Thank you so much.” She smiled softly at the girl and gave a nod of thanks towards her mom before wrapping the belt around her waist and securing it.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The girl – whose name, Rio found out, was Olivia – chatted to her until the plane landed and it was time for them to get off. </span><span><br/></span><span>Olivia told her that this was her first ‘big girl’ flight because she had been too small the other times she had been on a plane to remember it, and that they were going to visit her uncles for Christmas. Rio smiled and nodded along as Olivia spoke excitedly, saying the occasional “wow” when she felt like it was needed.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Olivia’s mom got their cases from the overhead compartment and led Olivia off of the plane, Rio following behind. When Rio started to veer away towards the luggage carousels Olivia said, “bye bye Miss Rio. Merry Christmas!” with a wave.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio waved back. “Bye Olivia, merry Christmas!”</span><span><br/></span><span>The interaction made Rio smile as she was waiting for her suitcase to appear on the carousel.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>When she finally saw her case, she grabbed it and headed for the exit. Maddy was picking her up so she swept her gaze over the people that were stood waiting, looking for her friend, and rolled her eyes when she saw Maddy and the sign she was holding.</span><span><br/></span><em><span>Her Royal Highness, Queen Of The Lesbians, Rio Vidal</span></em><span><br/></span><span>“You just had to, didn’t you?” Rio asked as she pulled Maddy into a hug.</span><span><br/></span><span>“How could I resist?” Maddy answered as she wrapped her arms around Rio and gave her a tight squeeze. “Fuck, I’ve missed you dude.” Maddy added as she pulled away.</span><span><br/></span><span>“That’s a bit gay.” Rio deadpanned.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Hey, bisexuality is real. Don’t erase me.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“My sincerest apologies your bi-ness.” Rio said with a cheeky smile. “Can you take me home now though? I’ve had enough of airports for one day.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy looped her arm around Rio’s. “Your chariot is this way.” She said as she led them towards her car.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio paid for the parking as a thank you, and they set off towards her house.</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy began telling her about a new person that had been adopted into the friend group. “Her name is Kate and she moved here four months ago. She started working at the office about three months ago and I’m training her. She didn’t know anyone and she doesn’t really speak to her family, who live in New York. So naturally I took her in.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled as Maddy spoke. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy was the kind of person that would talk to anyone and hated to see anybody being alone. It was how they had become friends.</span><span><br/></span><span>None of Rio’s middle school friends were in her homeroom when they moved to high school, so she had tucked herself into one of the back corners, too nervous to speak to anyone. And that's how the day went until lunch. She was once again tucked into a corner, watching her friends sitting and laughing with new people that they had met through the morning, when someone pulled out the chair opposite her and sat down. And from that moment on, her and Maddy were best friends.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Is she joining us on Boxing Day?” Rio asked.</span><span><br/></span><span>Her, Maddy, Chloe and Jesse had agreed to go for a meal and then go back to Maddy’s house to exchange the group's Secret Santa gifts, get high and have a few drinks.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Yeah she is and she’s staying the night at mine. So please for the love of whatever deity you want to assign this to, do </span><em><span>not</span></em><span>,</span> <span>under </span><em><span>any</span></em><span> circumstances, sleep with her.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio scoffed in fake outrage. “Madylin, what are you implying?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy didn’t reply until she had finished a risky lane change. “Well she’s a lesbian so I don’t need to tell Jesse and we both know that it won’t be Chloe, so that just leaves you. She’s still new to the city and she’s shy. So she doesn’t need to be added to your ever-growing body count.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio laughed. “I can’t believe I flew all this way just for you to slut shame me.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“I’m not slut shaming you, if anything I’m slut jealous. I’m just looking out for a new friend.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio made a show of thinking hard about what Maddy had said. “Hmm, okay. I won’t sleep with her.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Thank you, you’re such a saint.” Maddy said with a smirk.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I’ll save her for when I come home in summer.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy rolled her eyes. “You’re such a prick!”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They spent the rest of the drive to Rio’s house finalising the plans they had for the Christmas period. </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio had bought most of the presents for her friends and family online and had them delivered to Maddy’s house, so Maddy was going to bring them over and help her wrap them tomorrow afternoon. Then during Maddy’s lunch break on Monday and Tuesday, they were going to do some last minute shopping and Kate was going to join them so that she had a chance to meet Rio before the full group had their gathering.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Everyone would spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with their own families – except Kate who had been adopted by Maddy’s family for the holiday and would be with Maddy at Maddy’s parents’ house for dinner – and they would have their time on Boxing Day. The rest of the week before new years they would play it by ear since Jesse and Chloe both had to work and Maddy and Kate both had the week off. The plans for new years hadn’t been locked in yet so they would be decided on Boxing Day before they got too high.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy pulled up outside of Rio’s house and grabbed Rio’s arm to stop her from getting out of the car. “Before you go in, there’s something I need to tell you.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio didn’t respond, she just waited for Maddy to continue.</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy took a shaky breath. “So I came by every week to water your plants and clip them back when needed, like we agreed. I followed all of your instructions to a T. I spoke to them, I used their names, I even put classical music on for them like you asked.” She dropped her gaze, no longer looking Rio in her eyes. “I stopped by today before heading to the airport just to make sure they were all sorted for you coming home and you didn’t have to worry about them for a couple of days. But…” She trailed off.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio put her hand on Maddy’s arm reassuringly. “Maddy, it’s okay. I won’t be mad, just tell me how bad it is.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy looked back up at Rio’s face. “It’s Samwise. He was fine when I checked on Monday, but today his leaves had started shrivelling and they weren’t as vibrant as before.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Samwise was a Hobbit Jade that Rio adored, she’d had him for nearly five years and she’d have taken him to England with her if she could.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I Googled what to do,” Maddy continued, “and it said to let the soil dry completely before adding any more water. It was still slightly damp when I checked so I haven’t done anything, but I needed to tell you before you went in.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio started to laugh, she couldn’t help it. Maddy had taken this so seriously, and yes she would have been a bit upset if any of her plants had died, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world. “Maddy, you probably just underwatered him slightly. I’ll sort him out, don’t worry. He can be very dramatic.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy breathed out a sigh of relief. “Oh thank fuck. I thought for sure that this would be the end of our friendship.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Well I’m glad you didn’t overreact.” Rio said as she got out of the car and went to get her case out of the boot.</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy flipped her off as she went to the front door and used her spare key to open it for Rio.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio dumped her bags near the living room and threw her shoes back towards the door before heading to check on Samwise. His leaves were looking a little dry and shrivelled as Maddy had said, but it wasn’t anything she couldn’t fix with a bit of TLC. “You can relax, he will live to see another day!” She shouted over her shoulder towards Maddy.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I’m so glad!” Maddy replied, walking towards Rio. “I told your abuela that we’d be there for eight, so you’ve got time to shower if you want.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“As much as I’d </span><em><span>love</span></em><span> to, I know that if I get in that shower now then I won’t want to leave the house again.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy snorted. “Valid. I’ll make us a coffee then so that you don’t fall asleep in your food later.” She headed to the kitchen and Rio followed behind her, taking a seat at the counter. She knew that if she sat on the comfy sofa she would definitely pass out.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They killed the time drinking their coffees and chatting before Maddy drove them to Rio’s parents house – the drive was short as Rio only lived about ten minutes away from her parents.</span><span><br/></span><span>Her parents house was at their vineyard, right at the end of the winding road, past the small on-site shop. Rio never got tired of the scenery and admired it in the low light as they drove down the road.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>When the house came into view Rio felt a pang of excitement at seeing her family again after so long. Living so close to each other meant that they saw each other often and this was the longest she’d ever been away from them since she had been in New York doing her masters.</span><span><br/></span><span>As they got closer she could see that the front door was already open, and waiting to greet them was her thirteen year old great pyrenees, Monty.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>When the car stopped he immediately bounded towards it, beelining for Rio like he knew she had come home. She had barely opened the door before he was jumping up at her, his tail wagging so fast that it was just a blur.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Hey buddy!” She said as she rubbed his head, trying to stop him from licking her face. “Did you miss me? I sure missed you!”</span><span><br/></span><span>She managed to get him off of her long enough so that she could get out of the car and as soon as she was standing, he was jumping up at her again. He might be an old man, but he still had the same energy he did when he was a puppy.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy walked around the car to join them. “Wow, you come home and he forgets all about me.”</span><span><br/></span><span>At the sound of her voice, Monty dropped down from Rio and went to Maddy for a moment before going back to Rio and then back to Maddy, seemingly trying to work out who his attention should go to.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio bent down to pat his head. “How about we go inside and you can sit between us buddy?”</span><span><br/></span><span>As if he’d understood what she’d said, he turned and started walking towards the house, looking back at them to check they were following him, which they were.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio closed the door behind them and Monty continued into the living room.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Did you bring them in safely, compañero?” Rio heard her dad ask from inside the room, before hearing him stand up.</span><span><br/></span><span>She was hanging her jacket up when he appeared in the hall. “Mija, it’s so good to see you!” He said with a beaming smile as he wrapped his arms around her in a tight hug. “Thank you for picking her up Maddy.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Any time Luis. Someone had to make sure she didn’t land herself in trouble the minute she got back.” Maddy said with a smirk.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Isabella, Camila! Rio’s home!” Luis shouted over his shoulder towards the kitchen.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio and Maddy slipped their shoes off and the three of them made their way to the kitchen where Isabella, her mom, and Camila, her abuela, were finishing the meal that they had been preparing.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Her mom set down the spoon that she had been using to stir the pan and pulled her into a hug. “Querida, it’s so good to see you! I’ve missed you so much, how are you?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio hugged her back. “I’ve missed you too Mami. I’m good, just tired and hungry.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Isabella pulled away and said, “well we can fix one of those things.” She turned to Maddy. “Thank you for getting her here.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“No problem, Isabella. Anything for my second favourite family.” Maddy said with a smile.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Camila, who had been quiet up to this point, walked up to Rio and pressed the handle of the wooden spoon that Isabella had set aside a few moments ago into her hand. “Please help me. Your mother burnt the sauce twice.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio chuckled and looked at her mom. “How could you burn the sauce not once, but two times?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Isabella leaned in to whisper in Rio’s ear. “She kept turning the heat too high.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Isabella Marie, escuché eso!”</span><span><br/></span><span>Isabella turned to face Camila with a sickly sweet smile. “Te amo mucho mamá.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Camila grumbled under her breath and grabbed Rio by the wrist, leading her to the stove.</span><span><br/></span><span>Isabella laughed softly and left the kitchen with Luis in tow.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Camila bent down to check the contents of the oven before saying, “You’re staying for dinner, Maddy.” It wasn’t a question.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio had assumed that Maddy would be staying for dinner, her abuela always cooked enough to feed a small army and never turned anybody away. She had the feeling that Maddy had eaten meals with her family a lot while she’d been away.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Roger that.” Maddy said whilst saluting Camila and leaving the two of them alone in the kitchen.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The conversation started as small talk. Camila asked Rio how her journey was and how her PhD was going, if she’d made any friends, how living in England was etcetera. </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio enjoyed spending time with her abuela. Cooking with her was a huge part of her childhood and she had taught Rio so many recipes over the years. </span><span><br/></span><span>Rio’s family had imparted so many essential life skills on her and she was thankful for every single one of them. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The small talk shifted onto the topic that Rio had been anticipating, when her abuela said, “I was hoping you’d have a girlfriend for me to meet.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled. Camila always asked her when she was going to be in another relationship, not because she thought there was anything wrong with being single, but because she wanted Rio to be happy and find her ‘forever person’ – Rio still had no idea who had taught her abuela that phrase.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“How do you know I don’t?” </span><span><br/></span><span>“Porque te conozco, cariño. Unless you and Maddy have an announcement to make, you wouldn’t get a girlfriend and not bring her to meet me. It’s against the rules.” Camila poked Rio in the ribs to drive the point home and Rio chuckled as she poured the sauce into a bowl.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Okay fine, I don’t have a girlfriend. I’m trying to focus on my studies, abuela.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Camila didn’t need to know that Rio was definitely taking part in extracurricular activities. The woman might be surprisingly open-minded for a devout catholic, but she didn’t need to know that information about her granddaughter.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio’s lie seemed to sate Camila and they began taking the copious amounts of food into the dining room, announcing that dinner was ready.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio made a plate for Monty and put it on the floor at the head of the table, the place that had been reserved for him since he was a puppy. They had trained him to wait until Camila had said grace before he started eating, using “amen” as his release word.</span><span><br/></span><span>While Rio didn’t follow any religion, she still closed her eyes and respected the prayer that Camila said before they ate. It gave her a warm feeling in her chest. The feeling of being home.</span></p><p align="center"><span>__________</span></p><p align="justify"><span>The remaining four days until Christmas were filled with last minute Christmas preparations and spending more time with her friends and family.</span><span><br/></span><span>On Sunday morning Rio bought a card to write for Kate and in the afternoon, Maddy helped Rio wrap the presents that she had ordered.</span><span><br/></span><span>They made light work of the task and decided to reward themselves with a drink, which quickly turned into several drinks.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They headed to a local bar where the bartenders knew them by name and discounted their drinks. Rio was greeted by them like she had returned from the war, and her first couple of drinks were free. </span><span><br/></span><span>They invited Chloe and Jesse to join them and Maddy set a hard rule of no shots since she had to be at work the following morning.</span><span><br/></span><span>The four of them occupied their usual booth at the back and enjoyed a quiet Sunday night together.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe returned to the table with a fresh round for everyone and set the drinks down in the middle. “I am surprised that you haven’t brought a sweet yet naïve British girl back with you. I thought you’d have managed to find at least one that would follow you around wherever you went.” She said as she took her seat again.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio took a sip of her rum and coke. “I’m gonna blow all of your minds when I tell you that I’ve only slept with three women while I’ve been there.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Jesse’s mouth dropped open and his eyes went comically wide. “</span><em><span>Only three?</span></em><span> Damn, has the PhD broken you already? Do you remember all of their names?” He asked, his voice steeped in sarcasm. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio flipped him off as Maddy and Chloe laughed. “You’re all bullies actually. I don’t know why I continue to put up with you.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“You’d be lost without us, babe.” Maddy said as she reached across the table to hold Rio’s hand.</span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe mimicked the action and reached for Rio’s other hand. “Please tell me I was right and one of them was your supervisor.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio felt the corners of her mouth lift as she thought about her night with Agatha just two days ago. The night definitely could have lasted a lot longer if she hadn’t needed to catch her flight the following morning. She could always make up for lost time when she got back to England.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Okay yes, I did sleep with her. But it was </span><em><span>after</span></em><span> you mentioned it and not because of.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe grinned at her. “Doesn’t matter, a win is a win.” She turned to Maddy and nudged her. “You owe me ten bucks.” Then she turned to Jesse. “You too. Pay up.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Jesse and Maddy both sighed but reached into their pockets and pulled out a ten dollar bill each and handed them to Chloe.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio watched the exchange in shock. “You guys were betting on whether I’d sleep with her or not?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Me and Maddy bet that you </span><em><span>wouldn’t</span></em><span> sleep with her.“ Jesse tried to defend himself. “So technically, we’re not the problem here.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“</span><em><span>Technically</span></em><span>, you’re all dickheads.” Rio grumbled into her drink.</span></p><p align="center"><span>__________</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio met Maddy and Kate on their lunch break for some last minute shopping on Monday and Tuesday as planned. Kate took a little while to come out of her shell on the Monday but on the Tuesday Rio could see her being a good fit with their little group. She had a good sense of humour, which was needed around that sarcastic group of idiots, and joined in with the gentle bullying that went on between Maddy and Rio.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio tried to get to know Kate a bit better, asking her questions about herself, but avoided mentioning her parents since Maddy had mentioned that Kate didn’t really talk to them. Rio figured that Kate wouldn’t want to talk about them to someone she had only just met.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I was on my college's archery team, I was the best actually, and had the opportunity to take it further. But I enjoyed it too much and didn’t want it to end up feeling like work, you know?” Kate explained and Rio nodded in agreement. She understood where Kate was coming from.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I was worried about that when I decided to do my PhD on Greek Mythology but so far, touch wood, I haven’t had that feeling.” Rio said as she tapped her fingers against a wooden post that they were walking past.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy snorted. “It also helps that she’s sleeping with her supervisor.” She stage whispered to Kate.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio rolled her eyes but Kate spoke before she could. “Oh wow! That’s one way to make sure you pass.” She said with a laugh.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio threw her arms up. “I’m not </span><em><span>sleeping </span></em><span>with her, we had sex </span><em><span>one time</span></em><span>. And trust me, an orgasm isn’t enough to ensure a good grade from that woman.” While Rio definitely believed that, it probably wouldn’t hurt if Agatha actually had any say in her final grade. “Besides, she’s not the one that marks it. It's a panel of examiners that I need to impress and then I need to defend it.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“So you just need to sleep with the examiners then.” Kate said matter of factly.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio scrunched her face up. “But what if they’re men?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate matched her expression. “Oh good point actually.” She put her hand on Rio’s arm. “Don’t put yourself through that, you’re too pretty to sleep with a man.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“You’re so right! I’m glad you moved here, Kate. You get me.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They walked back to the building where Maddy and Kate both worked. Kate went straight in because she needed the toilet and Maddy stayed outside with Rio for a moment.</span><span><br/></span><span>“What did I say you’re not allowed to do?” Rio furrowed her brows in confusion, not really sure what Maddy was referring to. “Stop flirting with her. ‘Oh Kate, you get me.’” Maddy continued in a high pitched, mocking voice, followed by a gagging noise.</span><span><br/></span><span>“That’s not what I sound like and that wasn’t flirting. I was being friendly!” Rio said, defending herself.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy narrowed her eyes. “The line between you being friendly and you being flirty is almost non-existent, dude. You’re forgetting how well I know you.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio crossed her arms. “You’re so dramatic.” She said with a smirk.</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy rolled her eyes. “And you’re still a prick.” She said before turning and heading into the building. “Merry Christmas asshole, love you!” She threw over her shoulder.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled and shook her head. “Love you too. Merry Christmas.”</span></p><p align="center"><span>__________ </span></p><p align="justify"><span>On Christmas eve Rio drove to her parents house so that she could spend the next two nights there like she did every year since she moved out. The vineyard was closed to the public until Boxing Day so there was nothing to do except spend both days together.</span><span><br/></span><span>More family members would also be coming to stay and spend the holiday with them.</span><span><br/></span><span>The house was big enough that Rio, Luis, Isabella and Camila never felt like they were living on top of each other and always had their space, but with the seven extra people that were staying for the next two days, the house was going to be packed.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Luis and Isabella had planned out the sleeping arrangements ahead of time, both of them well versed in these family gatherings by now. They had the biggest house so it made sense that everyone went to them and they had the added convenience of Rio’s house only being a ten minute drive away so that people could stay there as well.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>In the late afternoon her tías Lucinda and Amelia and her tío Gabriel arrived with her cousins Luna, Sofia and Gabriela – Gabriela had also brought her boyfriend, Jason. They were all staying at Rio’s parents house both nights as well which meant it was about to get a bit crowded.</span><span><br/></span><span>The final cousin, Marcus, arrived with his wife Lara and their nine month old baby Phoebe who were all staying at Rio’s house so that Phoebe could have a quiet space. They had already stopped by Rio’s house to drop their bags off before arriving at her parents house to join the chaos.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Monty was diligently waiting by the door to greet each person as they arrived, loving the attention that he was getting. </span><span><br/></span><span>This was the first time that he had met Phoebe so they all watched as he cautiously sniffed her for a minute before ultimately deciding that he must protect the tiny human at all costs. He would lay at the feet of whoever was holding her, and if she was taken out of the room, he would follow closely behind, keeping an eye on her the entire time.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The focus shifted from the baby to Rio as everyone wanted to know how her studies were going and what England was like. She answered all of their questions, avoiding the ones about relationships as there was nothing to say other than the pre-prepared line of “I’m just trying to focus on my studies.”</span><span><br/></span><span>She would definitely be updating Gabriela, Luna and Sofia about her exploits later on when they were sharing a couple of joints in the field, and judging by the way they were looking at her as she spoke, they knew they would be getting all the details at some point.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Lara, Rio and her cousins had placed bets on how long it would take Gabriel to say something slightly homophobic, but just over two hours in and he was yet to supply them with the goods. Luna and Sofia were out of the running which left Gabriela, Marcus, Lara and Rio still in with a chance of winning the pot that they had gathered when everyone arrived.</span><span><br/></span><span>It was something they did every time there was a family gathering, but Amelia must have spoken to him about it on the drive down because it had usually happened by now.</span><span><br/></span><span>The rules of the game included not being allowed to trick him into saying anything homophobic – it had to be legitimate – and two people had to be with him at all times so that there were witnesses.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Just past the four hour mark and only Marcus and Rio were still in. Rio usually had very little faith in him and placed her bet somewhere within the first hour, but this time she felt the urge to go late. They were finishing up dinner and the drinks were starting to flow; this was Rio’s time to get her win.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Lara, Gabriel and Rio were all in the kitchen sorting the takeaway cartons into recyclable, non-recyclable and ones that Camila would definitely want to keep and reuse. It was tradition that they ordered in on Christmas eve as the kitchen was all prepped for the food that would be cooked the following day.</span><span><br/></span><span>They were just chatting and Rio was about to accept defeat as Gabriel </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> hadn’t made any comments… Until he turned to her and asked, “So you really haven't found yourself a girlfriend in England?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio watched Lara’s eyes go wide behind him and she felt the corners of her mouth fighting to lift. </span><span><br/></span><span>This was it. </span><span><br/></span><span>She still had ten minutes left until Marcus won by default and this could be her moment.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She turned her attention back to the plastic tubs she was washing to be stacked in the cupboard later in an attempt to appear nonchalant. “No, I really haven’t. Like I said, I’m just focusing on my studies.” She kept her voice light, she wasn’t allowed to goad him.</span><span><br/></span><span>He handed her another tub. “What about a boyfriend?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio flicked her eyes to Lara for half a second before looking at Gabriel. “I’m a lesbian tío. I definitely won’t be looking for a boyfriend." She said with an undertone of amusement.</span><span><br/></span><span>He hummed and nodded. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio was so close to winning the money she could almost taste it. The sixty dollars was within her reach. All she had to do was lead Gabriel to the water and let him drink, but it couldn’t seem like she was leading him. He had to go of his own accord.</span><span><br/></span><span>She asked her next question carefully, making sure to phrase it just right. “How’s your search for a boyfriend going?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio watched Lara’s expression shift over Gabriel’s shoulder. It was a risky question, but was still within the rules… Just.</span><span><br/></span><span>He gave a short, sharp “Ha!” before saying, “About as well as I want it to.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Ahh, so you’ve found him then.” Rio said without missing a beat.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Lara snorted and quickly disguised it by coughing but Gabriel didn’t seem to notice, he was too busy laughing at what Rio had said.</span><span><br/></span><span>“You’re a funny fucker, Rio! You know I don’t like my shopping dropped off round the back.” She faked her laugh like she was joining in with him, hoping that he would continue because that was a phrase he had used before and no longer counted for a win. They were playing in the big leagues now.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Lara held up her hand behind him, spreading her fingers and mouthing, “Five minutes,” at Rio.</span><span><br/></span><span>She thought she would have to concede but then Gabriel continued. “Besides, I work in construction. I couldn’t do that job if my wrists were limp!”</span><span><br/></span><em><span>Bingo!</span></em><span><br/></span><span>Lara punched the air which made Gabriel turn around. “I saw a fly.” Lara quickly explained. “I nearly caught the fucker but it got away.”</span><span><br/></span><span>He made a noise of disgust. “Pequeños bastardos.” He turned back to Rio. “Your dad still have that electric fly swatter?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh, uh, I think so? You’ll have to ask him.”</span><span><br/></span><span>He nodded and left the kitchen in search of Luis.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio and Lara waited for him to be out of earshot before they celebrated Rio’s win.</span><span><br/></span><span>Lara grabbed her and pulled her into a hug before pulling back and resting her hands on Rio’s shoulders. “That was fucking masterful, truly. I cannot believe I got to witness that with my own two eyes and ears.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio laughed. “There was no way in hell that I was letting Marcus win again. He’s way too smug about it.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Lara nodded her agreement. “We need to assemble the Council Of The Cousins to let them know.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“You gather them and I’ll grab the beers and the weed and meet you outside.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Lara saluted her and they went their separate ways.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>About five minutes later everyone was gathered outside for the announcement. Marcus and Rio stood next to each other and everyone else stood opposite them, with Lara giving the results as she was the last witness.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I have gathered the Council Of The Cousins here tonight to announce the winner of the traditional game of ‘When Will Gabriel Remember He’s Homophobic?’” </span><span><br/></span><span>They really needed to come up with a better name.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“The last two people in the running were Marcus and Rio, so let’s have a round of applause for them getting this far.”</span><span><br/></span><span>The seven of them clapped and cheered, Rio trying hard to keep the grin off her face at knowing that she won.</span><span><br/></span><span>“But unfortunately there cannot be two winners. So, it is my absolute pleasure to announce that tonight's winner is none other than Rio Vidal!”</span><span><br/></span><span>Everyone clapped and cheered again and Marcus pulled out the money bag that they’d all stuffed their ten dollar bills into hours ago to hand to Rio.</span><span><br/></span><span>“You have no idea how much pain this is causing me.” He said as she took it off him.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh I do, and I’m loving it.” Rio replied, her smile now wide and free.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They all stayed out there for another few minutes congratulating Rio before Marcus and Lara said that they were leaving because it had been a long day for Phoebe and they needed to get her to bed. They said their goodbyes and left Rio, Gabriela, Luna and Sofia outside.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio fished the joints out of her pocket. “Shall we ladies?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“We shall!” Her three cousins said in unison.</span><span><br/></span><span>Luna grabbed the beers and they all went out into the field.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela got the blankets out of the shed and they wrapped themselves up before sitting on the log that they had claimed years ago, they had even scratched their initials to reserve their ‘seats.’</span><span><br/></span><span>Marcus’ initials were also there and later Lara’s were added, but it would be a while before they joined in with the smoking again.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They lit the joints and took a few drags, enjoying the quiet for a moment after the chaos of the evening, listening to the crickets chirping away.</span><span><br/></span><span>Luna passed the joint to Rio as she said, “Okay, spill. How much has your body count risen while you’ve been over there?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio took a drag and took it back, savouring the burn on the back of her throat. “Only by three. One of them lasted a couple of months, one was a few times in between the first one and the last was on Friday.” She took another drag before passing it back to Luna.</span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela breathed out the joint that she and Sofia were sharing. “Ahh. So small amount of women, big amount of orgasms.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled. “Oh there were plenty of orgasms.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“That’s my girl.” Gabriela said whilst patting Rio on the back.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Sofia leaned forwards so that she could see Rio from her position at the end of the log. “How come the first one ended? Got too real?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio sighed. How did she begin to explain the Wanda situation? “Kinda, but not for the reasons you’re thinking.” She took a swig of her beer before continuing. “It turns out that I was friends with her son and she decided that wasn’t information that I needed to know.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Her three cousins all spoke over each other.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Damn.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Shit.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Dude!”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio puffed out her cheeks and blew out a breath. “Yep. We slept together a handful of times after I found out but, I don’t know. That’s information you can’t unlearn.” She gladly took the joint from Luna when it was offered to her and breathed it deep into her lungs before exhaling it.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Did the son know? How old is he? How did you meet him? How did you meet her? Sorry, that's a lot of questions.” Luna said, her questions coming in quick succession.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio answered all of the questions in order while they all listened, not interrupting her. “He found out that I was sleeping with his mom at the same time I found out that she </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> his mom. We were in her room and he came home to do some laundry – she wasn’t expecting him because it was mid-week and he usually went round on the weekend. So she quickly went downstairs and I threw my clothes back on and tried to sneak out but he caught me. In my haste to get dressed I also put my shirt on inside out.” She laughed at the absurdity of it, starting to see the humour in the situation. “He’s called Billy and was actually pretty cool about it and said that, as long as he didn’t have to know about it, we could keep seeing each other.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“He’s eighteen and he’s getting his degree in ancient history so we actually met on the first day of what they call freshers week, and he’s taking the module that my supervisor teaches so we sit together in those lectures. I’m also in a band with him.” She passed the joint back to Luna and took another drink of her beer. “I met his mom because she’s also a lecturer in the department. I emailed her about being my supervisor actually, but she never replied. I’m actually kinda glad about that now. Anyway, we ran into each other in a bar one night and I woke up in her bed and then we started a casual thing.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Luna passed the joint back to Rio for her to have the final drag. “When’s the last time you slept with her and when did you call it off?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“I slept with her about two weeks ago and I realised that I was pretty much done with it on Friday actually. We were at a university event and she came onto me in the bathroom but I turned her down. She messaged me later on but I was… busy. I didn’t see the message until I got home much later into the night.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela finished off the joint that she was sharing with Sofia and asked, “I’m assuming ‘busy’ was woman number three?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Ding, ding, ding, we have a winner.” Rio said as she discarded her joint into the small metal bucket they kept for occasions such as these.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela flicked the end of her joint into the bucket as well as Sofia spoke. “Okay, we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Tell us about woman number two.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio cracked open a second can. “Oh that one’s way easier. She’s one of Billy’s friends but she’s a couple years older than him and we met at a Halloween party, then we all went to a bonfire together and I went back to hers. I’ve seen her a few times since but nothing regular. She’s not my usual type but I like sex so…” She smirked and lifted her arms in a shrug.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela snorted and shook her head, a smile spreading across her face. “Short and sweet, I like it. Number three please.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Okay so, she’s a bit more complicated than two, but nowhere near one. At least I hope.”</span><span><br/></span><span>There was a beat of silence before Sofia said, “We’re waiting.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio tucked her tongue into her cheek, waiting another few seconds before speaking. “She’s my PhD supervisor.”</span><span><br/></span><span>All the replies came at once.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh come on!”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Seriously?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Rio!”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio held her hands up. “I didn’t plan it!”</span><span><br/></span><span>“You never do!” Luna teased as she lightly hit Rio on the arm.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh, let me guess, you just tripped and fell into her vagina?” Sofia questioned.</span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela just sighed and shook her head again.</span><span><br/></span><span>“We were both at the event and one thing led to another I guess.” Rio tried to defend herself but her cousins were having none of it.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Don’t give us that shit.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Yeah you’ve been spending extended amounts of time with this woman and you expect us to believe that?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“You’re telling me that not a single thing happened between you before Friday?”</span><span><br/></span><span>They were talking over each other again and Rio was just laughing. She knew that this would be how they reacted and was thoroughly enjoying it.</span><span><br/></span><span>“She looked hot, okay? I’m only human!”</span><span><br/></span><span>“You’re a fucking menace!” Sofia said as she gently threw a piece of bark she’d ripped off of the log at Rio’s shoe.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio picked it up and threw it into the field. “Okay, enough about me. Update me on your love lives. How’s things with Jason?” She asked the question to Gabriela.</span><span><br/></span><span>“They’re good! He’s just jealous that he doesn’t get to take part in the bet or join us out here.” Gabriela replied with a light chuckle.</span><span><br/></span><span>“He knows the rules. No joining in with family activities outside of gatherings unless you’re officially part of the family.” Luna said.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Yeah, so one of you needs to get down on one knee if he wants to stop feeling left out.” Sofia added.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio read the look on Gabriela’s face in record time, she could see the uncertainty in her eyes. “Unless you don’t want to get married.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela blew out a breath. “I want to get married, I’m just not sure I want to marry him.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Luna started to stand up. “Okay. If we're gonna unpack this, we’re gonna need more beers. Back in a sec!” And she took off towards the house.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Luna returned a few minutes later with Monty in tow for extra emotional support and she handed a fresh can out to everyone. “Okay, go ahead.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela took a deep breath. “When I think of my future with my husband and potentially children, I don’t see Jason being there. We’ve been together for nearly four years and he’s not a bad boyfriend, he’s a really good guy. He supports me, he does housework, we share the cooking and the bills, he’s really attentive… He’s just not what I think of when I think ‘husband’, you know?”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Do you still love him?” Sofia gently asked.</span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriela was now absentmindedly stroking Monty’s head. “I love him, I just don’t think I'm </span><em><span>in love</span></em><span> with him. I don’t think I ever have been. Come to think of it, I don’t think I actually know what being </span><em><span>in love</span></em><span> feels like. I’m happy with him but I feel like there should be more. And it’s nothing that he’s done. He hasn’t done anything wrong ever, the whole family accepted him pretty much straight away, but something feels like it’s missing.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio listened intently but didn’t offer any advice. She didn’t think that she </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> offer any advice. She wasn’t exactly a relationship guru given how she avoided them at all costs. Sure she had been in relationships but Cassidy was the only one that lasted for any significant amount of time, and that one clearly ended so well.</span><span><br/></span><span>She thought about what Gabriela said about not knowing what being in love felt like and Rio could relate to that. She thought she had been in love with Cassidy and then with the few girlfriends she’d had after Cassidy, but was she?</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>It wasn’t that she thought she was incapable of love. She obviously loved her family deeply and missed them horribly when she was in England.</span><span><br/></span><span>She thought about her platonic relationships, about Maddy, Chloe and Jesse. She loved each of them in the way one loves their friends but that wasn’t the same as romantic love.</span><span><br/></span><span>She didn’t truly know what romantic love felt like. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She had experienced the giddy feeling of being around a partner, the feeling of wanting to be near them all the time, and she had definitely experienced the feeling of wanting to rip their clothes off.. But she hadn’t experienced the chest aching, earth shattering, ‘no matter what, I’ll always find you’ type of love that people talk about.</span><span><br/></span><span>She wasn’t stupid, she knew that love wasn’t always like it is in movies, but she hadn’t even felt anything close to that.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The four of them stayed out there until they had finished their beers and then headed back into the house where the majority of people had already showered and donned the obligatory matching pyjamas. Jason was waiting for Gabriel to be done in the spare bathroom so the four cousins used Rio’s and Camila’s en suites.</span><span><br/></span><span>Once they were all showered and comfortable in their pyjamas they all reconvened in the living room for a final drink before heading up to bed.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio, Sofia and Luna all shared Rio’s room, Camila, Isabella and Luis all had their own rooms, Gabriel and Amelia took the spare room and Gabriela and Jason slept in the living room.</span><span><br/></span><span>It was the system they’d had worked out since Rio had bought her house and they could also use that. It was the one they were all used to.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio laid awake for a while, her brain unable to move on from the fact that she didn’t know what love really was. She really didn’t need an existential crisis right now, and the jetlag wasn’t helping with the difficulty of falling asleep either. She was happy with her life and her choices. Sure the Wanda situation could have been a bit smoother but she didn’t regret any of it. She was happy not being in a relationship, it was easier that way. </span><span><br/></span><span>It was safer.</span></p><p align="center"><span>__________</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Not being entirely sure when she fell asleep or how much sleep she’d had, Rio groggily opened her eyes and peered around her room. Luna and Sofia were still sleeping in their makeshift beds on her floor and daylight was only just beginning to work its way through the gap between her blinds and the wall. She picked up her phone from her bedside table to check the time and had to screw her eyes shut to adjust to the brightness of the screen.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>7:32am</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She put her phone back and closed her eyes again. There was still about half an hour before her parents and abuela would be getting up to slowly start getting dinner ready and another hour after that until everyone, including Marcus, Lara and Phoebe, would be in the living room for the video call with the family that were still in Puerto Rico.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She laid there with her eyes closed until she heard doors opening down the hall. People were officially on the move. She sighed, resigned to the fact that she wasn’t getting any more sleep and quietly padded to her bathroom, careful not to wake Sofia and Luna. When she had finished brushing her teeth she climbed back into bed and propped herself up against the headboard. She picked her phone up again and opened the band group chat as there were several unread messages.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Each one was a “merry Christmas” message followed by a picture of each of the band members with their families. She assumed the man in Billy’s picture was his dad and smiled as she looked at each picture.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Rio: Merry Christmas nerds! I’ll send a picture when everyone is awake</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Billy: How late does your family sleep? It’s 1pm????</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Alice: She’s 5 hours behind you idiot!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Alice: Merry Christmas Rio!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Ash: Merry Christmas Rio! Ignore Billy and his dumbness, sleep all you want queen</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Eddie: My boyfriend and his smooth brain never fail to amuse. Merry Christmas Rio!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Billy: Don’t bully me, it’s Christmas! </b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Billy: Merry Christmas Rio!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><span>She laughed quietly to herself as each of the messages came through. Of course Billy would forget that she’s in a different timezone, she shouldn’t have expected anything less.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Not too long later, Luna and Sofia began to stir. Luna opened her eyes and blinked a few times before looking at Rio. “Oh thank fuck you’re awake. I couldn’t deal with your snoring this early in the morning.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Fuck you, I don’t snore.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Yes you do.” Sofia grumbled, her eyes still closed. “I could fucking feel it through the floor.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio threw a pillow in their direction, not aiming for either of them particularly, just happy to hit one of them. “Merry Christmas to you too, assholes.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Luna gave a soft “hmph” as the pillow hit her in the stomach. “Feliz Navidad, idiotas.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Sofia finally opened her eyes. “Merry Christmas, fuckers.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>When Luna and Sofia had both used the bathroom, all three of them shuffled their way downstairs and into the living room. Everyone apart from Camila and Rio’s parents were there as they were hard at work in the kitchen.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Ah, they're alive!” Lucinda announced as the three of them took up spots on the couch. Monty jumped up to join them, laying across all three of their laps – he was also wearing a pyjama top to match all of the humans.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Isabella wandered into the room a few minutes later. “I have officially been kicked out of the kitchen.” She saw the three newest arrivals to the living room sitting on the sofa. “Good morning you three.” Then to Rio, “Merry Christmas Mija.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smiled. “Merry Christmas mamá.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Isabella squeezed herself into a gap on the other sofa. “Marcus texted. They should be here in ten minutes. Who wants to help Camila until then?”</span><span><br/></span><span>An immediate chorus of “Not it!” followed the question along with everyone's heads, including Monty’s, turning to Rio.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio rolled her eyes. “You’re all pussies.” She gave Monty a kiss on the head before she moved him so that she could stand and head into the kitchen.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She could hear her abuela loudly giving instructions to her dad, not quite shouting, but not soft either. She knocked on the doorframe to announce herself. “I heard you might need some help, abuela.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“¡Oh Río, mi salvadora!” Camila said as she started shooing Luis out of the kitchen.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I see the willing sacrifice has arrived.” He joked as he walked past her. “Merry Christmas Mija.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio chuckled. “Merry Christmas, Papá.” She walked further into the kitchen. “Where do you want me abuela?”</span><span><br/></span><span>She spent the remainder of the time until Marcus, Lara and Phoebe arrived following all of the instructions that Camila gave her.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She understood why the others didn’t want to help her. Camila was an amazing cook but she easily got stressed and could become snappy if you weren’t doing things just how she liked them. Rio had learnt how to be the perfect sous chef for her though which is why she was always the one that Camila either requested or the others sent.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Upon hearing Marcus announce their arrival, Rio and Camila left the kitchen to re-join everyone in the living room. Monty had reassumed his position as Phoebe’s personal guardian and Gabriela was linking her laptop to the TV for the call that would be happening shortly.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>When everyone was ready, they hit the call button and within a few seconds, the faces of the family members that were still in Puerto Rico were splashed across the TV screen.</span><span><br/></span><span>“¡Feliz Navidad!” Everyone shouted in unison and then the chaotic Spanglish began.</span><span><br/></span><span>Phoebe was lifted in front of the camera like baby Simba in The Lion King so that she could be seen and fawned over. She had a onesie that matched everyone’s pyjamas, even the family in Puerto Rico wore the same pyjamas.</span><span><br/></span><span>All of Rio’s family took tradition very seriously.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio got everyone's attention and moved to the corner of the room, holding her phone up in selfie mode to snap a picture of everybody. “On three, everyone say ‘merry Christmas.” She counted down and everyone said it in unison as she took the picture.</span><span><br/></span><span>She sat back down and sent it to the chat with her cousins so that they all had it, then she sent it to the band chat.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Rio: Obligatory family picture!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Ash: Stop it! Even the dog is matching you all 😭I’m obsessed, merry Christmas to your familia</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Eddie: Tell everyone feliz navidad from me!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Alice: That is the cutest baby I’ve ever seen! Also your family is huge holy fuck merry christmas Rio’s family!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Billy: Look at the goodest boy wearing his pyjamas, merry christmas everyone. Especially the dog!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><b>Rio: Tell your families I say merry Christmas too! Now get off your phones!</b><b><br/></b><b><br/></b><span>She also sent the picture to her chat with Maddy, Chloe and Jesse and then she was faced with a dilemma. Should she say merry Christmas to Agatha and Wanda?</span><span><br/></span><span>Technically she had covered Wanda off with telling Billy to say it so she could get away with that, but should she message Agatha?</span><span><br/></span><span>They hadn’t messaged at all since Friday so would it be weird to do it now?</span><span><br/></span><span>Normally Rio wouldn’t even think about a one night stand in any capacity, but Agatha was different. She was her supervisor first and they were sort of friends.</span><span><br/></span><span>Fuck it. What harm could it do?</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She sent the message to Agatha, put her phone down and thought no more of it.</span><span><br/></span><span>The family call lasted around an hour before everyone said their goodbyes and Camila beckoned Rio back to the kitchen.</span><span><br/></span><span>Camila put Rio to work straight away, asking her to check on the pork shoulder in the oven before handing her a knife and some plantains to slice.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They worked in comfortable silence with Camila occasionally muttering to herself as she flitted around the kitchen.</span><span><br/></span><span>The silence was broken when Camila said, “It’s such a shame that I passed my cooking skills on to you and you have no one to cook for.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio rolled her eyes, but not because she was mad, she was just tired of her choice to remain single being questioned by her family. She knew they always meant well, but after a few years it started to get tedious. “I told you abuela, I’m focusing on my studies. I’m not looking for a relationship right now.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Camila reached out and put her hand on Rio’s to stop her slicing. “Cariño, how will you know if you’ve found the right person if you’re putting all of your time and effort into your work? I know the others haven’t worked out but the perfect woman is out there. You won’t find her if you’re not looking.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Damn Rio had not expected Christmas to get this deep. First Gabriela was considering breaking up with Jason, then Rio spiralled about whether or not she had ever actually been in love and now her abuela was giving her a pep talk in the kitchen about finding the perfect woman.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio picked the knife back up and resumed slicing the plantains. “Okay, I see your point.” She said, hoping agreeing would get them off this topic. “I suppose I could amend my study schedule to allow time to meet people.” </span><span><br/></span><span>Camila narrowed her eyes which made Rio laugh. “I </span><em><span>will</span></em><span> amend my schedule to allow time to meet people.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Better!” Camilla moved to the cooker to check the various pans that were sitting on it and they continued to work until it was time for Luis to come start preparing the desserts.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Everyone slowly got changed out of their pyjamas, only changing into comfy clothes but clothes nonetheless. Marcus and Lara had brought theirs and Phoebe's clothes with them and used the spare room to get changed – Monty guarded the door while they were in there. When they came back down, Phoebe was wearing a Santa's elf onesie and a multitude of pictures were taken of her. They put her on the floor as she had just started to crawl and she curiously explored the living room, looking at everything with the awe that only a baby could have.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She soon found Monty’s tail and was enraptured by the fluff. They all watched with smiles as she gently put her hands on his fur and tried to bury her tiny hands under it. He started wagging his tail and she squealed with joy which startled him. He didn’t know that it was a happy squeal and not one of fright or pain, so he got to his feet to sniff and inspect her but she took off after his tail again which led to a hilarious game of chase between them. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They walked/crawled in circles until Rio gently held Monty’s face. “She’s okay bud, you can relax.” She said whilst laughing and kissed him on the head. He looked back towards Phoebe who was now making her way towards his feet. He gave her a final sniff before deciding that she wasn’t in any immediate danger and laying down again, letting her play with his feet and fur as much as she wanted.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>A few hours later everyone gathered around the huge table in the dining room which was now adorned with plates upon plates of food that Camila, Isabella and Rio had prepared through the morning. Monty still had his place at the head of the table and was patiently waiting for his command to begin eating. Camila said grace and they all tucked in.</span><span><br/></span><span>The drinks flowed and the conversation matched it, flitting between topics of nothing and everything all at the same time. Multiple conversations happening at once between the thirteen of them, people dipping in and out as certain words and sentences caught their attention.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriel was sitting next to Jason and started grilling him about when he was going to propose to his daughter. “Luis proposed after a year, me and Marcus proposed after two. You’re nearly at four now, gotta get your head in the game!”</span><span><br/></span><span>Amelia nudged Gabriela. “Doesn’t </span><em><span>have</span></em><span> to be Jason, you could get on one knee.” </span><span><br/></span><span>“No, no. Proposing is a man’s job!” Gabriel said, waving his hand as if to bat the comment out of the air.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Well there’s no hope for Rio then.” Lara jokingly said around her glass.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio noticed how uncomfortable Gabriela was getting after their conversation about this very thing the previous night and decided to shift the focus. “Sounds like </span><em><span>you </span></em><span>want to propose to Jason there, tío. Anything you want to tell us?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Gabriel screwed his face up and Jason joined in with the joke. “I’m a big diamond kinda guy Gabriel, just so you know. But you’ll have to wear the dress, I don’t have the hips.”</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Gabriel put his hands up to stop anyone else from adding on. “Okay I get it, I’ll stop asking!”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio looked towards Gabriela who mouthed, “thank you,” to her and the various threads of conversation picked back up again.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>After the main course and sides were done, Luis presented his desserts and then they reconvened in the living room to unwrap the presents. The majority of them were for Phoebe. Various new sets of clothes and toys and some things to store away for the teething stage.</span><span><br/></span><span>Monty also got some toys and a bandana printed with the Puerto Rican flag, which was immediately put around his neck.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio snapped a picture of him sitting proudly and set it as her lock screen.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The rest of the day passed with the same lazy energy. People splitting up into different rooms and wandering between them.</span><span><br/></span><span>Marcus and Lara helped with the clean up before they said their goodbyes and left to put Phoebe to bed.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio, Gabriela, Luna and Sofia went outside again to wind down but the conversation was kept light as they shared their joints and beers.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>People started to slowly trickle upstairs to bed and Jason and Gabriela turned the sofas into their beds again for the night.</span><span><br/></span><span>The house quieted and Rio checked her phone for the first time since that morning.</span><span><br/></span><span>There was a single message.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>Agatha: Merry Christmas, Rio</b></p><p align="center"><span>__________</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio waited until Marcus texted her to let her know that they’d gone and thanked her for letting them use her house before she drove home.</span><span><br/></span><span>It was early afternoon so she had a few hours to get ready to go out with her friends in the evening. </span><span><br/></span><span>She showered, changed her sheets and did some odd bits of cleaning around the house before she got dressed to meet her friends. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The restaurant was a half an hour walk from her house but she opted to do it so that she didn’t have to watch how much she was drinking with the meal, knowing that she would get carried away with the spirit and didn’t want to be an irresponsible driver.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>When she got there, Maddy and Kate were already seated and Maddy waved her over to their table. Rio gave both of them a hug and sat opposite Kate. </span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy placed a glass in front of her. “Jesse and Chloe are a few minutes away so I ordered a round.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “How do you know what I wanted to drink?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Because we’ve been friends since high school. We share a brain cell you moron.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio raised her glass and knocked it against Maddy’s before taking a sip and tasting the rum and coke as it hit her tongue. “Ahh, you know me so well.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Nice to hear you finally admit it.” Maddy smirked.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe and Jesse walked in and headed straight for the table, Chloe sat next to Rio and Jesse sat next to Kate, and they immediately took a sip of the drinks that were put in front of them.</span><span><br/></span><span>“How was everyone’s Christmas?” Jesse asked.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Kate is now officially my parents' favourite daughter.” Maddy said with fake annoyance.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I was just being nice!” Kate defended. “I wanted to show that I was grateful for them letting me join you for the day.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe’s eyes went wide. “Please don’t tell me you told her dad that his rancid eggnog was nice.” She said to Kate.</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate looked between them all. “What was I supposed to do? Tell the truth?”</span><span><br/></span><span>A unanimous response of “yes!” came from everyone’s mouths and then they all laughed.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy put her hand on Kate's shoulder. “I tried to warn her, but she didn’t listen.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Hold up,” Jesse said. “You guys </span><em><span>make</span></em><span> me drink it as some kinda sick initiation but Kate gets warned against it? How’s that fair?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe reached out to gently hold Jesse’s hand. “Life’s not fair, Jessekins. It’s one of the lessons we must learn.”</span><span><br/></span><span>He flipped her the bird and turned to Rio. “Tell us what we’re all dying to know. Who won the bet this time?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Who has two thumbs and sixty dollars?” She pointed both of her thumbs towards herself and leaned back in her chair. “This guy.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Hell yeah!” Maddy high fived Rio. “It’s about time Marcus lost.” Then she noticed the confused look on Kate’s face. “Rio’s uncle is slightly homophobic so her and her cousins make a bet every time the family is together on how long it’ll take him to say something homophobic.” She explained.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Kate’s brows dipped further. “Do you do this every time your family is together?”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Pretty much yeah.” Rio took a sip of her drink before continuing. “If it’s a multiple day event, like Christmas, we only do it on one day. And he’s gotten a lot less homophobic over the last couple of decades. He has some phrases and things that are his go-tos so we've had to ban a lot of them from being winners, but he always manages to come up with something.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate nodded, still confused but starting to accept it. “I guess if he’s gonna say it anyway, you might as well monetise it.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Exactly!”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe and Jesse told the group about their Christmases and they all ordered their food. </span><span><br/></span><span>They were at the restaurant for a few hours, having a general catch up and finding out more about Kate. She opened up a bit about her family, not giving too much detail but giving the group some basic knowledge. She told them that she moved to Virginia because she stopped talking to them but didn’t elaborate further than that and no one pushed for more information, all seemingly having the same thought of ‘she’ll tell us when she’s ready.’</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They split the bill evenly and left a healthy tip for the staff before all making their way to Maddy’s house. Rio took a detour to her own house to pick up the joints that she had rolled ahead of time along with the Secret Santa gift that she had bought, and met them all at Maddy’s.</span><span><br/></span><span>They attempted to make plans for new years and ended up leaving it as a pencilled in road trip to New York to watch the ball drop, but in reality they would probably end up doing exactly what they were currently doing and watching the ball drop on TV.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They exchanged their Secret Santa presents and none of them were serious. Rio unwrapped the one with her name on it. It was a Puerto Rican flag in the lesbian pride flag colours. “You could hang that off your balcony in England so that all of the queer women know where to go.” Jesse said.</span><span><br/></span><span>She draped it around her shoulders. “I think it works better as a cape. They can just follow me home then.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“I like your thinking, Vidal.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy went next and she opened an envelope to reveal a Lovehoney gift card with the message “Now you can actually go fuck yourself” typed onto the cardboard sleeve that the card came in. “Aww you guys.” She faked a crack in her voice and pretended to wipe tears from her eyes. “You know me so well!”</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate unwrapped her gift and pulled out a toy archery set with a surprisingly sturdy looking plastic bow, three arrows that had suckers on the end of them and a target to pin to the wall. “Now I can finally live my Olympic dreams! Thank you Santa.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe picked up the brown cardboard box that had her name written on it. “Damn, Santa couldn’t afford wrapping paper?” She asked to the room before opening it. She pulled a piece of paper and read what was on it. “Since you can’t drive a real car, I figured you could ride this to work.” </span><span><br/></span><span>“Oh fuck yeah! I can’t wait to take this baby for a spin on the interstate!" She said as she pulled out a toy car and a controller.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Jesse was the last to open his present. He chaotically ripped the paper and the gifts fell to the floor. He picked up the one closest to him and flipped it over. It was a grow your own girlfriend kit which made Rio nearly wet herself from laughing. “Whoever did this, I will pay for your drinks every time we go out!” She announced, hoping the culprit would reveal themselves but no one owned up to it, they were all too busy laughing as well.</span><span><br/></span><span>The second gift was a travel mug that said ‘Born To Slay, Forced To Work’ in pink cursive writing.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“I love when you guys listen to me when I talk.” He had told them not to buy him a travel mug as he had more of those than he did actual mugs at this point, so naturally it guaranteed that he’d get one. “I think I’ll grow my girlfriend in this mug, it can be her home.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“You can’t keep her cooped up in there, she needs space to roam!” Maddy laughed.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Yeah you need to be a responsible girlfriend owner.” Chloe added.</span><span><br/></span><span>He balled up two separate bits of wrapping paper and threw one at each of them.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>With the gifts now done, Rio passed out the joints. “I made these with love so you all better appreciate them.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate took the joint that Rio handed to her. “What does ‘made them with love’ mean?” She asked, slightly sceptical.</span><span><br/></span><span>“It means we’re about to get fucked.” Chloe said before flicking the lighter and sparking her joint.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy turned on the TV and hit play on Planet Earth for background noise as they smoked and chatted absolute shit.</span><span><br/></span><span>Chloe found some batteries for her toy car and started whizzing it around the living room, crashing into everything that was available.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio unfolded the target that came with Kate’s archery set and pinned it to a wall that wasn’t near anything breakable. “Okay Robin Hood, flex those archery muscles.” She said as she stepped out of the way. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Kate stood as reasonable of a distance from the target as she could given that they were in Maddy’s house and not a space specifically built for archery like she was used to.</span><span><br/></span><span>She tested the string on the bow a couple of times before knocking one of the arrows and drawing the bow. She took a slow breath and released the string.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio, her joint resting between her lips, watched the arrow fly towards the target and land perfectly in the middle. “Holy shit!”</span><span><br/></span><span>“I’m not done.” Kate simply stated as she knocked the second arrow and repeated the process. It landed just above the first one.</span><span><br/></span><span>She knocked the third and final arrow and sent it through the air to land just below the first one.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio just stood there for a moment, mouth open in awe while Kate removed the arrows from the target with a smug smile. “I told you I was good.” She said with a shrug. “Of course I’m used to specific bows and actual arrows, but the basic mechanics are the same.” She walked back to the spot that she had fired from. “Your turn.” She held out the bow and arrows to Rio.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio stepped up and swapped places with Kate, taking the bow and arrows from her and handing her the joint instead. “Prepare to be embarrassed.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio tried her best to mimic the stance that Kate had taken and to repeat the movements she’d seen her use, knocking the arrow, drawing it back and taking a slow breath. She loosed the arrow and it hit the target at an odd angle and fell to the floor.</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate tried to stifle her laughter. “You’re right, that was pretty embarrassing.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio picked up the second arrow. “I’m just warming up, give me a sec.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate crossed her arms and raised her eyebrows, but she didn’t say anything else.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio knocked the second arrow and drew the bow, taking a little longer to line the shot up before releasing it. The arrow went wide and hit the wall, it stuck this time though.</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate stepped forwards before Rio could knock the third arrow. “Okay, watching this is painful. Let me help you.” She moved behind Rio and told her to knock the arrow and lift the bow without drawing it.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio followed the instructions and waited for Kate to tell her what to do next. </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Kate gently covered Rio’s hands with her own, lifting the bow a little higher and then slowly pulling back on the string. “Obviously this is a very cheaply made toy, and the draw weight is practically non-existent, but this kind of tension on the string is what you’re aiming for.” She removed her hands from where they were covering Rio’s and said, “Don’t move.”</span><span><br/></span><span>She gently moved the arm that was pulling the string towards Rio’s cheek a bit more and tipped her elbow upwards just a touch.</span><span><br/></span><span>“When aiming you have to account for the drop. So you wanna aim just a bit higher than where you want to arrow to land.” She moved the arm holding the bow proper a little higher than where Rio was originally aiming it.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Kate dropped her hand from Rio’s again. “Take a nice, deep breath and when I say ‘release’ I want you to let both the breath and the arrow go.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio slowly breathed in through her nose, feeling her lungs inflate. </span><span><br/></span><span>She felt Kate lean in close behind her, her breath ticking the shell of her ear.</span><span><br/></span><span>In a whisper, Kate said, “Release.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio breathed out at the same time she let go of the arrow and watched it sail straight to the middle of the target and stick there.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Look at that. You’re a natural.” Kate was still behind her and speaking softly in her ear.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio turned her head to look over the shoulder where Kate was. “It helps to have a good teacher.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>They held each other’s gaze for a moment, neither moving until there was a loud cough from the living room behind them. They both turned towards the noise.</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy had a plume of smoke around her as she continued to cough. She absolutely could have been coughing because of the joint, but Rio suspected that she had been watching them and wanted them to break apart.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio stepped away and collected the arrows before handing them and the bow back to Kate. “I feel like you need a challenge.” She unpinned the target and moved it higher so that the middle was just above the top of her head and stood in front of it. “Let’s see how good your aim really is.”</span><span><br/></span><span>A smile slowly spread its way across Kate’s face. She nodded. “Okay.”</span><span><br/></span><span>She picked up the joint from where it had been resting in an ash tray and took a hit before knocking an arrow and drawing the bow.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio smirked. “Don’t miss.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“I never do.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>She released the arrow and it landed perfectly in the centre circle above Rio’s head. “Don’t move.” She said as Rio started to turn to look at the target, but upon the instruction, Rio turned back again.</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate knocked and fired the remaining two arrows and each one landed right next to Rio’s ears.</span><span><br/></span><span>Maybe she was just really high, but Rio felt a rush from Kate shooting the arrows at her. Obviously they wouldn’t do any damage if they hit her, but knowing that they </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> hit her made her stomach clench.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio didn’t move as Kate collected the arrows. Neither of them spoke but they maintained eye contact as Kate pulled them free from the target and then they returned to the living room.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Jessie turned towards them as they entered the room. “Damn it, I was hoping that Rio would have one of those arrows stuck to the middle of her forehead.” </span><span><br/></span><span>“It could still happen.” Kate said with a smirk as she sat next to Rio on the sofa.</span><span><br/></span><span>They all stayed there for another couple of hours, making sure the joints were as used as they could be before Chloe and Jesse said that they were going to head home.</span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy, Rio and Kate hugged them goodbye and told them to text when they were home.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Maddy asked Rio to help her clean up by taking the ends of the joints into the kitchen to throw away and put the ash trays in the sink for her to wash the next day. “If you’re too high to walk home, you can crash down here. But Rio I swear to god if I hear you in that spare room at any point so fucking help me.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio defensively held up her hands. “Okay, okay. You will not hear me in the spare room.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Good.” They walked back into the living room and Maddy announced that she was going to bed and shot Rio a look that said “behave”.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio saluted her before dropping back onto the couch next to Kate.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Are you staying over too?” Kate asked.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Nah, my house is only round the corner. I’ll walk back when I’m a little more sober.”</span><span><br/></span><span>“Well I’m not gonna leave you down here by yourself. What do you want to do?”</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio had a few answers to that question and all of them would piss Maddy off, which made them incredibly hard to resist. She looked into Kate’s eyes. “Whatever you want.”</span><span><br/></span><span>Kate grabbed the collar of Rio’s shirt and pulled her towards herself, crashing their lips together and immediately trying to sweep her tongue into Rio’s mouth, which Rio allowed.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Kate grabbed Rio’s waist and pulled her so that she was sitting in her lap, never breaking the kiss. Okay so maybe Kate’s archery muscles were more than just metaphorical.</span><span><br/></span><span>Rio felt Kate undoing her jeans and slowly sliding her hand beneath the waistband and had to fight to keep her volume down when Kate started slowly circling her clit through her boy shorts.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Rio always came harder when she was high and this time was no different. She had to bury her face in the back of the settee to dampen the noises that she made and the second time, Kate had to kiss her to keep her quiet.</span><span><br/></span><span>“Damn, I wish we could be somewhere where you didn’t have to be quiet so I could hear you properly.” Kate said in a hushed voice as she was slowing her movements to help Rio come down.</span><span><br/></span><span>“I know a great place to put my mouth where I won’t be heard.” Rio smirked as she started to slowly back her way off of Kate’s lap, pulling Kate’s pants down as she went.</span></p><p align="center"><span>__________</span></p><p align="justify"><span>Rio made her excuses to leave, which Kate accepted easier than Rio thought she would, and made her way home.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>The next few weeks were filled with spending more time with her family and friends.</span><span><br/></span><span>She did some work at the vineyard which her parents insisted on paying her for.</span><span><br/></span><span>She went out a few more times with her friends and ended up taking a couple of detours to Kate’s apartment on her way home.</span><span><br/></span><span>The weeks seemed to fly by and it wasn’t long before she was back at the airport waiting for her flight to England to start the new semester of university. </span></p>
