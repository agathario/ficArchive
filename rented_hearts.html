<div class="userstuff">
<p>It had happened all too quickly really.</p><p>Rio had received the email at precisely one minute past midnight last Thursday. Despite being technically “off the clock” - on no-client days, correspondence, research, and fielding happened strictly between the hours of 9am and 7pm - for some reason, some inexplicable movement of her thumb across her screen led her to reading the email.</p><p>
<em>
</em></p><p>
<em>Dear Miss Vidal,</em>
</p><p>
<em>
</em></p><p>
<em>I require your services.</em>
</p><p>
<em>
</em></p><p>
<em>If you feel you are up to the task, please find attached details of the flight out from JFK next Thursday at 9am, along with your ticket.</em>
</p><p>
<em>
</em></p><p>
<em>If, for whatever reason, you do not wish to acquire my business, feel free to disregard this email. Your empty seat will be enough answer.</em>
</p><em>
<p>As for payment: Half up front upon take off. The rest before landing on the return.</p>
<p>Yours,<br/>
2A</p>
</em>
<p></p><p>Blinking into the bright light of her phone screen, Rio had to read the email multiple times before she even understood it.</p><p>A potential client. A pre-booked flight. A mysterious sign off.</p><p>Spiralling, and briefly believing that instead of just two glasses of a full-bodied Shiraz, she’d somehow accidentally consumed her entire liquor cabinet, she put her phone aside.</p><p>What the fuck.</p><p>Clients were usually timid, unsure, overly explanatory as to why they were seeking her services. But this? This, whoever this was, was clearly some sort of psychopath. Or, in the very least, an egomaniac with a flare for the dramatic.</p><p>And dramatic wasn’t what Rio needed in her very neat, very quiet, very organised life.</p><p>But despite this, she found herself rolling into her side again, propping herself up on her elbows to stare dumbfounded at her phone.</p><p>And just when she thought she’d give herself a headache from the intensity of her stare she tapped out a response.</p><p>
<em>
</em></p><p>
<em>Dear 2A,</em>
</p><p>
<em>
</em></p><p>
<em>This isn’t how I conduct my business.</em>
</p><em>
<p>If you wish to enquire as to my availability, and my suitability for your request, please do give me a call. My number is in my signature.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.<br/>
Rio</p>
</em>
<p></p><p> </p><p>Her response to the mystery email went unanswered, unless you count a bounce back email a response, and Rio certainly didn’t.</p><p>When the word UNDELIVERABLE had flashed before her eyes at precisely 27 minutes past midnight she thought she was having a stroke.</p><p>The next day was dedicated entirely to research. Not the usual kind. Not the “do they have a criminal record” or “would they prefer me in a dress or slacks”, or even “how much do I need to know about Palaeontology to convince their ex we’ve been together a while”.</p><p>This research was instead like finding a needle in a haystack. Rio called the airline, she looked at some dubious sites to see if email addresses could be traced, and even tried to see if “2A” was a cypher and the email were in code.</p><p>All of this led to nothing, other than frustration and eventual resignation, and many more glasses of Shiraz.</p><p>But Rio was intrigued. Her life up until now, her business, was so controlled. So easy at this point. She had her pick of clients, her choice of endless wealthy women who needed a date for an important event, a pretty girl to hang onto at a yacht party, an experienced woman they could trust to teach them exactly why their husband couldn’t get them off (usually because it was two inches up and a couple centimetres to the left).</p><p>So she soon found herself sitting at gate 27A, wearing her best burgundy suit, matching red lipstick, and Prada loafers because everything was too easy. And this, as dramatic as it was, hell as SCARY as it was, was the first thing that had made Rio feel alive in months.</p><p>Boarding took almost no time at all, given her assigned seat at the front of the plane. But she was distracted the whole time, knowing that she didn’t know who 2A was but that 2A certainly knew her.</p><p>It wasn’t until Rio had made it to her seat, directed by an overly friendly, and far too young for her, stewardess that she realised just how stupid this plan was.</p><p>She had to work quickly if she wanted to get even a glimpse of an upper hand.</p><p>So she took her seat, accepted her champagne, and put on her most charming as a plan quickly formed in her bran. She smiled as her fingers brushed against the finger tips the pretty blonde smiling back at her with eyes like saucers.</p><p>“Thank you, sweetheart” Rio drawled in a low tone. She saw the throat of the woman bop before her and couldn’t help the twitch to her own lips, knowing she had read the woman’s over friendliness correctly.</p><p>“Would you mind telling me the name of the passenger in the seat just there?” She inclined her head slightly to the still empty adjoining booth to her left, but kept her eyes up on the young woman.</p><p>“You see, I’m a nervous flier and feeling like I know the people nearest me will really help,” her eyes flickered down and lingered for a second on the shiny badge perched on the navy uniform before flicking back up again, “Sarah”.</p><p>Knowing the flight staff would have made a point to know the names of every passenger in First, Rio had to pull out all the stops.</p><p>“I-I…” Brown eyes were now trailing slowly and purposefully along the lines of her uniform, and just as slowly making their way back up to a now blushing stewardess.</p><p>“A-Agatha. Agatha Harkness,” the blonde stuttered out.</p><p>Beaming in victory, Rio nodded her head once and briefly knocked her fingers against the woman’s. “Thank you so much. You’ve made me feel much safer.”</p><p>Just then, as if by magic, a disgruntled man behind Sarah nudged into her and startled the stewardess out of her reverie. Rio took the opportunity to sit back in her chair, celebrating her little win and only feeling a little guilty about the means by which she’d got the information from the poor stewardess. Still, one quick, overt flirtation and she’d just found out the name she’d been unable to uncover all week.</p><p>Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Agatha?” She muttered softly, briefly conjuring up images of a little old lady with a floral straw cap. But she didn’t have time to guess what this Agatha might look like. She had to get ahead before the flight was fully boarded and this Agatha was beside her before Rio could get so much as confirm a hair colour.</p><p>A rapid fire google and… bingo.</p><p>Agatha Harkness. High powered politico. Brunette. Hot. Hot. Hot.</p><p>Rio’s fingers spread again and again on pictures of the most beautiful woman she’d ever seen as she zoomed in and flicked through blurry conference shots, photo ops with Senators and billionaires, and the occasional charity opening. Each suit more flattering. Each glimpse of a piercing blue gaze more enticing. Each picture causing a faint flutter in Rio’s stomach.</p><p>But she didn’t have time to stare, she had to get to work. And fast.</p><p>Her eyes flicked up to survey the bustle around her and she realised to her horror that most people in the small First class cabin were settled. She didn’t have long.</p><p>If, that is, Agatha ever appeared to take her seat in 2A.</p><p>But it was minutes later, just as her fear of Agatha actually not turning up was becoming more and more real that she suddenly spotted her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was sauntering into the cabin as if she owned the plane. But Rio wanted her to know she’d spotted her, and knew exactly who she was.</p><p>She put her phone down, with all the facts she’d managed to find in the short amount of time now swirling in her brain, picked up her untouched glass of champagne and raised it to the subject of her week-long obsession.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Rio’s purr caused blue eyes to widen briefly before narrowing again almost instantly. Almost.</p><p>“I underestimated you.” Agatha responded as her eyes darted between Rio’s eyes, her smug grin, and down just a few inches, before settling back to meet her gaze.</p><p>Gotcha. Rio couldn’t help but do a little victory dance in her head as she quirked her glass in acknowledgement of the reluctant compliment sent her way.</p><p>But soon her smugness was taken over by something else something more dangerous. She was staring at Agatha, smirking up at her as the older woman stared down at her.</p><p>She was beginning to feel hot, though the plane was cool, and she’d barely touched her champagne. She licked her lips unconsciously, aware that the little images of Agatha on her screen had nothing on the real life version.</p><p>But Agatha stared back, which felt strange to Rio. Different. Sure, clients looked. Clients downright ogled her. But this? This felt more intense, more intimate. Which, admittedly, was a feat, as the stewards were beginning to corral the stragglers into their seats.</p><p>But just like that the spell was broken and a neat looking steward approached Agatha from the side with a polite, “Champagne, ma’am?”</p><p>Agatha moved to accept the champagne without a thank you, and Rio shot the attendant a quick smile, filling in Agatha’s unsaid words.</p><p>She seemed to notice this and sniffed lightly as she turned to sit in her seat, muttering a barely perceptible “thank you”, her head inclining slightly but not glancing at the man as he arranged her cubby then promptly hurried off to help a woman in the next row. Clearly Agatha didn’t like being even passively chastised and was unwilling to acknowledge that Rio has even clocked her bad behaviour and tried to correct it. Rio took a mental note of this.</p><p>Taking the chance to raise her glass again, pushing it forwards and in between the gap of their booths, she announced. “It’s not often I get anonymously hired, y’know.”</p><p>She pulled her glass back, lifted it to her lips and took a long slow sip as she studied Agatha’s profile - searching for any hint of embarrassment or explanation.</p><p>The older woman simply remained silent and brushed off nonexistent lint from her dark trousers.</p><p>“So.” Rio began again, “Agatha”, she emphasised the name, letting the syllables roll slowly off her tongue. “Why the mystery? Politicians and big donors look down on hiring escorts, huh? That’s not what I heard.”</p><p>This caught Agatha’s attention. Her head whipped around and she shot Rio a sharp look, raising her brow and studying her closely. Rio simply beamed across at her, silently thanking Stewardess Sarah for being oh so charmed.</p><p>“Could you keep your voice down? I was under the impression that you’re discreet. It’s the least you could be with the price you demand.”</p><p>Rio laughed gently and held out her free hand, moving her body as close as she could to the other woman, considering the barrier blocking their lower halves. “Speaking of…”</p><p>She wriggled her fingers expectantly at Agatha and raised her brows. Agatha shifted slightly, suddenly seeming for the first time, actually nervous.</p><p>She made a move to reach down into her bag but before she could Rio’s hand breached further into her cubby and landed gently on Agath’s wrist. The woman paused and looked down at the hand, having twitched as if to pull away but seemingly thinking better of it.</p><p>“No need,” Rio clarified, “wait until we get to where we’re going.” Tilting her head she gave Agatha’s wrist a gentle squeeze, allowing the pads of her ring and index fingers to gently brush the skin at the base of Agatha’s palm, above her shirt cuff. “I’m discreet. I’m the best. And I’m here. I’m playing your little game. But now’s the time to let me in a little. Am I here for you? Or have you hired me for the benefit of someone else?”</p><p>Rio kept her voice low, still leaning in as much as she could, and watched as Agatha’s eyes darted across her face. There was a slight frown on her brow and she moved her lower lip to be worried between her teeth as she listened intently to Rio’s words.</p><p>“You are the best,” Agatha breathed out eventually, “and so am I. It made sense to choose you but I wasn’t willing to risk exposing myself as a potential…” she shook her head and huffed out a reluctant “client… on the off chance you’d say no.”</p><p>Her hand came up to take long fingers through her hair and she took a large gulp of champagne. “You’re here for my friends. They… they worry I’m…” another shake of her head and a huff and Rio was beginning to wish American Airlines had a new seating policy because really a wall between two chairs when one housed this goddess suddenly seemed inhumane.</p><p>She wanted to force Agatha to look at her again. She wanted to reach over and… but she was a professional. She was the best. So she waited.</p><p>And Agatha, apparently done with her huffing, and definitely done with her champagne, stilled in her seat and rolled her shoulders back, clearing her throat one last time. “They worry I’ve been single too long. That’s it. You’re there for them.”</p><p>Her eyes suddenly flickered back to Rio’s and for the briefest second Rio thought she saw something close to vulnerability in them before Agatha’s tone suddenly became businesslike once more and she straightened up.</p><p>“You’re my girlfriend of six months. I’ve kept quiet about you because I wanted to see where it was going. That’s it. All you need to do is smile, look pretty, say nothing, and you’ll get your fee.” She paused and added, “I’m deducting the cost of your seat, by the way. I could have slung you in coach.”</p><p>“It’s a mystery why you’re still single,” Rio mused with a teasing grin. But she softened slightly as she watched Agatha shrink back once more into her chair. Her tongue moved to poke into the inside of her cheek as she considered Agatha’s words for a few seconds and she nodded. “Fine. Easy.”</p><p>She copied Agatha then and settled back in her own chair and reached for the remote to power on her mini television.</p><p>It took precisely ten seconds before Agatha was the one leaning into her space. “That’s it? No rules? No more questions? No… nothing?”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha briefly before turning back to her screen now showing movie options and shrugged gently. “Oh, I’m sure we’ll get to those. But if you’ll excuse me, technically I’ve paid for this seat, so I’ll be enjoying my inflight entertainment now.”</p>

<p>Twenty agonising minutes later, despite watching the best movie ever made (in Rio’s opinion), <em>Jurassic Park</em>, Rio could still hear Agatha’s gentle, rhythmic tapping on her arm rest.</p><p>Apparently the sight of Laura Dern’s long legs were not enough to distract her from the very distracting woman beside her.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t made an attempt to speak to Rio again through takeoff, apparently not in the mood to argue with someone technically now in her employ.</p><p>Throughout the years Rio had dealt with difficult clients; handsy ones, aggressive ones, overly attached ones, but she could already tell that Agatha was going to be the most difficult one of all.</p><p>But it was just as Rio was thinking about how long she was going to have to give Agatha the silent treatment that her peace was shattered.</p><p>“So,” Agatha announced as she leant across to get in Rio’s line of vision. Clearly done with the enforced silence Rio had placed upon them by watching a movie. A dinosaur one at that. Agatha blanched at the thought.</p><p>“You might not want to share <em>your</em> rules but I have some of my own.”</p><p>This captured Rio’s attention. She slowly removed her airplane-provided headphones and turned in her seat to stare aghast at Agatha.</p><p>“Rules?”</p><p>“Guidelines. Instructions. Whatever you want to call them.”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Rio said slowly as she adjusted her expression to something more akin to amusement. Agatha was staring back at her as if she were stupid. As if she didn’t understand how a client/escort relationship worked. As if Rio were a child. Which, Rio could admit, was maybe due to her movie choice.</p><p>“You need a life. A life as my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio muttered lowly and tilted her head to the side, “so how do you want me?” She winked across at Agatha and just as she was about shift in her seat and lean more into the other woman’s space she heard her name being called.</p><p>“Miss Vidal?”</p><p>The bright-eyed, eager stewardess from before was now standing beside her booth, holding a freshly popped bottle of champagne. “More champagne, ma’am?”</p><p>“Oh sweetheart, call me ‘ma’am’ again and you’ll upset me.”</p><p>The instant the stewardess giggled and blushed down at her Rio heard a rather obnoxious clearing of a throat behind her.</p><p>“But yes, please,” she continued as she held up her glass for the offered champagne. “Thank you so much.”</p><p>The noise of Agatha clearing her throat again told her that this woman did not share. And if Rio weren’t on the job right now, she’d have used this knowledge to her advantage. Flirted more, flirted harder.</p><p>She would have that this stewardess on her knees before her if she’d wanted. A nervous wreck for the sake of antagonising the woman in 2A.</p><p>But she’d already pushed it a bit far. So she bit the inside of her cheek and thanked the girl again as she finished the pour. Turning back to Agatha with a triumphant smile and raising her glass in toast she offered, “cheers!”, as if that would clear the air.</p><p>There would be time later to rile Agatha up. She needed to see how the other woman ticked first before she could properly push her boundaries.</p><p>Agatha simply stared back at Rio, ignoring her own glass being filled again by the other steward. She seemed to be weighing something up, something she clearly wasn’t ready or willing to say. But it gave Rio a chance to scrutinise Agatha’s face again. The sharp features, the slight pout of her lips as she watched Rio closely.</p><p>“Aries…”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she plowed on, “age up to you, only child, orphan…” she paused as she reached to take a sip of her newly filled glass.</p><p>“Landscaper, from some hick town up north but moved to the city after college,” she took another sip of champagne then held it aloft and caught the attention of the steward again for another top up. “Pick your own Ivy League. Except Brown.” She paused to turn back to Rio and took another sip of her champagne as Rio stared at her, a small smile playing on her face.</p><p>“Hobbies you can pick but nothing that would involve me and a paddle…”</p><p>“Well I could certainly think of a few things that involve you and a paddle,” Rio interrupted with a wink. This seemed to pause Agatha’s spiel and conjure up for Rio delicious images of Agatha on all fours, Agatha with a red mark across her…</p><p>Rio had to internally shake herself to focus back in on the conversation and just as she was regaining focus Agatha spoke again.</p><p>“Nothing else that would remotely embarrass me as an activity,” she concluded as if she’d never been interrupted in the first place.</p><p>But Rio had caught it. She’d seen a slight flicker in the other woman’s gaze that told her she was, in the very least, slightly affected by what she’d just said. Was it amusement? Embarrassment? Something else?</p><p>She didn’t let her thoughts dwell on it though as she threw herself into the quest for answers.</p><p>“Aries? Landscaper?” Rio was now practically hanging over the small wall between them. Her glass of champagne forgotten on the side as she leant closer to Agatha, her arms draped across the low barricade.</p><p>“Very specific. Usually I get full control over my back story. But… if you want control, you can have it.”</p><p>She smirked across at Agatha, shifting slightly to look up at her from under hooded lashes.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, Agatha’s control was almost impenetrable. Almost.</p><p>She barely acknowledged the interruption and shifted only slightly in her seat, swigging back the remainder of her champagne as she did.</p><p>When her glass was empty she placed it down slowly and considered it for a second before turning back to wide brown eyes staring back at her, boring into her.</p><p>“Do you have any questions?”</p><p>Rio thought for a second. She had many, many questions. And maybe it was the Veuve running through her veins, maybe it was the fact that there was an actual barrier between her and her employer, but she couldn’t bring herself to ask them. At least, not yet.</p><p>She instead swallowed down her questions and shook her head slowly. This seemed to cause Agatha’s whole body to relax. The older woman exhaled slowly and shuffled back a little in her chair, but not far enough so she couldn’t still see the face of the woman staring back at her.</p><p>“Okay,” she said cautiously, her tone the antithesis of her relaxed posture. Agatha was suspicious, Rio knew very little about this woman, but she could tell she didn’t trust easily. This alone would make Rio’s job a lot harder.</p><p>But piece by piece the form of Agatha Harkness was coming into view - the outlines of a woman, in the least.</p><p>“I’m yours,” Rio whispered in a soft and genuine promise. “For so long as you’ve paid me, I’m yours.”</p><p>“Your landscape gardener, Ivy League-educated girlfriend.” Her tone slipped into a more amused one as she smiled across at Agatha, searching for any signs that she might be on the verge of trusting her, or at least breaking into a smile. “This time is for you, I’m here for you. Okay?”</p><p>She reached out her right hand and held it in the space between them, keeping her fingers outstretched and hopeful.</p><p>She was pushing it, she knew that. There was no way this woman would willingly take her hand. But she did it anyway, if only to prove that she’d be waiting when Agatha was ready. If she ever were.</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze firmly on Rio’s and traced her tongue across her lower lip before she finally breathed, “okay.”</p><p>The rest of the flight was a quiet one. In fact, almost silent. Rio tried a few times to speak more with Agatha for the next hour or so but found that for some reason the woman in 2A had built a bigger wall between them than American Airlines had.</p><p>She ran through the conversation she’d had with her before the blue eyed politico had decided she’d had enough and found no real reason why she should have shut herself, or any real interaction with Rio, down.</p><p>After a while, Rio gave in. She focused back in on her little screen and continued to watch <em>Jurassic Park</em>, drowning her sorrows in the food and constant offers of champagne from infatuated Sarah the Stewardess.</p><p>The silence wasn’t uncomfortable. It wasn’t icy, or strange. It almost felt normal, actually. So Rio settled into it at first unwillingly, but soon calmly.</p><p>By the time the plane landed and everyone had moved to disembark, Rio found that she was far more interested in the physical being of Agatha Harkness than the strange combination of ice and softness that she’d found in her personality.</p><p>They went through the motions together, standing in considerably companionable silence for most of the time they queued for passport control.</p><p>At one point a harangued security official needed to push past the corralled line of passengers and Rio felt a hand gently press into the small of her back and a body follow suit.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers pressed then spread against the fabric  of her now slightly wrinkled black shirt - having slung her blazer over her bag after removing it somewhere between greeting Agatha and settling in for the best movie ever made.</p><p>Rio’s head turned to the side to see what Agatha wanted precisely when she felt her move into her. It was so brief, so tantalisingly fleeting that she could have written it off as not having happened at all. But Agatha had pressed into her. Her body pressing ever so gently up against Rio’s right side as her hand pushed her forwards and to the side.</p><p>If it weren’t for the look on Agatha’s face, she’d scarcely be sure it had even happened. But blue eyes were purposefully darting about the area as if looking for somewhere to escape. The only remnant of the sudden intimate interaction being the lingering scent of lavender and bergamot.</p><p>But time moved faster after that. Rio watched Agatha closely the whole time they moved through the airport together. She watched her barely acknowledge the staff, confidently stride through to baggage claim, and all the while constantly, almost obsessively shooting sideways glances at Rio.</p><p>It was only when they came to customs, walking slowly through behind a Floridian family visiting London for the first time: “We’re going to see the Big Ben!” that Agatha reached out to touch Rio for the second time that day.</p><p>Instead of the gentle, guiding touch she’d delivered earlier, it was a sudden and sharp movement. “Stop.”</p><p>Agatha turned sharply to Rio and looked at her as if she’d seen a ghost. But she didn’t leave the slightly taller woman hanging for long before she said with a sense of such urgency that Rio very briefly actually <em>did</em> wonder if she’d seen a ghost, “is kissing okay? Is it allowed?”</p><p>The question threw Rio so much that she stammered out a response that was so far from her usual professional persona that she shocked even herself, “I-I, yes, of course.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha breathed out harshly, but looked away as if she was considering something. “Because my friends are here.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, and, steeling herself back to professionalism despite a clanging cymbal going off in her brain about potentially kissing the absolute maniac before her, she said, “okay. That’s what we’re here for, right? <em>I’m</em> here for your friends.” She stepped a little closer to Agatha then and took the chance to gently press her hand to Agatha’s cheek, letting her fingertips rest at the top of her cheekbone and her palm curve around to cup her face in what she hoped, and usually found to be, a comforting hold. “I’m the best. Remember? It’ll be fine.”</p><p>Much to Rio’s surprise, blue eyes met brown and that strange mix of steel and ocean told Rio that she had a ways to go to get Agatha to trust her but it wasn’t a completely lost cause.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha breathed slowly, and pulled away after a second more of watching Rio. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio’s hand dropped as Agatha pulled away and found that her hand didn’t remain empty for long but instead was being tugged towards the exit, with lithe fingers making quick work of locking between her own.</p><p>Her job was as much physically being there for people as much as it was being a shoulder to cry on, or a warm body at night. But she read people well. Incredibly well, in fact.</p><p>It was how Rio was able to charm a room full of middle-aged, balding Republicans whilst simultaneously owning a battered laptop with weather-beaten stickers saying ‘Protect The Dolls’, ‘Plants Are People Too’, and the old classic ‘Fuck The Patriarchy’ splattered all over it.</p><p>So even as her body reacted to the simple gesture of having her hand held by another human - another devastatingly gorgeous human - she was able to tell something very important about the two women they were now walking towards.</p><p>Agatha was loved.</p><p>Agatha’s friends loved her.</p><p>One impossibly beautiful and beaming woman with flawless black skin and a shaved head let out a deep and true cackle of joy as she surveyed the sight before her, “Agatha Harkness be still my heart, you bagged yourself a hottie!”</p><p>The smaller Asian woman beside her with the best looking leather jacket Rio had ever seen simply shoved her hands deeper into her pockets and smiled between Agatha and Rio as they approached, “Jen couldn’t wait. We had to see it for ourselves to know that you hadn’t just picked up some random girl off the street and gave her a few bucks to be your girlfriend for the week.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s grip tighten slightly on her hand but she gave her a gentle squeeze and pulled her arm back and around her own body. It was a gesture of reassurance. Of, <em>‘they couldn’t possibly know. We’ve got this.’</em></p><p>But Agatha seemed to have other ideas. She tugged a little on Rio’s hand and turned their bodies together in one swift movement.</p><p>Then, as if they’d been doing it for hundreds of years, she reached her free hand up to tilt Rio’s face towards her and pressed their lips together.</p><p>It was instantaneous. The blankness of thoughts in Rio’s mind. The sheer vastness of nothing that occurred the minute Agatha’s lips pressed against hers.</p><p>Far be-it for her to judge the kissing technique of a client but she was only human and people had preferences. Turns out Rio’s preference was this. Agatha. Kissing Agatha.</p><p>The kiss was broken before Rio could memorise everything. The way their noses had brushed initially, the feel of Agatha’s warm breath, vaguely minty from the gum she’d been chewing in passport control, and the firm confidence of her hand snaking round to bury her fingers in Rio’s dark hair.</p><p>As it ended their noses brushed again and a gentle smile settled on Agatha’s lips as she turned to Alice. “Ye of little faith,” she said with all the smugness she suddenly felt with Rio against her.</p><p>Rio must have looked like a rabbit in the headlines just then because as Agatha turned to look at her smile faltered slightly before brightening again as she announced, “Darling, these are my friends. Alice and Jen.”</p><p>Rio found it unbelievably difficult to tear her gaze away from Agatha and only managed to do so because she had twice today promised to be the best. And so she had to be.</p><p>Kiss be damned.</p><p>“It was actually more than a few bucks,” she announced with a grin in Alice’s direction. “She bumped me to First Class too.”</p><p>Alice grinned at her and moved to kiss Agatha’s cheek swiftly before holding out a hand to Rio who took it readily and gave her a firm shake. “I think I’m going to like you,” Alice announced with a smirk and Jen moved up behind her to take Rio’s hand in turn, “Oh I already do.”</p><p>“But never do that shit in front of us again,” Jen snapped suddenly at Agatha who rolled her eyes in response. “Kissing your girlfriend in front of us. Nasty work.”</p><p>She tutted dramatically and turned to usher them all out of the terminal as Alice scoffed and moved to follow closely behind the taller woman.</p><p>Rio laughed with them as they made for the exit and fell back into step properly with Agatha who had  once again taken her hand.</p><p>As they walked through to Alice’s car waiting in a maze of taxis and other vehicles trying to leave the airport Agatha leant over to whisper in Rio’s ear, “One and done, had to sell it.”</p><p>Not responding for a second Rio took a breath before squeezing Agatha’s hand again and murmuring so quietly that even Agatha almost missed it: “I’m here for you, remember that.”</p>

<p>Much to Rio’s surprise, the next hour or so in the car with Alice, Jen, and Agatha, went by surprisingly quickly. Her car door had been opened for her by a still tense looking Agatha and Rio had felt the waves of stress radiating off of the woman as she’d pressed a quick kiss to her cheek with a whispered, “thank you.”</p><p>The lighter haired woman remained tense as they flew through the traffic towards Alice and Jen’s house in Tulse Hill, just south of Brixton.</p><p>As if making up for the feelings of the woman beside her, Rio was becoming more and more relaxed in the easy company of the two women in front.</p><p>Alice was an interesting mixture of snark and gentleness whilst Jen was every bit the self-possessed person Rio would have guessed Agatha would want to keep around (even with only the smallest amount of knowledge of the woman).</p><p>She soon found herself at ease with the dynamic in the car. Neither Jen nor Alice hesitated to jibe at Agatha, inciting little grunts or tuts from the woman to Rio’s right. But mostly the conversation was easy and sprinkled with anecdotes from the friends’ past together, Alice and Jen’s upcoming wedding, and how thrilled they both were that Agatha had found herself a woman.</p><p>Throughout the constant stream of conversation, Rio remained aware that Agatha had barely spoken, in fact she’d barely moved at all, other than the occasional flicker of her gaze from out of the window to Rio herself. Agatha’s steely gaze drifted against her will every now and then to settle on Rio as she was busy animatedly talking about the last time she was in London (also for work, a rich ex-housewife after a gnarly divorce looking for companionship) “oh yeah, it was after college, I came with some friends had the best time. Have never experienced a hangover like the day after we tried Guinness for the first time.”</p><p>Then there was the time she’d touched down in London again before flying over to Santorini for a wedding with a hotshot PR exec. “Oh we flew from Heathrow but it was literally a flying visit. The girls and I went for a long, relaxing week in Greece.” Though in reality the week had been far from relaxing as Rio found her client to be so horny and handsy that she’d barely been able to catch her breath all week. Still, worth it for the tan.</p><p>As Rio continued to amuse and charm the two in front they wound their way to the House of the soon to be Gulliver-Kales.</p><p>The house was three-stories, with large bay white shuttered windows and a neat little front garden against a Victorian tiled path to the pale blue front door.</p><p>The little mismatched foursome made their way out of the car after some questionable parallel parking done by Alice and guided by Rio and soon found themselves inside a warm and inviting entranceway that smelled like peonies. But Rio was barely able to focus on taking in the light wooden floors and richly painted walls as she was ushered further inside, with a gentle press on her lower back.</p><p>She didn’t need to turn to know that the hand belonged to Agatha, who, for the first time since leaving the airport was back to crowding Rio and pushing her to the side.</p><p>But the touch was as brief as their earlier kiss had been, and just like the kiss, left Rio yearning for more. As she mentally shook herself to behave like a professional she turned her head to see Agatha brush past her and head on up the stairs.</p><p>Blinking up at the ascending figure she was about to call for her when Jen interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>“Dinner,” Jen yelled, “don’t you dare make us late, Agatha Harkness. No naps, and no fucking before our rehearsal dinner. You have one hour!”</p><p>But Rio still hadn’t moved from where she was staring up at the place Agatha had just disappeared to and it was Alice who spoke next, “She always gets grumpy after a long flight.”</p><p>“<em>Extra</em> grumpy,” she corrected herself.</p><p>Rio let out a small laugh and turned back to the two women now looking expectantly at her, and hazarded a guess as to what they could be waiting for, “I suppose I better fetch her Royal Highness’ bag.”</p><p>This seemed to be the right take on the situation as Alice clapped her gently on the back and ushered her back outside with her to do just that. “Yeah, best keep on her good side for now. She’s kept her cards close to her chest about you but it’s clear she likes you.”</p><p>Rio only smiled in response and helped Alice to fetch the two suitcases and two handbags from inside the small car, heaving Agatha’s out with a soft grunt onto first of the steps.</p><p>The two managed to heave all the bags up to the second landing, arriving at what must be the attic room, and Rio and Agatha’s space for the remainder of their stay. Alice left Rio to it with a look of amusement and a pat to the arm before slouching back down the stairs to her fiancé.</p><p>Taking a slow intake of breath Rio pushed open the door.</p><p>In her line of work Rio had had to get quickly used to the intimacy of sharing space, sharing a bed, with people. It was sometimes easier than others, but she found that if she treated every second with her client as “on the job” she could quite quickly push her feelings down and get on with it. After all, she was being paid to share these things with people.</p><p>But as she stepped into the room for the first time and dragged the two cases along behind her she felt a sudden rush of nerves.</p><p>The cause of these nerves was now pacing back and forth between the large bed in the centre of the room and a door which must have led to a separate bathroom.</p><p>The pacing paused briefly so Agatha’s gaze could lift and survey the intruder for a second. Clearly deciding the coast was clear and she wouldn’t be overheard she announced, “this was a huge mistake.”</p><p>The air rang with tension, with the most earnest set of blue eyes staring back at her, Rio closed the door, trapping them both in the now silent room.</p><p>But Rio didn’t respond immediately.</p><p>She paused, took a breath, and matched Agatha’s unfaltering gaze with a measured look of her own.</p><p>“It’s going to be okay,” she started softly, keeping her voice low as if worried Agatha might flee at the slightest noice. Like a rabid dog.</p><p>When Agatha didn’t say anything but turned her gaze away, Rio slowly moved around the bed and removed her blazer. She rolled her up flight-crinkled black sleeves and settled down on the edge of the bed, looking up at Agatha.</p><p>“The worst part is over. It’s now just a few more days of niceties, polite conversations, and…”</p><p>“And what?”</p><p>Agatha whirled around so suddenly and violently that Rio almost winced, bracing herself for the harlequin spinning before her to flatten her in the haste to glare down at Rio.</p><p>“And what?” Agatha sneered when Rio didn’t respond immediately. “I didn’t even change your name. Someone could easily find you and this could… God, In a week’s time we fly home and in all the wedding photos is me and some… some…”</p><p>Agatha gestured widely, searching for the right word, the one to adequately capture her feelings.</p><p>“Escort?” Rio added calmly, settling back as she rested her hands behind her on the bed and leant back, “Prostitute?” She tried again, no judgement in her tone, “Sex worker? Whore?”</p><p>Agatha groaned and threw her hands in the air, turning again from Rio, “Well!”</p><p>She sighed and whipped back around, “Yes, <em>that</em>. <em>Those.</em>.”</p><p>Blue pools stared down into brown and seemed to soften slightly beneath Rio’s steady gaze as Agatha’s chest heaved with the frustration and emotion she couldn’t let fully spill over for fear there would be no stopping it once the dam was broken.</p><p>Her brow tensed, and she opened her mouth as if to say something, to take it back, but she stopped herself and went silent again.</p><p>But Rio gave her an out.</p><p>“None taken,” Rio said with a smile tugging at her lips. But she couldn’t deny the slight pang in her chest at the sting of those words - though she’d given them willingly. Loaded the gun and fired it before she’d even placed it in Agatha’s hands.</p><p>Agatha’s pacing continued just then, having decided that neither an apology nor doubling down on her earlier words would make the slightest difference.</p><p>Rio continued to watch her from her position on the bed for a while, taking in the way Agatha’s whole body vibrated with whatever she was struggling to vocalise.</p><p>It was rare that a client of hers referred to what she was, to her profession. They usually liked to pretend that wasn’t the case. That Rio was some girl they’d picked up in a bar, some attractive girl they’d matched with online.</p><p>And Rio had no shame in what she did. She provided a service. And people were willing to pay for that service. It was transactional.</p><p>And she knew she was lucky she felt safe almost all the time when at work. She knew that wasn’t the case of a lot of women in her profession and she never took that for granted.</p><p>But still, seeing Agatha use those words, even knowing she’d set her up for them, stung.</p><p>But as minutes passed and Agatha continued to pace she found her mind and her eyes wandering.</p><p>Her gaze moved indulgently over the curve of her back, the length of her legs, the roundness of her ass.</p><p>It was as she was making this visual map of Agatha that the other woman stopped, and turned. “I just don’t want to have to explain another failed relationship.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze shifted up quickly, taking in Agatha’s expression and where she was expecting a softening to the woman she saw a far off stare, somewhere behind Rio, over her shoulder, in another world.</p><p>“We can work something out. You can call me whenever anyone’s in town or we can take photos and send them when…”</p><p>“Enough.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out suddenly, slashing her hands down before Rio as if she was a fly she needed to swot. “Let’s just. Just get me through this week.”</p><p>“They like you. God, Alice was practically drooling over you and she’s about to get <em>married</em>.”</p><p>Rio smirked a little at this, sticking her tongue in her cheek as she sat up a little and straightened her posture, “You know I’m <em>supposed</em> to be good at charming people. Besides, I like Alice. Jen’s…” she searched a second for the right word before settling on, “interesting.”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a look of ‘I know exactly what you mean by that but let’s drop it for now’ before she rolled back her shoulders and shook out her mane of long hair. “Well, best be charm personified tonight because you’ll be bombarded with new people… and all of them not as easy as Alice.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and pushed herself up from the bed, moving to place both her hands on Agatha’s biceps and give them a gentle squeeze, “I got it. I’ve been thrown to the lions more than once in this line of work.”</p><p>Up close it was clear how stressed Agatha truly was. Her brows were furrowed ever so slightly and she was pursing her lips as she watched Rio grin across at her, “I’m sorry for calling you a whore.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught slightly as Agatha leant in, hesitating ever so briefly before placing a kiss to Rio’s cheek.</p><p>It was barely there. Agatha’s lips ghosting across Rio’s cheek for the briefest of seconds before she pulled out of Rio’s hold entirely.</p><p>The contradiction that was Agatha Harkness then strode across the room, rummaging for a few seconds for her toiletry bag before muttering about cleaning the goddamn dirt from the goddamn plane off of her in the shower.</p><p>And Rio took a seat back on the bed. And Rio closed her eyes as the shower turned on. And Rio wondered why she’d ever turned up at the airport in the first place.</p><p>——</p><p>Precisely an hour and a half later.</p><p>Precisely a half hour later than Jen had decreed.</p><p>Precisely ten minutes after Jen had practically hauled Agatha out of the house by her hair, the four women were squashed into a cab on their way to the bougie loft-adjacent restaurant booked out for the rehearsal dinner.</p><p>“What are we rehearsing?” Agatha had huffed as she squeezed in next to Rio in the left-most back seat of the Toyota Hybrid masquerading as a vehicle fit for transporting more than three adult-sized people. “Everyone knows how to eat. Everyone knows what happens at a we-“</p><p>“Rio,” Jen interrupted from her luxurious, practically palatial position in the front passenger seat, “can you tell your woman that if she doesn’t want to come then she doesn’t fucking have to.”</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>Rio scoffed softly and as Agatha made a move to get back out of the car - whether or not she was bluffing Rio wasn’t sure - Rio placed a hand quickly over Agatha’s and held it firmly in her own. “Oh, she’ll calm down once she has a glass of champagne.”</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to scoff this time but she settled, shuffling slightly to get comfortable and rubbing shoulders with Rio who was pressed against her right side.</p><p>Alice leant forward, as much as she could (being pressed between Rio’s other side and the car) and gave directions to the unamused driver who grunted his understanding.</p><p>“Charmed,” Jen muttered softly and earned a light jab on the shoulder before Alice sat back down.</p><p>The journey to the restaurant was mostly quiet after that, with Rio making easy small talk with Alice, asking her about the area, the house, and what plans she had to work on the little garden Rio had been eyeing out the back.</p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, was purposefully staring out the window, the long hot shower she’d taken (having been so long that Rio had only two minutes to shower, do her makeup, and rush out the door because of Agatha’s slowness), hadn’t done much to calm her down.</p><p>But her body was less tense. Less rigid.</p><p>Rio’s fingers were still settled over hers, and Agatha had done nothing to pull her hand back. Though Rio’s other hand now snaked its way in, idly toying with Agatha’s fingers as she moved to settle it on her thigh.</p><p>Their arms now entwined in the seat, with Rio’s shoulder having slipped back slightly to be beneath Agatha’s, they say more comfortably together, Rio’s body almost coiling around Agatha’s in the tight space. She pressed her thigh firmly towards Agatha’s, hoping she could take a little comfort from her presence - letting her know that although her attention was on Alice, she was still there for Agatha.</p><p>Agatha pressed her thigh back.</p><p>But almost as soon as they’d settled, they were moving again.</p><p>Agatha stepped out first, but helped Rio gently out the car, and pressed the door closed behind them. Their hands remained together as Agatha gave Rio one last once over, having already admired her outfit before Jen so rudely yanked her from the house.</p><p>“Suitable?” Rio dared ask, though she knew approval when she saw it.</p><p>Rio had opted for a velvet black dress with long sleeves and a slit exposing her chest, with just the slightest hint of her breasts. It was sexy, yet understated. And a weapon of choice whenever meeting new people, or trying to impress for a client.</p><p>“Suitable.” Agatha responded, her gaze lingering for the second time that day exactly where Rio wanted her gaze to linger.</p><p>Breaking the moment she leant up to murmur against Agatha’s ear, “if you hadn’t been so long in the shower you could have helped me pick. But I thought you’d like this one.”</p><p>She let her lips hover by Agatha’s ear for just a breath longer before she pulled back again to capture the look on the brunette’s face.</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>Agatha was staring at Rio with unadulterated lust. Her lips parted. Her eyes hooded.</p><p>But then, Jen’s hand reached between them again and broke their own hold on each other.</p><p>“Umm!”</p><p>Alice’s apologetic look at Agatha was lost as Jen huffed and locked arms with her fiancé to march her towards the door.</p><p>“Enough eye fucking and please come inside.”</p><p>Rio had to bite down in her lip to stop herself from laughing and reached back out for Agatha’s fingers, noting the woman had taken a step away from her.</p><p>She wriggled her digits teasingly at her as she said, “Shall we?”</p><p>But Agatha barely glanced at her as she captured her hand again and lightly tugged on it as she stepped after Jen and Alice.</p><p>It wasn’t long before they were being ushered up some stairs that wouldn’t have looked out of place in Rio’s beloved Manhattan and into a loft space riddled with twinkling fairy lights, large oak tables covered in pristine floral settings, and at least a dozen waiters doing their best impressions of penguins as they served their guests with Moët.</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised by the opulence on display before her. Not because she thought Alice and Jen were poor, she’d been in their fancy house for godsake, but because she’d thought this would be more intimate, just a few friends having dinner and toasting the brides to be.</p><p>How wrong she was.</p><p>It took seconds for her attention to be pulled away from the scene around her and back to Agatha as she was pulled in close to the other woman’s side.</p><p>Her hand was suddenly empty, but Agatha’s arm was now around her waist and she had been positioned just in front of the other woman.</p><p>“The lion’s den,” Agatha muttered softly, her head dipping dangerously close to Rio’s pulse point as she made a move to faux-nuzzle her faux-girlfriend, “mostly hangers on to Jen’s company. Her <em>empire</em>,” she continued, not unkindly.</p><p>Rio’s brow quirked as she spotted a group of what looked to be influencers milling around by one of the lavish floral arrangements taking selfies.</p><p>She hummed in acknowledgement and let her eyes scan back around the room only to land on a waiter skirting close to offer a tray of champagne.</p><p>“Thank you,” she took two glasses and turned slightly in Agatha’s hold to offer her up one, beaming over her shoulder. “People are watching us, you know.”</p><p>Agatha had moved her head and only then did Rio see that Agatha still looked tense. It wasn’t the crazed, pacing Agatha from an hour before in their bedroom, but a watchful, tightly wound Agatha who as much as she was putting on a show of nuzzling Rio, the escort suddenly realised that Agatha had actually been <em>hiding</em> behind her.</p><p>“What is it?” She asked cautiously as she turned her body fully in Agatha’s hold, still clutching two glasses and pressing one against the navy blue fabric of Agatha’s dress.</p><p>“Tell me, and I can help,” she promised quietly as she pressed herself closer, watching Agatha break eye contact only to take her glass.</p><p>There was a pause, a beat as Agatha seemed to frown down into the bubbles before her and Rio took the opportunity to press her nose into Agatha’s hair, letting her free arm snake around the other woman’s shoulders and her fingers find purchase in the soft hairs at the back of her neck.</p><p>“People usually want to show me off a little, y’know.”</p><p>The comment was light, flirty, and Rio hoped teasing enough to pull Agatha out of her stupor.</p><p>But as she pulled back to face her client she bumped noses with her instead. Agatha had turned more into her, pulling her oh-so close as to make Rio’s breath hitch.</p><p>They each pressed their faces a little closer and Rio could feel Agatha’s warm breath against her red lips as she desperately hoped the other woman would close the distance.</p><p>But Agatha shifted slightly, and nuzzled against Rio for a second, nudging their noses together in an act that felt far too intimate to be for show, before she gave her hip a light squeeze and pulled away.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>The blue eyes that remained settled on Rio’s darted suddenly to look for the culprit of the shout and looked panicked for a second before Agatha’s face for the first time in hours settled into a warm, genuine smile.</p><p>“Lilia.”</p><p>Rio turned just in time to see a shorter woman with curly grey hair and the most intricately decorated shawl she’d ever seen envelope the woman beside her in a tight hug.</p><p>Agatha returned the hug, perhaps not so readily, but at least without complaint.</p><p>“And just where have you been?! I’ve been fighting my way through children taking photos of themselves and generally causing a…”</p><p>But Lilia’s diatribe died on her lips as she caught Agatha’s drifting concentration and followed the younger woman’s gaze across to Rio.</p><p>“But, ahh…” The older woman turned smoothly to Rio and held open her arms, “my dear, I’m afraid she’s kept you from us.”</p><p>Rio hazarded a guess that “us” meant Lilia, Jen, and Alice, though she couldn’t be sure. But she thought she had seen a picture of this woman flanked by both Alice and Jen in their attic bedroom when she’d been in her fiftieth  minute of pretending a 50-minute-long shower was normal.</p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha interjected smoothly, stepping beside Rio again and suddenly the top political fixer that she was in her professional life, “This is Rio. And Rio, my good friend Lilia.”</p><p>The grey haired woman surveyed Rio closely and narrowed her gaze as she took her all in. Rio gave her the toothiest of grins and held out a hand just as a familiar hand settled in the small of her back. “Pleasure. And I’m beginning to think it’s <em>you</em> she’s kept from me.”</p><p>Lilia didn’t say anything and continued to monitor Rio closely as if she were some kind of experiment, or a crystal ball she was looking into to divine the future.</p><p>But Rio, undeterred, plowed on, “I already love Alice and I’m sure I’m growing on Jen.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly and tapped her fingers lightly against Rio’s back as if to shift some nervous energy away. “Lilia, please stop looking at my girlfriend as if…”</p><p>But Lilia suddenly held a hand up and Agatha just huffed and took a sip of champagne.</p><p>“Agatha, why don’t you leave myself and lovely Rio here to get acquainted. I’m sure there are other people here eager to hear your great wit and tales of the Capital.”</p><p>Rio’s brows shot up and she turned to look at Agatha but gave her no room to argument as she placed a kiss to her cheek and whispered, “Disappear, mi vida. Te veo.”</p><p>Agatha blinked across at Rio, taking a second to gather herself before she moved back over to Lilia and in a stage whisper so Rio could hear she leant in and said, “No embarrassing stories. No scaring her off. I know where you live, Calderu.”</p><p>Rio laughed and caught Agatha’s eye with as the woman in navy flashed her a tight smile then sauntered off into the crowd.</p><p>No sooner was Rio’s attention back on Lilia’s than Lilia’s was back on Rio.</p><p>The shorter woman continued to watch her closely, having not looked away even when Agatha had given her warning.</p><p>“Tell me about yourself.”</p><p>It was an instruction, a pointed request.</p><p>And so Rio obliged. She cleared her throat softly and took a sip of champagne before starting, “Well, I’m a landscaper, or gardener, whichever term you prefer. I work mostly around the city, but sometimes travel if I have to…”</p><p>She continued talking, though suddenly began to think that Lilia wasn’t actually listening. She was still looking Rio up and down with a slightly vacant look on her face.</p><p>“I, uh, live in New York, I’ve been there since college. I’m 36, I’m an Aries…”</p><p>It was then it happened.</p><p>Lilia’s gaze, sharp and calculating all of a sudden snapped up to Rio’s and she held up her hands, “There!”</p><p>Rio blinked across at the woman in confusion and looked up just in time to see a frightened looking Agatha staring over at them from where she stood in amongst a gaggle of Jen and Alice’s friends.</p><p>Just as Agatha began to push through towards where Rio and Lilia were standing Rio’s attention was drawn back to Lilia once more as the older woman stepped into her space and tilted her head to the side, watching for a reaction.</p><p>Her next words were softer than before, not unkind, as she said, “I think we both know that’s not true now, don’t we, dear?”</p>

<em> “There!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio blinked across at the woman in confusion and looked up just in time to see a frightened looking Agatha staring over at them from where she stood in amongst a gaggle of Jen and Alice’s friends.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just as Agatha began to push through towards where Rio and Lilia were standing Rio’s attention was drawn back to Lilia once more as the older woman stepped into her space and tilted her head to the side, watching for a reaction.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her next words were softer than before, not unkind, as she said, “I think we both know that’s not true now, don’t we, dear?” </em>
</p><p>As Rio’s gaze settled in on Lilia she opened her mouth to respond and realised that she was so taken aback by what had just happened that her mind went blank.</p><p>What <em>had</em> just happened?</p><p>Why was this woman so excited about a star sign? Then so convinced Rio was lying?</p><p>Rio was an excellent liar. At least, in her professional life.</p><p>Yes, high-powered, exclusive, glamourous escort to the rich (and sometimes famous) Rio could easily make up something on the spot. Usually.</p><p>But something about the old woman’s triumphant smile and the look she’d seen in Agatha’s face held her breath in her throat and her mind in a stupor.</p><p>“Lilia,” said a sudden breathless Agatha as she arrived at the two women now standing so close Rio could feel the warm breath of the grey-haired woman in front of her.</p><p>“Are you interrogating my girlfriend you old…”</p><p>“Why is she lying about her sun sign?” Lilia interrupted smoothly, not taking her gaze away from Rio, who equally was now refusing to look away.</p><p>Agatha made a noise that sounded like a mixture of exasperation and choking. But she reached between them all the same and pulled Rio back from the stand-off she found herself in with Lilia.</p><p>“<em>I</em> told her to lie. I did some research, I wanted…” but she trailed off and shook her hair back as if throwing away the rest of the sentence.</p><p>“You thought you’d pick a sign that I’d approve of. That would match your own? A love match. The two lovers.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze left Lilia’s for the first time since Agatha had arrived and she looked around to see Agatha’s response to this. She was met with pursed lips and a defiant glare aimed at the older woman.</p><p>“Look, I wanted you off our backs for the week so if she matched me,” she paused and threw up her hands dramatically into making quotation marks in the air, “<em>astrologically</em> you’d think she were fine and leave us alone.”</p><p>Agatha’s tone was sharp, dismissive with a drop of cruelty that made Rio’s brow quirk up slightly. Lilia seemed to either not notice or be so used to this sort of response that she simply rolled her shoulders back and said, “So what is it? Her sign?”</p><p>The question was directed at Agatha but Rio stepped in so quickly that she didn’t give Agatha a chance to either guess or lie. “Aquarius.”</p><p>Grateful for having at least some power back in the conversation Rio added, “I don’t know much about star signs so I’m hoping that’s still an okay match?” She smiled hopefully across at Lilia who was once again studying her closely.</p><p>The old woman’s face broke out into a conspiratorial grin then as she nodded, almost as if she’d known all along what Rio was going to say.</p><p><em>Spooky bitch</em>, Rio thought.</p><p>“Eccentric, friendly, creative, but stubborn, independent, a walking contradiction.”</p><p>Her eyes once again scanned over Rio and just as she was about to begin feeling as if she were on the back foot, Lilia spoke again.</p><p>“An excellent match. Which makes me wonder why you even lied in the first place.”</p><p>Agatha shifted and placed a hand on Rio’s waist to begin steering her away, clearly done with the conversation and less than happy with being caught out. “That’s enough kook for one evening.”</p><p>Her tone was clipped again, curt and clear as she put pressure on Rio’s side and moved her away. Rio glanced back at Lilia with a cautious smile that Lilia returned, eyes twinkling mischievously as she watched the two retreat into the crowds.</p><p>Mentally shaking off the idea that she’d just been character assassinated by a mad old woman in a large shawl, Rio focused instead on the task at hand.</p><p>Reassure Agatha. Impress the friends.</p><p>They moved in silence for a few steps until they hit the bar and Agatha dropped her hold, looking down at the polished wood surface, “you want another drink?”</p><p>Rio turned herself so she could lean back against the bar and held up her champagne flute. “Still working on this one.”</p><p>“God I’m on my third,” Agatha muttered as she held a hand up to signal the bar staff, “Need another ten to get through this.”</p><p>Rio turned to study Agatha’s profile and though it was on the tip of her tongue to ask about what had just happened between Agatha and her friend she stopped herself and instead offered a trick of the trade. “It’s called magic drinking. Three. Three drinks. Gives you a good buzz, makes it look like you’re involved, enjoying yourself, but never lets you get… <em>unprofessional</em>. Sloppy,” she clarified as she took a small sip of her champagne.</p><p>Agatha shot her a look and then glanced around them as if to check for eavesdroppers. “Right.”</p><p>They fell back into a tense silence then as Agatha ordered a double whisky. Rio’s eyes scanned the room, noting that people were glancing over, and not being so subtle about it. She smiled at those who dared to make eye contact and soon turned back to Agatha, intent to grab her attention and revert back to the doting girlfriend.</p><p>But she found the woman who’d hired her to do just that was already looking at her with a curious expression on her face.</p><p>“What? Is there something on my face?”</p><p>Rio beamed across at Agatha and briefly went cross-eyed as if to check her own nose. Agatha did not laugh.</p><p>She instead took a long, slow sip of her drink and dropped her gaze to the bar again, turning away from Rio.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, and ran a hand through her hair, tousling it before she placed her glass on the bar and moved to drape an arm across Agatha’s waist, moving into her side. Agatha tensed briefly then remembered where she was and visibly relaxed under Rio’s touch. Rio’s fingers twitched against her side and then began to rub small circles as she whispered, “You could at least pretend you enjoy my company. Most people do.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out in response, turning to lean her side against the bar and donning her mask again as she looked across at Rio, “it’s a good thing you’re pretty.”</p><p>Rio’s soft smile turned into a genuine guffaw and even the corner of Agatha’s lips twitched slightly at the corners. “The compliments keep coming with you, don’t they?” Agatha hummed and slinked a little closer to Rio as she took another sip of her whiskey, the glass now dangerously close to empty.</p><p>Her blue eyes had lost a little of their steel as they swept across the crowded room, whether from the alcohol or because she was relaxing, Rio didn’t know. But Agatha was now noticing what the younger woman had spotted a few minutes ago: everyone was looking at them.</p><p>Inhaling steadily through her nose before knocking back the rest of her drink Agatha leant around Rio to order another and Rio whispered, “be careful with those.”</p><p>Agatha just scoffed and looked back at her, “I’m not…” but before she could finish her sentence a long clapping started from somewhere amongst the throng of party goers and both their attentions turned to the source of the noise.</p><p>“Ladies, gentlemen, and everything in between!”</p><p>There was a light titter of laughter that flitted across the room, and a couple booming shouts of agreement as the beaming and gesticulating Jen as she stood on a chair and addressed the place. Rio couldn’t help but see how this woman had created an empire around her.</p><p>“Dinner is about to be served! Please do pay attention to the name cards on the table! Alice and I thought it would be fun to mix things up so everyone can make new friends!”</p><p>But as Jen continued on chatting about how important it was to her and Alice both that everyone left tonight feeling as if they knew everyone else intimately Rio was distracted by a harsh mumble from the woman just behind her.</p><p>“I’m going to <em>kill</em> her. Insane. Absolutely batshit.”</p><p>Glancing back and reaching to brush her fingers gently over Agatha’s now crossed arms Rio murmured, “It’s okay. I’ll catch you after dinner.”</p><p>She leant up to press a quick kiss to Agatha’s cheek and as the swarm of people around them moved she hurried off to find her place.</p><p>Turns out that she didn’t have to look very far at all.</p><p>The U-shaped table fit for 50-60 people was positioned so that the bottom left leg was close to the bar, and that is where Rio found her name staring back at her.</p><p>She was the first in her section to sit and so she took the opportunity to look around her once again, her gaze drifting to the names of the people either side of her.</p><p>
<em>William Kaplan.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Wanda Maximoff.</em>
</p><p>It didn’t take long for the former to bounce towards his seat, claiming it with something of a theatrical flourish and an eager grin, “I spotted you earlier. Agatha’s girlfriend? I’m Billy, I used to work for Agatha but then Jen needed me so I joined her company instead. Agatha was really encouraging and I still consider her somewhat of a mentor so I know she’s not pissed or anything.”</p><p>He trailed off with a somewhat hopeful look at Rio, beseeching her to confirm his statement.</p><p>Rio couldn’t imagine a world where Agatha would be a mentor to this chatty boy but smiled kindly and gave both him and Agatha the benefit of the doubt as she said, “I’m sure she’s not.”</p><p>“Phew!” Billy breathed out with a grin, “I did try to catch her earlier but she mustn’t have heard me. I’m sure she’s just busy catching up with everyone. It’s been ages since she’s been to London so maybe she’s…” but something behind Rio caught his attention and he stopped mid sentence to gawk at the figure who’d just arrived behind Rio.</p><p>“Wanda!”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned curiously to the woman behind her as she took the seat beside Rio.</p><p>She didn’t know what she was expecting but she was curious as to why Billy had frozen at the sight of this woman.</p><p>Rio turned to see a beautiful red head smiling across from her with a slight wrinkle in her nose from where she was apparently holding back a laugh, though Rio didn’t know why.</p><p>All the same she held her hand out with a smile, “Rio, pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>Green eyes stared back at her and flickered across Rio’s face, as if searching for something unnameable. “I know who you are.”</p><p>Her response was warm, though Rio couldn’t help but notice the slight smirk on the red head’s face as she took her hand and gave it a squeeze instead of a shake. “Agatha’s new girl. I’m Agatha’s old girl. Ex-wife, to be exact.”</p><p>Something deep inside Rio, something she’d noticed the very first second she’d seen Agatha from across the aisle of the plane, something that had threatened to reel its head when she’d first kissed her, when she’d buried her face against her neck, when she’d so much as looked at her for longer than strictly necessary, began to growl. It wasn’t exactly what she’d felt before, this feeling in the pit of her stomach, it was more unsettling, angrier, much less acceptable than a few butterflies caused by the blue eyes of a client.</p><p><em>Jealousy</em>.</p><p>Realising she’d not spoken for at least two seconds two long and that her hand was still being held by the other woman Rio plastered on a bright smile and lied through her teeth.</p><p>“Of course. I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>“Really? Don’t believe everything you hear,” Wanda smiled back and gave Rio’s hand another squeeze before she dropped it and continued, “You’re pretty. No wonder you’re the first girlfriend she’s brought to the table. You’re a knockout.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes were travelling the length of Rio, or what was visible above the table anyway, and her body was positioned just so that her knee had gently brushed Rio’s as she moved. Her hands were now resting down between them on the edge of Wanda’s chair and dangerously close to Rio’s thigh.</p><p>The woman was flirting with her, testing the waters. And Rio felt a wave of indignation rise in her, but she kept her cool and simply smiled at Wanda, aware that she was in dangerous waters. “You’re kind,” she said smoothly, then turned slightly to offer out Billy who’d sat watching the interaction with wide eyes and a slack jaw.</p><p>“You know Billy, I assume?”</p><p>But no sooner than Billy recovered himself and was leaning across Rio to get to Wanda had Rio’s attention already moved off to the other side of the room.</p><p>At the top of the table, at least twenty five people along from her sat Agatha. Agatha’s eyes were boring into Rio’s and she looked like she was either going to break the glass in her hand or lob it across the room.</p><p>Even as a passer by stopped briefly to say something to her and duck down to give a polite kiss in greeting Agatha barely flinched.</p><p>Rio’s instinct was to get up and go to the brunette but she knew she could handle this, and had to trust that deep down Agatha knew it too. She flashed a soft smile and gave Agatha what she hoped was a conciliatory<br/>wink before she tuned back into the conversation beside her.</p><p>“So,” Wanda was saying, eyeing up Rio again and clearly not so keen to keeping up with a chattering Billy.</p><p>“How is it going with my dear, <em>dear</em> Agatha?”</p><p>Rio released a breath and turned to where a waiter had just filled her wine glass. She thanked him calmly and turned to Wanda with a gentle smile, “Couldn’t be better.”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze didn’t falter as she picked up her own wine glass and took a sip, “I’m sure she was <em>pissed</em> when she found out you were next to me.”</p><p>“She didn’t know. The seating arrangements were a surprise until Jen announced it and even then, I found my seat and didn’t clock you’d be here until you arrived.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled under her breath and nodded, her eyes clearly flashing away to where Rio knew Agatha to be, “I’m sure Jen kept that from you both for a reason. Unintentional, of course, my being next to you. I was a last minute addition. More of a business attendee than a friendly one.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“My investment firm is…” but she trailed off and her mouth twitched as she placed her free hand over Rio’s as it held the stem of her wine glass, “but I won’t bore you with details, Rio.”</p><p>Rio knew this game, and unfortunately for Wanda, she was an expert in it. The push and pull of a flirt, an attempt to make someone jealous.</p><p>Usually she was the flirter, hamming it up with her clients to rile up an ex or else entice a potential flame. But she could flip the position. She wasn’t adverse to that.</p><p>“I’m sure you wouldn’t,” she uttered back, still smiling across at Wanda and leaving her hand where it was on her glass, her voice still soft, almost as if she were speaking of nothing more exciting than the weather, “But my girlfriend is over there. And, as you probably know, she’s quite possessive. Whilst that bodes well for <em>me</em> later in the bedroom, I’m not sure it bodes as well for <em>you</em>. So if you don’t mind…”</p><p>She dropped her gaze to where Wanda was now brushing her fingers lightly over the back of Rio’s hand and raised it again to look archly at the red head who, to her credit, looked taken aback.</p><p>Wanda soon caught herself and pulled her hand away slowly, straightening her back a little from where she’d been leaning into Rio, “<em>Touché</em>. Hot and smart. Agatha certainly does have a type.”</p><p>Rio’s buried monster growled again as Wanda winked at her but she kept her cool and simply smiled back. As she turned to engage Billy again she looked to Agatha to try and gage a reaction but saw the woman had turned fully away from the little scene at the end of the U and was flagging down another waiter.</p><p>The rest of the dinner went by agonisingly slowly despite the onslaught of delicious food; most of which came in such tiny portions that Rio found herself fantasising about a Big Mac by course four.</p><p>She managed to get by with just a few more exchanged words with Wanda, and only one incident where Rio was sure Wanda had purposefully stroked her thigh as she’d reached down to fetch a dropped fork. But she wasn’t about to accuse anyone, assuming Wanda was looking to either cause a scene, or get a reaction.</p><p>Billy kept her going, mostly. His constant chat, benign questions and wild observations actually made him the perfect I-don’t-know-anyone-here dinner party companion. And Rio could be sure that the growing soft spot she had for the boy wasn’t because of the wine. She was on drink two of her three drink rule, and still hadn’t finished the glass.</p><p>By the time the sound of scraped chairs and general noise of the room picked up, Rio had decided she actually liked Billy. So when he stood to leave she warmly reciprocated the hug he offered and gave him a gentle squeeze as he bounded off in search of his boyfriend.</p><p>It was as she’d been hugging Billy that she realised Agatha was no longer in her seat. There was no time, though, to begin searching for her as she felt warm breath against her ear, and a hand settle on her upper arm, “I look forward to seeing you at the wedding.”</p><p>Rio turned into the voice, if only to dislodge Wanda a little, and when she pulled back totally to get a clear view of the woman she was left with the sight of her back as she disappeared through the crowds.</p><p>Rio stood from her seat then, her breath catching slightly in her throat as she realised she had no idea where Agatha had gone. Or how long she’d been gone.</p><p>Somewhere between course seven and course ten she’d fallen into an animated conversation with Billy about the differences between American sitcoms and British ones.</p><p>Somewhere between comparing Michael Scott to Geraldine Granger Agatha must have disappeared.</p><p>It wasn’t Agatha who Rio found first, instead it was Alice, who was looking less happy than a bride to be should be at her own party. “She is pissed,” Alice emphasised as she stared up at Rio with a deep frown. “Like in the American way and in the British way.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but feel a little like this was all Alice’s fault, what with the table arrangement and all being at least 50% her idea but she didn’t voice that and instead nodded and asked, “Where is she?”</p><p>“Home, I think.”</p><p>“Home?” Rio looked around suddenly as if home would materialise in front of her but Alice grabbed her arm and turned her back, “Take a cab. Here,” she took out her phone and tapped about for a bit as Rio began to tap her foot impatiently on the floor.</p><p>“I told Jen inviting her in the first place was a bad idea and then she didn’t even think about where to place her and…”</p><p>She groaned but held up her phone to show Rio the confirmed uber plate number. “White Toyota. Sorry it isn’t fancier.”</p><p>Rio gave a quick smile and thanked Alice before she turned and exited into the cold night air.</p>

<p>The half an hour it took Rio to get to the house gave her just enough time to realise just how bone tired she was.</p><p>She’d been up since 5am a day ago. No, today.</p><p>She wasn’t entirely sure how long she’d been awake but the sudden quiet of the car let her know in no uncertain terms that she was exhausted.</p><p>As the desire to sleep crept in at the sides she instead focused on a game plan. On whatever she could get off the internet to help with what was surely going to be a difficult night, or in the very least, a very drunk Agatha.</p><p>Having dealt with drunk clients before (too much champagne at an event/too nervous before a trip to the bedroom; it happened more than she’d like it to), she knew she could handle just about anything and anyone. That was, anyone but the woman who one second was rigid and stiff, barely looking at her and was being purposefully elusive and then the very same woman whose arms so easily fit around her waist, who saw no issue with pressing her face against Rio, hiding behind her.</p><p>She googled everything she could think of to continue to build a picture that was still somewhat indistinct of the mystery that was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>
<em>Agatha Harkness Wanda Maximoff</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha Harkness wife</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha Harkness</em>
</p><p>
<em>Wanda Maximoff</em>
</p><p>The reams of pictures and articles that came up left her reeling. Photos of Agatha arm in arm with Wanda. Pictures of them at the same event, smiling coyly side by side. Pictures of Agatha dressed to the nines with Wanda beaming but Agatha with that same, mysterious smile. Agatha, Wanda, Agatha, Wanda.</p><p>It began to feel too much like an intrusion. And Rio wished she’d never started.</p><p>The feeling she’d felt in the pit of her stomach when she’d spoken to Wanda earlier was returning and she couldn’t feed it anymore.</p><p>A few days ago the one question she wanted the internet to answer for her was ‘who is this person’. And as the internet began to answer her, she now wished she’d never asked it.</p><p>The woman in those photos, she wasn’t who Rio had been with the past god-knows how many hours. The woman she was with hadn’t wanted her to see those pictures, or to read those articles. Or she wouldn’t have signed off her first email with ‘2A’.</p><p>Rio deleted her search history with a disgruntled sigh and flopped back in her seat as the busy streets of a busy city flew past her.</p><p>She had to get to know Agatha herself. It was how she could do her job well. At least, that’s what she told herself it was for.</p><p>Before Rio could spiral any further, the car was pulling up to the little house with the shutters.</p><p>Thanking the driver with all the politeness she could muster, Rio spilled onto the pavement with a renewed sense of purpose. Her job was this. To help her clients however they needed her.</p><p>They rented her face, her body even, but they also rented her skills, her experience, for how she could treat them, and show them how they should treat themselves. A full service mechanic, she told herself.</p><p>She just needed to lift the bonnet.</p><p>It took several ignored knocks, two rather embarrassing shouts of ‘Agatha! Agatha please open the door!’ And one half-hearted attempt to jimmy the lock with a hairpin she found in her purse for Rio to check under the mat.</p><p>One miracle key later and she was inside, closing the door and walking into what appeared to be an empty, silent house.</p><p>Venturing into the kitchen, the only clue that Agatha was either here or had made a quick visit and bolted, were the bottles of vodka, rum, and something that looked suspiciously like absinthe sitting haphazardly on the kitchen island.</p><p>Leaving them as they were, she ventured back out and up to the top floor of the still silent house and prayed she’d find the alcohol thief somewhere that meant she didn’t have to go traipsing out into the night with a rapidly dying phone battery and no knowledge whatsoever of London.</p><p>But pushing the door open gently to the very room she’d been hurried out of a few hours ago she breathed a heavy sigh of relief.</p><p>There would be no midnight search and rescue missions tonight.</p><p>“Go away,” Agatha’s voice was husky as she spoke from the other side of the bed, sitting on the floor so Rio could only see the back of a messy head of hair.</p><p>“Didn’t you hear me shouting?”</p><p>“I said,” Agatha tried again, this time raising her voice, “Go. Away.”</p><p>Rio closed the door quietly behind her and pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek as she kicked off her heels and steadily walked around to where she could look down at Agatha.</p><p>It was a sight to see.</p><p>Agatha’s crisp navy dress had been discarded somewhere in the bedroom as if it weren’t worth the hundreds of dollars it had cost. Her shoes were similarly discarded, one having made its way into the bathtub, the other in an unknown location.</p><p>The Washington Post’s ‘Most Powerful Woman In The Capitol’ was now sitting in a pair of silk pyjamas, haphazardly buttoned at the front, with her hair a crazed mess all about her and an open bottle of whisky half-drunk, and clutched in her lap.</p><p>And it was the most beautiful sight Rio had ever seen.</p><p>She took a deep breath and slowly said, “Agatha, what happened?”</p><p>Scoffing and standing up so suddenly and so clumsily that Rio reached to steady her, Agatha caught herself between Rio and the wall. With a soft grunt the older woman smacked her head back against the wall and Rio instinctively reached to cup her cheek, tracing her thumb lightly across a sharp cheekbone.</p><p>Agatha allowed this for only a second before tossing her head back and releasing a throaty laugh as her hands trailed up Rio’s arms, seemingly deciding that she didn’t want Rio to ‘go away’.</p><p>“You. <em>You happened.</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk was devilish as she leant in and closed the distance between then, intentionally ghosting her lips across Rio’s as she whispered, “you were supposed to be <em>mine</em>.”</p><p>The words travelled through Rio’s body and settled further south than she’d care to admit but she had no time to dwell on it as Agatha finally, mercifully, closed the gap between them and pressed their lips together in a forceful, slightly off kilter, kiss.</p><p>A noise of surprise vibrated through Rio as Agatha began clawing at her, pawing at the fabric of her velvet dress to get it up, off, away.</p><p>Rio had just enough self control to shift their positions, moving her head backwards and away from searching lips to look Agatha square in the face. “We can’t do this. Not like this.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha quickly agreed, shaking her head slightly as her hands continued to grope at Rio, one resting below her left breast and the other settled possessively on her hip.</p><p>“<em>More</em>.”</p><p>Rio barely had time to register the directive as Agatha practically body slammed her into the wall. The spin was so sudden that Rio gasped for both air and in slight pain as she was pressed against the wall in Agatha’s urgent attempt for “more”.</p><p>No sooner had Rio’s back had come into contact with the wall than Agatha’s lips had found purchase on her skin, leaving a trail of hot, open mouthed kisses across Rio’s jaw, and settling against her pulse point where Agatha bit down and elicited a filthy moan from Rio’s lips.</p><p>In spite of herself, Rio lifted a leg to drape over Agatha’s hip and the horny drunken frat boy who had taken over Agatha’s body responded with incoherent words as she groped Rio’s ass, sliding her hand along her exposed thigh and holding her so tightly she’d leave a mark.</p><p>“You fucking…” Agatha began to breath out between her ministrations against Rio’s neck, but the words died on her tongue as Rio pulled her back with a firm grasp of her hair.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>”</p><p>They stared at each other, both breathless and wanting, their bodies now pressed so tightly together that Rio could feel the push and pull of Agatha’s heavy breaths against her chest.</p><p>“Agatha,” she softened slightly, a little bit of the professionalism slipping back in. As if she hadn’t just broken about fifty rules and allowed a client to mark her without explicit permission.</p><p>She released a slow, steadying breath, aware that though Agatha had listened and stopped trying to mark every inch of Rio’s neck, her vicelike grip still held firm and blue eyes were unfocused, staring at Rio’s lips.</p><p>“We can’t do this. Not, not like this.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, still intent on Rio’s lips as she leant in again, breaking the hold Rio had on her hair.</p><p>“You want this as much as I do.”</p><p>Her hand moved around from Rio’s back to push up, tracing the plains of Rio’s exposed chest through the slit in her dress.</p><p>It was slow, deliberate and Rio had plenty of time to stop her, to protest, but the words died on her lips as Agatha’s delicate touch finally found what they both wanted.</p><p>Her fingers pushed below the fabric and slid just a couple of inches until her hand could cup Rio’s breast. A soft laugh escaped Agatha’s lips as Rio sucked in a sharp breath at the sudden feel of Agatha squeezing her, before shifting and rolling her hardened nipple between her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>Rio whined as Agatha, instead of leaning in, moved down again, intent on continuing her previous mission.</p><p>Her lips trailed a wet path down Rio’s sternum and her teeth made their claim against the side of Rio’s breast as she pushed the dress off, aggressively ripping it from Rio’s shoulder and exposing her whole upper left side.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio moaned, fighting internally with the desire to maintain control of the situation or just give it up entirely for the desperate woman now sucking hungrily on her breast.</p><p>Rio’s back arched into Agatha’s mouth and her hands found purchase in wild hair as Agatha sucked and teased her, nipping lightly at her skin before finally placing hot lips around her hardened nipple.</p><p>Agatha pulled back only to replace her lips with her hand and capture Rio’s open mouth in a hot, needy kiss. For the first time Rio felt Agatha’s tongue against her own as they wrestled for dominance, both moaning at the need they felt from the other.</p><p>It was a hot, sloppy kiss, their teeth clashing more than once as Agatha continued to grope at Rio, her hands now working to expose her completely.</p><p>The sound of ripping fabric was what caused Rio to wake from her haze of just <em>Agatha</em> and she pushed at Agatha, gasping for breath as the woman pulled and ripped the fabric of Rio’s favourite, secret weapon, dress.</p><p>“No, no, stop.”</p><p>The words felt alien on her tongue, and she had to fight against her own body to say them.</p><p>Rio’s dress now ruined and her chest fully exposed as the fabric rested by her elbows, Rio took in a deep breath before pushing forwards and grasping Agatha’s forearms she said, “Agatha, not like this… you’re, you’re drunk.”</p><p>Laughing throatily again and pausing her attempts to rip the rest of Rio’s dress to expose her upper body completely Agatha shook her head and stared back at Rio, her mouth opening slightly as if to speak and then closing again.</p><p>But her smirk died on her face, instead blinking slowly she softened.</p><p>She swayed on the spot as her gaze dropped down to Rio’s exposed breasts, and her hand moved to touch the new bruise just beginning to blossom of her own making.</p><p>“You were flirting with her,” she finally admitted in a soft voice, her fingers still resting lightly against Rio. She swayed ever so slightly and Rio squeezed her arms, keeping her in place.</p><p>“I saw you. The touches, the smiles. You were… flirting.”</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply and reached for Agatha’s hand but the older woman pulled it back, too sharply and too clumsily for Rio to have grabbed it. “I saw,” she repeated again, firmer this time.</p><p>Blue eyes flashed to brown and in them Rio saw hurt. She stepped closer to Agatha again but the woman moved away entirely and turned from her.</p><p>“Hey. It wasn’t like that. She was trying it on and I… I let her know I wasn’t interested. That I was only interested in you.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha scoffed and found the discarded bottle of whisky, “Interested in the money I’m paying you.”</p><p>Rio shrugged her dress back on, covering herself as best she could now the ripped opening of it ended just at the waistband of her lace panties.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said evenly, stepping to take the bottle back from the woman. “I was loyal to you. You must know that.”</p><p>Agatha just scoffed again, throwing her arms in the air as she rounded back on Rio, “It was so fucking obvious!”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Don’t. Don’t try and deny it,” Agatha’s frenzy began to grow again now she no longer had the anchor of Rio’s body, the comfort of the moans she’d been able to elicit just a few moments ago.</p><p>“I don’t want anyone,” she paused and pointed a finger at Rio, sneering across at her, “anyone to touch you. Not…” her voice seemed to die in her throat as she swallowed thickly, her eyes suddenly glassy as she stared at Rio. “Not again.”</p><p>Nodding and moving close, taking Agatha’s hand and turning it over to place a gentle kiss on Agatha’s palm Rio then moved back into the warmth of Agatha’s body. “Okay. Okay.”</p><p>Agatha slackened then, her whole body collapsing as she leant against Rio, allowing the younger woman to pepper slow kisses to her temple, her cheek, her jaw, before their lips met again and Agatha stumbled a little, off balance as she relied solely on Rio to keep them up.</p><p>Rio maneuvered them to the bed and pushed Agatha down gently before straddling her lap and running her hands cautiously through messy brown hair.</p><p>“I…” Agatha started, her hands moving to grasp Rio’s hips and pull her closer into her, her touch no less commanding than before but less desperate, less harsh.</p><p>Rio didn’t let her finish as she kissed her again, letting her tongue trace slowly across Agatha’s swollen bottom lip, easing her down from her tirade.</p><p>They remained like that for a few minutes, kissing languidly as Agatha calmed down, still keeping her firm grip on the younger woman in her lap.</p><p>When Rio pulled reluctantly back, far too happy to remain like that for the rest of the night, the rest of her life, she placed a final kiss to the corner of Agatha’s lips and said, “Let me go and get you some water and aspirin. You should get some sleep and we can talk in the morning.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were unfocused again, hovering somewhere between Rio’s own gaze and her lips. Either from the alcohol still rushing through her system or the desire she was clearly fighting, Rio couldn’t be sure.</p><p>But she didn’t let her answer and instead pulled off of Agatha’s lap, meeting only a brief resistance from the woman beneath her as she did so.</p><p>Moving from the room before she could change her mind Rio traipsed through the house and back to the kitchen. when there she replaced the scattered bottles in the drinks trolley and fetched the promised water and drugs for Agatha’s inevitable biblical morning hangover.</p><p>Her body was alive with the unfulfilled want she had for the older woman and as she made her way back she squeezed her thighs together, trying to ignore the ache she knew had been growing from the moment Agatha had thrown her against the wall.</p><p>It was her reflection, though, that stopped her on her way back to Agatha.</p><p>Her hair was a mess, her lipstick was smudged across her swollen lips and her dress was beyond repair. But it wasn’t any of this she focused on.</p><p>Agatha has painted bruises and angry red marks across almost every inch of skin she’d been able to reach. She counted at least three blossoming marks on her neck, and two in the centre of her chest, one large mark nestled beside her breast.</p><p>If any other client had done this, Rio would either have terminated their time and contract immediately or else charged a significant excess for this type of wanton show of possession.</p><p>But it had been Agatha. And the sight of herself, marked all over by the woman in the attic room, made her shiver with more desire than she’d felt in a long time.</p><p>She was fucked.</p><p>By the time Rio got back to the bedroom Agatha had curled herself up at the edge of the bed and was either asleep or pretending to be.</p><p>Rio left the goods on the side table, checked Agatha was breathing and in a position that meant any late night drunken vomiting wouldn’t result in choking and then moved to change for bed.</p><p>She fished out her own pyjamas from her bag, taking them from a separate and hidden compartment where she kept the clothes she only took out if she knew either a) the client wouldn’t mind b) she had free time and could do what she wanted or c) she’d had enough being someone else and wanted to be herself for a while.</p><p>So, in boy shorts with planets on them and a threadbare Eagles tshirt, she slipped silently into the bed.</p><p>It was somewhere after Rio finally slipping into what was a restless sleep, tormented by images of blue eyes, swollen lips, and long fingers that Rio felt the bed shift and she woke with a quiet groan.</p><p>Agatha was sitting up at the other end of the bed, her back to Rio as she took a steady sip of now warm water.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio croaked out cautiously, her hand reaching out across the bed towards Agatha.</p><p>“I’m sorry about earlier,” came Agatha’s husky voice, thick with sleep and apparently regret. “I went too far.”</p><p>“No, no you didn’t. You didn’t.”</p><p>She didn’t know what else to say. The reality was, before engaging in any sort of sexual activity with a client, there were rules Rio laid out. Agreed parameters. Established guidelines.</p><p>What had happened with Agatha wasn’t professional. It was something Rio had wanted.</p><p>“I was too aggressive. I was desperate to believe that…” Agatha trailed off again and this time Rio moved up onto her knees and shuffled closer to Agatha, applying light pressure to her shoulder to make her turn around.</p><p>“Agatha, there’s nothing to worry about. We both wanted it.” She smiled softly and tiled her head to expose the marks, now more visible even in the dim light of the early morning.</p><p>“But I will be invoicing you for some more concealer.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha mumbled and moved now to turn completely and trace her fingers gently over the marks. “Shit.”</p><p>Her gaze soon dropped to the Rio’s choice of pyjamas and she tugged lightly at the neck of the well-worn band tee. “This is what you sleep in?” her tone was teasing and Rio breathed out in relief as she saw the smirk across Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Look. What I sleep in is my business. Besides you were passed out and it would have felt weird to put on a neglige or something.”</p><p>“Neglige?”</p><p>Shrugging with a grin, Rio continued, “I like my shorts a lot better.”</p><p>Taking the opportunity to look down at Rio’s toned legs as she knelt in the aforementioned shorts Agatha hummed, “I think I like them better too.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and lightly smacked Agatha’s shoulder, “Insatiable.”</p><p>“Oh you have no idea.”</p><p>They looked at each other for a long second before Agatha broke the silence again, licking her lips before speaking once more, “It was too much. Earlier. Seeing you like that. With her. I couldn’t stand it.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I wanted…” but Rio was already moving, already closing the gap between them again and capturing Agatha’s lips with her own.</p><p>Agatha reacted immediately, wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist and pulling her back into her lap.</p><p>Rio’s stomach flipped at the powerful hold she found herself in, Agatha now back to her frenetic exploration of Rio’s body, her fingers desperate to touch, to squeeze, to hold.</p><p>A broken moan forced their mouths apart as Agatha’s hold on Rio slipped to her ass and she forced Rio’s hips forwards to make heavy contact with her own.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>Agatha stared up at Rio, breathing heavily as she held the woman flush against her, a look of pure lust across her face as Rio shifted ever so slightly against her, practically begging to be touched.</p><p>Unlike before, Agatha didn’t move immediately, didn’t take without asking. Instead she pressed a hesitant kiss to Rio’s jaw, seeking a silent ‘okay’ before she shifted them again and with a surprising strength she lay Rio down on her back, settling over her and leaning against her forearms either side of Rio’s head.</p><p>“Touch me,” Rio breathed, arching up in an attempt to press back against Agatha as her hands came to push below Agatha’s silk shirt and she grazed the warm skin of the woman’s sides.</p><p>Self-restraint could only last so long for Agatha and she moved to settle herself more solidly against Rio, finding her jaw again with her lips and working her way back down her throat.</p><p>Her hands groped at Rio’s breast as she flattened her tongue to the bruises she’d left earlier, causing Rio to whine in pleasure and pain.</p><p>“Take it off. Now.”</p><p>She fumbled downwards, wrestling Rio’s shirt up and not waiting until Rio helped remove the shirt the rest of the way before she captured Rio’s exposed breasts with her lips again, teasing her nipple with her teeth and tongue as her free hand moved to grope at her other breast.</p><p>Rio’s body was on fire beneath Agatha as she writhed below her lips, her hands desperate to hold on, grasping at Agatha’s hair, her shirt, tugging at her as she began to feel a desperate need for more.</p><p>Agatha seemed to either know what Rio needed or be too desperate herself to hold back as she moved her hand slowly down the flat of Rio’s stomach, marvelling in the trail of goosebumps she left across soft skin as she went.</p><p>Her body moved up again to capture Rio’s moans in her mouth and in doing so she pressed her thigh against Rio’s centre, forcing the other woman’s body to react and buck into her.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha. Please.”</p><p>Agatha moaned against Rio as she pushed her fingers below the waistband of her shorts and mercifully found that Rio had shed her underwear already.</p><p>She dipped her head to husk against Rio’s ear as her fingers dipped down further and met with slick folds that caused her to moan as she whispered, “You’re so fucking wet.”</p><p>Rio writhed beneath Agatha, now clutching at her back and raising her legs to wrap around the older woman’s hips.</p><p>“Please, I need you…”</p><p>“Tell me,” Agatha murmured as she moved her fingers slowly up to ghost over Rio’s clit, making the woman beneath her whine.</p><p>“Fuck me, please fuck me.”</p><p>The plea was so desperate that Agatha almost moaned again as she moved her hand to press the tips of her two fingers into Rio’s entrance.</p><p>She hesitated only for a second, teasing out more insistent noises from the woman before she pushed inside of Rio, meeting almost no resistance as she curled her fingers inwards and heard Rio moan.</p><p>Agatha let Rio adjust for only a second before she set a brutal pace, pumping into her as she returned her attention to Rio’s throat, licking and teasing the sensitive skin there.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Rio began to chant softly, her whole body on fire as Agatha continued to thrust into her.</p><p>With Rio’s legs so tightly wrapped around her Agatha had to shift slightly to brush her thumb across Rio’s throbbing clit, and when Rio responded with a shout of her name she rewarded her with another finger pressed inside.</p><p>“Come for me, baby,” Agatha husked out, now breathless with the energy she was exerting keeping up her relentless pace inside Rio and pressing down against her clit.</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told.</p><p>With a shout the knot that had been building in her abdomen finally released and she felt her walls clench around Agatha’s fingers as she came.</p><p>Agatha continued to press open mouthed kisses along Rio’s throat and chest as she slowed down her movements but helped Rio to ride out her orgasm, gently stroking her clit with the pad of her thumb.</p><p>As Rio began to whine at the sensitivity, and Agatha reluctantly pulled out of her, savouring the way Rio’s body bucked up to her, feeling the loss of her.</p><p>Rio looked down at Agatha with a sloppy, almost drunk smile and murmured, “That was…”</p><p>But she couldn’t find the words to finish her sentence as she watched in awe as Agatha removed her hand from her shorts, raised her fingers to her own mouth, and sucked Rio clean off of them.</p><p>Despite having just come, Rio clenched her thighs at the sight, moaning as Agatha moved her slick hand to rest lightly around Rio’s throat.</p><p>“You did so good, baby. You taste so good.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and licked her lips, desperate to taste herself on Agatha’s tongue but the woman was moving, too intent on getting more of Rio. Claiming her in every way she could.</p><p>Her lips, wet with Rio, were now trailing down Rio’s body, tasting and teasing the hot skin as she moved further down the bed to settle between Rio’s shaking thighs.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio started, leaning up slightly to watch the woman’s progress.</p><p>But Agatha ignored her, moving back only as she gripped the edges of Rio’s shorts and glancing up at her she said, “Lift.”</p><p>Rio swallowed as she lifted her hips and watched as Agatha seamlessly stripped her of her old Saturn-strewn shorts.</p><p>Exposed fully and feeling her desperation build once more Rio gasped at the sudden cool air against her warm heat.</p><p>She whimpered as Agatha scratched down her inner thighs and settled more comfortably between her legs. “Is this okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was so soft that Rio, in her orgasm-addled state, almost missed it. But she nodded quickly and gave a thick, “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha blew out slowly against Rio’s centre, aiming at Rio’s clit and smiling slightly when Rio whined a little.</p><p>She then experimentally flicked her tongue out, teasing so lightly through Rio’s folds.</p><p>“Is this okay?” she asked again and Rio realised that this time she wasn’t asking for consent, she was asking Rio to beg.</p><p>And Rio wanted to. God she wanted to. But not that easily. This woman couldn’t have ultimate control over her. Not yet.</p><p>“Yes,” she managed to gasp out, just before Agatha leant back in again and pressed a firm, deliberate kiss to her clit, letting her lips suck lightly on the little bundle of nerves now so sensitive from all Agatha’s previous, delicious attention.</p><p>Rio gasped and gripped tightly at Agatha’s hair, swallowing down her desire to shout.</p><p>Blue eyes flickered up to look at the mess that had become Rio Vidal.</p><p>She was breathless, sticky from sweat and Agatha’s kisses, and aching for Agatha to touch her, fuck her.</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze on Rio, taking in the sight before her, and kept her gaze on Rio as she licked a long, firm strip from her entrance up to Rio’s clit.</p><p>The moan that escaped Rio was unholy and she finally crumpled as Agatha asked with a sickening smugness, “Is this okay?”</p><p>Rio growled and glared down at the woman smirking back up at her, her arms now wrapped beneath Rio’s thighs and holding them in place.</p><p>Fuck it. This woman could have total control. And Rio would beg for it every time.</p><p>“Please,” she breathed out, “Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha, satisfied with the response, wasted no more time. She was just as desperate as Rio.</p><p>She plunged her tongue back inside Rio, dipping down to taste her where she’d already fucked her, thrusting in and out with the same relentlessness she’d shown earlier.</p><p>Her nose angled up to nudge at Rio’s clit and the whines from the woman above her told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>Agatha ate Rio out with a hunger that neither woman had experienced before. And Rio’s hips bucked with every ministration of the other woman’s tongue, every movement like a silent plea for Agatha.</p><p>Just as Rio’s breathing became shallower, Agatha moved her lips back to her clit and sucked harshly, causing Rio to cry out. As she soothed it back again with gentle laps of her tongue she shifted to circle her entrance with her fingers, pushing two just a knuckle deep inside of Rio as she focused on her clit.</p><p>Rio whined out and bucked her hips frantically, desperate for more of Agatha and finally getting what she wanted as Agatha began to fuck her again, sucking and lapping at her clit.</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped down to Agatha, wanting to watch her as she ate her out but her attention was caught by Agatha’s hips desperately bucking at the bed, desperate for some friction.</p><p>The sight sent Rio over the edge without warning. The thought of Agatha desperate and wanting her as she ate her out made her orgasm crash through her like a tidal wave.</p><p>Rio’s hips lurched violently as she pulled at Agatha’s hair, feeling the moan from the other woman reverberate through her whole body as she came against her mouth.</p><p>“Fuck,” she breathed, gasping for air as she slowed the movements of her hips and Agatha pulled out of her.</p><p>She pressed a soft, gentle kiss to the mound of Rio’s cunt and then moved slowly up the woman’s body with a smug grin on her face.</p><p>Rio was quivering slightly with the intensity of her second orgasm and she stared slack jawed up at Agatha as her hands found purchase against her back.</p><p>“You’re still wearing your pyjamas,” she managed to croak out, feeling punch drunk again as Agatha nuzzled herself against her neck.</p><p>“I was busy,” she mumbled indulgently before moving back up to grant Rio’s earlier, silent wish.</p><p>She kissed Rio slowly, opening her mouth to let Rio taste herself on Agatha’s tongue. Rio moaned at the mixture of salt and whisky and groaned as Agatha pulled away to catch her breath. “You’re so fucking perfect,” she whispered with a sincere look that caused Rio’s already racing heart to beat that little bit faster.</p><p>Rio nuzzled her nose to Agatha’s and sighed against her before whispering right back, “Not so bad yourself.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened as she placed another soft kiss to Rio’s lips, moving away slightly before Rio pulled her right back and nipped her her lower lip. “Sit on my face?”</p><p>A laugh escaped Agatha as she gazed down at Rio with raised brows, “Excuse me?”</p><p>Rio lifted her chin defiantly and with all the energy she had left in her she said, “Sit. On. My. Face.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but her body betrayed her as her tongue darted out to wet her lips, tasting Rio there again.</p><p>She moved slowly, almost as if to give Rio an out, to see if she’d change her mind.</p><p>She adjusted herself as Rio shuffled a little further up the cushions, propping her head up slightly, expectantly.</p><p>Just as Agatha moved to straddle Rio’s chest, rio placed a hand on Agatha’s stomach and said, “What do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed with something similar to the hurt Rio had seen in them earlier but she was quick to clarify as she began undoing the disastrously organised buttons of Agatha’s silk night shirt.</p><p>“Take it off,” she commanded, reflecting Agatha’s words from earlier.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t move, instead she allowed Rio to reach up and undo the buttons of her shirt, watching her face and losing herself in deep brown eyes.</p><p>Once the shirt was open, Rio’s breath caught at the sight of Agatha’s pale skin, speckled with a few light freckles. Her hands moved up to push down the shirt from her shoulders so Agatha was fully exposed.</p><p>Rio thought she’d blacked out for a second.</p><p>Agatha sat, her knees resting just below Rio’s armpits, her back ramrod straight, with her hair falling in messy waves about her, and the most perfect breasts Rio had ever seen.</p><p>Her mouth fell open with the desire to taste them, as Agatha had done to hers earlier. But the position they were in meant she couldn’t.</p><p>Instead she moved her hands to brush over the expanse of Agatha’s toned stomach. She felt her muscles flutter with every brush of her fingers and found herself mesmerised by the sight of her skin on Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha watched all of this, her desire for Rio growing with every second she watched Rio’s gaze on her, her fingers against her. She could no longer stand it.</p><p>She took Rio’s hands and leant down to kiss each palm before standing above her, glancing down she then threw her head back, pushing her hair away from her chest and exposing herself more.</p><p>Rio below her swallowed and shifted slightly, desperate for the warm weight of Agatha to be back against her.</p><p>But then she realised what was coming next. Agatha was moving, leaning forward to use the wall for support and she slipped off her silk pants, letting them fall lightly against Rio’s chest.</p><p>Rio’s mouth went dry at the sight of a fully exposed Agatha above her, and she moved her hands up to scratch along smooth and toned legs, finally gripping her thighs and applying pressure to pull her back down.</p><p>Agatha laughed a little at Rio’s insistence but silently obliged as she lowered herself back down, placing her knees by Rio’s head and leaning back so she could look at her.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened to say something but Rio beat her to it and uttered a soft, “Please.”</p><p>A visible shiver went through Agatha at the word and she moved then to lower herself fully over Rio’s mouth, moaning as she felt hot breath against the place she needed it most.</p><p>Agatha was practically dripping.</p><p>Rio wasted no time in tasting her, exploring her, mapping her folds with her tongue as she wrapped her arms securely around Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Rio had thought her moans were excessive earlier, but the noises Agatha began to make were practically pornographic.</p><p>She bucked her hips against Rio’s face as Rio pressed her tongue firmly into Agatha’s entrance, allowing Agatha to twitch around it, erratically moving to get more from Rio, to ride her face.</p><p>Her nose bumped Agatha’s clit and the woman above her moaned so loudly that Rio knew she didn’t have long to enjoy tasting her before she’d come.</p><p>The tension of the evening, as well as the desperate build up of Rio’s two orgasms made Agatha fall apart in mere minutes above Rio. She came with a loud “fuck!” And rode out her orgasm, using Rio and letting her continue to tease her clit with her tongue as she did.</p><p>Suddenly oversensitive she pulled away, Rio whining and trying desperately to keep her there, her arms tightening around her thighs.</p><p>“Baby,” was all Agatha needed to utter before Rio released her grip and allowed the brunette to move off of her, shuffling down slightly so she could fully look at Rio’s now ruined face.</p><p>Evidence of Agatha’s orgasm covered Rio’s mouth, cheeks and jaw. The Latina gazed up at Agatha with that same drunk look of desire she’d had before that Agatha wobbled slightly before she lay down to press her body fully against Rio’s.</p><p>It was the first time they’d pressed their bodies together fully and Rio’s arms immediately wrapped around Agatha as if afraid she’d move away again.</p><p>“You look a mess,” Agatha smirked, licking teasingly at Rio’s lips.</p><p>“And who should I blame for that?”</p><p>“Mm, I should get you a tissue.”</p><p>“No, not yet.”</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly at Rio and nodded just once, her vulnerability from earlier slowly shutting back down as she moved her head to rest beside Rio’s and pressed her nose into her hair.</p><p>Rio’s hands drew lazily patterns across Agatha’s back as she thought over the past hour or so.</p><p>Her body ached with the desperate need for sleep, from the bruises now prominent against her tanned skin, and the dull satisfying ache between her legs.</p><p>But as her mind wandered to what had happened that evening she found the weight of the day, coupled with the comfortable weight of Agatha settled above her, pull her into a deep sleep.</p><p>Agatha, remaining still on top of Rio, waited until the other woman’s breathing had evened out and she was sure she was asleep.</p><p>As the light from the early morning sunrise began to creep into the room Agatha moved quietly from Rio’s limp body and gazed down at her from the edge of the bed.</p><p>Her fingers twitched with the desire to touch, to trace the marks and bruises she’d given to the younger woman but for fear of waking her, she let her eyes do the travelling instead.</p><p>She remained like that, watching the steady breathing of the sleeping woman for just a few more seconds before she reached down and pulled up the duvet to cover her.</p><p>Once sure Rio was both still asleep and comfortable, Agatha went to dampen a warm cloth from the bathroom and came back to gently wipe at Rio’s face, removing evidence of lipstick and Agatha from her with gentle ministrations.</p><p>Rio mumbled something as she finished, feeling the bed move as Agatha leaned back but she didn’t hang around to hear it.</p><p>She changed and washed her own face before leaving the room entirely, closing the door behind her with a soft click.</p>

<p> </p><p>“You’re not alone in this house, you know.”</p><p>Came the greeting from Jen as Agatha entered the kitchen just as the sun was beginning to rise.</p><p>She squinted across at her oldest friend and chose to ignore the comment as she brushed past her and went to the fridge.</p><p>“And you smell like sex.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed as she grabbed the orange juice and went to pour herself a glass, thinking for a second before pouring a second one for the woman currently staring at her with a smug smile.</p><p>“Alice can sleep through anything but <em>that</em> was honestly enough to wake the whole street.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. You’re just jealous because your sex life fell off a cliff the moment you two hit 30.”</p><p>Rolling her eyes and not rising to the bait Jen took the offered orange juice and laughed, “So she’s a keeper then? This mysterious new girlfriend of yours? Clearly knows what she’s doing at least.”</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn not rise to her friend’s comment and instead she shrugged silently and dramatically rolled her shoulders back. She could still taste Rio on her tongue as she raised her glass to her lips.</p><p>Jen eyes Agatha closely but let her sit in her thoughts for a while before she spoke again, this time her tone a little softer, “I am sorry about inviting Wanda. I know you didn’t want to hear it earlier but I <em>am</em>.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent, her gaze now on her own fingers.</p><p>“It was just business. It was…”</p><p>“She’s my ex wife. My cheating ex wife who thought it was appropriate to flirt with my current girlfriend.”</p><p>Jen blanched at Agatha’s sharp tone and shifted uncomfortably on her stool.</p><p>“Flirted? With Rio?”</p><p>She laughed uncomfortably and threw her hand up with a dramatic flare, “I mean, god, Agatha, I would flirt with Rio! Alice has been practically drooling all day. You can’t expect,” but she was cut off.</p><p>“Goddamnit, Jen!” She slapped her hand on the counter and made Jen jump slightly.</p><p>“Agatha. Just relax, okay? Don’t let Wanda get to you. All I’m saying is your girl’s hot. And clearly she wasn’t thinking about anyone else tonight apart from you. You made for damn sure.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes twinkled with a little mischief again as she surveyed her still tense best friend. “You gotta relax. Maybe just with less alcohol next time. I thought you were going to throw hands at my party.”</p><p>“Yours and Alice’s party,” Agatha corrected stubbornly as she moved to slump in the stool beside Jen. “And maybe I should have. She’s a witch.”</p><p>Jen nodded in agreement and placed a comforting hand on Agatha’s shoulder, “Yes but Rio handled herself. I saw her, she was mostly chatting to Billy. That boy won’t shut up about you. He’s obsessed.”</p><p>“He’s annoying.”</p><p>“You love him really,” Jen leant across and nudged at Agatha’s shoulder with her own.</p><p>Agatha relaxed a little then and sipped at her juice, silently replaying the whole evening, having to watch her ex practically throw herself at Rio and feeling once again the bike rise in her throat at the thought of Wanda’s hands on her.</p><p>But Jen was back to talking to her, pulling her from her reverie.</p><p>“Lilia liked her, you know. There’s someone you don’t have to worry about stealing your girl.” She paused and tilted her head slightly, “Well, I guess Rio is into older women.”</p><p>“Oh fuck off,” Agatha muttered and pushed at Jen gently, making them both laugh.</p><p>“Besides,” Jen said quickly, recovering her balance and her breath, “I think this one’s pretty smitten with you. Can’t keep her eyes off of you. It’s actually pretty gross.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes once more and finished her juice, standing from her stool and placing a short, sharp kiss to Jen’s cheek.</p><p>She sauntered around the kitchen and just as she reached the threshold Jen called after her. “Don’t forget! Bridal fitting today! Alice has work so Rio can come or she can,” she grinned evilly at Agatha, “stay here and recover.”</p><p>Agatha laughed as she turned back to her friend, “Oh good, more torture.”</p><p>But taking her grinning friend in for a second she softened her smile and said, “Go back to bed. You need your beauty sleep. No more noises from us. I promise.”</p><p>Jen shot Agatha a disbelieving look and called after her retreating form, “I’m gorgeous enough, bitch!”</p><p>When Agatha arrived back in the room she cautiously climbed back into the bed behind a still sleeping Rio.</p><p>Painfully aware that whilst she’d put on her pyjamas again, Rio was still butt naked, Agatha kept a respectful distance but reached out to trace a gentle line down Rio’s shoulder blade and breathed in the scent of sex in the room, and something so distinctly Rio.</p><p>Her mind began to wander then, back to the way she’d pushed Rio, shouted at her, and ultimately found a comfort in the younger woman’s touch. Her head began to throb with the threat of an impending hangover but she was spared the indignity of rolling over and fetching the aspirin by a small voice that broke through her thoughts.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>There was silence for a while as Agatha listened to the steady breathing of the woman before her and wondered whether she’d spoken in her sleep. But then Rio spoke again, her voice gaining strength as she woke, “why are you so far away?”</p><p>Fighting back a smile Agatha shuffled closer and placed a hand on Rio’s arm, making sure their bodies didn’t touch.</p><p>“You’re naked and I’m not. I didn’t want to presume.”</p><p>Rio harrumphed quietly, “You were literally inside of me a few hours ago. Presume away.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in response and pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s shoulder before she closed the distance and wrapped her body around the woman.</p><p>“Better,” Rio confirmed before slipping back into a deep sleep.</p><p>Agatha took a little longer to follow suit, her mind whirling with questions about what this meant. Whether Rio would expect more payment for this. Whether she would slap Agatha with harassment charges. Or the thought that frightened her the most: Whether she was playing along because she thought it was what Agatha wanted her to do.</p><p>But sleep came, just as Agatha had done an hour ago.</p><p>Only a couple of hours later, there was a loud banging on the door that announced the return of Jen to Agatha’s consciousness.</p><p>“You better be dressed in there. I’m coming in!”</p><p>Groaning loudly and not quite awake yet, Agatha rolled over onto her back just in time to see a purposeful looking Jen storm into the room with a tray of toast and coffee.</p><p>“Hey hey!” Agatha shouting, suddenly realising that whilst she was dressed, Rio most certainly was not.</p><p>She moved her arm across Rio as if to shield her from prying eyes and a slowly waking Rio seemed to not care at all that her dignity could perhaps be compromised by a fierce cosmetologist yielding a tray of breakfast.</p><p>“Agatha, there’s a blanket over me.”</p><p>“Even still,” Agatha grumbled a little but relented and sat up slowly to accept the tray offered to her.</p><p>Rio, clearly more of a morning perhaps than her counterpart in the bed pulled the sheets up with her as she sat beside Agatha and leant over to steal a slice of toast. “Oh my god, amazing. Thank you. I’m starved.”</p><p>“I bet you are,” Jen comment with a smirk as she turned to leave the room again, “You have less than an hour. I want out of here by no later than ten. Rio, come if you want or feel free to laze about the house. I’m sure walking might be a bit…” but she was cut off by a piece of toast smacking her in the back of the head.</p><p>“Out, Jen!”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>Huffing slightly and picking up a mug of coffee that read ‘I don’t do mornings’, Agatha glanced slyly at Rio who was grinning into her toast.</p><p>“I am a little sore, you know. Didn’t exactly go the slow and gentle route.”</p><p>Agatha squinted down at Rio and released a breath of laughter, “Oh you loved it.”</p><p>The response came immediately in the form of a devilish grin as Rio sat up further, letting the blankets fall to her lap and exposing the fruit of Agatha’s midnight labours that bloomed across her neck and chest. “What gave me away?” She asked coyly, now raising the mug Agatha was holding to her own lips and taking a small sip.</p><p>Agatha tried to keep her gaze on Rio’s face but soon gave up her attempts at moral fortitude and instead let her eyes roam over Rio’s body, surveying the pretty pattern she’d left there.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to leave so many,” she admitted, still surprised at her own actions.</p><p>“You were very drunk. And very horny.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and took another sip of coffee, as if the strong liquid would clear her mind of the depraved thoughts it was once again conjuring up.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?” Rio asked cautiously, and Agatha glanced back at her, her body freezing slightly.</p><p>What did she mean? It? Sex? Money? Wanda?</p><p>Agatha’s over the top reaction to a woman she had once called ‘wife’ touching a woman she’d barely known for two days?</p><p>She cleared her throat and ran a hand through her hair, ever the political savant. “If it’s money you want to discuss, just name the price and I can get it transferred across. That’s not a problem.”</p><p>Her gaze flickered back to Rio and for a brief, heartbreaking second she saw the younger woman’s whole face fall completely.</p><p>But Agatha turned away, deciding that if she was going to be rejected, discover that the escort truly had just been playing a role, she’d rather know now.</p><p>“I don’t want to be paid for it.”</p><p>Agatha had moved the tray to the side table and almost let it slip from her hand as she turned back to stare openly at Rio. Suddenly confused. Suddenly doubting her own hearing.</p><p>Somewhere between leaving Jen in the kitchen and waking she’d convinced herself that Rio had been playing the part. The consummate professional.</p><p>“I said I don’t want to be paid,” Rio clarified again, and Agatha watched as her throat bobbed from a thick swallow. “Unless that’s how you want it. I don’t want payment.”</p><p>“Okay,” the word spilled from Agatha’s lips like a prayer, sent up to thank whatever god was out there for having created this woman before her.</p><p>Rio sighed and reached to cradle Agatha’s face, moving once more to take her new favourite spot in Agatha’s lap. Her dark eyes roamed Agatha’s features and though exposing, especially in the harsh morning light, Agatha let her.</p><p>“Wanda cheated on me. A lot. For a long time.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze widened a little at the admission, neither of them having expected it to come.</p><p>Agatha’s hands moved to settle on Rio’s waist, warm from where she’d been holding her coffee and Rio stretched beneath her hold, pressing a little closer.</p><p>“It took a long time for me to…” she sighed and dropped her gaze from Rio’s focusing in on the pout of her lips.</p><p>“I found you months ago. Some client of mine had mentioned something about you. No details just… mentioned. And it took me a while to find you. But I did. Then I thought about you every day for a month.”</p><p>Her gaze flickered back up to Rio’s as the other woman began toying with the ends of Agatha’s hair over her chest, keeping a steady watch on her.</p><p>“I arranged a meeting with you. From another burner account pretending to be someone else. In a coffee shop, on the upper west side.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed slightly then and she tilted her head, “That was you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I get no shows all the time. People get frightened, chicken out, but… I remember that one. You’d asked me to wear a green scarf?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and swallowed thickly, “I just wanted to see you. To know what it might be like to talk to you. But I couldn’t go through with it. Until one day… Wanda had reached out. Asking to get back together. And I couldn’t stand the idea of,” but her voice trailed away, noticing the slight shift in Rio’s soft gaze.</p><p>“Back together?”</p><p>Agatha nodded once and rubbed her thumbs soothingly over Rio’s rib cage, noticing the hold Rio had to the ends of her hair moving to a more solid one, settling over her chest.</p><p>“I knew I couldn’t come to the wedding alone. Not knowing Wanda would find out.”</p><p>She cleared her throat and dropped her gaze from Rio’s searching eyes again, “So I reached back out to you with another burner and… here we are.”</p><p>This information seemed to have taken Rio aback and Agatha realised how deranged it must have sounded. Having known about Rio months before Rio even knew she existed. Having seen Rio? Been in the same room as her? Spoken to her? It may have been too much.</p><p>But what Agatha didn’t know is that Rio’s head was full of the pictures she’d seen of Agatha and Wanda, full of smiles and matching rings.</p><p>The younger woman swallowed thickly, knowing that if the answer to her next question was what she suspected it may be, that she had to go back to professional Rio, back to negliges instead of boy shorts.</p><p>“Do you want to get back together with her?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed deeply as she looked up at Rio, beyond confused as to how she’d even arrived at that conclusion.</p><p>Instinctively she dropped her hold of Rio and held her more firmly at her hips, leaning up to her, “How could you think that? How could you…?” Her mind scrambled for the words as she shook her head and released a frustrated sound, “I lost it last night because she was all over <em>you</em>. I couldn’t stand her touching you. The idea of anyone but me…” she sighed and dropped her head again, letting it land softly against Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“All I can think about is you.”</p><p>Rio pulled back a little and, panicked, Agatha assumed she was pulling away. She looked up desperately at the woman and uttered a soft, “No.”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t going anywhere. Rio instead had pulled back in order to be able to lean down and press her lips firmly to Agatha’s. She kissed her to let her know that she wanted her too. That she was desperate to have her. Have more of her.</p><p>Agatha’s hands began to pull at Rio, suddenly even more hungrily aware that Rio was naked.</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened with a soft moan as Agatha pressed her tongue past her lips and Agatha, needing everything Rio could give her, moved her hand round to press against Rio’s soaked core.</p><p>Rio reacted immediately and bucked into Agatha’s searching fingers, but pulled her face away shaking her head. “No, she’ll kill us.”</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly and whined as if someone had taken away her favourite toy. “I can handle Jen,” she grumbled unhappily and continued her movements against Rio.</p><p>“No, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio groaned and held Agatha’s wrist still, making her stop just as Agatha was exactly where she wanted her to be.</p><p>“We don’t have long and I want to get through the week without Jen killing you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and was about to throw her arms out in frustration when Rio crawled from her lap and went to drape herself against the doorframe to the bathroom.</p><p>“So come fuck me in the shower and we can save time.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth went dry as Rio winked across at her and she practically fell over herself to chase Rio into the bathroom. Far from the usual sophisticated elegance.</p><p>Rio would be the death of her. Nevermind Jen.</p><p>As Agatha stripped herself of her pyjamas Rio leaned in to turn on the shower, and Agatha silently thanked Jen for insisting on a walk in shower separate to the bath. God bless primadonnas.</p><p>She backed Rio gently into the wall this time, making sure her movements were measured and slow so no one would slip, making up for her frenzy last night.</p><p>As the cool water battered down against their hot bodies Agatha buried her face against Rio’s neck and placed softer, teasing kisses there, pressing her knee up to Rio’s centre.</p><p>Rio moaned as she stretched her neck out to give more access and found Agatha’s hand again to guide it down between them. Her free hand matched Agatha’s movements and their mouths met again as Agatha wasted no time on pushing two fingers inside of Rio.</p><p>Rio moaned and threw her head back as she adjusted to the intrusion, still a little sore from last night. “Baby,” she whined softly, capturing Agatha’s lips in a heated kiss again, “Go easy on me.”</p><p>Agatha laughed quietly against her lips and kept her pace slow, gently pushing in and out of Rio as she felt Rio push into her.</p><p>Rio marvelled at how tight Agatha felt around her but felt little resistance as she twisted and pressed up against Agatha’s clit. She made light work of making Agatha moan against her ear, scissoring her fingers slowly into the woman to stretch her out.</p><p>“Fuck me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes almost rolled into the back of her head at the feeling of Rio inside of her and she had to focus in hard to keep up her own movements against Rio.</p><p>Whilst Rio was firmer, her pace more exacting as she pushed Agatha closer and closer to the edge, Agatha remained as gentle as she could, focusing on Rio’s clit to bring her to orgasm.</p><p>Once Rio had pushed a third finger into Agatha the older woman grunted and husked into Rio’s ear, desperate for her to come before she did. And she knew she didn’t have long.</p><p>“Come for me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need told twice, the constant teasing on her clit and Agatha’s fingers moving inside of her made her come hard as she gripped to Agatha’s shoulder with her free hand, digging her nails in as her thighs began to quake.</p><p>Agatha reacted almost instantly to Rio coming undone around her as her own orgasm riped through just seconds later.</p><p>She pulled out of Rio sooner than she’d have liked and pressed her forehead gently against Rio’s with a sly smile on her lips. Rio’s fingers remained inside Agatha, apparently also reluctant to pull out as Agatha twitched above her.</p><p>“Fuck Jen,” Agatha said softly, “Let’s just stay here all day.”</p><p>“I’ll barely be able to walk,” Rio chided as she slowly pulled her hand away.</p><p>“That’s fine. I can carry you wherever you need to go.”</p><p>It was then, as she was able to think a bit straighter without Rio’s touch on her that she notified Rio’s thighs still shaking slightly and she moved her hands down to rest steady on her hips. “You know… seeing you like this. It makes me wonder what you’d be like with more than just my fingers.”</p><p>Rio released a sudden laugh and draped her arms lazily around Agatha’s shoulders, pressing her hips up against her. “Oh?”</p><p>Agatha just hummed slyly and gave Rio’s hip a gentle squeeze.</p><p>Huffing out an amused breath Rio then began to fidget beneath Agatha’s hold and nudged her nose, “Shower. C’mon.”</p><p>Reluctantly, and with a scowl on her face, Agatha pulled back from Rio and shuffled backwards to be directly under the stream, reaching out to pull Rio towards her again and watching closely as Rio adjusted her gait, still clearly a little sore.</p><p>Agatha bent down and picked up the shampoo, silently lathering her hands before reaching across and lathering Rio’s hair.</p><p>The gentleness and consideration of the gesture made Rio melt into the other woman, and soon they were as good as pressed against each other again.</p><p>They showered in silence, each taking it in turns to take and use whatever lotions and potions they needed.</p><p>The only noises coming when Agatha reached down to gently run her fingers through Rio’s centre, cleaning her gently and sealing it with a quick kiss to her jaw as Rio groaned a little.</p><p>By the time they were done, wrapped in only the finest Egyptian cotton sheets, Rio had gained more control of her legs and they both set out to change.</p><p>Agatha, once her hair was mostly dry and her makeup done, settled on a pair of high waisted slacks that hugged her hips and a casual shirt which she left two buttons undone on.</p><p>She turns for the first time to Rio and almost dropped her phone at the sight.</p><p>Rio was standing at the other side of the bed, her hair piled up in a messy bun, wearing a black lacy bra and cotton shorts that had the words ‘fuck me’ on them.</p><p>“That is just unfair,” Agatha announced, catching Rio’s attention from where she’d been deciding what to wear.</p><p>Rio’s brow quirked up at the accusation before breaking out into a grin when she realised what Agatha was referring to. “Why? Don’t you want to?”</p><p>“You can’t do that to me.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Agatha thought she’d lose it all over again at the sight of Rio pouting across at her and running her hand along the trail of marks left across her skin.</p><p>But she held her ground and forced herself to not throw herself at Rio’s feet. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>Rio just laughed and turned back around to continue digging through her clothes, “So where are we going? How fancy is this place?”</p><p>Agatha grumbled a bit at the memory of why they were actually putting on clothes and sighed, “Probably quite fancy. But wear whatever you want. Jen won’t mind and all I care about is taking your clothes <em>off</em>.”</p><p>Rio snorted but soon settled on a soft cotton grey tshirt and black jeans.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze roved over her again before she finally opened the door and begrudgingly led Rio down to her impatient best friend.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After what felt like an age of listening to inane conversation, squashed between Rio and Jen in the back of an Uber Black, Agatha thought that the day couldn’t possibly get worse.</p><p>Her head was thumping and the one thing keeping her from dragging Rio back to the safety of their bed was her long-term affection for her best friend. As much as she wanted to kill her sometimes.</p><p>Along with her headache, she’d been trying to distract herself from two very distinct things: the topic of how important facial toners were and the feeling of Rio’s hand, wrapped just around the middle of her thigh.</p><p>One was much more welcome than the other.</p><p>She took her phone out to bury herself in work for a while.</p><p>But the usual solace and distraction she took in her work, in checking her emails, berating senators, and planning a busy schedule of talks, events, and rallies, didn’t help her in the half an hour it took them to make it to Maison De Couture.</p><p>They pulled up in the middle of a busy London street to what looked like a Georgian Gentleman’s mansion. The brilliant white facade housed what Agatha could only guess were millions of dollars worth of dresses. And she knew the day would be a long one with Jen desperate to try everything she could.</p><p>Because, as Agatha had found out only a week ago, although Jen had picked her dress and was getting it tailored, “it couldn’t possibly hurt to try on every other dress in existence”.</p><p>Agatha had put the phone down on her friend then.</p><p>The car door was opened by a tall man in tails, his gloved hand accepted by Jen, ignored by Agatha, and accepted again by Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s mood plummeted further when they entered a room where good taste went to die and she was assaulted by pink and white roses from every angle.</p><p>“God,” she muttered ruefully, catching Rio’s eye and widening her own, “You really should have stayed home.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and moved closer to press a soft kiss to Agatha’s cheek as she muttered, “And miss seeing you in a place like this? Never.”</p><p>Agatha just grumbled but took the opportunity to glance down at Rio’s neck, noticing for the first time that she’d done an almost otherworldly good job at hiding the evidence of last night. “How did…?”</p><p>But Rio shook her head and laughed with a wriggle of her brows, “Practice.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pursed a little at the response, suddenly faced with a reality check that slapped her in the face.</p><p>Maybe it was the dull ache of her head that had snapped her down to earth. Maybe it was just that she’d pushed the thoughts so deep down that it took two orgasms and now sleep to wake her to them.</p><p>But over the months of research, or scouring the internet, personal ads, trying to find out how to contact Rio Vidal, and finally finding her, speaking to her over email, she’d forgotten that… other people had too.</p><p>Flashes of other women pressing Rio against a wall, pressing open mouthed kisses to her skin, fucking her in the way Agatha had last night. In different ways. In better ways.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt all the whisky she’d drank to dull her senses churn in her stomach and rise to the base of her throat.</p><p>It wasn’t just that Agatha was paying Rio to be here with her, it was that other women had done it too. Would continue to do it.</p><p>And no amount of marking could prevent that.</p><p>The bruises would fade, Rio would get another client.</p><p>Even if she had given her a freebie last night.</p><p>Was that what it was? A freebie to entice Agatha more?</p><p>Her fingers began twitching at her sides as she stared ahead of her, now oblivious to the woman who stood beside her and stared across at her with soft brown eyes.</p><p>But Rio was already becoming more atuned to Agatha’s emotions. And besides, she was never very subtle anyway.</p><p>So she moved closer and reached to still the fidgeting fingers at Agatha’s side.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped suddenly and stared at the place their hands met, visibly sucking in a heavy breath and twitching slightly before she removed her hand entirely from Rio’s, glancing at her quickly before turning her attention to the woman now showering Jen with an absurd amount of compliments.</p><p>“And your skin! My god!”</p><p>Rio, unsure of what exactly had just happened between them, opened her mouth to speak but closed it again, seeing the stern profile of the woman who just an hour ago had been looking at her like she was something precious, something to be treasured.</p><p>The whiplash of Agatha’s actions then to her reception now was… painful. And Rio had to throw herself back into her professional persona in order to push down the hurt.</p><p>As the little group were ushered up to their own private suite, Rio trailed slightly behind Agatha, not daring to reach out again for her own sake, more than anything else.</p><p>Agatha, oblivious to Rio’s inner turmoil, threw her hair back as she entered the new area, sweeping away from Jen and Rio to drape herself across a nearby chaise. She took her phone out again and disappeared into work.</p><p>“You could pretend to be interested,” Jen called after her, receiving a raised middle finger in response.</p><p>“Bitch.”</p><p>Rio smiled kindly at Jen, allowing her gaze to sweep over Agatha before she turned back to the bride to be.</p><p>“So, where do we start?”</p><p>“First. Drinks! Then, I’ll start trying my favourites and you two can tell me how beautiful I look.”</p><p>“Easily done,” Rio confirmed with a nod, accepting a glass of champagne from a tray that appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>“Baby?” She turned, holding another glass out towards Agatha, “You want one?”</p><p>Agatha had glanced up at the nickname but didn’t meet Rio’s gaze before turning back to her phone. “No. Thanks. Coffee’s good.”</p><p>“Geez, what’s happened to you?” Jen called over loudly as she accepted her own champagne.</p><p>“I know this isn’t exactly your thing but c’mon Agatha. Fake it.”</p><p>“That’s more Rio’s thing.”</p><p>The comment was cold, sharp, and unnecessary.</p><p>Even Agatha paused her typing and seemed to think for a second before she returned to it, her shoulders slinking back slightly into the chair.</p><p>Rio stared openly across at Agatha, her mouth open in shock and indignation. Fake it? Fake it?</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed and her tongue poked the inside of her cheek as she moved over to Agatha, almost on autopilot.</p><p>Jen, unsure what exactly was happening, shook her head and motioned to the lady waiting for instruction in the corner. “Yeah, these three. Thanks.”</p><p>She glanced back at the two women and raised her voice slightly, “I’ll be in the dressing room. Agatha. Behave yourself.”</p><p>Rio remained standing in front of Agatha, silently willing her to look up at her. “Agatha,” she tried gently, “What the hell happened?”</p><p>She placed down the two champagne glasses on the side with slightly more force than she meant to and rounded back on Agatha again.</p><p>Agatha remained intent on her phone, taping out an email that she’d never send and that didn’t make much sense because all she could think about was that she’d done it again. And this time in front of Jen.</p><p>She’d exposed herself. She’d admitted weakness. And this time she couldn’t blame alcohol.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried again, this time leaning in to try and force Agatha to look at her.</p><p>“You need to look at me. You need to tell me what’s wrong.”</p><p>“I said,” Agatha started, struggling immensely to keep her voice from shaking from frustration. “Coffee’s good.”</p><p>Sharp blue eyes lifted up to meet pools of deep brown and Rio gazed down at Agatha, realising not for the first time, that she was effectively a stranger. And that Rio was back to being just a client.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio uttered coolly, turning away to order Agatha her coffee.</p><p>Having found a worker willing to make and deliver said coffee, Rio took herself off to the nearest bathroom to have a moment to herself.</p><p>Her body ached deliciously from the night before and as she stretched her tired muscles by the neat little row of sinks her gaze fell down to the now covered bruises on her neck.</p><p>She frowned deeply as she gazed at them, her fingers reaching to gently press on the sensitive skin there. Was it because she’d joked about having had to conceal hickeys before?</p><p>Surely not.</p><p>Then again, this was a woman who had crashed out because someone had held Rio’s hand and held her smiles for too long.</p><p>Sulking, she supposed, was better than drunken rage. Then again, she hadn’t exactly minded being manhandled by the brunette.</p><p>And before she could think any deeper on the matter, she grabbed a nearby washcloth and scrubbed the concealer off her neck.</p><p>If Agatha was going to shut her down, if she was going to sulk and lash out because Rio had reminded her that yes, she’d had hickeys before, then Rio was going to act up to her.</p><p><em>Unprofessional</em>, she chastised herself. Rio from a week ago would never dream of acting up to a client, it was in her nature to be stubborn, to push boundaries but only within the rules. Only when necessary. Never if her feelings were hurt, and never because she felt more than cool detachment for a client.</p><p>But she was in too deep, the seesaw of Agatha’s attitude towards her throwing her so off kilter that she couldn’t help herself.</p><p>So, for good measure, before she left the bathroom she put her hair up into a messy bun.</p><p>Precisely five minutes later, and precisely two minutes after Jen had arrived back, dressed in what looked like a giant meringue, Rio strode back into the suite and placed herself in front of the two women.</p><p>“Oh good, Rio! What do you think?”</p><p>Jen twirled around, her skirts threatening to knock the table close by with the champagnes. “Fabulous, right? Very… Lady Di.”</p><p>Rio fixed her expression into one of delight and nodded enthusiastically, “It’s something.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes at the somewhat lacklustre response but soon forgot what she was going to say as her gaze dropped to Rio’s neck. “What the hell. You got an exhibitionist kink or something?”</p><p>Agatha, who up until this point had been staring unenthusiastically at Jen’s brochure of bouquet choices looked up and stared at Rio, her mouth opening somewhat in shock. “What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and slipped past Jen, with some trouble, to fetch a champagne, taking a sip before she said, “Well, I figured I don’t mind who sees.”</p><p>Jen laughed, “This is a classy joint. Agatha, control your woman. And no more… making any of those.” She gestured vaguely to Rio’s neck and then called for the assistant to come and help her shuffle back out of the room.</p><p>In the silence that followed Rio could feel Agatha’s scrutinising gaze on her. She refused to look around.</p><p>“You’re being a brat.”</p><p>“Oh? <em>I’m</em> being a brat?”</p><p>Rio rounded then, staring down at Agatha who sat ramrod straight, still clutching the bouquet options book in her lap.</p><p>“Did I just suddenly shut you out and stop talking?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed as she glared up at Rio, “Why do you even care? I’m paying you to be here. Just like everyone else does.”</p><p>Rio felt a flush rise in her cheeks and a fury erupt in her chest and all of a sudden she was stepping forwards, her tongue poised to strike.</p><p>But as Agatha shifted slightly, preparing for the onslaught, she hesitated and turned away from the woman, taking strides to sit across from her in a love seat.</p><p>They remained that way until Jen came back in.</p><p>Neither of them willing to give in. Rio forcing herself to remain professional. Agatha terrified of showing herself up again.</p><p>Jen looked bewildered.</p><p>Perhaps it was the diamonds sparkling across her mermaid-fit dress, or perhaps it was the scowl on her face as she moved to the large central mirror with a mini stage, but she looked like she was going to combust.</p><p>“Whatever it is,” she called out to no one in particular as the assistants started running around fetching different jewellery options for her.</p><p>“Cut it out. This is about me. Me and my beautiful dresses. Not you two horndogs and whatever <em>this</em> is.”</p><p>Agatha was the first to move this time, considering Jen was her friend and all.</p><p>She went to stand by her and crossed her arms over her chest as she tried to focus in on the here and now, rather than the who and when of Rio’s past that had been tormenting her for the past hour.</p><p>“You look like a disco ball.”</p><p>“Yeah yeah but when else am I ever going to be this <em>shiny</em>.”</p><p>“You’ll blind someone.”</p><p>“And what a privilege it would be to have me as the last thing you see.”</p><p>As Rio watched the two friends bicker she swallowed down the remainder of her glass of champagne. One down. Two more. Then done.</p><p>Instead of reaching for the second though, she pulled her phone from her pocket and logged into her emails.</p><p>Distraction.</p><p>Two client requests. One new. One a semi-regular.</p><p>Her thumbs hovered over the email that she recognised, feeling torn between responding to something, someone she could control. And the whirlwind of emotions and passion that she’d realised she would never get to the bottom of, standing across the room, now watching her.</p><p>Against her instincts, she clicked into the email.</p><p>
<em>“Sweetheart,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I miss you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>June 20th I have a client dinner I’d like to show you off at. Then come to the cape with me for the long weekend?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Abigail”</em>
</p><p>The sharp intake of breath that hit Rio’s ears as she went to check her calendar, made her heart stop.</p><p>In her deliberation, Agatha had walked over to her. Intent on giving her an instruction from Jen.</p><p>She’d seen the email. Rule number 1, along with a million other rules that weekend, had been broken.</p><p>Don’t speak to clients about other clients. Don’t let them know.</p><p>Rio locked her phone in one swift movement and then looked up at the woman now staring down at her with a mixture of fury and embarrassment.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha. I was just checking my emails. Do you need me?”</p><p>Rio watched with concern as Agatha took a steadying breath and ran a hand through her hair. “Jen wants us to try on dresses.”</p><p>With that she stormed back over to the assistant who looked like she would rather be anywhere else in that moment.</p><p>Rio joined them a moment later, chewing on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>They were taken to the larger of the dressing rooms assigned just to Jen and party.</p><p>Whilst the assistant started talking through dress options, Rio watched Agatha from the corner of her eye, her fingers twitching at her sides again and her posture tight and straight.</p><p>“Yes, thank you.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at Agatha’s clipped tone and saw the young assistant flinch.</p><p>“We’ll be fine from here, really,” Rio offered in a more gentle tone and stepped towards the woman, touching her arm reassuringly.</p><p>Agatha made a noise behind her halfway between a scoff and a growl and Rio ignored her as she held the door open for the young girl and closed it behind her, turning the lock as she did.</p><p>She pressed her back to the door and watched as Agatha moved through the rack of dresses hung out for them. Her fingers brushed the fabric as she went, but her mind was elsewhere.</p><p>“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t contact your other clients when you’re with me. You assured me that I had you for the week.”</p><p>Her voice was clipped, distant, and Rio knew she had to take the hit on this one.</p><p>“I’m sorry. It won’t happen again. You were busy with Jen and I…”</p><p>But the excuse died in her throat, realising this sort of unprofessional behaviour would never usually happen and she didn’t have an excuse for it. “It won’t happen again.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>They fell into an uncomfortable silence then as Agatha continued to flick through the dresses, finally pulling out one black silk number with spaghetti straps and a delicate, floral pattern across it.</p><p>Her gaze darted to Rio’s before she disappeared behind the solitary curtained off area in the middle of the room to change.</p><p>Rio released a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding and went to review her own options. Welcoming the distraction.</p><p>With nowhere else to change, and having picked a red dress with cutouts at the sides, she threw her tshirt over her head and shimmied out of her jeans.</p><p>It was as she was bending over to remove her socks that she felt eyes on her.</p><p>She whipped around inelegantly and found Agatha staring at her, having just changed into a dress that wasn’t, in Rio’s opinion, wedding appropriate. But that Rio liked very much.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze fell to Rio’s chest and the tracks she’d left from the previous night.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried for what must be the third time since they’d arrived, trying to appeal to the softer side of the woman she’d found last night. “Can we talk about why you’re distancing yourself?”</p><p>The brunette moved then, grasping Rio’s face and pulling her in for a seering, desperate kiss.</p><p>Gasping in surprise and a little relief, Rio allowed Agatha to devour her. She grasped at her sides, trying to pull Agatha closer, control the kiss.</p><p>But somewhere in the back of her mind, she was still indignant, furious that Agatha had dropped her so easily, with no explanation.</p><p>And now she was taking. Taking what Rio had earlier willing given, and was now reluctant to.</p><p>Rules were there for her clients. But never before had she felt it to be more true: the rules were there for Rio.</p><p>With a grunt Agatha moved their bodies to the mirror and even as she cradled Rio’s head, she pressed the woman firmly against it.</p><p>Trapping her between her body and the wall-length reflective surface.</p><p>It wasn’t as frenzied as the night before. The difference between drunken lust and sober, passionate want.</p><p>Rio’s body was reacting before her mind could keep up. Agatha’s hold on her was vicelike and just as she felt like she couldn’t breath from the intensity of the kiss Agatha’s mouth left her own and pressed against her tender neck.</p><p>“Agatha,” she half-moaned, half warned.</p><p>But Agatha was too busy, focusing on reaching as much of Rio as possible.</p><p>Strong hands turned her round then and Rio caught herself, hands pressed against the glass as Agatha pressed into her from behind.</p><p>“Agatha,” she tried again, betrayed by her heaving chest and the curve of her spine as she pressed back into the desperate woman behind her.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slipped beneath Rio’s bra and palmed at her breast as her other slipped beneath the waistband of Rio’s shorts, eliciting a groan from the woman as she found her as soaked as she felt.</p><p>“$15,000!” Rio shouted, her voice catching in her throat as she rolled her hips into Agatha’s hand, “A-Agatha.”</p><p>“$15,000,” she said again, turning her head slightly to glance back at Agatha, who hadn’t moved away, but who instead had frozen, her hands still against Rio.</p><p>“That’s what I charge. It’s the basics. Kissing… penetration, me or you.” She swallowed and tried to steady her breaths as she continued, “anything else is extra.”</p><p>Agatha’s blown pupils found Rio’s then, and a flash of something Rio couldn’t read flickered across the woman’s face.</p><p>It was then she pulled away, sliding her hands entirely away from Rio’s body and putting two steps of distance between them.</p><p>Rio turned back to the hazy mirror, frosted with their hot breath. She looked at her reflection and swallowed down her feelings as she slowly turned back to Agatha and raised her chin slightly, refusing to lose any more dignity, “If you want to treat me as someone you’ve hired. Then you need to know how much I charge.”</p>

<p>The look on Agatha’s face almost made Rio’s whole resolve crumple. She looked so hurt that Rio’s whole body ached to reach out to her, to take it back, and to allow this woman to keep toying with her emotions. Though she knew that wouldn’t do either of them any good.</p><p>“How much?” Agatha whispered in such a small, fragile voice that Rio gulped down tears that threatened to pool in her eyes.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How much? Last night. This morning. How much was it?”</p><p>Rio’s chest ached so painfully then that she took a step closer only to have Agatha take a step back.</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>Doing the maths quickly, trying to remember what would count as ‘more’, what she’d charge extra for. What she’d have discussed and revised and negotiated with other clients that she’d just given to Agatha. What she was now having to quantify, to strip her feelings from.</p><p>“$27,000,” she whispered, her previous strength leaving her as she blinked across at Agatha, now so out of reach in more ways than one.</p><p>Agatha nodded once and turned away, marching over to fetch her phone.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and spoke again, “I can detail the costs, if that helps.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said curtly, already tapping away at her phone with her back to Rio. “That’s fine. Thank you.”</p><p>Rio saw her own phone light up from across the room as the transfer came through and she took a shaky breath as she moved towards it.</p><p>As she took her first step, Agatha swept from the room without so much as a glance in her direction.</p><p>Reaching for her phone and chewing her lower lip Rio opened her banking app and saw a deposit had been made to her account of $30,000.</p><p>It was hours later that they finally left Maison De Couture. And not once had Agatha looked at Rio.</p><p>Jen, deciding that whatever was going on she wouldn’t be getting to the bottom of anyway, had instead been focusing on herself. Doubling down on her vanity as she continued to flounce and flourish in the dresses that she was not going to be wearing to her wedding but that she just couldn’t resist trying on.</p><p>Rio had slipped back into her professional demeanour, keeping herself light and bright for the sake of Jen, and despite her feelings towards her in that moment, out of respect for Agatha, for the job she’d been hired to do.</p><p>By the time the three of them were piling into an Uber again, Agatha took the front passenger seat and was once again focused only on her phone.</p><p>“It’s this <em>tiny</em> Italian that Lilia loves,” Jen was saying to Rio, “Honestly the best tagliatelle you’ve ever tasted. Lilia knows everyone there so the service is always great and if you just ignore the gingham table clothes you can actually have a good time.”</p><p>“Rio won’t be coming,” came Agatha’s voice from the front seat. “She has to work, don’t you <em>sweetheart</em>.”</p><p>For the first time since the dressing room, Agatha had turned in her seat to gaze across at Rio. And it was withering.</p><p>Rio’s stomach churned uncomfortably as she nodded, unable to say anything as she held Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>“Work?” Questioned Jen with a laugh, “Aren’t you a gardener? What work could you possibly have to do?”</p><p>“Oh, client queries… planning, you know.”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Jen said suspiciously, squinting across at Rio. “Well we can drop you off at home first before Aggie and I go and grab a drink. Hair of the dog, Agatha, you look like hell still.”</p><p>“Don’t call me that,” Agatha snapped, referring to the nickname that made her feel both five years old and about a hundred all at once.</p><p>Jen just laughed and tapped away at her uber app to change the journey plan, not bothering to vocally tell the driver.</p><p>After that Rio slinked back in her seat and let Jen’s voice wash over her as she continued to gush about how radiant the gowns had been.</p><p>Soon enough they were pulling up to the house and Rio unbuckled herself, squeezing Jen’s arm in goodbye before she leant in and up and pressed a quick kiss to Agatha’s temple. Keeping up appearances, y’know.</p><p>Before she could even gage a reaction from the woman she disappeared out the car and let herself into the house.</p><p>Knowing Alice was there she shouted out in greeting before hurrying up to the attic bedroom where she could at last be alone and at peace.</p><p>Throwing herself across the bed Rio buried her face in the pillow which smelled… she pulled away, realising that she’d just been breathing in the faint scent of Agatha’s perfume. Like some lovestruck idiot.</p><p>As she was rolling off and moving to grab her phone, there was a knock at the door and a soft call of, “Hey, Rio? Mind if I come in?”</p><p>Rio, if it had been anyone else, would have pretended not to hear. But it was Alice and she knew she couldn’t lie. “Of course.”</p><p>“Hey,” Alice said cautiously as she opened the door and stepped into the room. It closed with a click behind her and she leant back against it, “Jen’s been texting me all afternoon. And I know you’re alone here with Agatha and all her friends, staying in our house…”</p><p>She trailed off and shifted uncomfortably, “Anyway I just wanted to make sure you were okay and say if you wanted to talk, you can.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders fell, and she moved to perch on the edge of the bed, rubbing her thighs in an effort to calm her nervous energy.</p><p>“Thank you. I appreciate that, I do. But I’m okay.”</p><p>Alice nodded and looked Rio over for a second before she spoke again, frowning across at the stranger in her home, “She can be difficult. She can be an absolute terror. But she’s been through the wringer. Her mom, Wanda, she’s not had it easy.”</p><p>Rio just nodded, acknowledging the information but trying desperately to not allow it to break her resolve, to change her decision.</p><p>She had to be strictly professional now. No emotions involved.</p><p>“We’re fine, Alice. Really. Think we just need a day apart, is all.”</p><p>Alice knew she’d been shut down and so didn’t push it again, shifting from foot to foot once more as she shoved her hands into her jean pockets.</p><p>“Well, I actually have tickets to this douchey art show tomorrow that I’m not exactly keen on going to. Jen needs to see the florist anyway and I’m sure Agatha would rather poke her eyes out than do either. Wanna come?”</p><p>The corners of Rio’s lips flickered into an almost smile and she laughed a little as she nodded. “That sounds like fun.”</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>With that, Alice left the room, and Rio to her own thoughts.</p><p>The rest of the evening went by slowly, with Alice stopping by once more to say goodbye before she left for the restaurant. Rio had spent her time taking a long shower, ignoring the memory of Agatha’s hands in her hair, on her body, as she lathered herself and washed away the day. She then responded to her potential new client, outlining the basics, her daily rate, any rules about intimacy, what she’d expect in terms of communication, everything she should have provided Agatha in the first place that would have prevented this mess.</p><p>She then responded to Abigail: a regular of hers who loved nothing more than to show Rio off, as well as keep her in the bedroom. An heiress with unlimited stamina and a penchant for taking, not giving, Rio didn’t mind her company - much less the payday that always came after - but she wasn’t exactly feeling the energy of another weekend with a client.</p><p>Still. It would maybe distract her.</p><p>She read the email again, a client dinner, a weekend at the Cape.</p><p>
<em>Abigail,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’d love to. Send me the details and I’ll be there.</em>
</p><p>
<em>R</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Before long, Rio collapsed into the bed, her pyjamas of choice now the silky neglige she wore to keep up the pretence for clients of ‘oh this? Oh I always sleep in this?’. It was sexy, classy, everything she was usually hired to be.</p><p>As she clambered into bed and spent the next hour or so tossing and turning she made an executive decision.</p><p>She had to email Agatha, lay down the law. It would keep them both safe, and sane.</p><p>So she spent the next hour tapping out her expectations, ground rules, and rates. Drafting and redrafting, trying to be as profession and prescriptive as possible.</p><p>She found Agatha’s personal email on her website.</p><p>
<em>Agatha,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I wanted to ensure that we’re both on the same page from now on.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was wrong of me to accept your initial engagement without first laying out my rules, and expectations. They keep us both safe, and enable us to finish this week on the same page.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I have categorised everything under the below headings. If anything is unclear, you have questions, or you wish to negotiate something, please let me know.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Basics/Day-to-Day<br/>
- Firstly, you can be assured of my complete discretion, something I take very seriously. I also expect the same from you.<br/>
- Safety: if I feel unsafe at any point during our time together I will terminate our contract. Equally, I understand that clients may also, for any reason, feel unsafe during our time together. I acknowledge that you too may immediately terminate our contract. Within reason, and given my half-upfront fee has been delivered. More on rates below.<br/>
- I will adhere to any parameters you set out, again within reason. This includes, but is not limited to: my history, our history as a couple, my clothes, makeup, and interactions with others.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Sexual/Intimate Activity<br/>
- $15,000 in addition to my daily rate is my base rate for any sexual activity. This does not include any ‘extras’: listed below, anything additional can be negotiated:<br/>
- Extras: Cunnilingus, giving/receiving ($5,000); Use of toys, giving/receiving ($1,000+ - at my discretion); Anal, giving/receiving ($10,000); marking/love bites ($1,000 for every visible mark left after any activity); anything additional, we can discuss.<br/>
- Use of safe words for anything beyond what I would consider the ‘regular’ is non-negotiable. My safe word is: Willow.<br/>
- Intimacy: I understand that most clients like the ‘girlfriend experience’, especially when in public. I will give/receive affection in public. This will be spontaneous and unless you have specific things you are uncomfortable with, or wish me to do specifically, I will continue to use my own judgement. Including but not limited to: kissing, hand holding, nicknames, etc. From what I’ve seen so far you are comfortable with this sort of behaviour in public. Please let me know if this has changed or you wish me to do more/less of anything.<br/>
- Sleeping: I’ve established that I’m comfortable sharing a bed. Intimacy in bed (excluding any sexual activity) is entirely at my own discretion, but something I’ll not initiate, you may request or initiate to your own comfort level.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rates<br/>
- Daily Rate: $25,000.<br/>
- Expenses: I will cover my own expenses, within reason.<br/>
- Rate is calculated midnight to midnight.<br/>
- The total for our time together, excluding any extras, is: $175,000.<br/>
- Half the fee is usually to be paid up front. In this case, please transfer half the fee within 24 hours of receipt of this email. That is: $87,500.</em>
</p><p>
<em>If anything above causes concern, or you have questions, please let me know.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Our time together is for you. I want to make it the best I possibly can. I’m here for you, Agatha.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yours,<br/>
Rio</em>
</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath as she finished the email, scanning it over and over again to make sure she’d captured all the most important pieces. It felt formal, far too formal for what she’d already shared with Agatha. But it had to be that way so Rio could maintain her distance, keep herself level-headed.</p><p>She pressed send.</p><p>She fell asleep hours before Agatha crashed into the room.</p><p>Waking with a start she sat up in shock and blinked into the darkness. “Agatha? Be careful…” but her plea was lost on the woman as she crashed into the bathroom and slammed the door behind her.</p><p>Rio remained still and silent, listening for sounds of vomiting, or crying, or any sign that Agatha was still alive in there.</p><p>It was close to half an hour later that Agatha emerged, her eyes bloodshot even in the dim, her hair now piled up on top of her head.</p><p>The woman didn’t even look at Rio as she sought out her pyjamas and struggled into them. Rio turned away to give the woman her dignity and soon felt the bed dip and a rush of cold air as Agatha lifted the duvet and settled in.</p><p>Turning back she was met with only Agatha’s back, the woman having curled in on herself.</p><p>Rio didn’t sleep a wink after that.</p><p>But the next morning came all the same and Rio rolled out of bed to freshen up before her day with Alice.</p><p>As she stepped over the threshold of the bathroom she heard Agatha’s husky voice ring out behind her, “Alice said you’re spending the day with her.”</p><p>Rio turned back around and nodded, waiting for Agatha to comment, unsure how she’d take her day away from her.</p><p>“I need to work anyway, so.”</p><p>Agatha shifted up to the top of the bed and her eyes flickered once over Rio’s new attire, hesitating briefly before she spoke again. “Do you need… any money for today, or…?”</p><p>She trailed off and looked up to capture Rio’s gaze again, which inspire of herself had softened at the sight of an Agatha who appeared softer in the morning light, watching as she tried to say the right thing. For once.</p><p>“No, thank you. Did you get my email? I took it from your website. Just so we’re both clear on exactly how this works.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, her gaze dropping again to the blanket over her lap. “Yes. Fine.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Rio turned and disappeared into the bathroom before Agatha could speak again. When she came out again, showered and ready for the day, Agatha was gone.</p><p>The rest of the day went by in a flash and Rio found herself relaxing in the company of Alice. The woman was funny. Like, really funny. She commented on almost every piece of art, ridiculed the people admiring it, and rolled her eyes at every price tag against every ugly portrait.</p><p>Rio knew that the woman was camping it up to try and entertain her, keep her mind off whatever was happening between her and Agatha, and she didn’t mind. She let her do it.</p><p>Just as they were leaving the gallery in the early afternoon, Rio’s phone buzzed with a notification from her bank. $200,000 had been deposited into her account.</p><p>She blinked down at the figure then moved to her email outbox, checking the amount she’d requested from Agatha, suddenly worried she’d either sent the wrong figure or she’d done some incredibly wacky maths.</p><p>But she had been right. She was expecting $87,500. Not a penny more. It was her usual fee. Half of it. So her time wasn’t wasted. Not even having Agatha’s number to call and ask, she instead sent her an email, replying off the back of her own from the previous night.</p><p><em>You sent too much</em>.</p><p>She didn’t receive a response.</p><p>But Alice was tugging on her to drag her towards a coffee shop nearby. And Agatha was pulled from her mind again as she focused in on scones and more tea than she could handle.</p><p>It wasn’t until the journey back to the house that Rio truly started to think about Agatha again.</p><p>Her heart thrummed steadily against her chest as her and Alice stepped over the threshold into the noisy, warm house.</p><p>Rio was taken into the open plan kitchen diner and greeted with the sight of Agatha swirling a glass of red wine, draped casually across the kitchen island as Jen and Billy fussed over a pot of something boiling on the hob.</p><p>Agatha turned her head as Rio entered and quirked a brow at her in greeting, straightening up from where she’d been leaning down on her elbows.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said casually, walking over as the woman turned properly to face her and much to Rio’s surprise offered her a hand and pulled the younger woman in close to her. Agatha’s breath was warm against Rio’s ear and smelled of the wine she’d been drinking but Rio’s stomach flipped as she heard Agatha’s low voice, “Jen’s been asking questions all day. Play along.”</p><p>Rio nodded ever so slightly, already agreeing to do so as Agatha added a soft afterthought, “Please.”</p><p>Rio felt her fingers then being entwined with Agatha and she turned her head into the woman, matching her gaze and seeing the pained expression across Agatha’s face.</p><p>Sucking in a slow breath she leant in and pressed their lips together softly, allowing the kiss to linger as Agatha squeezed her hand.</p><p>As she pulled back she heard Jen’s voice ring out, “Oh thank GOD. I thought we’d be dealing with whatever <em>that</em> was all week. Ruin my goddamn wedding.”</p><p>Alice cleared her throat dramatically, and Jen corrected herself with a grin, “Our wedding.”</p><p>It was Billy’s turn to speak then as he hurried around the island to wrap his arms around Rio, squeezing her close with a grin. “I came searching for you after dinner but you’d already left!”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes in amusement and grinned over at Billy, “I was exhausted so had to call it early.”</p><p>“Didn’t get much sleep from what I heard,” Jen deadpanned from across the island, earning a sneer from Agatha and a light slap on the arm from Alice.</p><p>The night went by relatively easily after that, with Billy and Jen taking the lion’s share of the talking. Agatha was silent, mostly swirling her wine but not drinking it, or tapping away at her phone. But Rio noticed that she’d taken, every so often, to touching her shoulder, pressing the briefest of kisses to her hair when she moved from the table, or squeezing her hand. It was all very above board, and crucially Rio knew, above the table so everybody could see.</p><p>Rio was back to playing the role of doting girlfriend now, receptive to Agatha’s meagre, stilted affection. And it made her heart sink every time.</p><p>When they all finally said their good nights, Rio waited patiently for Agatha to join her in the bedroom, having disappeared up a little earlier as Agatha stayed up to ‘finish some emails’.</p><p>She sat at the edge of their bed, dressed again in her silk slip and chewed on her lip as she waited.</p><p>Agatha sauntered in about an hour later and blinked in surprise at Rio sitting waiting for her. “You’re awake.”</p><p>“I wanted to talk to you. Make sure everything was clear in my email and… to ask you why you sent so much.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat quietly, “You don’t need to wear that.”</p><p>“What would you prefer I wear?”</p><p>Agatha’s tongue darted out to wet her lips and she swayed a little having clearly thought about stepping closer then changing her mind. “Whatever you want.”</p><p>“Agatha, why the extra money?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze darted away then and she steadied herself, her arms coming up to cross over her chest, “I realised I impositioned you. In the way I engaged your services. I wanted to make up for it.”</p><p>“Unnecessary.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, her gaze darting back again to Rio, sharp as ever. “I can’t do much about it now other than telling you to leave but…”</p><p>“Do you want me to leave?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened slightly and she took a step then towards Rio, “No. I meant,” but she stopped herself and her hands dropped down, twisting at her sides. “Do you want to leave?”</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly, her own fingers clutching at the bedsheets as if to anchor herself, not let her go to the woman. The woman she realised with a horrible lurge in her chest, that she’d missed. “No.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and kept her gaze on Rio as she uttered, “I have to leave early tomorrow for a work thing.”</p><p>“Am I coming with you?”</p><p>“No. You can stay here. I’ve already spoken to Jen about it. They’ll mostly be busy with wedding things so you can have the run of the place.”</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply and stood up then, lowering her voice a little as she took a step towards Agatha and placed the tips of her fingers just lightly against Agatha’s cashmere sweater, pressing softly against her stomach. “Agatha, you’ve paid me a lot of money to be here. It’s really okay to have me come with you.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped slowly from Rio’s eyes to her lips and Rio thought she saw something close to longing in her eyes before the woman snapped out of it and stepped away, shaking her hair back as if to brush Rio’s touch from her body.</p><p>“The sex thing,” she finally said, her back now to Rio as she busied herself with her phone.</p><p>“How far in advance do I need to… request it?”</p><p>Rio blinked stupidly across at Agatha and ran a hand through her hair, the feeling of whiplash coming back again. “Not too far. If you mean could you request it tonight, for instance, that would be fine.”</p><p>Agatha nodded then, her back still to Rio, “I won’t be back until the morning of the wedding. So. Tonight, if possible.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and nodded, though Agatha couldn’t see. “Okay. Do you have any requests? Anything you want to… discuss?”</p><p>It felt alien to be having this conversation with Agatha. The negotiations of what she could and couldn’t do with or to her body. If she were being totally honest with herself, she let the woman do anything. But that was dangerous. <em>This</em> was her job. Rules. Yeses and nos. She had to establish them before this went any further.</p><p>“I don’t want you to kiss me.”</p>

<em>”I don’t want you to kiss me.”</em>
</p><p>The breath was pulled from Rio’s lungs as she registered Agatha’s words. The woman still had her back to her and Rio would have laughed at the irony of it all if it hadn’t made her suddenly want to cry. Rio Vidal, infamously professional, sought after, detached.</p><p>How fitting it was that as Agatha physically turned away she shut herself off completely.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio confirmed quietly, her hands finding purchase on her thighs as she cleared her throat. She had to suck this up, had to get through the week. Had to play pretend. “What else?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything for a while and Rio began to grow frustrated, with Agatha, with the situation, with herself.</p><p>She stood to turn and force Agatha to negotiate with her and saw the woman staring across at her, looking… sheepish? Defiant?</p><p>“I don’t want to discuss it first.”</p><p>Rio nodded once and flexed her jaw, forcing herself to remain firm on this. “We need to.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her shoulders back and shook out her hair, “I wouldn’t do anything without your consent.” The words were charged, defensive.</p><p>“You don’t have my consent to do <em>anything</em> unless you discuss it with me first,” Rio shot back, absolutely refusing to back down to the woman who had been terrorising her from the very moment she’d first reached out.</p><p>Agatha bristled at that, her eyes flashing with fury as she stared across at Rio. “You’re being ridiculous.”</p><p>“This is my <em>job</em>, Agatha. Discussing this first helps to keep me protected.”</p><p>Agatha released a cruel and fake laugh, “I know it’s your job. That’s why I’m paying you.” But behind the laughter Rio thought she saw just the slightest glimmer of hurt. Maybe it was wishful thinking.</p><p>“We need to discuss it or it’s off the table. Not just for tonight. Entirely.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed and she seemed to consider continuing to argue but threw her hands up in surrender instead. “Fine. Fine. Discuss away.”</p><p>Rio nodded once, breathing out steadily through her nose to calm herself down. “I’m assuming there’s no extras? Nothing different to the other night?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, turning her gaze away as if trying to forget what exactly had happened two nights ago. “No. I want extras this time.”</p><p>She raised her chin defiantly, “I bought a strap. I want to fuck you with that.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, her mouth suddenly feeling dry as her mind swirled with the push and pull of it all once more. So Agatha wanted to push the boundaries, but preclude intimacy from the scenario, force Rio further into her little professional box. Dominate her.</p><p>“Okay,” she started slowly, taking a second to decide whether she would allow this given Agatha’s current refusal to soften for her. “Can I see it?”</p><p>Agatha shifted then, and Rio thought she was going to refuse but she turned and removed a large purple strap attached to a black suspender harness from a bag she must have hidden it away in earlier.</p><p>Rio squeezed her thighs together and hesitated for just a second before she moved closer to gage the size of this thing.</p><p>Agatha clearly didn’t do anything by halves.</p><p>At least eight inches by Rio’s guess, she looked back up to Agatha and saw that the woman was already staring at her, trying to gage what Rio might say.</p><p>“Okay. You can use it.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows raised then, but she nodded curtly and threw the toy on the bed. “Are we done now?”</p><p>Rio released a disbelieving laugh and ran a hand through her hair, “No. I also have a request. Boundary.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly as Rio continued. “You can’t leave anymore marks on me. No bruises, no angry red marks.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed again as she considered Rio’s words but she nodded just once, her steely blue eyes dropping from Rio’s much softer brown ones to let her gaze roam over the younger woman’s waiting body. They lingered for a while over the still visible bruising to her throat and her upper chest and remained there as she stepped closer and hesitated before she reached for Rio’s hips. Her touch was warm through the thin fabric of Rio’s slip and lithe fingers began to work their way up Rio’s stomach, tracing up her sternum and ghosting across her breasts.</p><p>“Are we done now?” She whispered hopefully, gaze flickering up to catch Rio’s.</p><p>Rio sucked a shuddery breath in and trailed her hands up Agatha’s arms. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio breathed more steadily as she watched Agatha, surprised by the light touch of the older woman who just seconds ago had looked as if she might explode. She seemed to be marvelling at Rio’s body which remained still, waiting for her, enjoying her touch.</p><p>As Agatha’s fingers traced back to brush over Rio’s hardened nipples she released a shaky breath and stepped closer. But she forgot herself and leant in so close that Rio thought she was going to kiss her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips were just a breath away and her first request was almost broken. It was Rio who pulled back, turning her head so they were almost cheek to cheek. Agatha’s touch changed then, Rio’s denial, though asked for, seemed to flick a switch in Agatha’s brain.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha’s head dipped and her lips attached themselves to Rio’s throat, easily finding her pulse point as if she’d been pulled there by some invisible force. Agatha’s hands traced down to grope at Rio’s ass and she pulled her painfully close as her mouth opened and Rio felt her teeth graze her skin for the first time.</p><p>“Agatha, don’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s head whipped back and Rio’s heart thumped heavily in her chest. Agatha already looked wild with lust, her pupils blown and her lips pouted and wet. She wanted to taste them.</p><p>“No marking, no teeth,” she breathed out, placing a firm hand on Agatha’s chest, “Not tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped then to Rio’s lips and she slowly pulled away entirely, not exactly looking regretful but not able to meet Rio’s gaze. Her fingers lingered at Rio’s hips for an extra second before she stepped back and turned away.</p><p>“Take it off.”</p><p>The instruction was firm, dismissive of Rio. And the younger woman felt every syllable of the directive. Agatha had shut her out entirely. The no kissing rule was the first sign. And Rio’s no marking rule had pushed her even further away. But if Agatha wanted to keep it emotionless, make it just about the act, getting herself off with Rio’s body, then Rio would allow it. She knew she trusted Agatha not to push beyond her limits, even if she had forgotten herself just then. She could push her feelings down for the sake of one night.</p><p>As Rio slowly shed the silk slip from her body - lifting it off easily and throwing it to the edge of the room - she raised her gaze back to Agatha who was still facing away from her, removing her own clothes.</p><p>As Agatha dropped her bra to the floor and stood naked now in the dimly lit room, Rio stepped forwards and slowly, cautiously, traced her fingers up Agatha’s spine.</p><p>She took the opportunity to look, to enjoy.</p><p>Her fingers worked their way closer to Agatha’s shoulder blades and Agatha stretched her neck back, moaning so softly and briefly becoming the Agatha who had cradled Rio two nights ago.</p><p>But it didn’t last long.</p><p>Agatha turned around as Rio’s fingers were moving back down to trace over her hips and she leant in to place a tender kiss to Rio’s jaw. Her hand raised to cradle Rio’s face then and she once again leant in as if to kiss Rio fully. But she stopped short and instead brushed their noses together, breathing out slowly against Rio’s now parted, wanting lips.</p><p>Her free hand curled around Rio’s hip and squeezed it firmly as blue eyes searched Rio’s face. “This is the last tenderness you’ll get from me tonight, okay?”</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded, leaning into the gentle touch of Agatha’s hand against her cheek.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>With that, the atmosphere in the room changed.</p><p>Agatha pushed Rio down onto the bed and moved down with her. As Rio’s body crashed down onto the soft mattress, she felt Agatha’s lips back on her, hungry and desperate.</p><p>Rio’s breathing picked up then as she tried to reconcile the part of her that wanted Agatha so desperately and the rule-focused, professional side of her.</p><p>Her job tonight was to be a warm body for Agatha, a dispassionate receiver of what she wanted to give. And it would be the easiest job in the world if she could allow herself to forget her feelings.</p><p>Hot, wet lips travelled across her throat, a growl vibrating against the tender bruises she still had from last time as Agatha realised she couldn’t claim Rio in that way again.</p><p>Instead she worked her way down, settling further down Rio’s body and kissing her with abandon, her hand already working to part Rio’s legs and seek what she desired.</p><p>Rio was panting under Agatha’s administrations, her chest heaving up as Agatha’s lips traced the curve of her breast and settled hot and wet over her nipple.</p><p>Rio released a whine as Agatha’s tongue began to bully the pink nub and she saw stars as Agatha’s hand found her centre. Long fingers wasted no time in running through the wetness she found there and Agatha moaned against Rio’s breast as she swirled her fingers through her cunt and pushed down and inside of her with two fingers.</p><p>Rio bucked beneath her, crying out at the sudden intrusion. But Agatha didn’t give her time to adjust as she aggressively began to pump in and out of her, twisting her hand to push her palm against Rio’s clit with every thrust.</p><p>Rio’s whining grew stronger as she opened her legs more for Agatha, her body practically arching off the bed as Agatha added a third finger and Rio clenched around her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio moaned, bucking against Agatha’s hand as she stretched her out.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha responded, her breathing almost as heavy as Rio’s as she kept up her brutal pace.</p><p>But Agatha kept her gaze down, her mouth busy as she licked and sucked and kissed across Rio’s chest and stomach. Rio’s hands settled in her hair and gripped it tightly, trying to keep her body still beneath Agatha’s merciless pace. She shouted out at a sudden, harsh press to her clit with Agatha’s thumb and pulled at Agatha’s hair as she did so, eliciting a loud moan from the woman on top of her.</p><p>It didn’t take Rio long to come. The intensity of her orgasm pushed her hips clean off the bed and crushed Agatha’s hand between them, making Agatha muffle her own moan against Rio’s chest as she felt the younger woman clench around her.</p><p>Her pace slowed down then and Agatha removed her hand from between Rio’s thighs, leaning back up to her knees to gaze down upon the panting woman.</p><p>Rio’s entire body was glistening with the trail of Agatha’s lips and tongue, her chest had a speckled redness across it from the heat of the room and her lips were swollen from where she’d been biting down hard to compete with the attentions of Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha…” Rio breathed out, trying to recover from the intensity of Agatha’s work in her.</p><p>Agatha’s breathing was just as heavy as Rio’s as her gaze fell everywhere but to meet wide brown eyes staring up at her. She seemed to be trying to memorise the sight before her as a slight furrow fell to her brow and her fingers moved to trace a damp line from Rio’s belly button to her centre again, gently brushing her clit as if to soothe it from the force she’d been applying earlier.</p><p>Rio twitched beneath her and moved up to rest on her elbows, still trying to catch her breath.</p><p>“Could go a bit easier on a gal, you know,” she tried lightly, hoping Agatha would look at her properly this time.</p><p>But Agatha had turned away already and was reaching for the strap. Rio licked her lips and shifted on the bed to sit up, feeling a slight dull ache between her legs as she reached out to Agatha, “Let me make you come first.”</p><p>Her hand lightly touched Agatha’s shoulder as she used her to sit up more properly on her knees and leant in to brush her nose against Agatha’s throat. She reached down to press her hand against Agatha’s core and found her to be just as soaked as she was. But as Rio trailed her tongue in a thick strip to just below Agatha’s ear, her hand was pushed away and Agatha had moved from her hold.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried gently, feeling another keen sting in her chest at the rejection.</p><p>“Can you not,” Agatha said, again not looking at Rio as she moved herself off the bed to fit the harness about herself.</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek as she watched Agatha stretch and secure the toy to her body.</p><p>Rio shivered as Agatha moved back to the bed and manoeuvred her onto her back again. But Rio was ready now, she knew what was probably about to happen and had to cut it off at the pass.</p><p>“Hey,” she placed a hand back on Agatha’s chest just as her head hit the pillow and stormy blue eyes finally looked up to meet Rio’s gaze.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched at the intensity of Agatha’s stare and she took the opportunity to nuzzle up, brushing their noses together gently. “Go easy, okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s face flickered with something that looked a lot like shame as she pulled back from her position hovering above Rio. She rested back on her knees again between her legs. Rio sat up with her to try and catch her gaze again but Agatha was now holding the base of the strap, and Rio’s gaze dropped to it too.</p><p>“Suck it,” Agatha instructed.</p><p>If Rio didn’t know any better she’d have thought that this sudden change in position, this sudden demand, was to give Rio time to recover. And perhaps to give Agatha time to calm down. But she couldn’t let herself think like that.</p><p>Ever the showgirl, Rio did as she was told.</p><p>She moved to her hands and knees as Agatha opened her legs and leant back on her elbows to watch.</p><p>Licking a thick, deliberate line across the tip of the cock, Rio kept her gaze on the woman before her, watching as Agatha’s mouth opened slightly, her tongue slipping out to wet her lips and her chest still falling and rising in a slow rhythm.</p><p>Rio welcomed the strap into her mouth, taking it slowly and as far as she could without gagging.</p><p>Agatha remained still as she watched the little show, brow quirking slightly as Rio’s hands moved to the base of the strap and she began to apply pressure, moving the grinding pad against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>Moaning softly Agatha bucked her hips up to press deeper into Rio’s throat, “Think you can handle this, pretty girl?”</p><p>Rio squeezed her thighs together at Agatha’s question and the movement didn’t go unnoticed.</p><p>But Rio’s mouth and tongue continued their work as she licked up the side of the strap and watched for a reaction. The woman’s chest now heaving a little heavier.</p><p>It was as she began to deep throat again, gagging slightly as her throat threatened to close around the length, and her eyes watering slightly, that Agatha shifted and lifted Rio back off of it. “That’s enough.”</p><p>A thick line of salvia connected Rio’s lips to the tip of the strap as she pulled back and Agatha reached to wipe it from her lip with the pad of her thumb.</p><p>The gesture caused Rio’s gaze to soften and she moved to pull at the suspenders, tugging Agatha into her. She landed on top of Rio with a soft “oomph” and almost immediately began to mark her territory with her mouth.</p><p>Rio gasped as soft lips pressed to her throat and the tip of the strap moved to press against her clit.</p><p>Agatha kept the strap there, tapping it against Rio’s clit experimentally as she moved her other hand to hold Rio’s hip.</p><p>Pulling away and shifting to sit up slightly, Agatha looked down between them as she rubbed the length of the strap against Rio, moaning at the sight.</p><p>Rio’s body twitched and she groaned beneath her, “Agatha, please…”</p><p>Blue eyes moved up to survey the masterpiece before her. Rio’s body was hot and flushed, sticky with sweat and Agatha’s saliva. Her hand moved to rest over Rio’s abdomen as she pressed into her, and despite how wet Rio was, she could feel some resistance from the younger woman.</p><p>Rio groaned at the sudden stretch and felt the ache build, both from wanting more and from Agatha’s attention earlier. Her hands clawed at the sheets beneath herself, twisting as she muttered a string of, “Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck…”</p><p>Blue eyes slowly lifted to study Rio’s face, and she moved up, keeping her hips as still as she could as she hovered over Rio. Agatha sucked in a quick breath, and nudged at Rio’s cheek lightly, unable to ask the question Rio understood what this was. A silent, ‘are you okay?’ ‘Can you continue?’.</p><p>She trusted Agatha. And so she took a deep breath and nodded, trying to keep it together. “Yes. Please.”</p><p>Agatha pushed into her then, slowly, agonisingly slowly. And Rio reacted, her body quivering slightly as she adjusted to the feel of Agatha’s strap stretching her out, filling her entirely. As Agatha bottomed out she grunted, her eyes roaming down Rio’s body again to where her hand sat across her stomach, pressing down and feeling the hard presence of the thick strap there.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whispered solemnly, her eyes wide as she took in the sight.</p><p>Allowing Rio to adjust for just a brief second more, Agatha began to pick up the pace. Her thrusts were slow but heavy and Rio’s moans grew louder, more guttural as she clutched at Agatha, practically mewing as Agatha pushed harder, fucking her down against the mattress.</p><p>“You’re taking me so well,” she husked out, her voice dripping with something between possession and amazement.</p><p>Agatha angled herself just so, able to reach down further and press against Rio’s clit, desperate for her to come with the cock buried deep inside her.</p><p>Incoherent noises began to spill from Rio’s lips then, breathy moans of <em>”Agatha”</em> and <em>”fuck”</em>.</p><p>At the delicious noises from Rio, Agatha’s movements became more erratic, and she attempted to push harder, desperate to be as deep inside of Rio as she could be. Desperate to Rio to feel her. Only her. Only ever her.</p><p>Rio got louder, her whole body arching into Agatha as her orgasm built so quickly that she lost all sense of self. The only thing was Agatha. Agatha over her. Agatha inside of her. Agatha fucking her.</p><p>Agatha looked crazed above her, her hair wild and her mouth hanging open. And when Rio came with a cry of relief, her body jolting suddenly up towards Agatha, her back arching impossibly, Agatha released a loud groan, her breath shuddering.</p><p>Agatha’s movements slowed until she rested, still buried within Rio. Her face now pressed against Rio’s neck as she panted against her damp skin.</p><p>Though Rio ached deeply from where Agatha was still inside her, her walls clenching painfully around her strap, she lifted heavy arms to scratch over Agatha’s back, letting her rest against her. Agatha didn’t stay there long.</p><p>Instead she pulled back, slowly pulling out of Rio and groaning at the sight of Rio’s red, swollen cunt. Her hand moved down to stroke down Rio’s thighs soothingly as she looked back up to meet the hazy, slightly drunken gaze of the younger woman.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched slightly, “I will be.”</p><p>Agatha nodded just once, continuing her gentle movements against Rio’s thighs and opening and closing her mouth a few times before she said, “Don’t move.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure she <em>could</em> move even if she wanted to but she just nodded and watched as Agatha moved away from the bed, removing the harness as she went. “Wait, you don’t want…?” She trailed off, shifting with a soft groan to sit up, “Agatha. You didn’t come.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond as she disappeared into the bathroom, taking the strap with her to clean off in the sink. The door shut behind her and Rio was left to wallow on the bed, laying prone in the wet patch and feeling a sinking feeling in her stomach.</p><p>She reached down between her thighs and groaned at the feel of herself, aching and soaked.</p><p>Her mind was slowly catching up with her body, as she went over a checklist of what had happened. What Agatha had asked for, and what she’d done.</p><p>Agatha had fucked her like a claim, like an attempt to ruin her. And Rio felt a shiver rush over her as she traced the sticky skin between her breasts.</p><p>Agatha had painted her body with her tongue, leaving her sticky and damp all over and Rio just knew that if she’d let her, she’d have been covered with the evidence of Agatha’s mouth for days to come.</p><p>Lost in her post-sex haze and thoughts of Agatha’s harsh, unrelenting treatment, she didn’t hear the sounds of a bath running, and it took her a second to react when twenty minutes later Agatha appeared in the entrance to the bathroom with a dressing gown.</p><p>“Can you walk?”</p><p>“I think so,” Rio murmured softly, and she sat up slowly, the dull ache between her legs intensifying as she shuffled to the edge of the bed. The older woman moved over then and held out a hand silently which Rio took and pulled herself up. She stood on shaky legs and reached for Agatha’s shoulder to steady herself but already anticipating Rio’s needs Agatha crouched slightly and lifted Rio up, placing her hands securely around the back of her thighs and lifting her into a secure hold around her middle.</p><p>The sudden movement made Rio gasp and she wrapped her arms loosely around Agatha’s shoulders then, staring wide-eyed at the brunette.</p><p>“I’m sure I could walk, Agatha.” Her tone was soft, her voice hoarse from the strain she’d put it under earlier. “It’s not far.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow, “Then I didn’t achieve what I set out to.”</p><p>Rio blinked down at the woman now unashamedly meeting her gaze and moved her hand to lightly brush against Agatha’s cheek. “That was why you were so… intense.” Her brow furrowed a little as she studied the lines and plains of Agatha’s face, struggling to read her stoic expression, “Something to remember you by when you leave?”</p><p>Shrugging a little Agatha’s gaze dropped to Rio’s lips, “Something like that.”</p><p>There she was again, the Agatha she’d been allowed to see oh so briefly just two nights ago. Hidden beneath a fearsome, walled off mask.</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, letting her fingers brush back to tame wild hair and allowed herself to be carried through to the bathroom where a hot bath was waiting for her. Her feet now touching the ground, Agatha helped her climb in and offered support as she sank down beneath the bubbles, closing her eyes as the warm water soothed her aching body.</p><p>Just as she was getting more comfortable she heard movement and saw Agatha turning to leave. “You’re not joining me?” Agatha hesitated for a second before she glanced back at Rio, an unreadable expression on her face. “Let me know when you want to get out and I’ll help.” With that she left, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Rio felt herself sink lower into the bath, letting the warm water wash away the evidence of Agatha’s possessive streak, her mind swirling with the way Agatha had held her, had watched her like she was something to marvel at, had hungrily and obsessively touched and tasted every bit of her she could reach.</p><p>She didn’t know that on the other side of the door Agatha had sunk to the ground, listening closely to the gentle sounds of lapping water every time Rio moved in the bath.</p><p>By the time Rio was ready to get out, the late hour and intensity of their fucking making her desperate to sleep, she stood shakily and managed to support herself on the nearby sink as she reached dry land again. Agatha, on the other side of the door, was alerted to Rio’s movements by the sound of several “fuck”s and the waves crashing about her as she’d moved. She stood and cracked the door open ajar to see the younger woman wrapping herself tightly in a towel. “Do you need help?”</p><p>Rio shook her head no and moved over to open the door more fully, quaking a little as she did so. Agatha’s hand reached out to take her forearm, as Rio said, “Do you really have to go tomorrow? Are you avoiding me?”</p><p>The brazen question caused Agatha’s hand to twitch slightly against Rio’s arm and she stepped back a little as Rio moved her free arm to hold the door. “Avoiding you? Why would I be doing that?”</p><p>
<em>”Because you want me like others have wanted me and will continue to want me.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Because you’re afraid of getting hurt.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Because this might actually be something and you are too scared and jealous to try.”</em>
</p><p>But Rio didn’t say what she truly thought and instead she said, “Because it’s easier than pretending.”</p><p>The words hung in the thick air between them and Agatha’s lips parted as she considered her next words but she shook her head instead and released an indignant breath, “Did I fuck your brains out or something?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha shifted then, her gaze dropping from Rio’s searching eyes and she focused in around the woman’s collarbone instead. Rio waited patiently, though she didn’t know how much longer she’d be able to stand with her legs still feeling heavy, her body beginning to fight her as the weight of everything settled somewhere between her chest and her thighs. But Agatha kept silent, her eyes glazing over as she moved back to Rio and pressed a fleeting kiss to her temple.</p><p>She turned then, and strode from the room, clicking the door shut behind her.</p>

<p>The day of the wedding couldn’t have come sooner as far as Rio was concerned.</p><p>She’d just about recovered from the last night she’d seen Agatha, both emotionally and physically, and had spent the next couple of days distracting herself with exploring London, helping Alice and Jen with errands, and taking long walks alone to clear her head.</p><p>She’s not heard anything from Agatha since the woman had left her standing at the threshold to their room wearing just a towel and had to glean what she could about her whereabouts and well-being from casual comments made by Jen.</p><p>But the finish line was in sight. In just over 24 hours she would be settled into her seat on her flight, her job done.</p><p>As Rio padded down the stairs at precisely 7:15 (a time decided by Jen the previous night as “the very, very latest you can get up if you don’t want to be brutally murdered”), she found Alice sitting at the breakfast island, looking a lot like she wanted to be anywhere but there.</p><p>“Morning!” Rio chirped, already moving to take the coffee pot and pour herself a mug, “How’re those nerves? You look like you’re about to vomit.”</p><p>Alice just laughed humourlessly and held out her mug for more coffee. “I hate this. A spectacle. Everyone looking at me. It’s Jen’s arena. Not mine.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and watched Alice with a steady gaze, “It’ll be over before you know it. Besides, at the end of the day you’ll be married to the love of your life. That’s a pretty damn good day.”</p><p>“Yeah, so long as I don’t collapse first.”</p><p>“I’ll carry you down the aisle if I have to.”</p><p>“You’re not strong enough for that.”</p><p>“I dunno, you’re pretty tiny. And I’m stronger than I look. Pilates.” Rio winked then at Alice and teased out a smile from the woman.</p><p>“Are you looking forward to seeing Agatha?”</p><p>Rio’s own smile faltered slightly and in spite of herself she found that her next words were the truth, “Yeah. I’ve missed her.”</p><p>“Well she’s been bothering us all since she left. Keeping tabs on you, I think. Almost as if she thinks you can’t take care of yourself. Jen threw her out of the group chat. Billy added her back in five minutes later, of course.”</p><p>Rio keened at this information, and laughed at the image of Agatha’s face as she saw the notification telling her she’d been removed from the group chat. “She’s protective,” she explained smoothly, taking a sip of her coffee as if this information hadn’t caused her heart to thump heavily in her chest.</p><p>Alice just shrugged and slipped from her stool, sighing heavily. “We should get ready. Jen’s already called and said she’ll shove her bouquet so far up our asses if we’re even a second late.”</p><p>Rio actually laughed at that and followed Alice back through to the stairs. “Noted. No one wants that.”</p><p>——</p><p>At midday Rio found herself sitting alone in a small room off of the grand ballroom assigned for the ceremony.</p><p>She’d been left there by an increasingly nervous Alice who had disappeared off with Lilia to go through the final details of the ceremony, due to start in less than an hour. Billy had sat with her for a while but soon left to answer a last minute request from Jen to fetch her a crystal that she’d left charging in the sun that could “make or break the ceremony, Billy”.</p><p>So there she sat, toying idly with the small clutch she’d brought with her and staring out into the afternoon sun of a warm London day.</p><p>“Penny for your thoughts?”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat as she recognised the voice and she whipped around to lay eyes on Agatha Harkness, leaning back casually against the door, looking more beautiful than Rio had ever seen her.</p><p>“I was beginning to wonder if you’d even show.”</p><p>“And miss the wedding of the century? Never.”</p><p>A smile tugged at the corners of Rio’s lips as she took in the sight of the woman she’d found herself missing. Agatha was wearing a red dress with a tight bodice and a ruffled skirt with her hair elegantly draped over one shoulder, wavy, effortlessly chic. But Rio’s gaze was focusing mostly on the matching red lipstick she wore and the soft smirk that brought out the sparkle of her eyes.</p><p>“You good incredible,” Rio whispered honestly and Agatha took a sharp breath in at the sudden tonal shift, watching Rio with a suddenly cautious gaze. “Jen tried to force me into a pink monstrosity. Thought this was more my style.”</p><p>Rio nodded in agreement and they both spoke again, overlapping each other. “So how was work?” “You look perfect.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat as she shifted in her seat, glancing down at herself as if checking how accurate Agatha’s assessment had been. She was wearing a black two piece, the top dipping between her breasts and the gap between that and the skirt showing off a couple inches of her abs. Even she had to admit she looked good.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said quietly, her gaze travelling back over to Agatha who seemed to not want to move from her spot on the door. “So, work? Good?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and raised a hand as if to bat the question away, “Fine. It’s… fine.” She cleared her throat then and continued on, “Alice said you’ve been really helpful the past few days. Thank you. You could’ve… you didn’t have to.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened as she watched Agatha, “It was my pleasure. I like Alice a lot. And I think Jen has finally forgiven me for keeping her awake that first night. I’m considering it one of my finest accomplishments.”</p><p>Agatha released a soft chuckle and her shoulders seemed to relax then as she ran a hand through her hair, “And you’re feeling… you’re all okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, picking up on the actual question: <em>did you still feel me the next day? Can you feel me now?</em> Her hand moved to thrum against the arm of her chair and she bit the inside of her cheek for a second, letting Agatha sit in her silence. Sensing she was on the back foot, Agatha moved forwards then, pushing off the door and taking four short strides to finish standing before the woman in black, her gaze intense as she struggled to voice what she really wanted to know: <em>did you miss me?</em></p><p>But Rio, determined to get through the day without any breakdowns of any kind, slowly stood from her seat and reached for Agatha’s hands, placing them on her own hips and stepping into the older woman, placing her own hands at the base of Agatha’s head, her fingers slipping into her hair. “The kissing thing,” she said softly, watching as Agatha’s gaze dropped down to her lips and feeling her hands move up to the gap between her skirt and top, pushing her fingers just slightly underneath the top to rest on her upper ribs. “Is that still a rule you want for today? Just so I know for when people are around.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly and shook her head just a little, her eyes darting over Rio’s face, as if trying to work out if this were a trap or not. “No. That was… <em>regrettable</em>.” Rio’s brows shot up at the soft admission from the woman in her arms and she opened her mouth to say something but was interrupted by a sudden appearance at the door.</p><p>“I got it!” Billy was panting hard as he held up a large pink crystal, beaming over at a shocked looking Rio and an irritated Agatha. “I’ve sweat through my shirt but I’ve got it!”</p><p>Rio laughed loudly and turned more towards Billy, inadvertently moving from Agatha’s hold as she held a thumbs up in his direction, now matching his grin, “Good. I was worried I’d have to help Alice hide the body once Jen was done with you.”</p><p>Agatha snorted beside her and found Rio’s fingers to entwine with her own, already pulling her towards the beaming boy. “We should find our seats. And you should find your boss.”</p><p>Rio’s body was still tingling from where Agatha had held her before and she knew that this day couldn’t end fast enough.</p><p>But there wasn’t much more time to dwell on her complicated feelings for the woman now pressed against her side as they sat at the front of the rows of chairs, Billy having directed them to their seats before hurrying off to deliver the linchpin of the day’s success.</p><p>As the room began to fill with some of the richest and most beautiful people Rio had ever seen - some faces vaguely familiar from the dinner party that first night, some catching her eye and smiling - she placed her hand lightly in Agatha’s thigh, feeling the woman beside her shift slightly. Her gaze fell then to an actually familiar face. A red-headed one.</p><p>Rio’s mouth went dry suddenly and her hand on Agatha’s thigh tightened into a fist as she saw the woman make a beeline for them. With just a split second to decide what to do and with Agatha now raising her brows and opening her mouth to ask what was wrong, she leant in.</p><p>The kiss was clumsy, at least at first. Agatha’s mouth had been open as she began to speak and Rio had been more worried about contact than actual accuracy as her lips captured Agatha’s lower one and she felt the warm wetness of Agatha’s mouth close in around her upper lip, landing a little sloppily. Agatha made a soft noise of surprise but to Rio’s relief she kissed her back, adjusting the angle to something a little more solid. Rio’s hand flew to Agatha’s hair as their lips began to move together and Agatha responded almost instantly as she reached for Rio’s side, turning her to grant more access, more contact.</p><p>“Oh, please,” came a nearby voice that wasn’t the one Rio had been expecting.</p><p>“This is supposed to be a classy event,” Lilia muttered as she took a seat beside Rio. The two woman broke away and Agatha huffed a breath of annoyance against Rio’s lips before she leant around and narrowed her gaze over at the old woman. “You’re just jealous, you old bat.”</p><p>Rio had to bite her lip to hold in her laugh but her eyes roved away to check for Wanda. She spotted her then, the other side of the aisle and five rows back, watching them closely. As Rio turned away, Agatha was watching <em>her</em> closely, her voice barely above a whisper as she asked, “Was that just a welcome home gift or was there a reason for suddenly attacking my mouth?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile at Agatha’s question but her smile fell slightly as she leant in and pressed her lips to Agatha’s ear to warn softly, “Wanda’s here. She was coming over.” She felt Agatha’s body tense against her and braced herself for what was about to come. But Agatha only nodded once and then turned back to the front, her arm now snaking securely around Rio’s back and tugging her in close to her side. Rio breathed out softly and lay her hand back on Agatha’s thigh, allowing the brunette to trace soft circles on her exposed abdomen.</p><p>There wasn’t much more time to think about any cheating redheads as the ceremony started.</p><p>A choir started up as Alice entered first, walking down the aisle in a fitted white suite with her signature teasing grin and her shock of red hair. She looked much more at ease after having convinced Rio to sneak her a tequila about an hour ago.</p><p>Next was Jen, radiant in her white gown, beaming at the attention she was receiving, and at her love, standing waiting for her at the top of the aisle.</p><p>The ceremony was quick, romantic, and Rio felt her heart ache slightly as she watched the two women exchange their vows. Somewhere between the start of Jen’s vows and the start of Alice’s, Agatha had wrapped her arm back around Rio and started up again the earlier soft ministrations of her fingers.</p><p>When they were finally announced as brides the room erupted with noise and Rio cheered beside Agatha, adding her own hollering to the din. As the happy couple turned to walk back down the aisle Agatha took Rio’s hand and led her after them, the pews slowly emptying as everyone followed suit.</p><p>Between the ceremony and reception, Rio forgot that she was here on a job. She enjoyed Agatha’s smiles and easy touches, she beamed at Alice when she gave her a tight hug and whispered “I owe you one” thanking her for the tequila, and she laughed alongside Lilia when Agatha complained that the confetti was stuck in her hair, ruining her aesthetic. It wasn’t until Rio was in the bathroom washing her hands that she remembered what she was there for. And the nudge into reality came in the form of a whisper against her ear, “How much?”</p><p>She startled and jumped away from the sink, staring wide-eyed at Agatha’s smirking ex-wife. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I said,” Wanda insisted, moving closer and placing her hands on Rio’s hips, “How much?”</p><p>Rio gaped at her, her whole body hot with the indignity of the situation, the brazenness of the question, and the warm, unwanted hands on her body. She wasted only a second longer pulling away from the woman, her voice sharp, “Get away from me.”</p><p>“Oh don’t be like that. Aggie would never find out. So come on. How much for you to be on your knees for me right now?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped and she released a noise somewhere between a laugh and a growl, “Get fucked, Wanda.”</p><p>“I’m trying, darling.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and charged past the woman, her mind going a mile a minute as she disappeared from the bathroom in search of Agatha. She found her sitting at a table with Lilia, Jen, Alice, and Billy, and she hesitated as she watched the easy laugh tumbling from Agatha’s lips, the way she gesticulated wildly, her relaxed posture with her friends making Rio second-guess what she was about to tell her. She didn’t want to ruin her night. She didn’t want to break her. But a soft touch to her waist broke her from her reverie and a chin moved to rest on her shoulder, Wanda’s voice in her ear again came soft and seductive. “We can make a deal, you know. I won’t tell her if you do this one thing for me. I’ll make sure you enjoy it, malyshka.”</p><p>For a second, Rio considered it. Considered giving herself to Wanda for the sake of keeping Agatha’s secret. She thought about how it would feel to willingly give herself to the woman who had broken Agatha’s heart. And it made her feel sick.</p><p>So she shrugged from Wanda’s hold and turned from the sight of Agatha and her friends across the room to stare into dangerous green eyes. “Stay away from me. And stay away from Agatha.” She lowered her voice and stepped in, forcing Wanda to take a slight step back. “If you do or say anything to anyone at this wedding, or after, I will personally destroy you. I have a lot of friends and a lot of good will in a lot of high places.” Wanda’s smug smile dropped a little and she weighed up her options, looking shaken by Rio’s threat.</p><p>“She’s got you good, hasn’t she?”</p><p>Rio scoffed and sneered back at Wanda, “<em>She</em> is none of your business anymore. You saw to that when you destroyed your relationship.”</p><p>Wanda raised her chin and narrowed her gaze at Rio, “It’s a pity. She’s too closed off for someone like you. She’ll never let you in. And you’ll be left wanting.” With one final glare at Rio she turned on her heel and marched away. Rio was shaking with rage as she watched her go, and she could feel the heat rising in her chest as she tried to take steadying, deep breaths.</p><p>When she finally was able to move her legs again she made it to the bar, ordering a shot of vodka and downing in with barely a wince. As the alcohol settled in her stomach she turned back to her other form of salvation: Agatha.</p><p>She marched over, forcing a smile on her face and greeting everyone cheerily as she took it upon herself to sit across Agatha’s lap, earning a look of surprise from Agatha as the conversation continued around them. No sooner than Rio had settled a hand on Agatha’s neck, Agatha had snaked her arms securely around Rio’s waist and was gazing up at her with a curious look on her face.</p><p>Rio knew she could sense something was wrong but she didn’t say anything initially, only dipping her head to kiss Agatha’s cheek and breath in the scent she’d missed the past couple of days.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and pressed her lips to Agatha’s ear, reassured that the rest of the group would not want to watch what Jen had once referred to as “canoodling teenagers”.</p><p>“Wanda knows,” she murmured as quietly as possible, barely able to utter the words for fear of Agatha’s reaction. She stealed herself to be thrown from her lap, to be thrown from the wedding, to be thrown from Agatha’s life. But it didn’t happen. Her hand moved down to settle lightly over Agatha’s chest and she felt the steady rhythm of her heart as she pulled back to gaze down at her. Agatha met her gaze and pressed their foreheads together in an intimate gesture that made Rio’s heart stutter; the feel of this Agatha again compared to the last time they’d been this close, compared to the unwanted, unacceptable touch of Wanda made her forget for a second what she’d been so frightened of.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha whispered just as quietly, “I should have told you. I didn’t want you to worry.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly, her hold on Agatha tightening a little, “How?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed and Rio felt her hand move against her thigh, pushing under the slit of Rio’s skirt and holding her tightly, “I’ll explain later. I promise. But you’re safe. She won’t… no one will know.”</p><p>Rio was the one to swallow then, swallowing down the realisation that whatever ‘work’ had been had maybe been something to do with this. Something to do with her. Something Agatha had tried to protect her from.</p><p>She suddenly couldn’t stand that they were in public, that her body was angled away from Agatha, that her friends were close, that they were still in a strange rule-based, transactional relationship. She just wanted Agatha.</p><p>But they were still in all those things. Whatever Rio thought may have happened, may be wrong. All she knew now was that Wanda had backed off and Agatha hadn’t lost it. At least not yet. And so she pressed a firm kiss to Agatha’s lips, hoping she understood what that meant. <em>Thank you. I’ll keep you safe too.</em></p>

<p>Agatha’s day had gone from bad to worse. And she had a feeling that there wasn’t going to be any relief anytime soon.</p><p>The email had arrived from Rio and had set her on a one woman mission to drown herself in the most expensive alcohol she could get her hands on.</p><p>And she was being rather successful at it, if she did say so herself. In fact, she was so drunk that she didn’t quite register the first few, frequent vibrations of her phone discarded on the bar beside her martini glass. Jen had left her hours ago, frustrated with Agatha’s stonewalling and uninterested in trying to needle anything out of her at what was sure to be a huge inconvenience to herself.</p><p>But her phone was persistent. It rang again, vibrating heavily and nudging along the delicate glass on the mahogany countertop.</p><p>
<em>BITCH</em>
</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly down at the name that lit up her screen, squinting as she focused in on the word, momentarily forgetting what she’d re-dubbed her ex-wife. Acting on instinct, and keen to take her anger and frustration out on someone, she picked up the phone.</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>“I thought you weren’t going to answer. Too busy fucking your new girl?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed loudly and gestured at the barman for another drink, “What do you want?” The thought of her <em>not</em> currently fucking Rio, or being anywhere even near her, making her heart pang sharply.</p><p>“I want to talk to you about something.”</p><p>“Oh wow I’m so confused as to what we’re doing right now.”</p><p>“It’s a business proposition.”</p><p>“I have no interest in doing business with you,” Agatha sneered back, a spark of smugness running through her as she shut Wanda down, “Turns out you’re not good for business <em>or</em> pleasure anymore. Not that I got much of the latter from you in the first place…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda pressed, her impatient tone giving her away a little, “you want to hear this. It involves your pretty little girlfriend.”</p><p>Agatha choked then, having taken an inopportune sip of her drink, “Rio? What about her?”</p><p>“Meet me tomorrow. I’ll text you the address.”</p><p>With that, she hung up and Agatha was left shouting into the void, “Wanda? Wanda! Don’t you fucking dare.”</p><p>But it was no use. Oblivious to the eyes on her then she pressed ‘call back’ to try and get the woman who had ruined her life back on her phone.</p><p>It didn’t work.</p><p>Minutes later she received a text containing an address to a bar in central london along with a time: 12pm.</p><p>Agatha could barely read the words at this point and simply threw her phone down with a groan, her mind reeling with what Wanda could possibly be needing to chat to her about. Why she wanted to talk about Rio. Rio. Rio. Rio.</p><p>It was a miracle that Agatha made it home after that, crashing into the attic bedroom with no degree of grace or decorum. She was vaguely away of Rio sitting up in shock and saying something to her as she crashed to the bathroom but she was too far gone to properly register it. She soon threw herself into the bed, curling in on herself and welcoming the thought-killer, sleep.</p><p>The next morning she woke groggily, her bloodshot eyes finding Rio’s retreating figure as she made her way to the bathroom.</p><p>Thankfully for Agatha, the first thought that came to her head was that she wouldn’t see much of Rio today. A thought that pained her but that was the least painful thing she was soon to remember: “Alice said you’re spending the day with her.”</p><p>Rio turned back around and nodded, and Agatha met her gaze cautiously, “I need to work anyway, so.” It was a lie. But a necessary one. Rio had made it clear this was a transactional relationship. Agatha couldn’t look needy, couldn’t act as pathetic as she felt.</p><p>She shifted up to the top of the bed, feeling a sharp ache at the base of her head as her eyes flickered once over Rio’s new slip. She licked her lips and took in a slow breath before she spoke again. “Do you need… any money for today, or…?”</p><p>She trailed off, unsure if what she’d said was the right thing. If Rio expected payment, she wanted to make sure she delivered. And if that meant paying for her lunch or admission to a gallery in addition then so be it.</p><p>“No, thank you. Did you get my email? I took it from your website. Just so we’re both clear on exactly how this works.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, her gaze dropping again to the blanket over her lap, her head thudding and her stomach sinking. “Yes. Fine.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Agatha glanced back up as Rio left the room and she moved quickly then, forcing her hungover body to grab a bag and some clothes for the day before she left to hole up in another bathroom on another floor.</p><p>Agatha left the house before Rio or Alice, waving dismissively at Alice as she moved about the kitchen making what looked to be a delicious breakfast. Today was going to be hell.</p><p>Tugging her cashmere sweater a little tighter around herself, Agatha looked up with a disgusted sneer on her face at the battered, creaking sign of the pub: The Golden Lion.<br/>
She couldn’t help but think Wanda had picked this place to bug her. To tease her about her impossible standards and to force her to defend herself, be on the back foot.</p><p>But she had no choice. Wanda wanted to talk about Rio, and Agatha had to listen.</p><p>Walking into the dimly lit pub, Agatha gaped at the sight before her. Cramped little tables were littered about the place, housing mostly solo drinkers staring morosely into their half-drunk pints. The carpet beneath her feet had a garish pattern and felt sticky as she moved. But the worst thing of all, the thing she hated most about this pub was the woman sitting primly at the bar, grinning across at her with two thick-stemmed glasses of wine in front of her.</p><p>“My love,” Wanda announced happily, gesturing for Agatha to take a seat. “I’m so glad you could make it.”</p><p>“Didn’t give me much choice.”</p><p>“Oh don’t be like that. We can still be friends, you know. You used to enjoy my company.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in disagreement and turned to the sticky bar, her gaze sweeping across it before settling back in on Wanda as she took the seat opposite her.</p><p>“Talk,” she snapped, no room for argument in her tone.</p><p>Wanda continued to grin, looking like she had just arrived at Disneyland rather than this grim inner city pub. “Well,” she started; shifting a little as if to get comfortable. “I have a proposal for you. I want you to champion by bid on Senator Stark’s new clean water bill.”</p><p>Agatha’s brain malfunctioned for a second and she stared across at Wanda in disbelief before releasing a bark of a laugh, “What? Why on earth would I do that? It would be suicide to back my ex-wife. Everybody wants on that bill. Stark would never speak to me again. He’d think I was a hack. Or worse, going soft.”</p><p>“Well,” Wanda drawled again, placing her elbow on the bar and leaning in towards Agatha. “Because if you don’t, I’ll expose your little hooker of a girlfriend.”</p><p>All humour dropped from Agatha’s face and she stared at Wanda, unsure she heard her right. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I said,” Wanda began again patiently, “if you don’t do this for me. I’ll expose Rio for the whore that she is.”</p><p>It happened so quickly then, Agatha’s hand came down fiercely against Wanda’s cheek, “Say that again I <em>dare</em> you.”</p><p>The response was immediate. Wanda’s eyes teared up, both from the shock and the sharp pain of the slap. Her mouth falling open as she gazed over at Agatha who sneered back at her, lifting her chin, “<em>I dare you</em>,” she whispered again, leaning in dangerously close to the woman she’d once said vows to.</p><p>Wanda‘s eyes widened and she looked hurt as she reached up to touch her cheek, her mouth faltering slightly before she spoke again. Her voice had lost its teasing tone, and was instead softer, the voice she used to use when she wanted something, the one she used when she wanted Agatha to give her something. Or, at least, used to use. “I sleep with half of D.C. and you shout a little, kick me out, but I call Rio a whore and you slap me? Fuck, Agatha. Don’t tell me you’ve fallen for the little…” but she didn’t finish her sentence as Agatha reached across and gripped the front of her shirt, grasping it so tightly that she pulled Wanda almost out of her seat. “Do. Not.”</p><p>She shoved her back and Wanda only just managed to steady herself, blinking across at Agatha. “How?” Agatha demanded, “How did you find out about Rio?”</p><p>Her brain was working a mile a minute trying to figure out how Wanda had done in just three days what she’d managed to do in weeks. How she’d found Rio.</p><p>“I didn’t know. I guessed. You’ve just confirmed.”</p><p>A smug smile twitched at Wanda’s lip as she surveyed the woman before her, “A client of mine had a new pool put in. Somewhere in the Cape. She was showing me pictures and there she was. Beautiful Rio, lying out in the tiniest bikini, looking…” but she trailed off slowly, smiling sweetly as she caught Agatha’s mouth twitch, “Anyway. It was brief. But it was Rio. Only Abigail referred to her as <em>Rachel</em>. A girl she had a casual relationship with. Mostly sex apparently. And I thought, huh. Isn’t it odd that the pretty girl my ex showed up with to her best friend’s party also went by a different name and was also fucking a client of mine. She has a type. Rich women. So I joined the dots and…” with a flourish she held her hands up, “Voila.”</p><p>Agatha had been grinding her teeth the whole time Wanda spoke and if she weren’t so furious at the woman before her she’d be seething with jealousy. That, she decided, she’d have to deal with later.</p><p>“So you think I’ll get you in with Stark in order to protect Rio’s job?”</p><p>Wanda laughed softly, “oh come on. don’t be naive. Think about it. If Rio’s… <em>servicing</em> people like you and Abigail, who else would she have… <em>worked</em> for. Powerful people. <em>Scary</em> people. People who wouldn’t like if their little piece on the side, their classy, sexy girlfriend, was exposed as…” but she stopped short again, letting the unsaid hang between them.</p><p>Agatha drew in a steadying breath, knowing what Wanda was saying could be true. And even if it wasn’t, would she risk Rio’s safety for the sake of pissing her ex off? She straightened then and tried to focus on the business of the piece. “Stark will never work with you. He doesn’t <em>like</em> you. He doesn’t <em>trust</em> you. And he’ll see through your attempts to get close to this.”</p><p>“Oh, but he likes <em>you</em>. And this is important, Aggie. I want that contract. I want the kudos. I want exclusivity. I want it.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze, trying to decide whether this ask was even possible. It might not be. And either way, it could be career suicide. But Wanda continued, “Also,” Wanda sing-songed, her smug smirk returning to her face, “I’d like a night with her.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows shot up and she felt like Wanda had slapped <em>her</em> then as she glared across at her. “Fuck off, Wanda,” she hissed violently, leaning in to press a finger against the red head’s chest, “go anywhere near her and I will kill you.”</p><p>Wanda just smiled serenely and took Agatha’s hand that was quickly snatched away, “You never did share very well. But fine. Just Stark’s bill. I want bragging rights to it. ‘’Maximoff Industries’ helped <em>you</em> access clean water.’ I’ll give you until the night before the wedding. Midnight. Let’s make it like a fairytale.”</p><p>Agatha balked and found herself speechless, torn between visceral fury and a sudden urge to vomit. “Fine.”</p><p>With a sickening grin, Wanda slipped from her stool and placed a deliberate kiss to Agatha’s cheek before sauntering off into the day beyond the pub door.</p><p>Agatha, now sat in a place she wouldn’t be seen dead in, felt the weight of everything crash over her. Rio had been exposed. Rio would be ruined. Rio might be in danger.</p><p>Shuddering at the thought, she scraped back her hair and began to work.</p><p>She didn’t have the sense of mind to understand just how far she’d come in that moment. Her biggest concern had once been her own exposure, her own embarrassment. And now all she could think about was the look in a pair of deep brown eyes as she realised her world had been torn apart because of Agatha.</p><p>It took five emails and two phone calls to finally get Stark on the phone and when she did, she realised how Herculean this task would be. He really didn’t like Wanda.</p><p>“Harkness,” the man drawled, “Why have you not called me lately? And why are you so desperate for me now? Change your mind about the man-hating thing, sweetheart?”</p><p>“Stark. As charming as ever. I need a favour.”</p><p>Tony listened in closely to Agatha’s spiel about her ex-wife. How diligent she was, how many connections she had, how much money she could bring to the table. How she could lobby with the best of them, and charm the pants off off any fence-sitters. But Stark knew their history. So he knew that already.</p><p>“So tell me this,” he questioned after letting Agatha run on for longer than he usually would, “Wanda? I thought you were getting me Banner for this. It makes more sense. Cleaner. Everyone happy. Maximoff is… dirty work.”</p><p>Agatha thrummed her fingers methodically against the sticky bar, wishing she’d moved to somewhere a little cleaner for this kind of conversation. “She’s hard. She’s relentless. She’ll get you what you need.”</p><p>There was silence on the other end of the line, Tony’s voice muffled as he said something to someone on the other end with him. But then came, “Fine. Come meet me tomorrow in Geneva. Let’s talk. Bye, Harkness.”</p><p>It was done then. The first knot in the noose for her own neck.</p><p>She made plans to fly out the next day to catch Tony as around his speaking obligations at the UN. She booked the flight, arranged the hotel, and called up her contacts to help her begin her brief. She had to nail it on her first try. Or she’d lose.</p><p>As she worked, she stopped only briefly to move to somewhere a little more up market and to pay Rio her due. She sent her far more than she’d charged, or was expecting, and hoped the extra would assuage her guilt. Because that was another monster chewing at Agatha. The guilt that she’d introduced Rio to a woman who would expose her carefully curated life on top of the guilt from her own behaviour. Her inability to stop flying off the handle. To have understood that Rio was just doing her job and Agatha shouldn’t punish her for that.</p><p>The work was painful, made all the worse because it felt so futile, but it was a welcome distraction from the other piece of painful information she’d heard about Rio. Abigail. The name of the woman she’d seen her emailing just yesterday. Abigail with the new pool. Abigail who Rio wore tiny bikinis for. Abigail who saw Rio regularly.</p><p>It ate her up. It gnawed at her brain with a viciousness that made her want to explode. She wanted Abigail to feel the same pain. She wanted her to feel Rio slipping from her, so far away she’d never be able to reach her again, landing permanently in Agatha’s arms instead.</p><p>But there was nothing to do. Nothing she could do other than to try and stop the inevitable from happening; try to prevent Rio’s exposure.</p><p>Hours later, Agatha was striding down the King’s Road, having just met with a contact who would help write the brief for Stark when she finally gave in and answered her vibrating phone.</p><p>She’d ignored all of Jen’s fifteen calls up until this point. “What is it?”</p><p>“Jesus. Where have you been and why are you ignoring my calls, Agatha?”</p><p>“I’m busy,” Agatha responded tartly, “what do you want?”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes on the other end of the line and though Agatha obviously couldn’t see it she could feel it. “Look, I’ll be home soon. I’m just sorting something.”</p><p>Jen huffed out a breath then but decided to drop it, “Billy’s coming over to make dinner. Be on your best behaviour. And… whilst we’re at it let’s discuss whatever happened with you and Rio, yeah?”</p><p>Agatha froze on her spot, and was jostled by the people trying to move about her on the busy London street. “Rio? No. Why?” Her defensive tone wasn’t lost on Jen as she responded, “You’re blowing hot and cold. It’s painfully obvious you’re smitten and you keep pushing her away. I was talking to Alice about it and she said…”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed then, still rooted to the spot. “Leave it alone, Jen.”</p><p>Jen just sighed and shook her head, “You’ll lose her if you keep this up. I’m just warning you. You know I hate moping.”</p><p>Agatha huffed heavily but felt her blood begin to boil again, feeling, not for the first time, that she’d already lost Rio and having to remind herself that she never really had her in the first place.</p><p>She hung up then, not bothering to say goodbye.</p><p>A little while later, on an unknown street in an unknown borough is where Agatha stopped to pick up the only thing she could think to get to remind Rio that, if only for a night, she was hers. She knew it was childish, churlish, even. But she couldn’t help it. A white hot jealously that had earlier caused her to bury herself in her work had now curdled into possession. She needed Rio to feel her. Really feel her. To be left wanting for nothing but her again. Especially in the days when Agatha couldn’t be with her.</p><p>She eventually made it home with her new purchase and hid it in her attic room, frustrated that Rio wasn’t there already and that she’d have to wait, biding her time to ask her permission. To request the thing she wanted most: to make her hers.</p><p>As she waited, ignoring the inane chatter of Jen and Billy she unconsciously worked her way into a burning fury. Fury at Wanda, at this rich bitch Abigail, but mostly at herself. That she had allowed herself to fall for someone she’d never met, then pine for someone she had for a week, then ultimately destroy even the slimmest chance she’d had of having a good, easy time with Rio.</p><p>It was sickening.</p><p>But soon Rio’s bright smile had made its way back into her dark day and she reached for her, pulling her close and whispering, “Jen’s been asking questions all day. Play along.”</p><p>Her nose brushed just along Rio’s ear and she did her best not to breathe the woman in and cause herself to lose it completely, “Please.”</p><p>It was in the second that Rio kissed her that she knew she wouldn’t be able to get over this so easily. Whatever this was.</p><p>And it was hours later when she made her most stubborn, stupidest mistake.</p><p>“I don’t want you to kiss me.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t believe the words had fallen from her lips before she could stop them. They were a reaction to Rio forcing them further into the professional agreement they’d made. Their mutual contract. She could feel herself pulling away from Rio even as she desired nothing but to be all over her. Keeping her for herself.</p><p>But she’d said it. And she couldn’t take it back.</p><p>The conversation that followed was painful and did nothing to calm the monster inside that was gnawing at its cages to get to Rio, to claim her.</p><p>But it was when Rio had turned her head from her, when she’d denied her kiss, that she’d seen red. It didn’t make sense, not really. Rio was doing as Agatha had asked. But Agatha didn’t want what she’d asked. She didn’t want rules and she didn’t want to be denied. She wanted everything.</p><p>And despite spending the rest of the night doing everything she could to make Rio hers, with only a slight concern about breaking her, she felt desperate still.</p><p>Only when Agatha left that night did she let her true feelings out. The piece of her she’d  hidden away. And it spilled out in hot, thick tears even as she charged from the house, and into the night.</p><p>——</p><p>Agatha sat staring up at the woman she’d travelled across Europe for. The woman she’d suffered through two sleepless nights for. The woman for whom she’d bullied an arrogant senator into agreeing to work with her evil ex-wife. The past two days had been tough. Tony had put her through the wringer. And Wanda had called her every hour, either to remind her of what was at stake or to ask about her progress. None of this was made easier by the questions she was getting form every angle, the curious looks from Tony’s team as she lobbied them to accept support from a CEO who was not their first choice, not even in their top ten. Maximoff Industries was the epitome of everything wrong in the world. Wanda had built her business, with a lot of help from Agatha, so that she was now one of the richest women in America. Only when Agatha had left her, she’d taken a sharp turn to dodgy dealings. Making money fast, but tarring herself with her own brush of the morally questions dealings, often with arms dealers or dubious nuclear powers.</p><p>“She’s bringing her dirty hands into my clean water,” Stark had quipped in the fourth hour of his first interrogation with Agatha. He wasn’t wrong.</p><p>Her loyalties were called into question. Her instincts queried and her political acumen, for the first time in her career, doubted.</p><p>She’d managed it, though - manipulating Stark into choosing her ex-wife.</p><p>But as she looked up to wide brown eyes she couldn’t bring herself to care much about all of that.</p><p>Her gaze was soft as she took Rio in, her fingers flexing slightly against her thigh and  as Rio leant in to press their lips together for the second time that day Agatha felt her whole body collapse around her. Her hold went slack and she forgot that she had to kiss back, had to respond the way she wanted to. Desperately, infinitely wanting.</p><p>Just as she turned her head and opened her mouth to pry Rio’s lips open with her tongue she felt a jolt on her chair.</p><p>Of course, Jen.</p><p>“You <em>cannot</em> get more action than me at <em>my</em> wedding.”</p><p>Agatha smirked across at Jen, smugly giving Rio a light squeeze as she did so, as if to show off that she could, “Oh go fuck your wife.”</p>

<p>Rio’s hand remained in its place against Agatha’s chest, but the intimate bubble they’d created for each other just a second ago had burst.</p><p>Agatha was now rounding on Jen and Rio’s gaze drifted to Alice, who was beaming across at her, oblivious to what had just occurred between her and Agatha, herself and Wanda. Hearing Jen’s laughter and briefly checking Agatha was in on the joke and not about to become a murderer because of it, she slipped away from her hold and moved to take her place between Alice and Lilia.</p><p>Across the small table Agatha’s eyes had followed her and Rio caught her gaze, sending her a gentle wink in acknowledgement. But away from Agatha’s hold she felt her body go cold. Her hackles rise slightly as the reality of what could have happened, of all the questions she still had, raced through her mind.</p><p>“Made up again, I see?” Alice whispered conspiratorially, reaching for her glass of champagne. “Knew it wouldn’t be long.”</p><p>“Written in the stars,” Lilia twinkled across at her, giving Rio that same look she’d given before where Rio couldn’t help but think she knew more than she was letting on.</p><p>Just as the words <em>spooky bitch</em> were forming in her mind, her attention was caught by a shout from Jen, “Hey! Agatha’s whipping boy!”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and smirked as Agatha slapped Jen’s arm, “Yes, your highness?”</p><p>“If you can keep your hands off of Agatha for the length of the meal I’ll give you a million bucks.” Rio laughed at that and turned to stare disbelievingly at Agatha who looked incredibly annoyed by this.</p><p>“Pay me not to touch her? Now there’s a thing.”</p><p>“Just for that she’ll be in my lap the whole meal, Kale.”</p><p>“I like the girl Aggie but she is not at the top table.”</p><p>“Don’t call me that. And she’s my guest, I’m your best friend, she can sit with me.”</p><p>Rio was watching this exchange closely, goosebumps raising across her skin as she saw the possessive fire awaken in steely blue eyes. But her reverie was broken as Alice stood and moved to wrap her arms around her bride, “Enough. Rio’s next to Billy on Table 2. He can keep her entertained and I’m sure Agatha will have a pretty view.” She ducked her head then and began to pepper kisses all over Jen’s cheeks which caused a lot of consternation, “Hey! Hey! Don’t ruin this masterpiece. I had a girl working all morning on this!”</p><p>Rio laughed despite herself, the tension in her body easing slightly as she felt Agatha’s gaze on her again. She sucked in a slow breath as the woman stood from her seat and made her way around, offering a hand down to her that she gladly took. “If you’ll excuse us, ladies, if we’re actually being banned from touching then I’m going to take Rio off somewhere private for a little while.”</p><p>Rio’s brow raised as she was pulled to her feet and gently led through the crowds of people, not missing Jen’s shout of, “Nasty!”</p><p>Agatha’s hand settled comfortably on her hip and it felt a sharp contrast to the way Wanda had healed her there earlier. It made her shudder. Something Agatha didn’t miss.</p><p>When they were finally through the crowds and Agatha had dismissed any attempt at conversation with her from the other guests, Agatha pulled Rio into the same small room she’d found Rio in before. Her hand fell from Rio then and she moved across to the small selection of alcohol on the counter to pour two measures of whatever brown, high-proof liquid was sitting waiting in the decanter. “Did she try something?”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, and lied, protecting Agatha more than protecting Wanda. “No.”</p><p>Agatha turned then, holding one glass full of amber liquid to her chest and the other out to Rio. “Why are you lying? I know Wanda. I know what she’d do.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and moved to take the offered glass, placing it down again by Agatha’s hip, “I’ve had a drink already and it’s going to be a long evening.”</p><p>Agatha watched her closely but said nothing as she placed her own glass down beside Rio’s, “If you’re worried I’ll be mad…”</p><p>“I’m not. It just doesn’t matter. She asked and I said no.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose and Rio then took the opportunity to lean in, dipping her head slightly to press a soft kiss to the corner of Agatha’s lips. “I said no,” she repeated gently.</p><p>“Will you tell me what happened the past two days? Where you’ve been?”</p><p>But Agatha remained still and Rio wandered if she was going to push her away again but she soon spoke once more, “It doesn’t matter.” She said dismissively and then softened her tone slightly as she said: “But I want you to tell me if she tries anything. Even after… when we’re not together.” Blue eyes opened again and to Rio’s surprise they were much softer than she expected them to be.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered quietly, her hands moving then to clasp around Agatha’s waist, “But you don’t have to protect me, Agatha. I’m a big girl. I know what I’m doing.” Though deep down Rio knew that Agatha had already done just that. She knew she’d have stepped in the moment Wanda had discovered her secret. What worried her was how.</p><p>Agatha remained silent, brooding over Rio’s words, unable to tell her just how far she’d gone to protect her.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, worried Agatha was beginning to bring up her walls again. Her fingers flexed against Agatha’s waist and she leant in to kiss her softly again, capturing her lips fully this time in a gentle kiss. “Don’t shut me out tonight, okay? Let me in just a little.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes closed again and she pressed their foreheads together, her hands moving up to rest against Rio’s neck.</p><p>“I’m sorry about her. About Wanda. I can’t imagine she just…” but she sighed and pressed her body closer to Rio’s, “I can’t stand it.”</p><p>Rio nodded as best she could and felt her heart ache at Agatha’s admission, her own body relaxing under her gaze, her breathing slow as she leant in again to whisper against Agatha’s lips, “Wanda is nothing. Not compared to you.”</p><p>She pulled back then, aware this was heavily pushing the boundaries between being good at her job, providing the experience but not the depth, and the reality of the situation, how she felt about Agatha and how she hoped Agatha felt about her.</p><p>As her skin began to feel hot under Agatha’s gaze and proximity to her body, Agatha closed the gap between them. The kiss was hungry, searching. Agatha was tugging at Rio again, and she moaned as Rio nipped lightly at her lower lip, opening her mouth to let Rio’s tongue crash against her own.</p><p>They kissed hungrily, tongues fighting for dominance and Agatha holding Rio so tightly she thought she’d soon blackout from the intensity of it all. But just as Agatha was spinning them to press Rio against the sideboard the door opened and a voice rang out.</p><p>“I’m not looking! I’m not looking!”</p><p>Agatha pulled away and groaned loudly but pressed her face against Rio’s neck instead of turning around. “Get the fuck out of here, Billy.”</p><p>Rio huffed softly, her body on fire in the places Agatha was touching her but she moved her head to look over at Billy who was standing sheepishly in the door with his hand covering his eyes. “What is it, Billy?”</p><p>Her hand trailed down Agatha’s waist and squeezed her gently as she felt soft lips begin to subtly explore her throat. She kept it gentle, barely moving at all as her tongue darted out to taste Rio, causing her breath to hitch.</p><p>But Billy was too far away to hear it and certainly couldn’t see it. “Jen says your absence is noticeable. And… and that you should ‘get your fucking ass out here before she drags it out’.”</p><p>Despite Agatha’s soft explorations, Rio released a throaty chuckle and finally found the strength to pull back an inch or two, stopping her from where she’d been licking up to Rio’s ear. “Agatha,” she breathed softly, “Shouldn’t we get back to your friends?”</p><p>But before Agatha could speak or protest in any other way, Billy spoke again: “And Rio, Alice wants you out too. But mostly because I think she’s worried Agatha won’t listen to Jen but she might listen to you.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and finally turned around to Billy with a scowl, pulling away from Rio entirely, “Billy! Out!”</p><p>Rio grinned at this and called after Billy as he grimaced and made to leave, “Give us five minutes. We’ll be back soon, I promise.”</p><p>“Promise?” Agatha gaped as she whipped around to Rio and Billy slunk from the room. “Five minutes?!”</p><p>Rio beamed at Agatha and placed a soft kiss to her cheek, “You can keep it in your pants for the rest of the evening, surely?”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha scowled, bending slightly and lifting Rio to perch on the edge of the counter, glancing down between them and already beginning to push up Rio’s skirt.</p><p>Rio hummed softly, enjoying the feeling of Agatha’s hands against her thighs once more but keeping her breathing steady to fight off the desire to submit to her touch. “We have time,” she said quietly, moving her hands to Agatha’s neck and brushing her thumbs along her jaw, “Plenty of time.”</p><p>But time was what Agatha was worried about. Time was slipping away. And this time tomorrow Rio would be completely out of reach.</p><p>“We don’t,” Agatha muttered, her gaze now settled on Rio’s collarbones as she pushed her legs open slightly and moved closer, “I don’t want to waste it on other people when I could be right here.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and brushed her fingers lightly through Agatha’s hair as the woman pressed closer and nudged at her jaw with the bridge of her nose, “I’ll discuss rules. We can do that.” Agatha was bargaining now, trying to prove to Rio that she could do it her way. That she’d do it any way she wanted if it meant they could stay like this. Preferably all night. Ideally forever.</p><p>But Rio dipped her head and pressed a light kiss to Agatha’s cheek, “We can’t right now. But later on, when this is over, before I leave tomorrow. You can have me.”</p><p>Agatha groaned softly, and pushed up to capture Rio’s lips again, sucking lightly on her lower lip before she pulled away.</p><p>She stepped back then fully and Rio almost took everything back. Almost reached to pull Agatha back to her and force her close again.</p><p>Agatha’s brow was furrowed slightly and she ran a shaking hand through her hair, her other reaching up to brush over her lips, aware her lipstick was probably all smudged. “Jen owes me a lot for this. Too much.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened and she slipped from the ledge, pushing down her skirt again and straightening herself out. “I’ll make it up to you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but reached out a hand to Rio and began to worry her lower lip between her teeth, “Just… don’t stray far tonight, okay? I want you close.”</p><p>There was something deeper behind her words that Rio registered, not possessiveness anymore. Protectiveness.</p><p>So she nodded and pressed herself back against Agatha, reassuring her with her touch as she rested her arms over her shoulders, “Going to make true on that promise to have me in your lap at the top table?”</p><p>Agatha laughed then, the noise loud and true, the tension breaking slightly, as she wrapped her arms back around Rio, “All I can think about right now is having you in my lap.” She nipped lightly at Rio’s jaw, “Whether everyone can see or not.”</p><p>Rio shuddered at the attention, pulling away slowly to gaze into Agatha’s eyes as she said, “We need to leave before I change my mind.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched up into a ghost of a smirk and she tugging Rio impossibly closer, “Change it. Just this once.”</p><p>But Rio shook her head, beginning to unfurl herself from Agatha’s hold and eventually pulling back to drag her from the room, silently leading them both out to the party, and revelling in the knowledge that Agatha had let her in. If only slightly.</p><p>As they ventured back to the party Rio didn’t have long before she felt her free hand being taken by someone who wasn’t Agatha. Slender fingers clasped hers and yanked her from Agatha’s hold, already pulling her in the opposite direction. “Thank god. I need you to distract Alice’s boss. He likes pretty girls and you smile a lot so he’ll love you,” Jen was saying rapidly as if worried Agatha would get her hands on Rio again and pull her away.</p><p>She wasn’t wrong. Agatha was pressing close behind and looking furious. “Jen. Jen would you stop being such a,” but her words died on her tongue as they all came to a halt in front of Alice and a tall, ridiculously handsome man.</p><p>Agatha clattered inelegantly into Rio’s side at the sudden stop and Rio turned to smile at her, taking her hand back and tugging lightly as she scowled. “Bitch,” Agatha muttered for Rio only to hear, darting her gaze away to Jen who was busy grabbing the man’s arm.</p><p>Rio just laughed under her breath and tugged playfully at Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Steve! This is who I wanted to introduce you to.”</p><p>Rio’s brows raised as Jen held out her arms to Rio as if to say, “ta dah!”</p><p>She thankfully didn’t but she did then reach to pat Rio’s arm, “Rio, meet Steve, Alice’s boss.” Brown eyes flicked over to Alice who was looking a little sheepish and mouthed to her, ‘I’m so sorry’. “Steve has a big green thumb and would love to pick your brains about gardening. I’ve told him all about you.”</p><p>Rio continued to look a little surprised as she focused back in on the tall man opposite her giving her a subtle once over and she felt Agatha shift beside her. “And I’m Agatha,” she interjected haughtily, offering a hand to the man, “Rio’s girlfriend.” Steve was the one to look surprised now and looked between then as he took Agatha’s hand. “Kept that part quiet, Jen.”</p><p>Jen had the decency to look a little shame-faced but recovered quickly and went to take Alice’s hand, “Why don’t we leave you to get acquainted and we’ll catch you later.” With that, and without giving Agatha the chance to so much as shoot her a glare, she disappeared off hand in hand with Alice. Rio could have sworn she saw them dip into the same room she’d just been in with Agatha.</p><p>“So,” came the cheerful voice of Steve, taking a sip of his drink as he focused back in on Rio, “Gardener, huh? Can’t imagine someone like you getting their hands dirty.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat loudly beside her and shot daggers up at the man but Rio simply slid her arm around Agatha’s waist and smiled sweetly, “It’s not so dirty if you know what you’re doing.” Steve laughed a great booming laugh that made Agatha want to punch him in the throat but he seemed to steady again as he caught her glare, “you two thinking about marriage?” He glanced at where their bodies were pressed closely and dared to look Rio over again, who matched his gaze with a cool one of her own, “It’s not something we’ve spoken about.”</p><p>“Huh,” Steve offered, a grin falling to his face as he took a sip of his drink, “Interesting.”</p><p>“Is it?” Agatha countered steadily, “How so?”</p><p>“Just…” he gestured vaguely and his gaze gave him away as it focused back in on Rio. Rio sucked in a breath and turned to Agatha then, feeling the anger practically radiate off of the woman. “Could you fetch me a glass of wine, <em>mi amor</em>?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed from where she continued to scowl at Steve but she nodded, flicking her gaze over to Rio briefly before strutting away to the bar. Once she arrived, she kept the two in her sightline.</p><p>“So,” Rio tried again, feeling a little calmer now Agatha was out of the man’s orbit. “Did you actually want to talk gardening or were you looking to try and flirt with me some more infront of my girlfriend?”</p><p>Steve blinked stupidly and threw up his hands in mock surrender, “Come on, Jen made out like you were up for grabs! It just took me by surprise is all. Forgive a man for enjoying what he sees.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes then but in the back of her mind she knew she had to play this carefully, it being Alice’s boss and all. “I’m not interested. Neither of us are. So unless you can be respectful of that…”</p><p>“Woah, woah. I apologise. I’m sorry, I’ve not long come out of a breakup and…” but he was cut off as Agatha returned to Rio’s side holding two glasses of wine. “Did I miss anything important?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly, taking her wine and slipping her free hand into Agatha’s again, “Nothing at all.”</p><p>From then on Steve began to behave himself, though every so often he caught steely blue eyes staring at him as his eyes drifted south of Rio’s chin.</p><p>Twenty painful minutes later a flushed looking Jen appeared again, nudging Agatha’s shoulder, “Oh good, no one’s killed anyone. Steve, I think I saw Peggy over by the door. Why don’t you go say hi?” Steve seemed to stiffen at this but nodded his consent, politely saying his goodbyes and glancing one last time at Rio before leaving.</p><p>“What the fuck, Jen?”</p><p>“Look, I couldn’t allow you two nymphos to fuck before we did at <em>our</em> wedding. Besides, Steve’s cute if you like that sort of thing and he’s not <em>bad</em> company, per se.”</p><p>“We <em>don’t</em> like that sort of thing and he was trying to get into Rio’s pants because <em>you</em> failed to mention she wasn’t single.”</p><p>Rio looked between the two women now barring down on each other and slowly sipped on her wine, her gaze soon falling to Alice as she grinned foolishly over at her, “He’s okay, really. Just a bit arrogant.”</p><p>Rio hummed in response and tugged at Agatha just as she was saying, “And as for your fucking assistant…”</p><p>“Agatha, calm down. Let’s go mingle some more and you can show me off, okay?”</p><p>She hoped her playful tone would bring the softer Agatha from before back and it seemed to work as Agatha grumbled and moved away from Jen, “You’re lucky I’m not doing a speech, Jennifer. Alice, you’re not off the hook either.”</p><p>As they moved through the crowd, stopping occasionally for quick hellos or polite introductions, Rio felt Agatha begin to relax again. She turned to her fully only once they found a quiet spot near the corner of the bar and Rio placed her wine down there. “It doesn’t take much does it?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched as she placed her own glass down and moved into Rio’s space, her gaze falling to trace the curves of her body, “What doesn’t?”</p><p>“To make you jealous. At one point I thought you were going to rip his head off.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes then and shook her head back slightly, “He was being rude.”</p><p>Rio just smiled and shrugged her shoulders, “I’m just saying. It doesn’t take much.” Agatha moved in closer then, her fingers lightly grazing the skin visible at the top of Rio’s slit in her skirt. “Are you though? ‘Into that sort of thing’?” She’d attempted to keep her tone light but her brow was furrowed a little and she moved her other hand to Rio’s waist as she pressed her back against the bar.</p><p>“No,” Rio reassured softly, tilting her head as she surveyed the woman before her, “No, I’m not.”</p><p>“Are you saying that because…”</p><p>But Rio cut her off, “I’m saying it because it’s true. I’m not into men.” Agatha nodded slowly at this, relaxing a little as she took Rio in again, looking down at the place her fingers traced her thigh, “Do other people get like this? Jealous?”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched and Agatha’s eyes darted up to look at her, taking in Rio’s parted lips as she tried to work out what to say. Agatha had never intentionally asked about her other clients before and it was her general rule not to discuss them. “Agatha,” she tried softly, moving a hand up to cup her cheek, “Let’s not talk about that.”</p><p>“I want to know,” Agatha whispered, her hand squeezing at Rio’s waist, “Do they?”</p><p>Rio thought about it, thought long and hard about the other women she’d been with. About the ones who wouldn’t let her leave their side. The ones who dismissed her to a corner to remain there to be viewed, but not touched. The ones who got angry if she wasn’t available. Who treated her as less than, or as if she were barely human at all.</p><p>Of course there were others, others who treated her like a queen. Who showered her with gifts, praise, and affection. But always within that was something ugly and discomforting that Rio could never quite put her finger on.</p><p>Yes, her clients got jealous. But not in the way Agatha did. Theirs was a cloying, angry jealousy, a suffocating one. Agatha’s felt different. It felt somehow comforting, and awoke something in Rio that had been dormant for a long time.</p><p>“Yes, sometimes,” she settled with, still eyeing Agatha closely. The noise of the party around them seemed to dim then as Agatha leant in and pressed her lips so softly against Rio’s that she thought her heart wouldn’t be able to take it.</p><p>She didn’t deepen the kiss and instead pulled away slowly, both hands now resting solidly against Rio’s hips, “And you’re seeing another one soon. After this?”</p><p>Rio felt a lump in her throat then as her gaze swept over Agatha’s face, clearly hurting but unable to say it. “Yes,” she breathed, the word barely audible even in their proximity.</p><p>Agatha nodded as her thumbs brushed the skin of Rio’s sides. “Okay,” she whispered quietly back. Rio moved her hands then to pull Agatha closer to her and pressed a soft kiss to her ear. Unable to speak for a few seconds for fear her voice would catch she eventually whispered, “You have me now. Can we focus on that?”</p><p>But she didn’t get a response as the room filled with a loud voice announcing dinner. People around them began to move, all rushing to find their seats on the table plan at the other end of the room.</p><p>Agatha had moved back, her eyes sweeping around them and avoiding Rio’s entirely.</p><p>“Hey, don’t pull away. Not again. Please.”</p><p>Agatha turned slowly back to Rio and seemed to falter before she pressed a soft kiss back to her lips and took her hand, “we should go.”</p><p>With that Rio followed Agatha, glancing briefly at the table plan as they swept by but knowing she was at Table 2 with Billy. Agatha hovered for a while by Rio’s seat, having moved it out for her and smiling tightly as she sat down. Rio’s hand reached out to take Agatha’s again and she pressed the back of it to her lips before Agatha pulled away and went to find her seat at the top table.</p><p>“I’m sorry about earlier,” Billy mumbled close to her ear as he sat down, “I really thought Jen would fire me if I didn’t interrupt. And that was worth the risk of Agatha actually murdering me.”</p><p>Rio gave his hand a small, reassuring squeeze then and turned to focus on her fellow table mates, making friendly introductions and small talk before the brides were announced and Jen and Alice flew into the room on a wind of noise and shouts from their guests.</p><p>Rio joined in enthusiastically and caught Agatha’s gaze as she clapped for her friends. Rio beamed at the woman and Agatha was able to return her smile, though it didn’t quite meet her eyes.</p><p>The rest of the meal went by agonisingly slowly, with Rio’s solace being only Billy who kept her entertained with stories of his time working for Agatha. “One time, she got so mad at me for breaking a vase that she threw her hands out and broke another one.”</p><p>Every so often Rio would look up at Agatha, catching her gaze or else enjoying watching her interact with her friends, leaning around Jen to talk to Alice or rolling her eyes as Jen teased her.</p><p>Just before the dessert course was served, people began to mill about, swapping tables and going to visit friends across the room. Rio took the opportunity to excuse herself and sauntered up to Agatha, tapping her shoulder and slipping into Agatha’s open arms as she pulled her down onto her lap. “Thank god,” Agatha mumbled against Rio’s shoulder, placing a soft kiss there.</p><p>“She’s been pining,” Jen said with a smirk, “It’s pathetic. One minute she looks like she’s going to kill someone, the next like she’s going to cry.”</p><p>“Shut up before I make you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes with a smile and draped her arm around Agatha’s shoulders as if they’d been doing this their whole lives. “Miss me, baby? Billy’s been telling me all about having you as a boss.”</p><p>Alice laughed from the other side of Jen and Agatha shot her a look which did nothing to silence her. “Did he tell you about the time he lost her passport and Agatha called the Security of State?”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio snorted and looked down at Agatha with delight, “Seriously? That’s so dramatic.”</p><p>“He picked up,” Agatha shrugged with a frown, “I’m important.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Jen drawled, leaning back into Alice’s arms as she turned in her own seat, “You’re annoying. That’s why he picked up.”</p><p>But then some other guests moved up to engage Jen and Alice in conversation and Rio turned back to gaze down at Agatha with a soft smile, “Bothering government officials for a lost passport? Really?”</p><p>“Hey, I got him his job. He owes me.”</p><p>Rio just hummed and tilted Agatha’s head up so she could place a soft kiss to her lips, letting her thumb brush lightly over Agatha’s lower one, “You okay? You drifted earlier.”</p><p>Agatha just nodded and pressed a light kiss to the pad of Rio’s thumb. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Jen’s glass clinked not five minutes later and she stood with a bright smile. <em>Built for business, made for the stage,</em> Rio thought.</p><p>Her arms opened and she swept her gaze across the room, enjoying the admiring whistles and cheers that came her way, “Allow me to say a few words about my wife!”</p><p>The room erupted and even Agatha laughed along, clapping as she gazed up at Jen. Rio’s hand settled against the base of her neck and toyed with the hair there, scratching distractedly as she listened to Jen.</p><p>“No, no… firstly I want to thank every body for being here. It means so much to us to see all of you looking so beautiful and we couldn’t be happier to have you. I’ll keep this short because I know you’re all drunk and as much as you’ll enjoy looking at me I know the dance floor is waiting.” Laughter flew through the room.</p><p>“I have loved Alice since the day that I met her. It didn’t happen slowly, it happened…” she clicked her fingers with a flourish, “like that. My life was forever changed when this woman crashed into it and I am so grateful that she…” her smile faltered then and Rio watched as Jen turned to Alice and took her hand, “that she loved me back in a way I could not have imagined.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands twitched gently against Rio’s side and she looked down to see that blue pools were filling fast, watching her best friends with that soft expression again.</p><p>“I have everything I need right here,” Jen finished softly, so softly that Rio was sure that only the top table would have heard it.</p><p>But no sooner had she said the words than she’d turned back around, clapping her hands together and then raising them in triumph, “So, friends, please raise a toast, to my brilliant, otherworldly, Alice!”</p><p>Rio turned and picked up Agatha’s water glass as Agatha raised her champagne and she toasted alongside the room as she watched Jen and Alice share a tender kiss.</p><p>Looking away she felt Agatha gazing up at her and she blinked down in surprise at the softness still evident in her face. She closed the distance and mirrored the two women beside them, pressing herself as close as she could at the side angle she was at.</p><p>The rest of the meal went by much faster after that. Rio stayed in Agatha’s arms even as an eager-to-please waiter came by and squeezed a seat in beside Agatha. Rio had made to move but Agatha had silently held on. She hadn’t protested after that.</p><p>The table itself and the room around them got steadily drunker, gradually louder, and comfortably messy as people continued to move around, the table plan forgotten.</p><p>Agatha’s hands hadn’t remained still for the rest of the final course, ghosting over Rio’s body in every way she could think of that would either escape Jen’s notice or not get them put on some sort of register.</p><p>Rio had allowed it, leant into it, and at one point even encouraged it as she shifted slightly beneath each delicious stroke or squeeze.</p><p>Before long they were being ushered from the grand hall, taken back to the ballroom where they were met with more drinks and a space cleared for a dance floor with a band set up and playing an Adele song that Rio recognised but couldn’t name.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand and walked with her to the edge of the dance floor, holding her close as the room filled and the announcement was made for the first dance.</p><p>Jen pulled a shy looking Alice to the centre of the floor and draped her long arms around her, tugging her close as the band started up and began singing ‘Let’s Stay Together’. Rio leant into Agatha’s side as the crowd cheered and wolf whistled at the couple now practically grinding together, grinning and laughing into each other’s mouths.</p><p>“Dance with me,” Agatha whispered against Rio’s ear about halfway into the song, as Lilia had just pulled Billy up to dance and an eager Alice was gesturing for more people to join them, desperate for all the eyes not to be on just her.</p><p>Rio didn’t need told twice, she let Agatha take her to the middle of the floor and spin her around, catching her with ease and pressing her grinning face in against Rio’s cheek.</p><p>They danced in silence, their bodies pressed deliciously close together and Rio finding it hard not to openly grope at Agatha as the woman’s hands and body slid so tantalising all over her own.</p><p>“Get a room!” Jen yelled close by as Alice swept her across the floor, eliciting a booming laugh from her bride as she did so.</p><p>Rio pulled back to watch and laugh but found her attention back on Agatha as the woman chuckled darkly against her ear, “I wish we could…” Rio gasped softly as Agatha’s hand slipped past her lower back and ghosted over her ass. “Agatha…”</p><p>“Yes?” She squeezed purposefully then, pulling back to see Rio’s reaction which was a confusing mixture of want and warning. “We can’t leave immediately after the first dance.”</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and moved her hands back to a more polite position on her hips, still swaying gently to the music, “I’ve been away from you for two days,” she reminded with a frown, “and the last time…” she flicked her eyes and dropped her gaze down to Rio’s chest, “I didn’t even really get to see the fruits of my labours.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio grinned and raised her brows, “There it is. I knew it. You wanted to ruin me.”</p><p>“<em>Claim.</em>”, Agatha insisted as something flashed in her eyes, looking back up to Rio again as she leant in to brush their lips together, “I wanted you to be mine.”</p><p>“I am,” Rio reassured softly but she knew it was only partially true. Only in so far as Agatha had her for the rest of the night but Rio would be alone again tomorrow. Missing her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything and instead she pressed a gentle kiss to Rio’s shoulder and continued to dance pressed against her.</p><p>Their little bubble was burst two or three songs later as Alice interrupted and dragged Rio away from Agatha’s clutching hold, “Borrowing her! Will give her back!”</p><p>Before Agatha could so much as complain, Jen was by her side and they both watched one real wife and one fake girlfriend disappear into the throng of drunken dancers.</p><p>“She wants to do the Macarena and thought Rio would be the best person to do it with.” She squinted then, tilting her head, “Which is maybe vaguely racist?”</p><p>Agatha snorted and dragged her friend back from the dance floor to take a seat beside her and watch the ensuing chaos. Alice and Rio now lined up in the middle of the floor, laughing their heads off already as the music kicked in. “I can’t believe you’re allowing this?”</p><p>“What, my hot wife to dance with your hot girlfriend?”</p><p>“No, this song.” Agatha gestured at all the guests dressed in their finery now falling over themselves as they hopped to the beat, now all facing in a variety of directions.</p><p>“Alice enjoys it,” Jen mused, her gaze softening as she stared across at her new wife. “Happy wife, happy life.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed, her attention solely on Rio, watching the way she was manhandling Alice into the right movements and seemed to be singing along to the lyrics.</p><p>The two best friends sat in silence for a while, watching their respective partners, before Jen spoke again, having taken an offered champagne from a waiter and taking one for Agatha too. “Alice said she was leaving first thing in the morning but I thought you said you were going later.”</p><p>“I am,” Agatha sniffed slightly, taking a large gulp of her champagne and earning a glance from Jen at her not-so elegant behaviour. “Work.”</p><p>Jen eyed her closely and sighed, “You ever think you working so hard is what pushed Wa-…” but before she could say it Agatha had whipped her head around, “Don’t talk to me about her. I mean it. Never again.”</p><p>Jen blinked but nodded, “O-Kay… weird reaction but fine.” They fell then into a slightly more tense silence that Jen broke again, just as the Macarena shifted into the Cha Cha Slide and Agatha groaned softly.</p><p>“You ever think that this could have been our wedding day?”</p><p>Agatha’s groan turned into a snort and she laughed as she turned to Jen, “What one drunken mistake in college and suddenly we could have been married?”</p><p>“Hey, I’m just saying. You were goddamn head over heels for me.”</p><p>“I was not!” Agatha shouted indignantly, “You were arrogant and rude and you never let me bring girls back.”</p><p>Jen just scoffed, “Because you brought one back every night. I barely got any sleep.”</p><p>“Not my fault you had no game.”</p><p>“I had game enough to sleep with <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes at that and sipped on her drink again as she watched Rio ‘cha cha real smooth’. “It wouldn’t have worked anyway. We’d have killed each other two weeks in.”</p><p>“Nah,” Jen drawled, nudging their shoulders together, “We’d have rubbed along fine. Once you got your head out of your ass.” Agatha laughed then and turned to Jen with a genuine smile, “You’re a pain in my ass.”</p><p>“I know and you love it.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled but didn’t deny it and leant back against the table as she focused back in on Rio apparently having the time of her life on the dance floor.</p><p>“Think we need to worry about these two running off together?”</p><p>“Alice is too smitten.”</p><p>“And Rio isn’t? She’s just willingly sat in your lap for almost an hour. I saw you pawing at her, by the way. Disgusting.”</p><p>“She loved it.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, horny bitch.”</p><p>Thankfully for Agatha, the Cha Cha Slide ended and Rio came hurtling towards her, as Alice did Jen. They both collapsed either side of their date, their chests heaving dramatically and Rio reaching to knock back the last of Agatha’s champagne, desperate for a drink. “Easy,” Agatha mused and leant down to press a teasing kiss to Rio’s heaving bosom. She lingered for a second then pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek, “That was something I thought I’d never see.”</p><p>“Only because you don’t know how to have fun,” Rio teased right back, her cheeks flushed and her smile bright. Agatha rolled her eyes and pulled Rio’s hand into her lap, squeezing it affectionately.</p><p>Despite wanting to be as close to Rio as possible all night, Agatha did allow that she was enjoying watching Rio twirl her way along the dance floor with her friends for the rest of the evening. Rio danced with them all, but flew back to Agatha whenever she got the chance, enjoying being pressed against her, even when the rest of the dance floor were jumping around them and ruining their private moments.</p><p>But as the band began to wind down and the last song of the night started up, Rio’s smile faded and her heart sank. Guests had already started to make their goodbyes, congratulating the happy couple and spilling out of the building. But a few were left. The important few. The ones who loved Jen and Alice the most.</p><p>So as Billy pulled Lilia up and insisted on leading this time, and as Alice tugged Jen close to her, Rio turned to Agatha and offered her hand. “Dance with me?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze moved slowly from where she’d been watching her friends with a small, sad smile, to meet Rio’s gaze and she nodded as she took her hand and allowed herself to be pulled to the middle of the floor.</p><p>Rio slotted her arms loosely around Agatha’s neck and sighed into the embrace as Agatha pulled her in close by the waist, nuzzling their noses together and pressing a soft kiss to her lips. Agatha tasted of a heady mixture of champagne and whisky, and Rio wanted to drink in as much as she could, knowing this may be her last chance.</p><p>As they swayed slowly to a gentle cover of ‘Always Be My Baby’, Rio kept her face pressed close to Agatha’s, her hands now buried firmly in thick wavy hair as she held her close. Agatha’s breathing had picked up slightly and Rio didn’t know if it was the proximity or the heat but her cheeks were flushed as she applied pressure to Rio’s lower back and held her as close as she could. Before long they’d stopped moving and Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha whispered against her mouth, only barely brushing their lips together, “I need to take you home.”</p><p>She nodded slightly but was reluctant to pull away and only when she felt the air rush between them as Agatha peeled off her did she feel how dizzy she was with desire. Agatha had moved quickly then, pulling Rio behind her as she moved to give Jen and Alice quick kisses to their cheeks, doing the same for Lilia and Billy. Rio just smiled dumbly, and allowed herself to be pulled by Agatha from the ballroom and into the cool night air.</p>

<p>Rio’s teeth were biting into her lower lip so hard she thought she’d draw blood.</p><p>She’d fallen so far from professional in the time it took them to hurry from the ballroom and stand in the freezing street ordering a cab. Agatha had wrapped Rio in her coat and attached herself to her lips, warming her up in more ways than one.</p><p>As they’d clambered into the Uber, Agatha reluctantly releasing Rio in order to do so, she’d been pulled back towards the woman almost immediately. Apparently sitting on either side of the car was now too far for Agatha. Rio needed to be flush against her.</p><p>As the driver pulled off, Agatha’s hand had slipped innocently over Rio’s thigh, experimentally ghosting across the skin now accessible through the long slit that ended sinfully close to Rio’s hip. Rio was keeping her eyes forwards, praying Agatha would behave herself. They were in an uber for Godsake.</p><p>But she felt her breath hitch as Agatha dared to push her hand slowly, agonisingly slowly, beneath the opening of her skirt, ghosting her long fingers over the curve of her thigh and dipping slowly inwards.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned, her gaze now landing on Agatha’s face, “Don’t.”</p><p>Agatha halted her movements and turned to press a kiss to the corner of Rio’s lips, murmuring against them, “Just a little more…”</p><p>That’s when Rio’s teeth sunk into her lower lip. When her thighs moved just slightly to grant Agatha access and she stretched out her fingers to brush ever so lightly over the lace fabric of Rio’s underwear.</p><p>The angle was difficult and Rio’s skirt was tight so Agatha strained against it to where she desperately wanted to be.</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s eyes went dark and her tongue darted out to wet her lips as her middle finger stretched again and ghosted over the wet patch that had settled there earlier in the night. “Oh, Rio,” she murmured indulgently, pressing a little firmer to feel her more.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was picking up and she saw stars as Agatha leant in to husk against her ear once more, “I want you <em>so badly</em>.”</p><p>Rio reached then to grasp Agatha’s wrist, not pushing her away but not letting her move again. “Not here,” she said softly, her lower lip now slightly swollen from where her teeth had been clenched around them. Agatha nodded a little but pushed her luck by grazing her finger slowly across Rio once more, her eyes sparkling with something Rio knew to be smugness. “If you would just move to my lap again…”</p><p>But Rio laughed quietly and shook her head, now finding the strength to push Agatha away. “No. You’ve waited all evening, you can be a good girl and wait twenty more minutes.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows shot up at this and she smirked across at Rio, “Here I was thinking I’d be calling <em>you</em> a good girl later.” Rio grinned and leant in to kiss Agatha softly, sighing against her lips before she nipped at her lower one and caused Agatha to moan against her, “What if I don’t want to behave?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed at this and her hand returned to Rio’s thigh, only now resting on her, “Are you trying to kill me here?”</p><p>Rio laughed and all but melted against Agatha’s side as she placed a calming hand on her cheek, “Not until I’m done with you.” Agatha hummed and her eyes crinkled into a bright smile as she turned her head to kiss Rio’s palm, nuzzling a little into it.</p><p>They sat in silence for the rest of the journey, Agatha toying gently with Rio’s fingers and Rio toying with the ends of long wavy hair, occasionally exchanging soft kisses that Rio had to keep pulling back from as each and every time Agatha tried for more.</p><p>By the time they arrived at the house, Rio’s heart was thumping heavily in her chest and she stepped slowly from the uber, trying to prolong the evening. As the car drove away and Agatha realised that she was standing alone halfway up the path, she turned around to see Rio staring at her, her arms wrapped tightly around her own body. “What’s wrong?” Agatha took a step back towards Rio and held out her hand, her eyes scanning over her as if to check she hadn’t been somehow hurt in the time it took them to exit the vehicle.</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, watching the steam from the cool night rise from her lips, “Nothing. Just… savouring.”</p><p>Agatha squinted slightly across at her, unsure how to take her words but she kept her hand out until Rio took it and let herself be pulled to the door. After fumbling with the keys, Agatha soon pushed the door open and once Rio was over the threshold her breath was taken from her lungs. Agatha had wasted no time in pushing her against the wall and pinning her hands above her head.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio husked out, gasping at the woman as she tested the hold on her wrists.</p><p>“This skirt,” Agatha said slowly, ignoring Rio as she moved against her and instead reaching her free hand down to begin tugging her skirt up roughly, “It’s too tight. It’s been distracting me all night and then…” her gasp matched Rio’s as she finally was able to get to where she’d wanted to be in the uber. Her hand cupped over the fabric of Rio’s panties and she moaned at the wetness she found there. If Rio had any coherent thoughts in her head she would be mortified about how soaked she was.</p><p>She whined softly as Agatha made light work of slipping her fingers under the edge of her underwear and moaned as her hips stirred when her long fingers began to swirl over Rio’s soaked entrance. “A-Agatha. Rules. We need to…”</p><p>But Agatha’s face was pressed to her neck now, and she dragged her hand down to hold Rio’s head still as she kissed her way to Rio’s lips, “Can I?” She asked quietly, the pads of three of her fingers, pressing swirling lightly against Rio’s entrance. Rio groaned and felt her hips betray her as they bucked against Agatha’s hand and she couldn’t help it as she nodded, staring into dark blue pools. “Y-yes.”</p><p>Her gasp was loud as Agatha shifted and pushed three fingers inside of Rio, their moans swallowed by each other’s mouths as Rio began to whine softly, bucking up off the wall. “Fuck, Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha smirked against Rio’s cheek as she began to move slowly inside of her, pushing in until Rio clenched around her then pulling out again to begin a slow, steady pace as she built Rio up. Rio’s breathing was laboured and her hands clutched at Agatha, one leg coming up to hook over her waist and pull her closer. “Fuck, fuck, fuck…”</p><p>But Agatha needed more. She needed to taste Rio. She pulled out slowly, revelling in the noises Rio made as she did so and trailed a line of kisses down her hot skin until she fell directly to her knees. “Agatha, let’s go upstairs,” Rio managed to choke out, her hand in her own hair and her other resting on Agatha’s shoulder. “We have to… the discuss… rules.”</p><p>But Agatha simply blinked up at Rio and reached to take both sides of Rio’s skirt, ripping it from the slit. “Agatha!” Rio bellowed in shock, not believing that she’d now had two perfectly good, expensive dresses ripped by this woman.</p><p>“I’ll buy you a new one,” Agatha husked as she threw the fabric to the side and began pressing delicate kisses to Rio’s inner thighs.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha. I can’t think when you…” But she looked down just as Agatha licked a thick strip over her panties, applying pressure so Rio could feel it just enough to drive her to the edge of sanity.</p><p>But Rio grit her teeth and groaned as she reached down, sliding her hand between Agatha and her cunt. She reached to hold Agatha’s chin and brushed her thumb across her lips as she released a shaky breath. “I need to think, o-okay?”</p><p>Agatha clearly didn’t agree with this as she parted her lips and sucked Rio’s thumb into her mouth, letting her tongue swirl around it as she gazed up at Rio. The woman had never looked prettier or more dangerous and Rio sucked in a slow breath before she pulled her hand away. Just as Agatha smirked and was about to lean back in Rio quickly opened her legs fully and squatted down, holding steadily onto Agatha’s shoulders, “Agatha. As much as I’d like you to fuck me in every room of this house…” Agatha’s eyes flashed then and she moved closer, pulling Rio into her lap as she sat back against her heels. “We have to discuss it first, remember?”</p><p>Agatha sighed quietly and nuzzled down behind Rio’s ear, her hands moving to hold her hips tightly, “What do you want?” Rio bit down on her lip and prepared herself for the reaction that she knew would come from her next words, “No marking. Anything else but… no visible marks.”</p><p>Agatha breathed out slowly and deliberately against Rio, but was no longer pressing into her and soon pulled back entirely, her eyes flicking steadily up to meet soft brown eyes. “Okay.” Agatha bit the corner of her lip then, lost in thought as she stared at Rio’s lips.</p><p>Rio smiled slightly, and moved to lift Agatha’s gaze to meet her own again, “Okay, your turn. How do you want me?” She ghosted her lips across Agatha’s then, trying to bring her from her thoughts.</p><p>“I want everything,” Agatha murmured, her gaze finally meeting Rio’s properly again, her hands squeezing Rio’s hips. Rio nodded slowly, and her fingers moved up to trail slowly across Agatha’s cheek and down to her lips, watching them part for her, “Okay.”</p><p>Rio replaced her fingers with her lips and kissed Agatha slowly, trying to pull her back to wherever she’d fallen to in her mind. But as Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed and her grip on Rio tightened, she took control of the kiss, turning it into something desperate.</p><p>Agatha sucked at Rio’s lower lip and released it with a soft <em>pop</em> she tilted Rio backwards and held her as her head and shoulders came into contact with the wall. She was more exposed to her his way, and Agatha wasted no time in slipping her hand back between Rio’s thighs, her panties now aggressively pushed to the side and her fingers ghosting over Rio’s clit.</p><p>“Agatha, fuck… god that…” but Rio’s babbling became incoherent then as Agatha pinched her clit and she screamed out, her body twitching in Agatha’s hold. Recovering as Agatha returned to her gentle ministrations and panting uselessly she looked up at Agatha and saw a delighted smirk on her face.</p><p>“Just… just proving you can?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Agatha whispered as she moved in to kiss a soft and wet trail along Rio’s jaw. Rio’s fingers found purchase in Agatha’s hair just as Agatha entered her for the second time that night, pushing slowly into her again win three fingers as her thumb drew lazy circles over her clit.</p><p>“God,” she whined, shifting slightly in Agatha’s hold, “Fuck me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to be old. She pulled back from Rio then, her free hand at the centre of her back to give her support as she pumped in and out of her as fast as she could. Rio’s eyes never left Agatha’s as the woman over her fucked her to conclusion and she came with a shout, her body practically vibrating from the attention.</p><p>As Agatha slowed her movements down, she looked between them to watch herself pull out of Rio and twitched each finger to run gently back up to her clit, circling it softly as she watched Rio’s thighs quake with every movement.</p><p>“You’ve made a mess,” she murmured quietly, her gaze still focusing on Rio’s cunt, and she moved down to press a soft kiss at Rio’s collarbone as Rio found her voice again, “I’m not sure that was… entirely my fault.”</p><p>Agatha laughed against her and pulled up to meet her gaze again. “So… everything?” But Rio just smiled blearily and used her core strength to push herself up again, pushing Agatha back as she did. “But this time. This time I want to make you come too. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and her gaze dropped back to the mess of her skirt between them, seeming to think on it before she said, “I want to focus on you though.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed then and she reached to cradle Agatha’s face, brushing her thumbs over high cheekbones as she did, “Agatha… I want you to enjoy this too. Let me…” she sighed softly when she saw Agatha’s gaze purposefully slip away, “Hey, we can stay up all night if you want. We have time.”</p><p>But as Agatha looked back up at her again she realised that’s what it was. Time. By focusing on Rio. By worshipping her in, Rio was soon realising, only the way <em>Agatha</em> knew how, she was praying for time.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Only gazed over at Rio, her grip firm. So Rio pulled back, standing slowly and on shaking legs. She reached down to pull Agatha up and was immediately met with arms around her again, softly pressed against the wall. She gasped and frowned again as she caught Agatha’s hesitating expression, torn between kissing her and running.</p><p>“Bedroom?” Rio asked cautiously, her fingers twitching slowly against wild hair. But Agatha was a step ahead of her as she bent down and knocked Rio’s knees out from under her, throwing her legs around her waist. Rio gasped at the motion and the sudden feel of herself against Agatha again and huffed out a breath of faux-annoyance. “I can walk.”</p><p>But Agatha ignored her and kicked off her heels before looking up at Rio, “Not for long, honey.” Rio narrowed her eyes down at Agatha and poked her cheek as they began to move, “We have a long day tomorrow. Do you really want me whining all the way home?” Agatha’s gaze dropped then and Rio suddenly felt stonewalled as her jaw flexed and she continued to carry her up the stairs - no mean feat. Rio was light but three flights in an old Victorian house? If she hadn’t been so concerned for the mask Agatha had donned again she’d have been putty in her hands.</p><p>But as they got to the attic bedroom with Agatha barely out of breath, Rio felt the walls close in on them. Agatha kicked the door shut and practically threw Rio onto the bed, dropping her down without much warning. “Your safeword is ‘willow’?” Rio blinked up at Agatha, trying to understand just why she had shut her out again, why she was… but she nodded and reached around herself to undo her bralet.</p><p>“What’s yours?”</p><p>“I don’t have one.”</p><p>“You need one.”</p><p>“No, no tonight. Nothing happening will…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>. If you want you can use mine, but if you’re telling me I might need to safeword then not…”</p><p>But Agatha had thrown up her hands and said, “Fine, fine. I’ll use that.” They stared at each other then, both unwilling to give in. Rio relented only slightly by shuffling to the edge of the bed and holding out her hands, “Here, let me help you take that off.”</p><p>Agatha complied with a soft huff and moved to stand between Rio’s legs, turning her side to her so she could access the zip and Agatha could slip the dress off from her pale, toned body. Rio’s mouth went dry and she reached to trace down Agatha’s sides, skimming lightly over her hip and across her stomach, her fingers dipping into the hem of Agatha’s red underwear. “Let me?” She asked cautiously, aware how this very move had gone last time.</p><p>But Agatha turned to her completely and nodded, pushing Rio back and shuffling her up the bed so she could crawl up her body, leaning down over her. Rio smiled in triumph as she nestled back and reached again, pushing her hand slowly into Agatha’s panties and moaning at the wetness she found here. If Rio had been soaked, then Agatha was practically dripping as Rio began her soft explorations. She had no idea how Agatha had held out this long. Agatha’s mouth fell open and she groaned as her hips bucked, her gaze never leaving Rio’s as the younger woman pressed two fingers slowly into her and began to scissor in and out, stretching Agatha slowly, enjoying the slight twitches and groans she could elicit.</p><p>Rio twisted her hand then and, panting slightly as Agatha buried herself against her neck, she pushed a third finger into her, finding no resistance. As her thumb found that tiny bundle of nerves she released her own groan as Agatha clenched around her, her hips bucking, desperate for more of Rio. Their naked chests were pressed together and Rio could feel herself aching for Agatha’s touch as she wrapped her legs tightly around her hips. This limited her movements but she kept herself buried within Agatha, and it didn’t take long for the woman to come, her head thrown back in ecstasy and her back arching impossibly, pressing Rio further into the mattress.</p><p>Rio didn’t move then. She was panting alongside Agatha and bringing her down gently from her high, drawing soothing circles on her back as she did. “Don’t…” Agatha started, and Rio halted all movements, both hands going still. Agatha’s gaze dropped down to Rio then and she continued to breath heavily, her hips rocking ever so slightly, rolling over Rio’s fingers. “Just let me…” but her words died as she leant in suddenly, her elbows now by Rio’s head as she crashed their lips together. The kiss was slow at first, Agatha’s tongue pushing into Rio’s mouth, and her moan sending vibrations through Rio’s whole body. Rio’s fingers twitched slightly within Agatha and she strained to keep her hand still, allowing Agatha to take charge. Strong fingers moved to hold Rio’s jaw as the kiss deepened and they moaned into it, Agatha’s hips stirring every so often as she devoured the woman below her.</p><p>It was only when they separated to catch their breath that Agatha, grunting, pulled away from Rio’s now cramping fingers. Rio smiled lazily up at Agatha, deciding secretly that this was how she preferred her; hair wild, eyes drunk with desire, and pink, flushed cheeks.</p><p>“You are insanely hot, do you know that?” Rio moved to kiss Agatha again, subtly wiping the evidence of her desire against her own hip.</p><p>Agatha just smirked a little and moved down Rio’s body, painting it again with soft kisses, trailing her tongue between her breasts. The shiver that ran through Rio’s body was only partly physical, and she felt the agony of want flow through her as she watched Agatha lavish her skin with attention, always being careful not to press too hard or suck to keenly. Though Rio desperately wished she would.</p><p>She began to writhe as Agatha’s lips found the mound of her breast and her hands clutched at dark hair as she willed Agatha to move faster, do something. But Agatha stopped just as her lips ghosted over Rio’s nipple and she raised her eyes to look up at the mess of the woman beneath her, “Will you ride me?”</p><p>The words caused warm breath to tickle Rio’s nipple and she almost choked on her response as she gazed down at the woman now, with one hand, slowly tugging her panties down her legs, “What?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth and licked a thick strip over Rio’s nipple, making her moan softly and lift her hips. “A-Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and moved back up to gaze down at Rio with a soft smile, “I want you to ride me,” she said, a little firmer his time as her hand found Rio’s cunt again and she pushed two fingers inside of her, meeting no resistance this time. Rio moaned and nodded, her hands moving to dig her nails into Agatha’s waist as she began to rock her hips as best she could from where Agatha was pressing her into the bed.</p><p>“No, baby. Not like that.”</p><p>Agatha moved to nip at Rio’s ear lobe before pulling away completely and slipping off the bed. Rio whined and sat up, watching hopelessly as Agatha moved to rip her own underwear off. “You’re going to kill me,” she muttered petulantly as Agatha moved away to find what she was looking for. “You know I could barely walk the next day. Alice could not stop laughing and I’m pretty sure Jen thought I was faking it to give you kudos or something.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed quietly, not turning back to Rio until the harness was in place and she had the grinding pad positioned just right. She moved slowly back to the bed and held the base of the strap proudly, her eyes glinting as she looked down at Rio, who had also dropped her gaze and was chewing on her lip. Agatha didn’t have to say anything. Rio knew what she wanted. So she crawled over to her, wet her lips, and placed a slow, deliberate kiss to the tip of Agatha’s cock. Agatha’s free hand moved to brush some hair from Rio’s face as she watched her take the silicone toy as deep as she could, already choking around the thick length.</p><p>Rio settled her hands onto Agatha’s ass and squeezed as she pulled back up, gasping for air as she gazed up at the brunette. “Is this for me or because you enjoy the show?”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly and tucked a loose strand of hair behind Rio’s ear, “Baby, all for you.” Rio hummed and turned her attention back down again but was met with Agatha’s hand moving to rest around her throat, squeezing her at the sides lightly. Wide brown eyes snapped back up and she clenched her thighs together as Agatha leant down to be on a level with Rio, her other hand still gently resting in her hair, “Now, will you be a good girl and fuck yourself on my cock?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth dropped open and she nodded silently, her gaze darting between Agatha’s blown pupils. She allowed Agatha to move away from her then, going to settle at the top of the bed, casually placing some pillows up against the headboard to lean back against before offering a hand out to Rio.</p><p>Rio moved slowly over to her, crawling up her body and swallowing thickly as she knelt up with her knees either side of Agatha’s thighs. Agatha pulled her in for a soft kiss then, taking her tongue and running it slowly around Rio’s lips, tasting her. Rio shuddered and moved her hands to Agatha’s neck, holding her gently. “I’ll help you,” Agatha promised in a soft whisper as Rio pulled back and moved to hover over the strap, her thighs clenched and her jaw flexing as she gazed down at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha moved one hand to Rio’s hip to steady her and her dominant left hand to grasp the middle of the length, guiding Rio down so she could run the tip through her folds and watching as Rio groaned, her chest speckled again with the flush of heat as the strap moved to rub against Rio’s clit.</p><p>Agatha bit down on her lip as she pushed the strap towards Rio’s entrance and she held Rio steadily over it, not moving until she did. Rio swallowed and breathed out slowly as she pushed herself down, reaching to replace Agatha’s hand on the strap, and feeling the delicious stretch as she took just half the length inside of her with a load moan.</p><p>Agatha’s hands now settled firmly on Rio’s waist, half holding her up, half holding her steady. “You look so fucking good like this…”</p><p>Rio barely registered Agatha’s words as her tongue pressed into her cheek and she slowly pushed down to bottom out around Agatha, her hips twitching erratically as she adjusted to the intrusion. Agatha moaned as the movement caused the strap to press against her own clit and she marvelled at the sight of herself buried deep with Rio. One hand moved around to press against her lower abdomen and the feel of herself there made Agatha almost come on the spot.</p><p>But she managed to hold herself back, managed to be patient as Rio took her time in lifting off slightly, beginning to slowly fuck herself against Agatha. Now dark blue eyes kept a close watch on Rio’s face as she moved against her, her pace picking up slightly as she got used to the stretch and uselessly, desperately wanted more. As Rio began to move faster on top of her Agatha rewarded her with her thumb against her clit, brushing against it was every slap against the pad, in awe every time Rio bottomed out.</p><p>Rio’s moans grew louder until she was almost shouting Agatha’s name and a constant trickle of “Fuck, fuck, fuck me,” spilled from her lips. But Agatha was feeling wild beneath her as she struggled to hold off her own orgasm and she kept her hold firm on Rio, her one arm shaking at the effort to keep her steady when she wanted to press more, push deeper.</p><p>But just as Rio clenched around the length Agatha felt her own orgasm rip through her as Rio fell heavily against her, her hips bucking uncontrollably as she moaned. Rio gasped at the sudden push of Agatha who had mercifully held still as she’d moved herself up and down and without thinking she sunk her teeth into Agatha’s neck and groaned against her, tasting her salty skin with a hunger she couldn’t satiate.</p><p>Agatha responded immediately, her hips bucking now consciously as she pressed deeper into Rio and moved them to throw Rio onto her back. With no friction anymore, she slipped out of the younger woman slightly and groaned down at the sight of her soaked cunt. Agatha’s own thighs glistened with a mixture of their juices and she rocked steadily into Rio, watching in awe at how well she was taken.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, Agatha,” Rio begged softly, her hands reaching to grasp at Agatha’s arms, “It’s too much… I’m…” but she didn’t finish her sentence as she released a moan whine as Agatha slowly pulled out of her, letting the strap spill out onto the bed and watching as Rio’s hole gaped and her hips bucked at the sudden loss of her cock.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha whispered softly, now frantic, desperate to remove the harness from around her body. Rio was was still shaking slightly, her thighs clenching and unclenching from where Agatha knelt between them. Her gaze was bleary, her mind still focused entirely on Agatha as she watched the woman struggle out of the harness. If Rio weren’t so fuck-drunk she might have laughed at the sight. But there was nothing funny about the sight of Agatha, desperate, and practically growling as she finally managed to free herself.</p><p>She settled down between Rio’s thighs and wasted no time in pressing two fingers inside of her, curling them against her sensitive walls and attached her lips to Rio’s throbbing clit. The whine that escaped Rio then was unholy and she writhed desperately beneath Agatha, as sensitive as she was. But Agatha only pushed on as clutching fingers dug into her scalp and she lavished attention to Rio’s clit, eating her out hungrily and continuing to stroke the tight walls she’d just done her best to stretch out.</p><p>Rio was so sensitive that she came fast and hard, her moans lost on her strained voice as as came. Only after Rio’s hips stilled did Agatha pull her mouth away and her fingers gently out. She kissed a soft trailed up to Rio’s breasts and then rested her head there as Rio whimpered beneath her, her mind blank.</p><p>They lay like that for a few minutes, Agatha drawing soft circles over Rio’s hip bone and occasionally turning her head to press soft kisses across Rio’s hot skin. Rio’s eyes were closed as she scratched lightly at Agatha’s scalp and she thought of nothing but staying here, like this, forever.</p><p>But as Rio’s breathing started to even out and sleep began to seize her, Agatha lifted her head slightly to gaze down at her, “Do you want me to run you a bath?” Rio groaned softly, momentarily annoyed that she’d been nudged from sleep and blinked at Agatha wearily, “No. Stay here. Just like this.”</p><p>Agatha moved then, shuffling up slightly to wrap herself more securely around Rio’s limp body, pulling her into her side and moving Rio’s upper leg to drape across her. Rio allowed this. Revelling in the soft care of Agatha’s now gentle touches as she drifted off into a deep sleep.</p><p>The alarm went off not three hours later and sent a jolt through Rio’s entire body. She gasped as if someone had thrown cold water all over her and then groaned as she felt the dull, familiar ache between her thighs.</p><p>Agatha had done it again. Jealously claimed her. Making sure she’d feel her today.</p><p>As the jealous woman in question groaned beside her and rolled away, grumbling as she realised she had been laying with her head at the wrong end of the bed so she actually had to get up to turn her phone off, Rio blinked cautiously across at her, taking the opportunity to take her form in one last time.</p><p>“Hey,” she whispered hoarsely, her legs stretching experimentally under the blanket Agatha must have wrapped them in last night.</p><p>“How’re you feeling?”</p><p>Agatha turned around then and gazed down at Rio for a long second before she asked, “Do you need help showering? We have about an hour before the cab arrives.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, recognising that she’d been dismissed and shook her head as she sat up, feeling every inch of movement in her body as she did so. “I’ll be fine.” But Agatha had stepped forwards already and took Rio’s hand as she went to stand.</p><p>“You don’t need to be brave about it,” she teased softly, her eyes now softening as she took Rio in. Their proximity now gave Rio a chance to truly scan over Agatha’s face, surveying the slight furrow in her brow and the look of genuine concern she held there. But as her hand reached to touch Agatha’s cheek her gaze fell to an angry red mark on the woman’s neck. “Oh.” She touched it gently and bit down on her own lip, “I’m not sure I even remember doing that.”</p><p>Agatha quirked a brow at this but moved to support Rio to the shower and stepped in before her to turn it on. Rio swayed a little, perhaps from the jellied feeling in her legs or perhaps from the acknowledgement that this was the last hour she’d be spending with Agatha.</p><p>But Agatha kept quiet and said nothing, her mind elsewhere as she pulled Rio to her. They kept their bodies close but neither made a move to push anything further, their hands remaining in respectable places: their hair, backs, hips. Agatha, this time, let Rio clean herself and only held her steadily as she did so, watching the slight wince as gentle fingers wiped over her sensitive centre.</p><p>When Agatha was sure Rio could stand and dry herself they separated, each packing their own bags in a tense silence that seemed to permeate into Rio’s bones. But she dressed into comfortable jeans and a navy blue hoodie, tying her hair back into a loose bun, still damp from the shower.</p><p>Agatha settled on a brown sweater and dark jeans, more elegant than Rio’s look but just as comfortable. It was Agatha this time around who carried the cases down the stairs, leaving no room for argument as she did so. Rio followed her down slowly, cursing herself for getting into this position again but trying to focus on soon being comfortably sat in their little booths on the plane together. She was just thinking about how she could possibly convince a flight attendant to let her curl up with Agatha in her booth when Agatha’s voice cut through her thoughts.</p><p>“Ride’s here. Let’s go.”</p><p>The journey to the airport was quick, silent, but mostly because Rio fell asleep after five minutes.</p><p>When they arrived she was woken by a gentle nudge from Agatha as she’d opened her car door for her and Rio reluctantly peeled herself out of the car and stretched her body before they made their way to the bag drop kiosk.</p><p>Agatha went ahead of Rio and was still talking to the attendant by the time Rio had finished her turn. They seemed to be in an intense discussion and Rio could have sworn that Agatha had handed the woman something that looked suspiciously <em>not</em> like a passport and suspiciously <em>exactly</em> like a wad of cash. But she told herself she was being crazy. It must have been the lack of sleep.</p><p>Five minutes later they were making their way through security and moving to an airport lounge where they found seats by the window and Rio pulled her hoodie drawstrings slightly to tighten the fabric around her and settle down in the chair. It was Agatha who spoke first, having not said much of anything all morning, “What will you do after you arrive?”</p><p>Rio glanced over at her with a curious head tilt and smiled, “Go home and sleep.”</p><p>“I think we both need to do that.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly and shifted to pull one of her legs beneath her opposite thigh, as Agatha continued her line of questions, “Where do you live?”</p><p>“Washington Heights, a little below it.”</p><p>The question had taken Rio by surprise, clients usually didn’t care where she lived, and they’d certainly never been allowed to make house calls. But she knew if Agatha asked, she wouldn’t deny her.</p><p>But Agatha’s brow quirked slightly, clearly surprised by the answer. “I like the vibe,” Rio clarified, “It’s noisy and busy and everyone leaves me alone. No nosey neighbours.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, clearly absorbing this information. It was as she opened her mouth to ask another question that her phone lit up on the table between them, aggressively vibrating as the word “BITCH” appeared across it. Though Agatha snatched it away quickly Rio had caught the name and had already guessed who it might be.</p><p>Agatha declined the call and instead sent off a message to the contact, her face now masked over with something Rio interpreted as panic.</p><p>“Was that Wanda?”</p><p>Blue eyes snapped up suddenly and Agatha took a slow breath before stating, “What gave it away?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said firmly, leaning forwards in her chair, “We should really talk about what happened whilst you were away. I want to know what you did… because I know you did something.”</p><p>“It’s nothing,” Agatha countered quickly, now avoiding Rio’s gaze as she returned back to her phone to what Rio guessed was a response from Wanda.</p><p>“It’s <em>something</em>. And it has to do with me so if you’ve done something to protect me or…”</p><p>But she trailed off as Agatha looked back up at her, her jaw flexing as she weighed up her next words carefully. “She’s my ex. She’s my burden. Not yours. I sorted it and that’s all you need to know.” Rio nodded then, shifting back in her chair and folding her arms across herself. She was tired. Bone tired. And even if she did have the energy, she wasn’t sure she’d get anywhere with an equally exhausted and clearly stressed Agatha. So she kept her mouth shut and as the steady noises of the lounge rang out around her she drifted back to sleep.</p><p>She woke about an hour later to a gentle hand against her side and one cradling her cheek. “Hey, they’re boarding.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, now getting used to waking up to an aching body, and slowly stood to follow Agatha to the gate. To her surprise Agatha had entwined their fingers together somewhere between leaving the lounge and arriving at the gate and she pulled her down beside her on one of the godawful, hard airport chairs.</p><p>“Think they’ll let me sit with you?” Rio asked softly, turning to whisper to Agatha. She squeezed her hand as she caught the stoic expression on the other woman’s face and quietly added, “assuming you’d want that.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent but returned the squeeze and turned her head to place the ghost of a kiss to Rio’s cheek. It was enough. For now. Rio breathed out heavily and rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder, brushing her thumb slowly over the back of her hand.</p><p>She must have drifted again because the next thing she knew Agatha was nudging her gently and attempting to pull her to her feet. “Rio, honey, you need to go. They’re calling you.”</p><p>Sure enough, as Rio blinked into the harsh lights of the airport she heard over the tannoy:</p><p>
<em>”This is a last call for passenger Rio Vidal. Rio Vidal for flight number AA175 to JFK.”</em>
</p><p>Rio frowned in confusion as she stared at Agatha, “Just me? Why haven’t they called… o-oh.”</p><p>The realisation hit her like a tonne of bricks and if Agatha hadn’t been holding her by her waist she’d have stumbled back into her seat. “You’re not coming.”</p><p>Agatha looked pained then, her mouth opening slightly and then closing again before she shook her head. “No… my flight’s a lot later.”</p><p>“The cash… you <em>did</em> pay them to take your bag early. I thought I saw…” But she trailed off as the deceit of the thing settled squarely in her chest and she felt her eyes well with unshed tears. “Why didn’t you…?”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head again as another call for Rio Vidal rang out around them.</p><p>“You have to go. You’ll miss it.”</p><p>Agatha hurried her over to the desk now, her hold on Rio still gentle but hurried as she pushed her forwards.</p><p>Rio felt numb, as she fished her passport and boarding pass out and handed it over to the woman. Agatha lingered by her shoulder and as the woman confirmed Rio was okay to fly she felt soft lips press to her cheek and a gentle squeeze at her waist and then Agatha was gone.</p>

<p>By the time Rio had stepped onto the plane, she’d started uncontrollably crying. Not, unfortunately for her, a subtle, delicate cry, but instead a puffy-eyed, wracked sobs kind of crying. Neither her fellow passengers nor the flight staff knew quite what to do.</p><p>But she found her way through to her seat and by the time they were cruising she must have run out of tears because no more came. For six long hours she sat, staring ahead of herself and stewing in her sadness.</p><p>She felt used, rejected, and alone.</p><p>Agatha had played her the whole time, fully aware that she wouldn’t be flying back with Rio. And then not to even say a proper goodbye? Crushed was putting it lightly.</p><p>By the time they’d landed, and Rio had barely moved the whole flight, she was furious.</p><p>Going through the motions of passport control, customs, and bag pickup, and all the while thinking over every conversation, every touch, Rio almost missed the large sign held out by a smartly dressed man at arrivals.</p><p>‘RIO VIDAL’</p><p>Rio blinked stupidly at her own name, tugging at the sleeves of her hoodie as she approached him cautiously and impolitely asked, “Who sent you?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, ma’am. I’m to take you home.”</p><p>The scoff that fell from Rio’s lips was louder than she intended it to be and the man with the sign frowned slightly as he watched her. “No thank you. Please tell her I’ll make my own way.”</p><p>She paused as she went to turn around and glanced back at him with a softer gaze, “Tell her she makes sure to tip you well for your wasted journey.”</p><p>As Rio moved along the line the man followed too, nudging and squeezing past other people waiting for the newly arrived visitors to JFK. “Ma’am? Ma’am? She really did insist I take you home.” Rio just ignored him, wheeling her bag through the crowds and out towards the taxi rank.</p><p>She heard him still calling her from the entrance to the concourse but ignored him as she approached a waiting yellow cab, gave her address, and got in.</p><p>By the time she got home Rio was aching all over. But she couldn’t bring herself to think about why that might be. So she dumped her bag, fed her starving plants, and crawled into bed.</p><p>When she woke up the next morning she saw several unread messages from friends, multiple emails from clients or potential ones, and one deposit to her bank account of $50,000.</p><p><em>Guilt money</em>, she thought bitterly.</p><p>Having recovered somewhat from her trip and now nestled into her favourite seat by the window with a mug of coffee and a greasy bodega bagel, she had a clearer mind enough to think properly about what had happened and where it had gone all wrong.</p><p>Well, she knew the first step to wrong had been going in the first place. The second step had been her initial inability to get Agatha to talk to her, to tell her her boundaries, the rules she had. And the third step had been to fall for the woman.</p><p>But she was gone now, flown off to who knows where on whatever flight she’d actually booked. And Rio was left to pick up the pieces of herself.</p><p>She didn’t have long to recover though, two days, to prepare for her next client in her usual ways. Abigail was very exacting about how she wanted Rio to dress, how she wanted a Rio to be. Rio had a list in her mind, a way to check off everything the woman wanted, in exactly the way she wanted them:</p><p>- No dark colours, lighter is better. “You’re not a vampire, Rio.”<br/>
- Nude nail varnish, trimmed nails. “You’re not some slut on a street corner. You’re better than that.”<br/>
- No trainers, or flats. “It’s inelegant.”<br/>
- No cardigans, sweatshirts, or printed t-shirts. “I want a woman, not a prepubescent boy.”<br/>
- Absolutely no body hair. “It’s dirty.”<br/>
- No phones. “I want your full attention. After all, I’m paying for it.”</p><p>Abigail’s requests were exhausting but her homes were incredible and Rio had to admit that she enjoyed living, if only for a few days every couple of months, the lifestyle of a billionaire’s girlfriend. Plus, usually Abigail left her alone when she wasn’t showing Rio off or alone in the bedroom with her. Abigail wasn’t exactly cruel, she’d never given Rio any reason to want to leave or to terminate her time with her, but Rio always found herself exhausted when they were done. And not exhausted in the way she had been after Agatha.</p><p>But she ran through the city, hitting her usual haunts, and splurging on the kind of clothes, accessories, and shoes she knew Abigail would like. By the time she was dressed and ready to make her way to the dinner reservation, she felt more ready for it. Focused on the job.</p><p>Where in her personal life on a warm evening in New York she might be wearing frayed denim shorts and an old t-shirt, hell, if she were meeting friends for drinks she might even be wearing a soft linen dress, nothing too fancy, nothing too showy. But she instead was wearing a white sleeveless mini dress with gold buttons down the front and small slits at her side. Her hair was blown out and she had matching gold accessories. She hated herself.</p><p>Still, it was her job. So, with her new Loewe hold-all, and a small gold clutch for the evening, she trudged down to the subway, heading downtown a few blocks to an agreed upon location (random on Rio’s part to keep her anonymity and address secret), and found a sleek black car waiting for her.</p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath and exhaled slowly as she walked along with a smile plastered across her face. Brian, the driver, had already climbed out to greet her and tipped his cap with a knowing smile, “Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“Brian, nice to see you.” Rio smiled more genuinely up at the man as he took her larger bag and opened the door for her.</p><p>“Sweetheart!”</p><p>Abigail’s bright voice and beaming smile greeted her as she settled in beside her and leant in to place a soft kiss to her cheek, “Abigail.”</p><p>“Oh I have missed you,” Abigail reached then to pull Rio closer and pressed her hand against her thigh in a way that felt familiar but unwelcome. “Darling, haven’t you done well,” she teased with a patronising smile as she looked Rio up and down, her light blue eyes making light work of scrutinising every inch of her outfit. “My, my… they’ll be sick with envy.”</p><p>Rio just smiled as she usually did, knowing Abigail wasn’t really looking for a conversation, let alone a stimulating one and allowed the woman to continue to paw lightly at her as she ran through the guests expected at the dinner.</p><p>Rio had tuned out after the first one, focusing on a small spider she’d seen crawling lazily across the window pain of the door opposite. But she kept up appearances, smiling and nodding in the right places and allowing Abigail to whisper promises for later in her ear, that mostly revolved around Rio naked and eating Abigail out for hours.</p><p>But still, she slotted back into her professional persona with ease and found solace in Abigail’s enjoyment of her.</p><p>By the time they’d arrived at the restaurant snug in the busy meatpacking district, Rio had shaken off her London trip and was very comfortably the enigmatic but beautiful girlfriend of Abigail Presley. She carried herself differently, moulding herself into the persona of ‘Rachel’, from family money, a volunteer at a soup kitchen, a woman with means and not much personality.</p><p>As they were ushered into the dimly lit restaurant and shown to their private dining area, Rio noted the cards dotted around the table and raised her brow as she spotted her own at the bottom, closest to the door. “I’m not with you?” Her gaze turned to Abigail who was leaning back against the chair beside hers, admiring the view of Rio now standing beside her, “No. I’m afraid I’ll be talking a lot of business at my end tonight so I thought I’d save you the earache and let you sit with James. He’s usually got a story or two to tell.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and let her finger lightly brush over the flower centre piece, as she felt Abigail move in to her body. The woman was taller than her by an inch or two and she bent her head to place a soft kiss to Rio’s shoulder, her hands sliding around her waist to pull her in closer, “I have you for the weekend, don’t I? Did you bring that swimsuit I like?” Rio hummed and smiled, turning it on as she turned in Abigail’s hold and rubbed up her arms lightly, “of course. I bought it in blue too.” Abigail hummed her approval and just as she was about to close the distance between them the first guest arrived and Rio was forgotten.</p><p>Rio was passed around from guest to guest, accepting rather European greetings of multiple cheek kisses, firm handshakes, and even one, unexpected squeeze on the ass. Thankfully Abigail missed the last one but Rio made a mental note to avoid the perpetrator for the rest of the evening. As cocktail hour continued, Rio found her mind glazing over. There was only so much small talk she could make about golf handicaps, San Tropez in June, or someone’s new Lamborghini. But they flocked to her, as they usually did, and Abigail rewarded her every so often with a smile or a raised brow.</p><p>It was only as they went to take their seats and the first course of what Rio was sure would be many, and mostly of things she either didn’t like or wouldn’t be able to name, was begun to be discussed that she noticed the seat next to her was empty.</p><p>This ‘James’, whoever he was, hadn’t turned up.</p><p>She glanced around the table as if to see if he were squatting down between anyone else for a quick last minute chat but saw no errant heads and so wondered whether or not she should move one seat up or leave off for a while incase this storied man arrived.</p><p>Her indecision didn’t last very long though as a sudden figure appeared in the door, her arms spread wide and a grin on her face, “No no, go ahead, start without me.”</p><p>Agatha <em>fucking</em> Harkness stood, brazenly, assuredly, unashamedly, just five feet from Rio.</p><p>And Rio could have flipped the table.</p><p>“Oh Agatha! Of course! James did say! It completely slipped my mind!”</p><p>Rio’s head was reeling as she whipped around to spot Abigail leave her spot at the head of the table and saunter over to kiss both of Agatha’s cheeks. If Rio had been at all focused in on this and not now staring at the place card that said ‘James Barnes’ and clearly not ‘Agatha Harkness’ she’d have noticed that Agatha’s smile turned to a grimace as the blonde woman kissed her.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m sure we have lots to discuss.”</p><p>Agatha smiled tightly and nodded and Rio turned reluctantly to look up at her. She was wearing a brown pant suit with a simple silk shirt underneath and on her neck, visible when she moved her head to survey the table of 13 men and Rio, was the sure sign of a fading hickey.</p><p>Rio’s fists clenched at her sides as she felt the rest of the table stand, each man now making their way to Agatha, to greet her, or introduce themselves. She remained seated until Abigail subtly kicked her ankle and shocked her into movement.</p><p>Time slowed down then. Everything around her seemed to blur as she stood and turned to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze had fallen to Rio for the first time since she’d entered the room and her lips parted just so as she took in this new version of her. Abigail’s version.</p><p>“Agatha, allow me to introduce you to my Rachel.”</p><p>The corner of Agatha’s lips twitched slightly as she stepped forwards and leant in to place a kiss to Rio’s cheek. But Rio was ahead of her, even in her daze. She held out her hand and met Agatha with a steely gaze that left no room for any other form of contact. “Pleasure.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch, didn’t let her feelings on the matter show as she took Rio’s hand, the only flicker of recognition coming in the form of a gentle squeeze before she released it. “Charmed.”</p><p>As Rio turned to take her seat again, having had it pulled out by the man who had previously groped her. She thanked him softly and then primly sat, tucking her ankles under her chair and her hands firmly in her lap.</p><p>Agatha refused the man’s help and sat gracefully in her own chair, sending a waft of her familiar perfume Rio’s way as she did.</p><p>The smell of it made Rio want to vomit.</p><p>Conversation picked up then across the table, everyone slipping back into their previous chats as Agatha turned her gaze to Rio and watched her carefully. “That’s a pretty dress,” she whispered softly, not exactly teasing but more testing her reaction.</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed slightly but she forced a tight smile and inclined her head in acknowledgement of the comment, refusing to make eye contact or to play whatever little game Agatha was looking to play.</p><p>Seemingly realising she had been cut off, Agatha turned her attention to the man her other side and Rio released a shaky breath, gathering herself before she similarly engaged the man across from her.</p><p>For two courses and half a glass of wine for Rio, two for Agatha, they remained like this, both ignoring the other, and when called to dip into the same conversation, refusing to look at each other.</p><p>It was just before the third course that Rio excused herself for the bathroom and disappeared off for a second to breathe. Just a second and she could get her head back in the game.</p><p>But she got ten. Ten seconds before the bathroom door was swinging open and Agatha Harkness was standing against it, watching Rio with a cautious expression.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“No,” Rio snapped from her place by the sink, rounding on Agatha and pointing an accusatory finger at her, “How dare you be here. How dare you do this to me. Do you know how stupid this is? How reckless? How disrespectful?” Her voice was picking up with each word and she knew that she needed to calm down for fear of exposure but she couldn’t help herself. She wanted to kill this woman.</p><p>“We were done when you left me at the airport, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha just stood there and took it, her hands splayed out on the bathroom door at her sides as if to ground her in something as she took in the mess she’d created of Rio Vidal.</p><p>“You <em>cannot</em> do this to me,” Rio finished in a much quieter voice but with so much edge to it that Agatha flinched a little.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath before she began to walk closer to Rio, and Rio took a step back, her hip nudging the sink again. “Please,” she whispered so softly that is it weren’t for her lips moving, Rio would have missed it. “I wanted to see you again. I just…”</p><p>But blue eyes searched Rio’s scowling face and looked on the verge of tears as she struggled to put into words what she wanted, “I had you because I was paying you. And then… and then I didn’t even have <em>that</em> anymore and I…”</p><p>“Enough,” Rio cut her off, more harshly than she meant to. Her gaze still stern as she watched Agatha, praying she wouldn’t step closer because her resolve might crumble.</p><p>“I told you,” she started and then paused to gather herself for a second, her voice dropping in volume again, “I told you I didn’t want payment that first morning after…” she sighed and closed her eyes, “I told you. I <em>have</em> told you. But you cut me off and I had no choice but to…” her eyes flashed open again and she was unable to hide the hurt in them this time. “Agatha, you shut me out at Jen’s bridal shop. And continued to blow hot and cold after that. So I introduced rules. I accepted payment. Not because I wanted to, but because I <em>had</em> to.”</p><p>She took in a shaky breath then and turned away from Agatha to check her makeup in the mirror. “You shouldn’t be here. I don’t want you here.”</p><p>But Agatha had moved closer and was touching Rio’s waist, turning her cautiously, slowly into her with a soft frown as a solitary tear fell from her eye. “Rio…” Rio instinctively reached to wipe it away with her thumb and she hesitated before she spoke again, barely above a whisper. “I’m working, you need to leave.” Agatha didn’t move, her mouth opening and closing, opening and closing, until finally, Rio pushed her away and slipped out of the bathroom without looking back.</p><p>Entering back into the little private room Rio slipped into her seat without any fuss and brushed down her dress, the picture of sophisticated grace. But her mind was elsewhere. Her mind was on the look of devastation she’d left on Agatha’s face, and of those hands that somehow always found their way back to her.</p><p>She didn’t have to wait too long to find out if Agatha had honoured her request. She hadn’t. And she took her seat again beside Rio without saying anything to her. Rio took the opportunity to catch a glimpse of her profile and saw her makeup spotless again, her jaw set.</p><p>More boring conversation and another half a glass of wine later and Rio’s attention was pulled back to Agatha again. But not because of the woman herself, but because of Abigail.</p><p>“Agatha! Agatha, what’s his I hear you forced Stark’s hand. And with your ex-wife, no less?”</p><p>The whole table was now staring at Agatha, and Rio was too.</p><p>“Oh, that’s putting it a bit dramatically, isn’t it?” Agatha threw her hand in the air and brushed the comment off.</p><p>“Well I heard,” Abigail drawled with a smirk, “That you practically begged him to take her on. As a favour to you, apparently.”</p><p>“I don’t beg.”</p><p>“Well however you did it you’ve managed to piss a hell of a lot of people off. And you’ve given her quite the payday. Tell me,” Abigail leant forward a little on the table as if this were a private conversation between the two of them, and not a very public one, “Do you get spousal support?”</p><p>She, and the men around them, erupted into laughter that was half drunken, half cruel.</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be able to see Agatha’s face to know what expression she’d have and she kept silent as she slowly reached below the table and placed the pads of her fingers ever so lightly against Agatha’s thigh. Agatha didn’t move, didn’t react to the touch, but she didn’t swipe it away either. Instead she waited for the noise to die down and coolly stated, “I’ve never had a penny from Wanda. And from what I’ve heard, this is the most recognition she’s had for her support of the bill. People aren’t cow towing to her, and I can hardly blame them.”</p><p>She reached then to lift her glass with her right hand and in one smooth motion her left came to rest across her lap and she made contact with Rio’s fingers there, stroking the tips of them gently and causing Rio’s stomach to flip.</p><p>Agatha’s comment shut Abigail up and the conversation soon moved on from Wanda and Stark. Agatha and Rio sat then, the only two not engaged in conversation, but the only two touching. It was Agatha who spoke first, turning slightly in her seat to gaze at Rio and breaking the contact of their fingers. “You didn’t accept the car,” she whispered softly, her brow furrowing ever so slightly as she attempted to read Rio’s features.</p><p>“I was angry.” Rio cleared her throat, her eyes darting around them to check they weren’t being overheard, but everyone was getting steadily drunker and voices were getting steadily louder, “And I didn’t want you to know where I lived.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and glanced down at where Rio’s fingers were in her own lap, “That was my original plan. To get your address, originally just to have it… just in case… but after you left… I got Jimmy to wait for you at the airport in the hopes you’d go with him and I could show up later with…”</p><p>“With what? Flowers and a teddy bear?”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly and chewed on her lower lip, “Something like that.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and ran a hand through her hair, “And then, when that didn’t work, this?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and dared to move her hand subtly, grazing the skin at the hem of Rio’s skirt. “Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio felt goosebumps raise on her leg at Agatha’s touch and she was quick to push her hand away, glancing back around the table. “Don’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed as she gazed over at Rio but she didn’t try again and instead said, and despite what she’d just announced about not begging she pleaded, “Can you leave tonight? Come home with me?”</p><p>Rio laughed despite herself and turned her gaze back to settle on Agatha’s, finally getting to the crux of the whole issue, “This is my job, Agatha. That isn’t going to change because you showed up here tonight. You should go home.”</p><p>There was a movement at the head of the table then and Abigail was standing up, striding to Rio’s side and laughing softly, “Now what are you two chatting about, hmm?” She nudged at Rio’s arm and motioned for her to move her chair back so she could drape herself across her lap. Rio’s gaze fell to Agatha as she did this and saw a murderous look in her eyes.</p><p>She cleared her throat softly as she loosely wrapped her arms around Abigail’s middle, unable to do anything else. Abigail’s arms were around her shoulder as she rounded back on Agatha again with a girlish grin, “Isn’t she divine, Agatha? We keep it casual, don’t we darling, but boy do I miss her when she’s away.”</p><p>She turned then to gaze down at Rio who returned her smile with a slightly subdued one of her own. Agatha just hummed quietly and turned to take a sip of her wine, her face still thunderous.</p><p>“Are you seeing anyone, Agatha? You’re so attractive I can’t imagine no one’s tried to pin you down again.”</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, her gaze flying to Rio’s for the briefest of seconds before she offered, “Many have tried but I’m just not the type.”</p><p>“Ah yes, Wanda did mention you were all work and no play.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze widened slightly at the mention of Wanda and she watched as Agatha’s jaw flexed and her body became even more rigid. Her fingers twitched where they held loosely to Abigail and she wished more than anything that she could reach out to reassure the woman in front of her, to tug her back to her little apartment and tuck her in her sheets, protecting her from the world.</p><p>“You know,” Agatha started, after a little too long a silence, “I think I should leave. I’ve had quite a bit of wine and… it’s getting late.” She moved to stand up and Abigail trilled and jumped up from Rio’s lap too, Rio following suit shortly after. “It’s not late enough,” cried Abigail in a cloying, irritating tone, grabbing Agatha’s hand and swinging it lightly, “Come now. If you won’t stay you must at least promise me that you’ll come to the house this weekend. I’ll send you over all the details but you are very welcome. In fact, I insist that you come. We’re throwing a huge garden party tomorrow evening and have rooms for a select few to stay. I’ll make sure you have one of those.”</p><p>She stepped in then, her voice lowering, but with Rio’s proximity, not to mention sobriety, she could still hear her loud and clear, “Besides, I’d like to talk some more about what you did for Wanda. You could be very useful to me.”</p><p>She stepped back then and Rio saw a look of pure hatred flicker briefly over Agatha’s face before she softened it again. Barely.</p><p>“I’ll check my schedule,” she promised, her teeth clenching as Abigail moved to press her lips to her cheek.</p><p>“Wonderful! Safe home now!”</p><p>Rio had never seen Agatha so angry. At least not this controlled and angry. But she couldn’t do anything, couldn’t say anything, as even when she stepped in to her, Abigail called her over.</p><p>“Rachel, sweetheart! Come back to me!”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily but took a second to step in to Agatha fully, her hand slipping below her blazer where she knew it couldn’t be seen by Abigail or anyone else, to rest against her silk-covered side. She pressed her lips firmly to her cheek and whispered, “Goodnight, Agatha,” letting her fingers linger on her side for much longer than necessary, before she stepped away and towards her client.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look back as she swept from the room.</p>

<p>It was another two hours before Rio left the restaurant with a clearly tipsy Abigail.</p><p>Rio had just about shaken away the anger she’d felt upon seeing Agatha, but she hadn’t been able to shake the pain.</p><p>The rest of the evening had been spent indulging Abigail’s drunk guests with her smiles, indulging Abigail with her touches, and now finally, indulging Abigail with her tongue. It was degrading, the way she’d requested the “little favour, sweetheart”, but Rio had complied like she always did, hoping if she got it over with early, Abigail would simply fall asleep and her services would no longer be required. These things were routine now for her alone time with Abigail. She knew they were coming, the game never changed, and Rio had already been paid more than enough and in advance to make up for it.</p><p>And so she got on her knees for her in the back of her car and ate her out just the way she liked, gently, with no hands.</p><p>After making Abigail come twice against her mouth, Rio pulled back and delicately wiped her lips against the back of her hand. She collapsed against the plush leather seats of Abigail’s Rolls and caught her breath. Abigail hummed happily and rested her head in Rio’s lap, falling asleep until they made it to her apartment building.</p><p>Abigail had a classic six on the upper east side that she used maybe three times a year, and Rio had stayed there at least ten times now, familiar with its overstated grandeur and crisp white furnishings. She woke Abigail gently and helped walk her up to the elevator where they were whisked off to the Abigail’s floor.</p><p>They didn’t speak much for the rest of the night, and Rio didn’t even have to kiss Abigail (because she didn’t like that sort of thing after Rio had gone down on her). But she did have to hold her until she drifted off. Which was much worse.</p><p>Rio lay there, dressed in another silk neglige, with Abigail curled around her, softly snoring against her ear. Her body felt odd against her, even more odd than it usually felt, but she tried not to focus on that as she closed her eyes and thought of the woman who had ruined her.</p><p>Blue eyes drifted into Rio’s imagination, deep pools of cerulean that had contained so much hurt, so much pain, and then so much anger. Rio’s chest ached at the thought of those eyes, and the woman who’d hunted her down twice now just to test her.</p><p>But the anger was still there bubbling under the surface and no matter how devastated Agatha had looked she couldn’t just forget how much she’d hurt her.</p><p>Forgetting came only in sleep, where she was miraculously saved from more thoughts of Agatha. She slept solidly until around 6am when she was woken by Abigail sitting back down on the bed and placing a coffee on the side for her.</p><p>“Morning, sleepy.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly but sat up, rubbing at the back of her neck as she did so. “Good morning.” Abigail grinned at her and moved her hand to Rio’s side, “Maybe we could have a repeat of last night on the way to the cape, hmm?”</p><p>Rio only smiled in response, silently calculating how many times Abigail could possibly come in the four or so hour drive. Too many for Rio to even fathom. And much more than she’d like.</p><p>“Get ready, okay? Wear something cute. I’ve checked your bag and I think the pink dress for today. You can maybe change into something else in the evening just to wow everybody but for now, the pink will do.”</p><p>With that, she disappeared from the room and left Rio alone to her coffee and more importantly: silence.</p><p>Soon enough, she shuffled from the bed and padded through to shower before she did as she was told and put on the pink dress she’d packed. She put her hair up in neat bun, did her makeup, and then grabbed her bags to place them by the door.</p><p>“Sweetheart! Finally! No more time wasting, let’s get going.”</p><p>Abigail was wearing a long white dress that made her look like a mix between a bride from one of those glossy magazines and an elf from Lord of the Rings. But Rio mentioned neither as she followed Abigail out to the car, greeted Brian happily and then slinked into the back seat with her.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, Abigail did request a “special favour”. The request came about two hours into the ride, after what sounded like a particularly stressful phone call with Abigail’s father. She hung up with an huff and tugged on Rio’s arm with a pout on her lips, “Make me feel better, sweetheart?” And so Rio slipped down to her knees and went through the motions. It took three orgasms for Abigail to gently pat Rio and grin down at her, a light sheen of sweat across her chest as she did so. “Always reliable.” For the rest of the trip she answered emails, talked loudly on the phone to business associates, and generally ignored Rio. Rio, for her part, stared out of the window and tried to forget what had just happened. But pleased she’d done her job well. No muss, no fuss. As the journey went on, her thoughts turned to Agatha and she daydreamed about what she should have said to her. Whether she should have slapped her or left with her. Whether she might show up today.</p><p>They arrived soon enough at the grand, beach front property and as Brian swung the car around the curved driveway Rio thanked her lucky stars that the house was so large and the grounds so sweeping it was inevitable that at some point she’d be able to hide away from Abigail and her simpering friends.</p><p>Preparations for the party were already in full swing as they stepped over the threshold and whilst Abigail brushed past the old housekeeper, Maria, without so much as a word, Rio gave her a warm hug and whispered a soft greeting in Spanish to her before hurrying after her client.</p><p>The house was covered, in what Rio considered to be, a hideous amount of balloons. There were so many that they spilled out onto the lawn and across the beautiful new swimming pool that Rio longed to dive into but knew she wouldn’t have a chance to whilst the party were ongoing. Elsewhere there were white and gold flowers dotted everywhere and for some reason a giant white ball floating in the middle of the pool.</p><p>What she’d thought was going to be a small gathering had somehow turned into a party of over 200 people soon descending on the property. The house had five large bedrooms and the surrounding property housed at least another 10 self-sufficient little cabins and chalets. Rio hadn’t even seen all of them, she was sure. It did mean though, that she wouldn’t get much peace tomorrow either if all these rooms were to fill up.</p><p>As staff and hired help moved around her she kept herself out of the way and went to sit down by the pool, sliding her sunglasses over her face as she watched the water ripple in the light wind. It could have been five minutes, it could have been five hours, Rio wasn’t sure, as lost in thought as she was. But her peace was disturbed by a shout from by the house, Abigail after her attention.</p><p>“Sweetheart! People are arriving, come here!”</p><p>Rio obliged and threw on her best smile as she did so, moving in and out of hugs and handshakes like she were some smarmy politician looking for votes.</p><p>As the house filled and the noise picked up, Rio soon found a glass of light pink liquid pressed to her hand by one of Abigail’s closest friends. “Darlin’, pink for pink,” she made herself titter at the little joke as she motioned to the drink and to Rio’s dress and Rio then got caught in painful small talk with the woman for what felt like an eternity.</p><p>But eternity had its plus points. From Rio’s position at the breakfast bar she could see the entrance to the kitchen. Which meant that she could see the guests filtering in looking for drinks. Which meant that as Agatha Harkness strode in like she owned the place, Rio got a full, delicious view.</p><p>Agatha had sauntered in, her hands tucked neatly into the pockets of her linen trousers with her thumbs hanging out, ever the coolest person in any room. She had matched the trousers with a light, thin cami, that sat just so to give only the slightest hint of a sculpted core and a full view of her toned, freckled arms.</p><p>Rio had to take a sip of her drink just to rectify her dry mouth.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were scanning the room, clearly looking for something, or someone. And it wasn’t until they landed on Rio that her whole demeanour changed, and the ghost of a smile even fell to her lips. But Rio didn’t return it. She’d already missed the last two things this woman was saying and had to zone back in quickly or she’d be caught. So she looked away from Agatha, focused back. And when she had the chance to look up again, Agatha was gone.</p><p>Rio’s pulse was racing as she tried desperately to forget it. Wondering if the punch she’d been handed was spiked and maybe she’d imagined Agatha. But she hadn’t. She’d turned up. Rio had asked her to leave and she’d shown up again and that infuriated Rio as much as it thrilled her.</p><p>Eventually, when other people joined the conversation, Rio was able to excuse herself and went off in search of Agatha, hoping to track her down quickly so she would leave just as quickly. But she couldn’t find her anywhere. Maybe she’d rocked up, seen Rio hadn’t fallen at her feet and left? Just as Rio was about to give up entirely and try to focus on not having such a terrible time she heard her name being shouted. Or, fake name.</p><p>“Rachel! Sweetheart!”</p><p>Rio turned around and saw at the edge of the lawn two figures standing together, one waving happily towards her and the other standing stock still at her side. Agatha.</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and slowly made her way over, which was a little tricky in the heels she was wearing for the occasion. “My darling,” Abigail crooned and moved in to place a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek, “You remember Agatha from last night I presume? We were just talking business.”</p><p>Rio dared to look up at Agatha then and felt her breath hitch at the intensity of her gaze as she held her hand out to her, “Lovely to see you again.”</p><p>Agatha took her hand, gave it a gentle squeeze and then dropped it as if it had burned her. Abigail seemed oblivious to the tension between the two as she turned back to Agatha, “Rachel’s somewhat of a good luck charm. That’s why I had her there last night. The men ogle her and go a bit soft so I can nail them on the details.” Her arm reached out to wrap around Rio’s waist then, “Of course, our little secret.“</p><p>Agatha’s whole body was tense, even as the breeze rushed between them and her long hair blew gently in the wind, and Rio was once again struck by how beautiful this damn woman was. But Agatha shifted slightly, making an effort to relax her pose, “I hope you didn’t bring her over here to have me ogle at her, Presley.”</p><p>“Oh no…” Abigail laughed loudly, “Wouldn’t <em>dream</em> of it. Everyone knows you’re a shark. You wouldn’t be soft enough to fall for a pretty smile and big brown eyes.”</p><p>Rio watched then as Agatha took a long drink and run a hand through her hair. “Perhaps we should go back to the party, then. I’m sure… <em>Rachel</em> doesn’t want to stand around and talk politics with us.”</p><p>Abigail shrugged and turned to Rio with the same wide smile, “Oh she usually does what she’s told.”</p><p>Rio groaned internally but could do nothing more than smile politely back at her client, her whole body cringing and her mind screaming at her not to look at Agatha, not to check for her reaction. But a second later she did. And she saw that same fury from last night flashing in her eyes.</p><p>“I usually like my girlfriend to have a mind of her own.”</p><p>“Not when they look like this, come on.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and dropped her gaze, moving a hand to Abigail’s stomach as she whispered in what she hoped was a placating way, “You flatter me too much.”</p><p>This seemed to rattle Agatha even more. And whether it was Rio’s touch, her tone, or her words, Rio couldn’t be sure. But Agatha began to walk away then, heading back to the party with a purposeful stride.</p><p>Abigail turned to watch her go and laughed after her, “Wanda did say she was a handful. But she’s good for business. One of the finest political minds of our generation. Blah, blah, blah. She could do wonders for me.” She trailed off, her mind on her own glory as she watched Agatha disappear into the crowd.</p><p>But Rio’s mind was also elsewhere: she felt a sick sense of shame flow through her at Agatha having seen what she put up with. How she allowed Abigail to treat her. Any other day, she wouldn’t have thought twice about it. It was harmless. A simple exchange. For a substantial amount of money, Rio would occasionally receive belittling comments. Fine. No harm done. But in front of Agatha it felt like an affront, an assault. One she couldn’t stand up to.</p><p>Rio gnawed on her lower lip until Abigail noticed and touched her cheek to get her attention, “None of that now.”</p><p>Her stomach churning at the gentle reprimand, she allowed herself to be steered away by Abigail, thrown into a conversation about properties with her vacuous friends, her mind back on the woman who had gatecrashed her weekend.</p><p>It wasn’t until hours later when the sun was beginning to set that Rio made contact with Agatha again. She’d been chatting quietly to the bartender at the bar set up in the outside kitchen, asking him with interest about his studies in pre-law when she felt a presence beside her and a hand move to brush her thigh as Agatha took her seat.</p><p>“Double vodka on the rocks.”</p><p>Rio glanced away from the barman with a smile of understanding before she turned to focus in on Agatha, who wasn’t looking at her.<br/>“Enjoying yourself?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed softly and ran a hand through her hair, toying with the ends idly as she turned to look at Rio fully now, “This is hell.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, feeling a smug sort of joy at the knowledge that Agatha was at least not enjoying herself either. “Well you don’t have to be here.”</p><p>“I do, actually,” Agatha replied coolly, turning away to accept the drink with barely a glance in the bartender’s direction. Rio scowled a little and turned away from Agatha to focus back in on Kyle, her scowl softening into a gentle grin, “So. Columbia. How’re you finding it?”</p><p>As Rio continued her conversation with the young man, Agatha’s gaze began to drift back towards her. Rio ignored this. Ignored the way Agatha’s eyes bored into her, the way she could feel her gaze as if Agatha were touching her skin.</p><p>It was after Agatha had finished her drink, that she finally spoke again, interrupting the flow of Rio’s conversation, “Can we talk?”</p><p>Rio blinked, having been halfway through an impassioned diatribe on the benefits of extracurriculars when she heard Agatha’s question. She caught Kyle’s eye and saw him look a little bewildered. But he was professional enough and polite enough to pretend her hadn’t heard and moved away to begin cleaning some glasses. “I was in the middle of a conversation,” Rio answered begrudgingly, turning to Agatha with a frown. Agatha looked neither embarrassed nor put off by this and simply rolled her shoulders back to draw herself up, “I need to talk to you.”</p><p>“There you are!” Abigail’s sparkling voice filtered into Rio’s conscious as she turned to see the woman striding towards her, pulling with her a man who looked like he wanted to be there even less than Rio. “Sweetheart, I wanted to introduce you to Colonel Rhodes, a dear friend of mine.”</p><p>Rio fixed her face into a bright smile to match Abigail’s and slid from her stool to greet the man, giving him a firm handshake and a polite kiss on the cheek. “It’s a pleasure, Colonel Rhodes.”</p><p>The man smiled politely, but kept his back ramrod straight and only just dropped his gaze to Rio’s legs before he met her eyes again, “Pleasure’s all mine, Rachel. I’ve heard a lot about you.” Rio felt more than heard Agatha shift behind her and soon was aware of her presence at her side, her arm just lightly grazing Rio’s as she offered James Rhodes a hand. “Rhodey,” she said shortly, her lips now in a tight smile.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rhodey countered, his gaze now sharp as he took her hand, “I wasn’t expecting you to be here. Not too busy sinking other people’s bills?”</p><p>Rio blinked at this, looking between the two of them with interest and a slight frown as Agatha responded as if it had been nothing, “I take the weekends off.”</p><p>Rhodey nodded, his eyes narrowing as she stared across at him, refusing to waver. Abigail hovered awkwardly and then as if to break the tension she squeezed between the two in the stand-off and went to wrap her arms around Rio, pressing against her from behind and using her as a bit of a barrier against the sharp downturn the conversation had taken. “As much as I usually enjoy sparring over business, perhaps we should…”</p><p>But Rhodey interrupted her, “Abigail, were you aware that Agatha has almost single-handedly ensured that those without access to clean water will inevitably remain so for years to come, decades even? That the rise in water-based diseases and pathogens will continue, that she’s so polluted a bill that <em>should</em> be bipartisan, that <em>should</em> have secured solid support across the aisle that it’ll probably never see the light of day?”</p><p>Rio turned to look at Agatha, her eyes the size of saucers and her breath catching in her throat as she desperately wanted to reach for her, to hold her away. But it was as she watched Agatha appear to grow two more inches, glaring across at Rhodey that she knew she wouldn’t have to. That this woman could handle herself.</p><p>“A bit dramatic for a garden party, aren’t we, Rhodes? What? No Stark here so you’re given an inch off your leash and you decide it’s time to bite?”</p><p>Abigail laughed, desperate to cut the tension as she turned to Rhodey and reach around Rio to tug his arm, “Let me get you a drink, hmm? Better yet, Rachel can get you one. She can keep you entertained and Agatha…” but Agatha had already left, had turned away and was putting as much distance between herself and the three of them as they stared after her.</p><p>“I don’t usually say this about women,” Rhodey started, and Rio’s eyes narrowed across at him, already anticipating his next words. “But what a bitch.”</p><p>Abigail laughed in agreement and then gently pushed Rio towards Rhodey, “Drink, my sweetheart, entertain my friend here and I’ll see you later.”</p><p>Rio smiled against her better judgement as Abigail placed a kiss to her shoulder and then sauntered off to find more friends to fawn over her. She looked to Rhodes and offered him the same, tight smile, gesturing for him to follow her to the bar.</p><p>“If you don’t mind,” he said formally, glimpsing at the bar before turning back to Rio, “I’m not sure I’m up for this today. As much as I’d enjoy your company.”</p><p>Rio ducked her head in faux-modesty and nodded, “I understand. Lovely to meet you.”</p><p>“Yes,” the man offered with a slight smile before he turned in the opposite direction and disappeared out of sight.</p><p>Rio released a slow breath as she weighed her options then. She could sit back at the bar and jump back into her conversation with Kyle, she could find Abigail and spend the rest of the day following her around like a little duckling, she could search for Agatha and drag the truth out of her, or she could disappear off to somewhere quiet where she could be herself for five precious minutes.</p><p>She chose the latter and soon made her way through the guests to sneak up to Abigail’s bedroom, breathing a sigh of relief when she opened the door and threw herself down on the bed.</p><p>She needed to decompress. Needed to fight down the feelings that Agatha brought out in her. Or she’d explode. At something, or someone.</p><p>Groaning as she stretched against the soft fabric she almost missed the sound of a door opening and then gentle footsteps across the plush carpet.</p><p>She turned her head slowly from where it rested on the mattress and looked up at Agatha, now standing at the foot of the bed, staring at her with an inscrutable expression. “You let her talk to you like that?” Her words were soft, questioning, but Rio had been angry for almost four days now so she didn’t take them that way. She pushed herself up and moved to stand again, squaring up to Agatha a little.</p><p>“It’s none of your business how she speaks to me.”</p><p>“It is when she speaks to you like that.”</p><p>“It’s not <em>me</em>, it’s <em>Rachel</em>.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head back and closed her eyes, giving Rio a real chance to scan over her body, but instead of finding herself pulled towards her, she found it made her angrier. She looked casual, and expensive. Rio hated her for looking so good when she was so mad.</p><p>“Is it <em>Rachel</em> when she fucks you?”</p><p>“That’s none of your business,” Rio grit out, her hands curling into fists at her sides then, “You shouldn’t be here. I told you last night…”</p><p>Agatha held her hands up suddenly, raising them to waist level as she took a step closer to Rio. “I wasn’t going to. But Wanda’s coming and I don’t trust her so I wanted to be here. For you.” Her words were rushed, almost falling over each other to get out of Agatha’s mouth, as if she’d been holding them in all day.</p><p>Rio flexed and unflexed her jaw then, her eyes darting hurriedly over Agatha’s features as if to search for any semblance of a lie. She found none and instead found a sadness that she’d also seen last night, and countless glimpses of through their week together.</p><p>“She’s never been here before. Abigail’s never even…” but she trailed off and began to frown, “But Abigail’s never mentioned you either. How did you…?”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed suddenly as Agatha spoke, “I knew her first name, that she was interested in women, that she had a house here, and Wanda knew her… it wasn’t hard.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, “Wanda. Was it from Abigail that she found out about me?”</p><p>“Yes. But only technically. She saw a photo of you by her pool.”</p><p>Rio groaned and rolled her eyes, moving her hands to rub at her temples. “Fuck!”</p><p>“I need this over. It’s getting too messy.”</p><p>“It won’t be for much longer. She knows you’ll be here, that’s all it is.” But Rio was shaking her head, trying to get her mind straight, trying to make Agatha understand.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be here,” she said more firmly, unsure what to say anymore. Or why her words weren’t getting through to Agatha’s thick head.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha responded quietly, taking a slow step towards Rio again as she lowered her hands and reached for Rio’s. But Rio pulled away slowly, turning her back on Agatha as if not seeing her would help the hurt in her whole body.</p><p>“What did you do, with the Senator and Wanda? That guy, Rhodes, whatever his name was. He was practically spitting at you.” Agatha didn’t say anything in response.</p><p>Rio turned then and moved to push at Agatha’s shoulder, shoving her roughly back, “Tell me. I deserve to know.”</p><p>“It’s none of your business,” Agatha said calmly, correcting her stance after Rio’s shove, her hand curling into itself as she watched Rio steadily.</p><p>But Rio could feel the frustration build in her again, could feel the fire starting to spit as she rounded back on Agatha. But she was too close. Agatha had moved right up to her so that if Rio moved to shove her again, she’d lose balance and stumble back. But she tried. She pushed her hands into Agatha’s waist and pushed against her, meeting resistance as Agatha placed her own hands on Rio’s arms and held her steady. Rio’s breathing had picked up, this time not because she was ready to shout, but because she could feel Agatha’s ribs through her thin top, feel the way her fingers began to scratch lightly at her forearms and feel the breath from her lips as she leant in some more.</p><p>“Agatha,” she breathed softly, her mind already screaming at her that this was a bad, terrible, no good idea. But Agatha moved in closer then, her lips already parted and her eyes wanting. She pressed her lips cautiously to Rio’s, giving her the chance to pull away if she wanted. But when Rio began to kiss back, her hand moved to wind her arms around her and tightened as she pulled her securely against her body. And Rio was on fire again. All the anger she had towards Agatha dissipated as she felt her tongue brush her lower lip she moaned desperately as she opened her mouth to let Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha’s hands began to move against her, desperately grasping for anything she could get to, anything that would anchor Rio to her. It was hot, needy kiss that threatened to become more. So much more.</p><p>It was Agatha nipping lightly at Rio’s lower lip that awoke the younger woman to the danger of doing this. Especially here. Especially in this room. And she forced herself back with an urgency that almost threw her balance. Almost sent her toppling onto the bed she’d shared with Abigail.</p><p>“No. No. You can’t just…” but her anger was too great now, too cataclysmic for her to form a coherent sentence as she glared across at Agatha, “You shouldn’t be here! You… you shouldn’t!”</p><p>Agatha bit down on her lip as she watched Rio unleash on her, took it as hands began to tug and push at her torso, as her body moved into hers not for comfort or for release but to get her away, to drive her from the room. “A-Agatha…” Rio was desperate now, fighting against Agatha even as she didn’t fight back, allowing herself to be forced towards the door. “I need you to go.”</p><p>With that Agatha’s back came into contact with the door and she gasped quietly, her arms having still been held out to Rio, offering protection even as Rio rallied against her.</p><p>But as Rio saw there was no place else to push Agatha, no way to force her to move again and shove her out the door Rio lost momentum and she shook her head as she twisted her hands into the fabric of Agatha’s top, holding her just above her hip bones.</p><p>“You have ruined my life.”</p><p>She hadn’t expected the words to come, hadn’t even known she’d meant them as they tripped from her lips, but she’d said them now. She couldn’t take them back.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened slightly and then settled again as she gazed across at Rio, her expression morphing into the same one she’d worn last night when Rio had told her to leave for the first time. She looked like Rio had broken her heart.</p><p>And so she stepped back, gently untangling Rio’s fingers from her shirt and stepping out of the bedroom.</p><p>Rio stood stock still for a moment before she closed her eyes and wished she could take back her words. Wished to have Agatha back in the room, back in her arms.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t afford the time she needed to truly recover from that last interaction. She had to go back to the party and play her role perfectly. And so, with her chest aching, she mingled with the best of them, she toasted to business ventures and laughed at cruel, mostly bigoted jokes, and made sure Abigail knew she was there for her. They exchanged kisses and touches and Rio felt sicker and sicker with every one.</p><p>She hadn’t seen Agatha since she’d left the bedroom, but she’d felt her in every touch of Abigail’s, felt the ghost of Agatha’s fingers, Agatha’s lips against her, and sunk deeper and deeper into her sadness every time.</p><p>It wasn’t until the sun had disappeared and everyone was well on their way to drunk that Agatha had appeared again, so suddenly that Rio wondered if she’d been there this whole time and her mind had blocked her out. For self-preservation purposes.</p><p>But there she was, amongst some of Abigail’s worse friends, draped back against the chair as if she belonged there. As if she owned the room as well as the people in it.</p><p>Her gaze landed on Rio briefly and as Rio perched on the edge of an armchair nearby she felt her breath hitch. Agatha looked every bit the political marvel that she’d first witnessed in the photos she’d seen of her back on the plane all those days ago.</p><p>Her posture was relaxed, confident, and her gaze was sharp as she listened to the people around her talking about the state of the country.</p><p>“Of course, if it weren’t for all the immigration issues we’re having, funnelling hundreds of millions into tidying that up then I think we’d be in a much better place,” said one square-jawed dude to Agatha’s right.</p><p>“Come now, it’s the people that are already in the country that are the problem not those trying to get in,” countered the woman to Agatha’s left.</p><p>Rio watched Agatha closely, so closely she thought she could see the way her mind worked, how she absorbed the conversation of those around her and was already ten steps ahead before the next person could speak. She watched as she brought her glass of red to her lips and took a delicate sip, watched as she stretched her back slightly and a sliver of skin became briefly visible at her waist, and watched as her eyes moved back around to catch Rio staring. Rio felt hot suddenly, the kind of hot she used to feel when she was caught stealing candy from the corner shop when she was little. The kind of hot that meant she’d been caught. That her anger earlier was nothing compared to the overwhelming want she had for Agatha.</p><p>But it lasted all of two seconds as she fought her body again for control. She flexed her jaw and turned her head sharply away, unaware of the flicker of hurt that passed over Agatha’s face as she did so.</p><p>Rio wasn’t alone long, though, the soft sounds of Agatha’s conversation lulling her into a false sense of security before Abigail and her cronies marched in, finding Rio and descending on her immediately. “Sweetheart! Always in the last place I look,” she crooned and leant in to place a firm kiss to Rio’s lips. Rio smiled tightly and didn’t have to look around to know that she was being watched.</p><p>Abigail sat down beside her on the armchair and moved a hand to rest possessively across Rio’s lap, blocking her ability to stand up as the others all took seats across from them.</p><p>“I was just telling…” but Abigail trailed off as her gaze found Agatha and she exclaimed, “Agatha! I was just telling Charlotte here about your run-in earlier with Rhodes. My, my, he is not a happy bunny. But from what Wanda’s told me,” she paused then and turned to this Charlotte in question, “I meant to tell you, Wanda’s been held up tonight so will be through tomorrow instead,” she turned back to Agatha then with a grin, “I hear she’s not particularly happy with the outcome either.”</p><p>Rio had been watching Agatha this whole time, watching the way her lips twitched ever so slightly and she kept her gaze on Abigail, “Wanda’s never really been in the business of being happy.”</p><p>Abigail laughed, throwing her head back dramatically, “These Eastern European types…” she sighed heavily as she continued to smile across at Agatha, “It is quite the feat, though. Despite the obvious disaster, you did manage to secure her a rather large payday. I hear it’s astronomical.”</p><p>Agatha released a soft breath and swirled her glass of red, “I do what I can.”</p><p>But Abigail wasn’t about dropping it and Rio glanced up to see that the room was now full of at least twenty curious onlookers intent on seeing the outcome of the great, enigmatic Agatha Harkness against the sparkly, vicious Abigail Presley.</p><p>“Remarkable that you could be so calm about it. I’d have thought that a misstep like this one would send you running for the hills.”</p><p>“I don’t run from my mistakes, Abigail.”</p><p>“Clearly not,” Abigail said with a simper, her hand moving slowly up Rio’s thigh. Rio glanced down at it briefly and had to remind herself that if she slapped her hand away it would be over then and there. So she allowed it, knowing Abigail would never do anything she’d consider uncouth, regardless of how Rio felt about it.</p><p>But her gaze moved back to Agatha who once again looked murderous, her steely gaze focused on Abigail and Rio, and the hand that she’d seen disappear beneath the hem of Rio’s dress.</p><p>Conversation soon turned back to various pockets of the room and Rio was relieved that everyone seemed to be giving Agatha a reprieve. She tried to focus on Charlotte’s story about her fifth race horse’s terrible season but found her mind drifting back to Agatha, who watched her closely from across the room.</p><p>When she could no longer stand sitting listening to the same old awful stories, or feel the hand that rested hotly against her leg, she excused herself to go to the bathroom and disappeared quietly.</p><p>Walking the familiar halls of the grand house, Rio slipped into a back room where the maids kept their secret stash of cigarettes hidden behind a pile of old magazines. It was always worth Rio’s while to befriend the staff of her clients. If not for the easy company then for the secrets they knew, the insights into their employer’s personalities, their hidden cigarettes.</p><p>She stole one, silently thanking Maria for always keeping a lighter close by and lit up with a groan, pushing the small window open at the top of the longer frosted glass that hid the little room from the outside but gave the galley space some natural light even as the evening set in.</p><p>She rested both wrists up against the lip of the open window to ensure the ash and smoke would have a place to fall that wasn’t her expensive dress or the swept floor.</p><p>But she barely had the time to savour her first lungful of ashy air. The door had opened behind her and closed again, just as softly. Rio turned her head slightly to see who it was. But she should have guessed.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be here.”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t say anything. Instead she heard a soft click of the door and she knew she’d locked them in. She sighed softly before taking another long drag of her cigarette and turning her head to blow the smoke up towards the small opening at the top of the frosted window.</p><p>Agatha remained silent and moved behind Rio, pressing herself softly against her from behind. She moved cautiously then, her fingertips ghostly delicately over Rio’s sides, starting from just below her arm pits and stopping only when they hit the skin of her thighs below the hem of her dress.</p><p>Rio’s skin felt like it was on fire, and goosebumps rose along the trail of Agatha’s fingers. If it weren’t for the soft weight of the cigarette and the familiar sting of her lungs she’d have collapsed into Agatha without question</p><p>But instead she stood still, allowed it to happen.</p><p>Rio allowed it because it wasn’t sexual. The touch was more like comfort. It felt like an apology, a promise. Agatha’s fingers drew lazy circles against her thighs and her face pressed against her shoulder as if she were placing a kiss there, making it last for the time it took Rio to smoke nearly half the cigarette.</p><p>Rio didn’t move under Agatha’s touch, didn’t even acknowledge it. She just let it happen. As she knew she always would.</p><p>Rio waited until she’d smoked half the cigarette’s length, enjoying the soft attentions of Agatha as she did so. When she was done she turned slowly and Agatha moved her hands up to rest on Rio’s ribs, watching her closely. Rio placed her hands up, onto Agatha’s shoulders, the lit cigarette shedding some hot ash that dropped onto Agatha’s forearm and caused her to hiss and pull back.</p><p>Rio mumbled, a quiet “I’m sorry,” and took Agatha’s hand to move her arm up and kiss over where the ash had fallen, tracing her tongue over the area to soothe it down.</p><p>She glanced up at Agatha then, and watched her lips part slowly, but she turned away for fear she’d lose her edge as she reached to stub out the lit cigarette and gently fan away the remaining smoke.</p><p>“Come to me tonight. When she’s asleep.”</p><p>Wide brown eyes turned to gaze up at Agatha and she shook her head no, unable to vocalise it, knowing she’d be lying through her teeth to say she didn’t want that.</p><p>But Agatha had stepped forwards again, her hands finding Rio. “Don’t,” she whispered softly, and pushed Agatha’s hands down again, “I need to get back. She’ll be expecting me.”</p><p>Rio was still angry, could still feel the push and pull of Agatha as she fought herself to do the right thing, the thing she knew she should do, and the thing she so desperately wanted to do. But as she pulled away Agatha reached out a hand to her again and she hesitated, allowing the older woman to close the distance and cup Rio’s cheek. She held her for a second before pressing her lips to Rio’s temple then stepping aside and letting her leave the room.</p><p>Rio’s body burned as she made her way back to the noise of the party still ongoing out back and she found the nearest bottle of vodka to take a long swig and clean her mouth of the ashy taste from her cigarette.</p><p>It didn’t take long for her name, “Rachel!”, to be called by a few of Abigail’s drunken friends and she soon found herself sitting by the campfire, Abigail draped across her and her personhood long forgotten.</p><p>Across the haze of the smoke and the flames Rio saw the silhouette of Agatha, standing still for a while and watching. She couldn’t make out her expression but she could guess how she might be feeling. Another flicker of flame and Agatha was gone.</p><p>It was several more long hours before Rio was able to take Abigail to bed. She was half cut, swaying slightly and pawing at Rio as if she were a Christmas present she’d been waiting to open. Rio told her she was too drunk, gently moved her hands away with every swipe, every grope, and with a patience rivalled only by the saints she eventually got Abigail dressed, face cleaned, and in bed. She washed her own face, cleaned her teeth, and changed into her usual nighttime uniform before climbing into bed beside her, staying as far away from the soft snores as she could in the comfortable California King.</p><p>She lay for what felt like hours like that. Staring at a wall, listening to the soft snores of the woman beside her. The woman who’d belittled and groped at her all day. The woman who’d humiliated Agatha more than once. And she grew angry. It was anger upon anger as she stewed on Agatha’s presence that had led her to this newfound hatred of Abigail. Before she’d been fine, manageable, not too unpleasant. And now she was intolerable, and mortifying.</p><p>But all roads led to Agatha as she went round in round in her mind about what had happened the last few days. What had happened tonight.</p><p>When she could no longer stand it, she slipped silently from the bed and rummaged in her bag before disappearing briefly into the bathroom. When she emerged she stole a light shawl from Abigail’s dressing table chair, checked the woman was still fast asleep and slipped from the room.</p><p>The trip to the cabins dotted around the estate wasn’t too treacherous, as Rio had stolen some sliders from near the pool door to protect her feet as she walked through the dark grass, and out to where a few of the stand-alone cabins stood.</p><p>She didn’t know which one was Agatha’s but she could hazard a guess that it was the one with the light still on. Whether for her own benefit or simply because the woman couldn’t sleep, she didn’t want to guess. Without much hesitation, she knocked lightly on the door, and held her breath that she’d guessed right.</p><p>The door opened slowly to reveal the person she’d hopped to see: Agatha. There she stood, wearing emerald green silk pyjamas and a subtle smirk on her face. “I thought you might change your mind.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and slipped into the warm room before she could change her mind and glanced about the place. The cabin was cosy, but had enough room for a king bed, two bedside tables at one end, and a soft looking couch, a little coffee table, and a bookcase at the other. A door to the back led to a separate bathroom. But Rio was more focused on the woman now staring at her, glancing her over in the least subtle way possible.</p><p>Rio stealed herself then. Having decided that Agatha wouldn’t get her way tonight. She needed punished. And Rio needed relief. And so she dropped the shawl from around her shoulders and slowly stepped out of her sliders, making sure to keep her gaze on Agatha the whole time.</p><p>Her tongue darted out to wet her lips as she made to lift her slip over her head, pausing only to whisper innocently, “I wanted to show you something.”</p><p>In one swift movement, she’d pulled the slip entirely off of her body and dropped it by her feet, leaving her standing in a tiny, light blue bikini that left nothing to the imagination.</p><p>As if the visual weren’t enough, she ran her hands slowly down her body, brushing over her breasts, and skimming slowly down her torso as she spoke, “It’s Abigail’s favourite. Well, her favourite is the pink one but I got this new colour for her… what do you think?”</p><p>Agatha had never looked so furious.</p><p>Bingo, Rio thought smugly, unable to stop herself from smirking as she looked over at Agatha. “Agatha? Cat got your…?”</p><p>But Agatha had stepped forwards and was pulling at Rio, pressing her close and attacking her lips with her own. Exactly the reaction Rio had been hoping for. She wanted the release desperately. Wanted to punish Agatha for making her want her. Wanted to make her consumed with jealousy so much so that she’d lose her mind.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth found a hot and fierce trail down to Rio’s throat and with the last semblance of control available to her Rio was able to gasp out, “No… no biting.”</p><p>Agatha growled at this and thrust her tongue down against Rio’s pulse point, eliciting a soft whine from the other woman as her hands groped and grabbed at her, much more welcome than Abigail’s from earlier.</p><p>Rio was similarly grasping at Agatha, pulling her face up to kiss her fully, sucking so hard on her tongue that they produced unholy, filthy noises and Agatha ran them back into the wall and they both groaned as they collided, their bodies now pressed impossibly closer.</p><p>“Get,” Agatha groaned as Rio pressed a knee firmly against Agatha’s core, “these,” she tugged at the sides of the string bikini pants almost ripping them, “Off…” But Rio grabbed her wrists and panted as she pulled back from Agatha, the woman’s movements stilling as she looked up with a frown across her face.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha’s frown deepened as she moved slowly back from Rio but the younger woman still held her wrists and she smiled evilly as she leant in and licked over Agatha’s upper lip before whispering, “I want you to fuck me in them.”</p><p>Agatha’s whole demeanour changed then. Where Rio had thought she was being rough before, Agatha kicked it up a notch. She pulled her hands from Rio’s wrists and moved her right hand up to wrap around her throat, moving in again to press her further against the wall as her left hand pushed down into Rio’s panties and she groaned at the wetness she found there.</p><p>She squeezed the sides of Rio’s throat gently as she pushed one finger slowly inside her. Rio was wet enough. Rio was desperate enough. And Agatha knew it.</p><p>“Fuck, <em>Agatha</em>…”</p><p>“Will you wear this tomorrow?” Agatha husked, leaning in to press her forehead against Rio’s temple as she pushed a second finger slowly into her, stilling her hand.</p><p>“Will you parade around in her favourite bikini knowing I fucked you in it?”</p><p>Rio groaned and bucked her hips slightly, desperate for movement from Agatha, anything she’d give her.</p><p>“Y-yes.”</p><p>Agatha smiled against Rio’s cheek and placed a soft kiss there before pushing a third finger into her and beginning to swirl her thumb lightly over her clit.</p><p>“Good girl.”</p><p>Rio moaned loudly then, Agatha applying a little more pressure to her throat as she began to thrust slowly into her soaked cunt, her breathing picking up to match Rio’s panting.</p><p>“You,” she whispered, “have no idea… what you do to me…”</p><p>Rio whined softly, her hands moving to rest against Agatha’s sides, twisting and clenching in the fabric as Agatha continued her slow and strong movements inside her, forcing Rio to feel every thrust of her long fingers. Rio came with a broken moan as Agatha held her throat firmly, causing her to see stars as she arched against Agatha’s hand and her thighs quaked from the strength of the orgasm.</p><p>Agatha loosened her hold on Rio’s throat entirely, gently stroking it before dipping her head to kiss her there softly and moving back to press a kiss to her lips.</p><p>Rio sighed into the kiss and moved her hands down to the waistband of Agatha’s pyjama pants, tugging them down slowly over her hips and releasing them to fall to the floor. But Agatha seemed far too intent on making her mark on Rio in the only way she now could, she pulled her fingers slowly out of her and looked down to see that the once light blue fabric was now a much darker tone as Rio’s thighs glistened with her come. But Rio was stepping closer again, raising Agatha’s hand with an intent to suck herself off her fingers. Just as her lips drew close Agatha stopped her and wiped her fingers gently over the small fabric triangles barely covering Rio’s breast, and then replacing her fingers with her mouth, sucking desperately on Rio’s nipples through the thin fabric and moaning as Rio dug her nails into her scalp and pressed her chest up and into her.</p><p>Agatha pulled back only to breathe and grinned as she stepped back to remove her own shirt, smirking as Rio moved closer and attached her own lips to Agatha’s breasts. Agatha allowed this for a few seconds, her hands brushing down Rio’s sides gently as she moaned when Rio’s tongue drew tight circles around her nipple and nipped lightly at it.</p><p>But tonight wasn’t a night for foreplay.</p><p>She pushed Rio away and said, “On the bed.” Rio quirked a brow and moved to kneel up in the centre of the bed, holding a hand out to Agatha. But the woman turned from her and went over to her bag.</p><p>“You did <em>not</em>,” Rio uttered in disbelief, watching as Agatha turned around with a harness in her hands.</p><p>“Presumptuous,” she scoffed, feeling indignant at the idea of Agatha packing a strap because she knew Rio would come to her.</p><p>Agatha ignored her as she expertly stepped into the harness and secured the strap at its centre. This, Rio noticed, wasn’t as large as the one in London. But it would be more than enough.</p><p>She eyed Agatha with a stern expression, not moving from her place in the middle of the bed even as Agatha moved to stand at the edge with her knees touching the sides.</p><p>Unconsciously or not, the brunette began to slowly jerk her hand up and down the midnight blue cock, watching Rio with a smug expression across her face.</p><p>“I can’t <em>believe</em> you brought that.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha drawled, now officially enjoying this all too much for Rio’s liking. “I was originally going to arrive wearing it but… I thought you riding me in the middle of a garden party might be a step too far.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped at the audacity of the woman. The sheer arrogance of her. “You think I’d let you fuck me in front of everyone? Have you not been listening the past two days? I’m here to work.”</p><p>Agatha hummed lowly, keeping up her movements against the strap, “And yet here you are. Asking me to fuck you in your bosses favourite outfit.”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw. Unable to argue with that but unwilling to give Agatha the satisfaction. She waited a second but soon moved closer, reaching to take the base of the strap in her hand but Agatha slapped her away lightly, “Ah!”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, making her eyes as wide and innocent as possible as she did so. Agatha just smiled, “On your back.”</p><p>Rio hesitated but obliged, shuffling back slightly to lower herself down, leaning up on her elbows to keep her eyes on Agatha who looked like she owned the whole world.</p><p>In one swift movement Agatha had grabbed Rio’s ankles and pulled her so her ass was on the edge of the bed, making Rio release an unconscious squeak. Agatha laughed softly and then positioned herself between her thighs, breaking eye contact only to look down and spit on the strap, slowly rubbing it over the length and looking back at Rio, who had gone a little slack jawed.</p><p>“I want you to beg,” Agatha said in a soft voice, stepping a little closer and pushing the strap to begin rubbing small circles around Rio’s clit through the thin fabric of the sodden bikini.</p><p>Rio moaned loudly as she watched her movements and bucked her hips a little but she didn’t beg.</p><p>Agatha just smiled and moved her free hand to hold Rio’s thigh, pressing down at her hip joint, keeping her from bucking.</p><p>“I said,” she started again softly, pressing a little harder against Rio’s clit, “<em>beg</em>.”</p><p>But Rio only continued to moan softly, now biting down on her lip as she watched Agatha’s cock move slowly down to where her entrance was below the fabric. Agatha pressed in and the slither of fabric that was there stretched back, exposing Rio’s lips, but not allowing the strap to slip in.</p><p>She groaned again, louder this time and released a, “Fuck, Agatha…”</p><p>But it wasn’t enough and Agatha rocked her hips into her lightly, testing the stretch of the fabric, “Oh, you can do better than that…”</p><p>Rio groaned and rocked her head back, desperate to get Agatha to give in but having no power in the situation.</p><p>She felt Agatha move above her, and looked back up to see Agatha leaning over her slightly, that same smug grin on her face, “I could do this all night, baby… but I’m not sure you can… <em>beg</em>.”</p><p>She thrust then a little harder and Rio breathed out a stuttering, “F-fuck, Agatha… please, <em>please</em> fuck me!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled quietly and paused only to murmur a gentle, “Good. Girl.” She let her tongue roll around the last syllable as she reached down to pull the fabric to the side and pressed slowly into Rio’s dripping entrance, until she’d bottomed out completely and Rio had dropped onto her back, babbling soft curses and rocking her hips.</p><p>Agatha groaned at the sight, this new angle allowing her to see exactly how well she took her. She experimentally pulled out until the tip was visible again and watched as Rio groaned and moved her hips, trying to get her to slip back in again. The reward for this desperation was quick, and firm. Agatha held open Rio’s thighs and thrust fully and harshly into her, setting a brutal pace as she continued to press as hard and deep as she could, her own moans matching Rio’s as she began to buck more erratically against the grinding pad.</p><p>Rio could feel every inch of Agatha at this angle, her mind full of just Agatha, the way she’d made her beg, the look on her face when she finally gave in.</p><p>But she moved her hand down to press again Rio’s clit, bullying it with the sudden, urgent desire to get Rio to come before she did. She just about managed it, tumbling over the edge as Rio’s moans filled the small cabin and Agatha’s own followed suit with a heavy gasp of Rio’s name.</p><p>“Fuck, <em>fuck</em>,” she whispered as she gazed down at the sight before her and Rio felt her breath hitch as she made eye contact with Agatha. The woman continued to thrust gently into her, her thumb only now lightly brushing every so often across her clit as she rocked her hips rhythmically to meet Agatha’s gentle thrusts. Agatha’s moved greedily over Rio’s body and settled down to where she continued to rock slowly into Rio, her mouth falling open at the sight. It was too much for her too stop, too delicious for her not to continue rocking into Rio’s cunt, almost coming all over again at the sight of Rio taking her so well, at the gentle twitches of her hips, of the wetness that spread from Rio’s cunt and all over her inner thighs. At the sight of the ruined bikini that Abigail loved so much. Her hand moved to brush over the thin piece of fabric still clinging to Rio and Rio groaned, her enjoyment now moving to a dull satisfied ache, “Agatha… I can’t…”</p><p>Agatha’s movements slowed entirely then and she matched Rio’s groans as she let her cock gently slip out of Rio, her fingers replacing it to stroke over Rio’s sensitive centre before she leant down and placed a kiss to her hip. Rio watched this all with a growing urge to get Agatha to please, please fuck her again but she held on to her head as she instead slumped back against the mattress and threw her forearm up to cover her eyes, needing a second to recover herself.</p><p>After shimmying out of the harness, Agatha crawled over Rio and began placing soft kisses along her shoulder, dipping her head to kiss the space where her shoulder met her throat. Rio turned then and with what strength she had left in her aching body she rolled them onto their sides and wrapped herself as snugly as she could around Agatha, watching as she caught her breath.</p><p>“We shouldn’t have done that,” she murmured softly, feeling Agatha’s hot breaths against her lips. “It was stupid. I shouldn’t have come here.”</p><p>“I’m glad you did,” Agatha admitted quietly, now drawing slow patterns up Rio’s back.</p><p>They were both silent for a while before Agatha said again in an even quieter voice: “I want you to leave with me. Please.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know whether it was the post-orgasm haze or the fact that Agatha’s touches set a fire inside of her but this time… this time the request didn’t make her want to scream. Instead she pressed a kiss to waiting lips and whispered against them, “I can’t.”</p><p>Agatha tried to depeen the kiss then, tugging Rio closer to her as her soft touches turned hard, wanting. As if Rio would stay if she kept her busy all night. Kept her coming.</p><p>But Rio was able to pull away before she fell under Agatha’s spell again and she unentwined herself to stand on heavy legs, “I need to shower.”</p><p>Agatha just sat up and watched her silently as Rio disappeared into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.</p><p>As Rio stood beneath the hot waterfall, having removed her soaked bikini and lathered herself with whatever ridiculously expensive soap Abigail kept in here even for her guests, Rio closed her eyes and imagined a world in which she could leave. A world in which she could throw in the towel on this job of hers and find something else to do. Something she’d be equally as good at.</p><p>But now wasn’t the time. She was tired, aching, and nervous that she’d already blown it all up because of the irresistible magnetic pull of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>By the time she left the bathroom, dried and ready to put her slip back on, she had decided on something. Something that if Agatha didn’t meet her in the middle on she knew she had to cut her off. Cold Turkey. No take backs.</p><p>“Agatha-“</p><p>“Rio-“</p><p>They both blinked at each other, Rio now standing in her earlier-discarded slip and Agatha sitting with her legs tucked demurely beneath her in her slick pyjamas.</p><p>“How are you getting home?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head with a frown, “On Monday? Brian, Abigail’s driver, he’s taking me.”</p><p>“And you trust him? This Brian? Enough to give him your address?”</p><p>The last part came out more an accusation than a question and Agatha’s chin rose up slightly as if to fight the indignity of Rio trusting an unknown driver but not her.</p><p>“I trust him. But he doesn’t take me home. He drops me a few blocks away.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and ran a hand through her hair as she considered this for a second, “Jimmy can take you.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>…”</p><p>“Not all the way. Not if you don’t want that. But he can drive you back to manhattan. Take you wherever you need to go.”</p><p>Rio sighed and moved to grab Abigail’s shawl from the floor, snatching it back rather suddenly, “I told you I trusted Brian.”</p><p>“But I don’t,” Agatha said calmly, watching Rio with a frown, “I’ve had Jimmy for years and-…”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio rounded on her then, her voice firm as she clutched the shawl around herself, “Stop. I’m a big girl. I’ve been doing this a while. I know Brian and trust him.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed slightly but she nodded, seeming to know this line of argument wouldn’t get her anywhere, “Fine.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily, not wanting to leave like this and still needing to see if Agatha would give a little. She moved to the edge of the bed where she could reach out and graze Agatha’s cheek with her fingertips, “I wanted to ask… would you have dinner with me? Sometime next week? I… we need to talk about what’s going on. With us.”</p><p>Agatha eyed Rio carefully, sharp blue eyes darting across her face and clearly struggling with what she wanted to say versus what Rio wanted to hear, “Okay.”</p><p>Rio nodded then, giving Agatha a tight smile before she turned and slipped silently from the warm cabin.</p><p>Her journey back to Abigail’s room was uneventful, and she managed to make it back without spotting a soul. She tied her bikini to the balcony, having run it under some cold water beforehand, and then checked herself over in the mirror before she silently returned to the bed. Abigail’s light snoring was enough to set her at ease as she kept to the edge of the bed, curling in on herself and willing sleep to take her so thoughts of blue eyes and soft lips wouldn’t haunt her waking thoughts anymore.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio woke the next morning before Abigail did. And she was aching. She groaned quietly as she stretched out her legs and felt the dull, satisfying throbbing between her legs intensify.</p><p>But it was the aching in her chest that was really the issue. The first thing that had popped into her mind was Agatha. Agatha touching her. Agatha inside her. Agatha… Agatha begging her. Pleading with her to just go home with her.</p><p>It was more than she could stand.</p><p>She stretched out from the bed cautiously, unwilling to wake Abigail, not ready to face up to the person she had to be around her: Rachel. She tiptoed into the bathroom and closed the door behind her as softly as she could before she shed her neglige and slipped into the shower.</p><p>As the hot water cleansed her of her waking thoughts she let it run down her back, her hands pressed against the wall and her ears atuned only to the noise of the heavy droplets pummelling her body.</p><p>The noise of the shower meant that she didn’t hear Abigail slip into the bathroom, wasn’t aware of her as she stripped herself of her clothes, and knew nothing of her until she felt soft hands against her hips and a body soon pressed against her own from behind.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped open and she felt the need to recoil, to pull away entirely, but she hesitated too long, and was so unsure of what she wanted in that moment that she did the easiest thing: she fucked Abigail just like she wanted. She fucked her in a slow, soft, detached way. She kissed her neck and traced her skin with her tongue. She made her come twice against her hand and brought her down steadily. Able to do the mechanics of the act. Able to go through the motions. But remaining unimpacted by it. Unmoved. Untouched.</p><p>As Abigail got her breath back she smiled down at Rio, having two inches on her, and Rio focusing somewhere between the wall and Abigail’s shoulder. “Are you done in here? I shouldn’t be much longer or my guests will think I’m rude.”</p><p>Rio just nodded, and pressed a soft kiss to Abigail’s cheek, ever the gentlewoman. She slipped from the shower and went to dry herself, stepping out into the bright bedroom and hating what she’d just done. But her anger was there again. Burning slowly in her chest.</p><p>Her work with Abigail was routine. They’d agreed on spontaneous sessions, if Abigail asked, she’d usually get. This had been going on now for years. Three, to be exact. Abigail was one of Rio’s most recurrent clients. There was safety in knowing exactly how the woman liked to be touched, that Rio could keep an extra distance from her because, apart from the occasional drunken grope, Abigail would never bother to touch <em>her</em>.</p><p>But Agatha was here now. In her life, and in her world. It felt different.</p><p>As Rio slowly dried herself off and fixed her makeup for the day she waited for Abigail to come back out, knowing she’d want to pick her outfit.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Abigail to re-emerge, looking pleasantly flushed with a towel piled on her head. “A pool day today I think, don’t you? You can wear that delicious bikini for me. I have a few guests who’ll still be here but I’ll mostly be inside with them talking business. I’d like a nice view when I’m done though.” She winked over at Rio and went to fetch her bikini from her bag, pulling out with it a blue and white striped linen shirt.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat softly as she moved across to the balcony to fetch the blue bikini she’d tied there the night before. “I bought it in blue. Thought it would look good against the shirt. What do you think?”</p><p>Abigail hummed appreciatively and nodded, “Let me see.”</p><p>So, feeling her stomach clench at the exposing nature of it all, Rio dropped her towel and fit the bikini about herself, adjusting it delicately as she moved over to take the shirt from Abigail and slipped it over her arms.</p><p>Abigail practically squealed at her sight, her hands now freely roaming over Rio’s body, blissfully unaware that another woman had her hands on this body, on this very bikini the night before. Rio allowed this to happen, watching Abigail with a semi-smile as it did. “Perfect. No one will be able to look away from you.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow slightly as Abigail moved away to begin readying herself for the day and moved to grab her book from the side and descend into the main house, heading for the kitchen.</p><p>Much to her dismay, the kitchen wasn’t empty. Maria, the housekeeper, was busying herself with cleaning the countertops - but she wasn’t the issue here - Wanda was.</p><p>Rio hesitated briefly before deciding to focus entirely on Maria, greeting her in Spanish as she moved to kiss her cheek, and slipped behind her to fetch some coffee from the pot.</p><p>But Wanda had been watching her the whole time. Her hungry greens eyes moving slowly over the ridiculous amount of flesh Rio currently had on show. “Well aren’t you a sight for sore eyes.”</p><p>Rio ignored her, instead moving to the fridge to fetch some milk. But Wanda persisted. “Turn around, gorgeous. I want to get a proper look at you.” Rio didn’t. She wouldn’t. She stood with her back to Wanda and stirred the milk slowly in her mug. The small, kind housekeeper stepping beside her and whispering: <em>¿Ella te está molestando?”</em>
</p><p>Rio smiled softly at the question and shook her head just once. Maria gazed at her for a second before she turned to glare at Wanda and then walked off to continue her duties.</p><p>“I hear Agatha made quite the impact last night,” Wanda continued, having glared right back at Maria as she’d passed her. “Always did love the spotlight.”</p><p>Rio clattered her spoon down on the side then and turned around to shoot daggers across at Wanda, “What did she do for you? With Stark? What did she give you?”</p><p>But Wanda wasn’t interested in talking anymore. Her mind was far too diverted with the full view of Rio’s body. Her gaze was hungry as it moved slowly down and back up again and Rio felt her cheeks flush slightly from the attention. “Well she wouldn’t give me <em>you</em>,” Wanda said with a soft pout, “Outright refused to share.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed at her words, her hand curling tighter around her mug as she glared at Wanda, “Tell me. You and Stark. What has she done?”</p><p>But Wanda just tutted and rocked her finger back and forth as she moved around the island and went to stop infront of Rio, her gaze dropping to her chest once more, her hands moving to the counter behind her to trap her, “Give me a kiss and I’ll tell you everything.”</p><p>She leant in then, so close that Rio could feel her breath against her lips and for the briefest moment Rio considered it. She thought about pressing their lips together, sucking the truth out of Wanda. But despite the fact that she’d been fucking another woman that very morning, even the thought of just kissing Wanda made her feel sick, like it would be a total and utter betrayal of Agatha.</p><p>Instead, she leant in ever so slightly, as if she were about to oblige. As if she’d ever submit to this woman. Stopping just shy of their lips touching and smirking as she heard Wanda’s breath hitch, she whispered, “I would rather die than touch you, Wanda.”</p><p>She pulled away then before Wanda could even process her words and pushed her away with a firm jab at her waist.</p><p>Rio picked her book back up and only when she was a good distance away from Wanda did she turn back, “Come near me again and I’ll tell Abigail.”</p><p>“As will I,” Wanda countered with a grin, having recovered quickly, her fingers wriggling teasingly, “Kiss me and we can forget all about it.”</p><p>“Go. Fuck. Yourself.”</p><p>She emphasised her words with a raised middle finger and then turned around to head towards the pool, finding a spot in the sun to flop down on and try to block Wanda from her brain.</p><p>By the time Rio had finished her coffee, and read a few pages of her book, she’d calmed herself down. But just a little.</p><p>Yesterday was peanuts compared to what lay in store for her today. Yesterday was only Agatha and her complicated feelings about her. Today Wanda was back in the mix. And as much as she wanted to throttle Agatha, she wanted to <em>murder</em> Wanda.</p><p>It was only when she heard her name being called - “Rachel!” - that she actually looked up and saw that the kitchen had filled with people. She sighed and reluctantly left her space on one of the sun loungers to traipse back through to the house, holding her empty mug in her hand.</p><p>The large kitchen now housed a few familiar faces, with two at the centre, Abigail and Wanda. Abigail beamed over at Rio, delighted that she was able to show her off to her guests as if she were a prime piece of meat. Rio simply smiled at everyone, deliberately ignored the redhead, and went to pour herself another coffee. It was as conversation picked up again behind her and she was about to replace the pot that she heard a familiar voice that made her heart stop, “Spare me some? I had a late night…”</p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder and saw Agatha standing, a little too close to be casual, a little too smug to be charming. “Late night, huh?” Rio said with a soft smile of her own as she turned to pour Agatha some coffee, “Can’t imagine why that would have been.”</p><p>Agatha hummed as she let her eyes roam over Rio’s body now she was fully facing her, “Had to make some claims, that’s all.”</p><p>“Ah, you make it sound so easy.”</p><p>“It’s easy when you know how.”</p><p>Rio smirked as she finished the pour and replaced the pot, moving past Agatha and deliberately bumping against her to allow Agatha’s hand to drag across her front, making it look as casual and natural as breathing.</p><p>She didn’t think it were this possible to be this turned on by a woman who had barely spoken to her. No less by a different woman to the one she’d been inside of not an hour ago. But here she was, already forgiving Agatha all over again because she <em>wanted</em> her. But she couldn’t focus on the want in her chest or the desire settling between her thighs as she looked up to the room before her. Many were dressed for the Cape, casual enough, but exuding wealth, exuding that luxury that always made Rio uncomfortable. It was tacky, really, gauche.</p><p>Her gaze fell to Agatha then, as the woman moved back to an armchair with her coffee, sitting down and leaning back in her chair, opening her legs and… Rio blinked slowly, stupidly, her mouth falling open slightly as if not believing what she was seeing. But surely she hadn’t.</p><p>Agatha, her arms spread out along the back of the arm chair, coffee mug held securely in her left, was gazing across at Rio with a raised brow. Her legs were similarly spread and, subtly, but there if you were looking, was a slight bulge.</p><p>Rio had to turn away for fear that her staring would give Agatha away completely. She coughed softly and swallowed a large gulp of hot coffee, trying to control her spinning thoughts.</p><p>That <em>bitch</em>. She ran a hand through her hair, keeping her back to the rest of the room as she focused on lowering her heart rate, forcing herself to think straight again. She’s made a mistake last night. A mistake that she’d thankfully, at least seemed to, get away with. She couldn’t risk anything else. Not when she had less than 24 hours to go.</p><p>And there was Agatha. Brazen. Arrogant. Presuming. She turned then and left the kitchen again, shrugging off her shirt and draping herself over a sun lounger, knowing everyone could see. Knowing Agatha could see.</p><p>It wasn’t that Rio was inherently vain about the way she looked. It’s that she was smart enough to know the way other people felt about the way she looked. And so she stretched out, raising one knees to the sky as she adjusted herself slowly on the sun lounger and sighed heavily as she felt the warmth of the sun wash away every unhelpful, distracting thought about Agatha.</p><p>She was so comfortable then, lying out in the gentle morning light that she slowly drifted off to sleep. Not two hours later she was woken by a gentle touch to her shoulder and she squinted into the midday sun to find Agatha leaning over her, a soft smile on her face and a halo over her head with the sun perfectly framed behind her. “Hey,” she whispered softly as the took the sight in, her brow furrowing slightly and briefly wondering if she’d died and this were her heaven.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her shoulder and moved her free hand to gently caress Rio’s face as she took her in, “You’ve caught the sun.” Her thumb traced gently down Rio’s nose, looking at the light freckles that had appeared there, and she bit down on her lower lip as Rio shifted slightly, turning into her touch, “Where is everyone?”</p><p>“The front deck. They wanted the view and I wanted this view.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes raised slowly to catch Rio’s gaze and she gave her a genuine, soft smile as her hand moved down to rest against her jaw, careful to keep her hands where her body would block them if anyone were to look out towards them. “How did you sleep?”</p><p>“Just now? Or last night?”</p><p>Agatha grinned and raised her brows, “Both?”</p><p>Rio hummed softly and raised a hand up to rest gently across the one against her jaw, “Well. Both times.”</p><p>She moved her hand up to find what she thought she’d seen earlier and raised her brows in disbelief as her fingers curled around exactly what she’d expected they might at Agatha’s crotch. “That really is insane.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged a little and moved slightly closer to Rio from her position squatting by her bed, “Can’t blame a gal for trying.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, still a little hazy from sleep and sun as she moved her hand back to rest lightly against Agatha’s wrist, “Wanda tried it on earlier.”</p><p>Now that she wasn’t Agatha’s client anymore, she felt more at ease to share such details, trusting that whilst Agatha said she was here for her, she wouldn’t cause a fuss. But Agatha’s jaw clenched and she dropped her gaze from Rio’s, “Did she touch you?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said truthfully, moving a hand to lift Agatha’s chin, “Hey. In less than twelve hours you’ll all be gone, okay? Just need to make it through.”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and slowly pulled away from Rio though it was the last thing Rio wanted her to do. “She won’t stop trying until she gets what she wants.”</p><p>“And what does she want?”</p><p>“Me, on my knees, and you… on yours.”</p><p>Rio sat up slightly as she caught the double meaning and frowned up at Agatha, “Will you tell me now what you’ve done for her? What all that was about yesterday? I… Abigail doesn’t like me to have a phone so.” She stopped, realising how stupid that must have sounded, how infantile.</p><p>But she needn’t have stopped because Agatha had looked suddenly venomous. “She… doesn’t let you have a phone?”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and sat up fully then, swinging her legs over the side of the chair and briefly looking to check they were totally alone. She reached to place her hands on Agatha’s neck and held her there softly, “It doesn’t matter. What I meant to say was I haven’t been able to look it up. And I want you to tell me what’s happening.” But Agatha had lost her train of thought, unable to concentrate as she saw red and she pulled slowly back from Rio, standing above her and staring out at the horizon.</p><p>“I knew she was…” but she stopped as Rio raised her hands to her hips and deliberately, keeping her gaze up on Agatha the whole time, leant in to place a kiss to the slight bulge in Agatha’s pants. Agatha felt Rio’s movements against her and groaned softly, now gazing down at her with a frown, “That isn’t fair.”</p><p>Rio broke out into a grin as she stared up at Agatha, her eyes twinkling mischievously as she opened her mouth wide and stuck her tongue right out, waiting to see what Agatha might do. It was reckless, incredibly so. But she wanted more than anything to take Agatha’s mind off of Wanda, off of however she felt about Abigail.</p><p>Agatha seemed to deliberate for a second before she reached into her pants and pulled out the strap she’d used on Rio the night before, having slipped it out of the holster against her thigh. She held it out then, eyeing Rio cautiously as if she might start to laugh at her but Rio only moved closer and allowed Agatha to place the tip of the strap on her outstretched tongue before she closed her lips around it and began to slowly, in purposefully exaggerated motions, suck her off.</p><p>“Fuck me,” Agatha moaned softly, her hand moving to rest on Rio’s head as she watched her, having to fight hard not to press into her and hear Rio gag around her.</p><p>But Rio kept this up for a little longer, enjoying Agatha’s reaction until she finally pulled off and licked a thick strip from the base to the tip and sucked it off one last time before releasing with a loud <em>pop</em>.</p><p>Agatha watched her with her mouth hanging open, her eyes wide and her cheeks flushed, unable to say anything as Rio slowly stood from the chair and leant in to press a soft kiss to her cheek, “Two can play at that game, big boy.”</p><p>Agatha whined softly, attempting to catch Rio’s wrist as she brushed past her and missing so that she was left to stand exposed and desperate.</p><p>Rio stretched her neck out slightly as she sauntered back, her coverall shirt forgotten as she ventured back into the kitchen and poured herself another mug of coffee. She leant against the island and glanced back towards the pool, seeing Agatha now striding towards her, all tucked away. Her better judgement told her that to set Agatha off like this so early was not the best idea. Especially with Wanda near. Especially when she could only imagine the dick measuring contest they’d have if they were both in the same room alone with Rio but as Agatha strode towards her she couldn’t find it within herself to be bothered about any of that. She wanted this woman. She wanted her when she cradled her face as she woke from a sun-filled nap. She wanted her as she pressed inside of her. She wanted her as she danced with her to a corny love song. She wanted her full stop.</p><p>But Agatha was on her before she could properly process this realisation. She had her hands either side of her on the island and had pressed her face in against her neck as…</p><p>“I knew it,” the voice came high and loud behind them and Rio gasped as Agatha pulled back and Rio turned around to see Wanda grinning in delight at the sight of the two of them.</p><p>“You know,” she began to sing song out as she sauntered around to the other side of the island where Rio and Agatha stood. “I can’t see what she could give you that I can’t, baby. I’m bigger and better than her in every way.”</p><p>Wanda moved closer then, angling for Rio, “Is she still paying you? I didn’t know you took two at a time but if it’s an option…”</p><p>Agatha had stepped then in front of Rio and Rio thought she might actually throttle Wanda but Rio had pulled her back, to save Agatha from herself.</p><p>Pale biceps flexed beneath her hold but Rio wouldn’t let go, her nails digging so tightly into Agatha’s arm she knew she’d be leaving marks.</p><p>“You’re nothing,” Rio said with a surety that she felt in her bones, a calm sense of the inevitable rushing over her as she felt the end beginning to come.</p><p>But just as Wanda was about to react, and Agatha’s hand had found her side, she heard her name. Her <em>other</em> name.</p><p>“Rachel? What’s happening? These two having a marital dispute? Not in my house, ladies!”</p><p>Abigail’s laughter ran through the kitchen and did nothing to break the tension even as she moved around to where they were and held out a hand to Rio, “Come, sweetheart. You’ll catch a death of cold.” When Rio didn’t move she took her arm and pulled her close to her, draping the light shawl she was wearing over her shoulders around Rio’s too and holding her flush against her, Rio’s back against her front.</p><p>Agatha reacted instantly to this, and pushed past Wanda with such force that she stumbled into the island and gasped in pain. But Agatha had stormed out of the house before anyone could say anything and Rio felt a sudden, intolerable shame wash over her. Her body telling her to do something whilst her mind told her to stay.</p><p>She watched as Wanda recovered herself and bit down on her lip as Abigail leant around her to speak directly to Wanda, “Bit unhinged, isn’t she? Did she have any mental problems whilst you were together?”</p><p>But Rio had had enough. She pulled away from Abigail slowly and ignored the calls after her as she went to fetch something to cover herself with. She ran back to the bedroom and grabbed a plain baby pink tshirt (bought especially for the trip) and a white mini skirt (again, special purchase). She then disappeared out the front door and ran down to where Agatha’s cabin was, knocking furiously until she was let in.</p><p>Agatha opened the door only ajar, body blocking Rio from entering. “What is it?”</p><p>“<em>What is it?</em> Are you fucking kidding me?”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and looked to the sky for a second before she focused back in on Rio, “I don’t want to cause any more problems.”</p><p>Rio opened and closed her mouth a few times before she finally said, “That’s it? That’s… that’s it?”</p><p>But Agatha’s eyes had become swirling pools of all the things she couldn’t say and she closed them tightly as she whispered, “I just need five minutes. And I’ll be back. I’ll be good.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth faltered at her words, her brow furrowed deeply as she took in the shell of Agatha Harkness, and all she wanted to do was reach for her, was to bring her back to where they were teasing and playful and alive. But she didn’t. She couldn’t. And so she turned away and made her way slowly back up to the house, leaving her heart in  Cabin 7.</p><p>As she ventured back to the main house she saw a small group of the guests leaving. She stood to the side and waved with a soft smile at the people she barely knew, and who would never know her.</p><p>Abigail caught her eye as she moved back to the house and raised her brows at her, moving closer to whisper against her ear, despite the fact that no one was around to eavesdrop. “What happened back there, Rio? You’re acting strangely.” She placed her hands against Rio’s waist and held her securely, pulling back only to meet her gaze. “Is it something I did? Are you unhappy with our arrangement? You wouldn’t embarrass me now would you?”</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly, biting her tongue as she leant in to place a kiss to Abigail’s cheek, “No. I’m fully here. Fully in.”</p><p>Abigail nodded then and pulled away slowly, still watching a Rio closely, “we just have a couple more guests left. The terrible twosome. So you can lay low as I deal with them. Because you know that Wanda is a <em>dear</em> friend of mine and Agatha is important to my future. You wouldn’t want to mess either of those up now… And when they’re gone we can have some much needed alone time.”</p><p>Rio had to force a smile at that, knowing Abigail couldn’t really tell the difference anyway. She leant back in and pressed a kiss to Abigail’s other cheek and whispered, “I’d like that.”</p><p>And with that, a beaming grin from Abigail, and a light pat on the arm, Rio was alone again. She let her face fall and disappeared to her favourite room in the house to smoke a cigarette in private, trying to ignore the memory of yesterday when Agatha had been draped around her.</p><p>After smoking two, she left the little room and went to sit in the small den off the kitchen, curling up on a love seat and going over everything that had happened.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a room at the back of the house with a sweeping view of the grounds and the ocean in the distance, sat three very different woman. Two were friends - at least they pretended to be. Two were exes. Two wanted to be there. But all three hated each other.</p><p>Agatha, after taking a moment to herself in her cabin, had ripped her slacks off, thrown her shirt into a ball in the corner of the room, released the harness from her hips and threw that after her shirt. She swapped into a black halter neck dress that was perhaps more appropriate for a ball or a function but that made her feel in control. Switching from comfortable flats to killer black heels, dressing for the conversation she wanted to have, for the woman she wanted to crush.</p><p>Wanda, effortlessly unimpressed with almost anything but herself, sauntered into the room with one agenda: to taunt Agatha.</p><p>She sat opposite Abigail in the comfortable bucket chairs and picked up her soda water from the side, “Is she even coming?”</p><p>Abigail opened her mouth to speak but closed it again quickly when Agatha appeared in the door, stepping in without a greeting before she took a seat and threw her hair back. “So. What do you two bitches want?”</p><p>Wanda released a laugh and Abigail blinked over at the woman, taken aback by her foul mouth. “Now, Agatha… I’m really just looking to see if what you did for Wanda, you can do for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed slightly as she crossed her leg delicately over the other and her gaze flickered across to Wanda. Wanda smirked at her and raised her brows, “What about it, Aggie? Think you can do for Abi what you did for me?”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond and instead turned back to focus in on Abigail, “You want in? Political sway? What is it? Republican? Democrat? Both?”</p><p>Abigail nodded readily, finally glad they were getting somewhere. “Yes, yes, both. All! I have contacts, of course I do. But you have their ear. What you did for Wanda… well it didn’t exactly <em>work out</em> but… it got her name out. Some people, some still <em>good</em> people are now talking about her, talking <em>to</em> her. I want that. I want <em>them</em>.”</p><p>Agatha watched Abigail carefully, wondering how the hell Rio could stand to be in her presence for longer than five minutes. She herself wasn’t exactly a woman of the people. She knew she could do better with waitstaff, knew she could be more patient and polite. But Rio was different. She was warm and ebullient. She had time for anyone. And yet she was spending it with this cunt.</p><p>“The people who want to speak to Wanda aren’t <em>good</em> people,” Agatha said slowly, as if speaking to an idiot, which she firmly believed she was.</p><p>But Wanda interjected, “Depends who you’re talking to, Aggie.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and began to drum a slow rhythm against the arm of her chair then, watching Wanda with a steady look, “They’re bad people, Wanda. <em>You</em> are bad people.”</p><p>“Then why did you make Stark take my bid?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched suddenly and she narrowed her eyes over at Wanda, “A favour. That’s all.”</p><p>Abigail seemed to be lost in the conversation already, not entirely sure what was being left unsaid and who she should be focusing on but knowing something was soon to blow if she didn’t step in.</p><p>“So. Good people, bad people… whichever. I want them. I was everyone to want me.”</p><p>Agatha laughed quietly, rubbing at her temple as if to erase this conversation from her mind. “I can’t provide that.”</p><p>Abigail laughed, that grating, twinkling laugh Agatha had been hearing all weekend, “Of course you can! You’re the most powerful woman in D.C. Look what you did for Wanda! Look what you’ve been able to do your whole career.”</p><p>Agatha slapped her hands down on the arms of her chair then, growing frustrated with the constant reminder of how good she was, how powerful, when the one thing she wanted was the one thing she couldn’t get. She got up from her seat and went over to pour herself a drink from the decanter in the corner and knocked it back without so much as a wince. She stood facing away from the other two in the room for a while before she slowly turned back, comfortable that her temper wouldn’t show itself again, at least, not in the next five minutes.</p><p>“Wanda, I think we should leave. Let Abigail alone with…” she paused and shook her head slightly, “with her girlfriend.”</p><p>There was a soft noise behind her and she turned around to survey the two woman before her, raised her brows expectantly. “Don’t you think?”</p><p>But Wanda didn’t seem keen on the idea, and neither did Abigail.</p><p>“Stay just a little longer, both of you. I’m sure there will be opp-…”</p><p>But Agatha cut Abigail off, “No, I’m afraid there’s none. None that I’m willing to help you on anyway.”</p><p>Wanda smirked across at Agatha, her fingers toying lightly with her hair as she watched the woman who used to be her ex-wife, “Perhaps she’s right, Abigail. Besides… if I were you I’d want alone time with Rachel too. How many times was it you came this morning? Two? And before even a cup of coffee… my, my.”</p><p>If Abigail hadn’t been fidgeting, slightly embarrassed by this kind of talk, she might have noticed that Agatha looked positively murderous.</p><p>“Oh and in the car on the way here? Was that three? And all from little Rachel on her knees… imagine that, Agatha. Three times.”</p><p>Agatha was gritting her teeth so tightly she thought she might crack a tooth but she turned around again, refusing to give Wanda the satisfaction.</p><p>It was instead Abigail who spoke next, looking a little flustered, “Yes, well, she is insatiable. I really can’t get her to keep her hands off me.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes at this comment. And breathed out slowly through her nose, counting to ten in her head so she wouldn’t rip the heads off of these two bitches.</p><p>“Aren’t you lucky,” Wanda drawled, her gaze still in Agatha’s back, “If I had a hold of her I wouldn’t let her out of my sight.”</p><p>Agatha’s glass slammed down then and though she’d meant to try and do it a little softer she made Abigail jump slightly. But she recovered and turned around with a tight smile, “We should go, Abigail. It’s been a long weekend and we have a lot to do.”</p><p>Agatha moved then and practically dragged Wanda from her chair, pulling her with her through to the front of the house again. Her eyes swept the rooms as she passed but she saw no sign of Rio. And instead she released Wanda and did a big sweep of the main living room, her eyes darting about the place for any sign of the Latina. “Jimmy will be nearby. He arrived early this morning. Wanda, I’ll leave when you do.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes and went to turn to Abigail who had followed them through looking a little bewildered. But Wanda took her off to the office to discuss something business-related and Agatha took the opportunity to do another sweep of the house. It wasn’t five minutes later that she found her.</p><p>Rio was curled up in the centre of the love seat with a fluffy blanket draped over her, breathing steadily and softly. Agatha watched her for a second and debated on waking her but decided she had to, she had to say goodbye. She moved slowly over and dropped down to her knees beside the seat, gently stroking through dark hair as she whispered Rio’s name.</p><p>Rio groaned softly and fought waking as she scrunched her eyes more tightly and then rubbed at them as she adjusted herself and then blinked over at Agatha. “Hey.”</p><p>“Hey. I’m leaving soon.”</p><p>“Oh? Did…” Rio sat up hurriedly, her eyes bleary as she gazed around the room, “How did it go?”</p><p>“As well as it could have.”</p><p>Rio sighed and reached to touch Agatha’s cheek lightly, studying her for a second before she whispered, “Dinner? Next week?”</p><p>But Agatha countered with a soft whisper of her own, a base plea that she knew she’d said countless times already, “Come home with me.”</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly and moved her fingers down to trace over lightly pouting lips, “You know I can’t.”</p><p>Agatha nodded ever so slightly, keeping her gaze on Rio’s confused face and raised a hand to trace her fingers along the indent from the cushion across her cheek. This gave Rio the opportunity to look over Agatha properly, gazing down at the immaculate dress she was wearing, “Are you… going somewhere?”</p><p>Agatha hummed a little as her hand moved down to Rio’s and held it gently, “No. I just wanted to feel…” but she didn’t finish her sentence, didn’t need to. Rio understood. Rio moved then, shifting slightly to properly sit up, swinging her legs over the side of the seat. “Where are they?”</p><p>“The office. I said I’d leave when Wanda did.”</p><p>Rio just nodded and held Agatha’s hand gently across her lap, not daring to move any closer in case they were spotted. This position was innocent enough. Maybe.</p><p>“Abigail told me I was acting strangely. You should probably go sit and wait for Wanda somewhere else.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched then, her hand on Rio’s tightening its grip as her free hand slid up Rio’s bare thigh and settled so her fingers were toying with the string of the blue bikini she still wore beneath it. She didn’t have to say anything for Rio to understand what she meant, what she felt. So Rio let her hand stay there and leant in to place a kiss to the corner of Agatha’s lips as she whispered, “Give me a call mid-week. I’m assuming you saved my number from my emails, despite not having used it,” she chided softly, trying to get a smile out of Agatha again. “We can arrange dinner.”</p><p>“Is this going to be a dinner I enjoy?”</p><p>Rio frowned a little then and moved back to properly survey Agatha’s face, “It’s one we need to have.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped then to where her hand sat below Rio’s skirt and she furrowed her brow as she tugged a little at the string bikini, “Two orgasms this morning?”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, a flash of hurt in her eyes, “It’s my job, Agatha. The agreed rules of the…”</p><p>But Agatha was pulling away, her jaw set. She stood slowly and the contrast between this same positioning of the two of them could not have been more different from the morning. Rio looked up at her with a deep frown, “This is why I want to talk with you. Properly. We need to discuss… whatever this is.”</p><p>Agatha allowed one quick nod and bent down again to place a quick kiss to Rio’s temple. “Be safe. I’ll call you tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio reached back for her despite her frustration, despite the fact that Agatha was pulling away again both physically and emotionally, “Hey.”</p><p>“Tell Jimmy I said hello.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked up a little at the sides but she soon turned away, marching off to fetch her things and be ready for when Wanda deigned to leave.</p><p>Rio watched her go with a heavy heart. She threw herself back against the chair and stared up at the ceiling as she tried to rationalise the way her body wanted her to run after Agatha, to take her hand and drag her to her car, taking her home with her to her cosy apartment on the west side.</p><p>But she couldn’t. She had a job to do and she had to do it well.</p><p>And so she sat and waited until Abigail eventually appeared in the door to the den and looked at her expectantly.</p><p>“They’re gone. I’ve had a stressful day, sweetheart. Make me feel better?”</p>

<p>Ten orgasms (for Abigail), countless inane conversations about property expansion and this season’s Chanel collection, as well as one very uncomfortable conversation about Rio <em>not</em> speaking Spanish to the staff later and the weekend was finally over.</p><p>It was just after 6am when Rio placed a kiss to Abigail’s cheek and then slipped into the waiting car, thanking Brian as she did so.</p><p>Despite her desire to sleep, Rio eventually moved into the front passenger seat - Brian having stopped a mile down the road from the house to allow her to do so - and they spent the rest of the journey shooting the shit about Brian’s kids, Rio’s friends, and everything in between that wasn’t Abigail.</p><p>Exceptions had to be made for staff of her clients. They were never explicitly told who Rio really was but they weren’t stupid. And they saw everything. Besides, Rio usually felt most comfortable with these people. She was one of them after all.</p><p>Just before midday, Rio was dropped off near the subway station at Central Park West 104th and she made her way back home by herself, happily zoning out to the noise around her as she focused on getting home, getting showered, and into bed.</p><p>After arriving back at her apartment she took a hot, luxurious shower and then crawled into bed. Refreshed and cleansed of Abigail’s expensive soap she then changed to take herself for a run down the riverside parkway, stopping off on the way back to pick up a coffee.</p><p>It was then, as she was walking back, taking the scenic route with her iced latte, that her phone rang, with an unknown number flashing on the screen and interrupting her NPR podcast.</p><p>“Rio Vidal speaking.”</p><p>“Very formal, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha. Rio grinned into the phone but took a slow sip of her coffee to not give herself away, not be too eager.</p><p>“Well, when an unknown number pops up you never know who may be calling. You could have been the IRS.“</p><p>“Are you glad I’m not?”</p><p>“Unbelievably.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence as Rio continued her way through the park, her gaze settling on the water to her left as she tried to guess what Agatha might be looking at, what she might be doing, and how she’d settled on 4:15 to be the right time to call.</p><p>“I take it you’re home?”</p><p>“Just finished a run, actually. I got back to my apartment around midday.”</p><p>“A run? Making up for all the time you spent sleeping over the weekend?”</p><p>“Hey, I’ve had a lot of late nights lately. Mostly your fault.”</p><p>Agatha laughed at the other end of the line and Rio heard a soft murmuring in the background that suggested Agatha were out in public.</p><p>“Where are you?”</p><p>“I’ve just finished a business lunch. It ran on a little longer than I was expecting, or I’d have called sooner.”</p><p>“Just to check up on me?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little at the other end of the line and took another sip of her coffee, “So, Friday night. I have a couple places in mind but open to suggestions.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent for a few seconds and Rio wondered whether she’d gone off the idea entirely. But she soon responded, her voice dropping to a lower tone: “About that, I’ve already booked somewhere. It’s in the Village. I can get Jimmy to…”</p><p>But Rio cut her off, “I can get there myself, Agatha. But that sounds great. Assuming it’s the kind of restaurant I need to dress up for?”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, clearly having decided to drop the subject of Rio’s refusal to let her know where she lived. “You can wear what you want. It’s just a small place. Italian. I go there a lot.”</p><p>“Your go-to for dates?”</p><p>“Is this a date?”</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to pause now and she silently weighed up her options, unsure exactly what to call it. “I’d say it’s a pre-date.”</p><p>“Does this mean I have to work extra hard to get you to come home with me?”</p><p>“It’ll take more than a good bowl of pasta and a glass of wine, yes.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, the clear sound of a car door being opened in the background, “Then I’ll see what I can do.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Agatha.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s evening after that was spent lying on the couch, flicking through an old, well-thumbed and well-loved book, her thoughts really on Agatha, and just exactly what she’d say to her when Friday came around.</p><p>
<strong>TUESDAY</strong>
</p><p>6:03am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Good morning, Rio Vidal.</p><p>7:15am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Still asleep?</p><p>7:37am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: You should please see a doctor about how much you sleep. I can recommend a good one.</p><p>8:17am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Are you alive?</p><p>8:42am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Waking up at 8:40 when you don’t have to work is not unreasonable.</p><p>8:43am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: She lives!</p><p>8:46am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Has anyone ever told you what a menace you are?</p><p>8:52am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: What are you doing today?</p><p>9:14am<br/>
Rio Vidal: I have a class and then I’m meeting a friend for drinks. What are you doing?</p><p>9:40am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: A class? Who’s the friend? I have meetings all day. But if you’re free after your drinks you could come to mine for a nightcap.</p><p>10:11am<br/>
Rio Vidal: I teach basketball at the Y. A friend from college. And nice try.</p><p>11:30am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Aren’t you a little short for basketball?</p><p>1:05pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’m taller than you.</p><p>2:09pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Just.</p><p>3:48pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Every inch counts.</p><p>6:15pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I can show you a few tonight if you come over.</p><p>9:47pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: You can wait a few days.</p><p>9:49pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: So you will come home with me Friday?</p><p>10:13pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Shut up</p><p>10:14pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Get home safe</p><p>
<strong>WEDNESDAY</strong>
</p><p>The next morning Rio woke up with a hangover from hell. She felt as if she’d been run over by a truck. Twice.</p><p>She’d staggered home at around 3am, having been out in a dingy dive bar with her friend, Natasha, and had thrown herself onto her small couch, narrowly avoiding throwing up in the night.</p><p>As she clutched her head and went to check her phone she sighed as a black screen stares back at her. It had died. Staggering to her feet and shoving her phone on charge she then went stand for half an hour under a hot shower, hoping to wash away the pain of her head and the nauseating feeling in her stomach.</p><p>By the time she got out and had changed, her phone was nearly at 40% and she saw a string of messages from Agatha, along with one missed call. It was 2pm and the texts had started at 6am.</p><p>6:17am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’m assuming you won’t respond to this for a couple hours at least but could you let me know you’re alive?</p><p>7:47am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I have an hour free at 1pm if you wanted to grab lunch downtown. My treat.</p><p>10:26am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Asleep? Or dead?</p><p>1:08pm<br/>
Missed Call: Agatha Harkness</p><p>After reading through the messages and hovering her thumbs over the text input box on the chain, Rio decided instead to call Agatha.</p><p>Agatha picked up after two rings.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m sorry I didn’t respond I was-…”</p><p>“No,” Agatha cut her off quickly, her tone clipped, curt. “It’s fine. I’ll call you back later.”</p><p>And she put the phone down.</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, processing what had just happened. Agatha had been texting her all morning, even called her, to check she was alive and then? She frowned down at her phone, eyes scanning over the texts again to make sure she hadn’t missed anything, that she hand sent Agatha she should have when she was drunk. But, nothing.</p><p>Forcing herself to put her phone down for the rest of the day she attempted to win back the time she’d wasted being asleep on the couch. She tidied her apartment and went to the grocery store. She did her dishes and made dinner for herself. And finally, she poured a large glass of wine and ran herself a bath.</p><p>All the while keeping herself busy so she didn’t dwell on Agatha.</p><p>It was whilst she was in the bath, reading her book, that she heard her phone vibrate softly by the sink. She leant across, splashing water everywhere, to check it.</p><p>‘Agatha Harkness’ flashed across the screen.</p><p>She answered.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>There was silence on the other end of the line and Rio waited, unwilling to fill it.</p><p>“So you didn’t die?”</p><p>“I slept in. Late night. Too much vodka. What happened earlier? You cut me off.”</p><p>Another pause. And Rio heard the sound of liquid being poured into a glass. “I was in a meeting. I couldn’t talk.”</p><p>“Right. Well I’m fine. My phone died sometime in the night so I didn’t get your messages until I’d charged it a lot later.”</p><p>There was another long silence and Rio began to move the water around, brushing her fingers across the surface.</p><p>“Are you in the bath?”</p><p>“Yeah, figured it would be-…”</p><p>But there was a strange noise against her ear then. A familiar beeping. She pulled it back to look at the screen and almost rolled her eyes. Agatha was trying to FaceTime her.</p><p>She rejected it. And put the phone back to her ear again. “You’re trying to FaceTime me in the bath?”</p><p>“Why not? I’ve seen it all before. What’s the harm?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but roll her eyes this time but she laughed as she did. “I’m not FaceTiming you. I came in here for some peace and quiet.”</p><p>“That’s fine. I don’t need to say anything. I’ll just watch.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>.”</p><p>“It’s mostly bubbles anyway. Nothing exciting.”</p><p>“Bubbles move, you know.”</p><p>Rio hummed and pulled the phone away from her ear, swiping up on the screen to enter the camera app. She took a quick photo of a bath full of bubbles with her red-painted toes sticking out at the end and sent it to Agatha.</p><p>“See? Check your texts.”</p><p>There was a second of silence and then she heard Agatha’s voice again, “The least exciting bath pic I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>“Oh so you’re trying to make me jealous? Think that’ll work?”</p><p>“Is it?”</p><p>Rio paused for a second, thinking about how admitting that it was, just a tiny bit, might not work in her favour.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>There was a silence on the other side then as Agatha seemed to also be thinking her next move. “Well I should leave you to your bath.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>There was silence again, a little longer this time and Rio found her fingers gently toying with the water at her sides as she waited for Agatha to speak.</p><p>“I’ll call you tomorrow?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was quieter then, softer, like the sound of her voice when she woke Rio up in the mornings. So soft it made Rio ache for her.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>Rio hung up the phone and placed it on the side again, sloshing more water onto her tiled bathroom floor. She sat back in the bath and shimmied down a little until the water was just below her nose. But she no longer found it relaxing. She was no longer finding any calm in the warm, bubbly water.</p><p>She lay like that for a long while, until the bubbles had started to disappear and the water had cooled down to an uncomfortable degree. Her fingers continued to play lightly with the water at her sides, over her naval, by her thighs. And she made a decision. One fuelled by a desire to remain on Agatha’s mind, even with the self-imposed distance until Friday.</p><p>She reached for her phone, cursing as she sloshed more water and making a mental note to mop the water before bed or tomorrow morning would be miserable. She lay back again and adjusted herself so the few bubbles that were still there framed around her breasts and carved a trench down her stomach to just below her belly button where they met again. It was sexy. But not too much.</p><p>She took a photo and then sent it before she could second guess it.</p><p>Almost immediately after that she sloshed even more water over the floor in her hurry to get out, dry herself, and hurry to bed before she could look at the response from Agatha.</p><p>Sitting on her phone, waiting until morning was an immediate response.</p><p>10:17pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Apt. 7, 9 Jane Street.</p><p>
<strong>THURSDAY</strong>
</p><p>Rio woke this morning feeling like a million dollars. But mostly because she didn’t have a hangover.</p><p>And only partly because she’d seen Agatha’s text from the night before. Her thumb hovered over the little blue line that appeared across the street address, knowing that her phone would automatically take her to Maps and show her how long it would take to get her there. Which mode of transport was the fastest. Exactly how long it would take her to get to Agatha.</p><p>She clicked it.</p><p>A cab: 30 minutes. The A: 30 minutes.</p><p>It was tempting.</p><p>But it was also the morning after she’d sent the photo, and the morning after Agatha had so clearly asked her to come over.</p><p>So she put her phone away and went about her day, deciding to leave contacting Agatha until later. For now, she had a meeting with a potential new client to contend with. An older woman, a shy, later in life lesbian who’d had neither the courage to come out to anyone she knew nor the experience of being with a woman. Both, she hoped, Rio could help with.</p><p>So Rio soon left her apartment and made for the coffee shop downtown where she was to meet this woman and spent the next three hours having, for all intents and purposes, a very wholesome, fine time with her. She agreed to the booking, putting the woman in her books for five months time - the only space in her diary that would work for them both.</p><p>It was as she was walking home, heading up through the park that her phone began to vibrate in her bag.</p><p>“Agatha. I hope you didn’t wait up for me.”</p><p>“I was up late already. Your company would just have been a bonus. Tell me, am I to expect more of those pictures before our dinner tomorrow? I’m not sure I can take all this talk, no action.”</p><p>“Or in this case: show no touch?”</p><p>“You’re teasing me.”</p><p>“I would never.”</p><p>Agatha hummed on the other end of the line but dropped the subject as she heard muffled voices in the background and Agatha’s own name being called to her. “I need to go. But tomorrow. I’ll text you the address.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Agatha.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiled to herself as she locked her phone again and made the rest of the way home.</p><p>
<strong>FRIDAY</strong>
</p><p>The next morning Rio had another long lie, and again was greeted by early morning texts from Agatha.</p><p>5:47am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Sofrito, West Village. 8:30.</p><p>7:17am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: If you want, I can send Jimmy to get you from wherever you want. Alternatively, you can come to mine for a drink before we go.</p><p>8:42am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: We need to have a serious discussion about how much you sleep.</p><p>Rio’s alarm went off at 9:30 and that’s when she text Agatha back.</p><p>9:32am<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’ll meet you at the restaurant. No discussion needed about my sleep schedule. Looking forward to seeing you later x</p><p>Agatha didn’t text back after that.</p><p>Rio spent the rest of the day doing admin for work, filtering through the demand she had over the coming weeks and researching what clients might need.</p><p>At around 4:30 she was bored of work and her mind had drifted to the evening’s plans. Her dinner companion, in particular. She sat down at her little desk by the window and tapped her name into Google.</p><p>Unlike before when she’d googled Agatha, this time reams of articles came up that were less about Agatha and more about Tony Stark. ‘The Iron Man’, the man who had single-handedly revived the Iron and Steel industries in the mid-west. The man who had a once-popular, bipartisan Clean Water Bill.</p><p>She read through everything she could get her hands on, scanning every long read to find Agatha’s name. Always near Wanda’s. Always accompanied by a picture of them together, clearly when they’d still been together. When they’d been happy.</p><p>After over an hour of reading through, increasing the nauseating feeling in her stomach, she stumbled across a small article published in The Washington Insider, a tawdry gossip mag seemingly focused solely on the movements of Politicos: ‘The Hubris of Harkness’.</p><p>
<em>Unseen around The Capitol since her disastrous, but successful pincer movement to get her ex-wife, Wanda Maximoff (CEO of Maximoff Industries) to be the sole private sponsor of Senator Tony Stark’s (R-NY) ‘Clean Water Bill’ is the indefatigable Agatha Harkness laying low?</em>
</p><p>The introduction to the article was more than enough for Rio. She’d had enough. And she was feeling less ready and suddenly less sure about this dinner. Agatha had clearly been the puppet master of the devolution of the Bill. It, from what she’d read, looked completely destroyed. Done before it had even hit the Floor. Why had Agatha firebombed her whole career? Surely not for her. And if not for her then… for Wanda? She wanted to vomit.</p><p>But she was running out of time and needed to focus on her outfit more than her present state of mind. She settled, eventually, on an outfit that made her feel sexy and confident without looking like she was trying too hard. She went with a sheer black shirt with a black bra just visible beneath and a mini black and white skirt with matching heeled white sandals. She looked good. She looked like herself.</p><p>By the time Rio left her apartment she already knew she’d be late.</p><p>She arrived at the restaurant at 8:45, slightly out of breath from where she’d run from the nearest subway. The restaurant was a small, single-fronted place. The type of place you’d miss if you didn’t know it was there, or what it was. A simple sign scrawled above the door announced its name and the windows showed a view of a cozy, busy little trattoria that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a Tuscan town. Rio sucked in a deep breath as she took all this in and then released it as she pushed open the door, her eyes darting around to find a familiar set of blue eyes.</p><p>But before she could find them, a young boy of no older than 16 or 17 greeted her with a friendly smile.</p><p>“Buonasera, do you have a booking with us tonight?”</p><p>Rio smiled back and shook her head as her eyes darted around again, still unable to see Agatha. “No, I’m meeting someone. I’m a little late…”</p><p>“Ah,” the boy said, his eyes lighting up in recognition. “Signora Harkness.”</p><p>Rio looked back at the boy and nodded with a nervous smile, allowing him then to lead her deeper into the restaurant and to a little row of small booths opposite the open kitchen to their right. They stopped at one of the booths in the middle of the row of four and Rio’s breath caught in her chest.</p><p>Sitting looking up at her expectantly was Agatha. She wore a cream dress that hugged her upper half, and as she stood to greet Rio, she noticed a hint of thigh as the dress fell to float around toned legs.</p><p>“You’re late,” Agatha chided as she moved to press a kiss to Rio’s cheek, glancing at the young waiter with a tight smile and a nod before he left. Agatha’s hand had settled on Rio’s waist and she turned to hold her gaze then, her eyes questioning, she looked… nervous.</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip as she gazed back at Agatha, letting her own hand move to rest on Agatha’s at her waist, “I’m sorry. Time got away from me.”</p><p>“Not napping, I hope?”</p><p>“Not quite.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips as she pulled her hand away and sat down in her seat again, watching Rio closely as she took her own seat. Only then did she feel Agatha’s gaze rake down her body, checking out her outfit. But she didn’t say anything and Rio could feel the tension - thick, and unspoken - settle around them.</p><p>She brushed out her skirt slowly, taking time to decide how she might make Agatha feel at ease and was about to speak again when another waiter appeared at the side of the table and held out a bottle, “Signoras, Franciacorta,” he held the bottle to Agatha who surveyed it with a clinical eye and then nodded, “Perfect, Massimo. Thank you.”</p><p>The man nodded indulgently and then waved for the young waiter from before to bring across an ice bucket on a stand and place it by the table, following soon with two flutes. Massimo popped the bottle expertly and poured a small amount into the first flute, offering it to Agatha to taste. Agatha’s gaze fell to Rio and she gestured to her instead, causing Massimo to offer Rio the flute instead. Rio raised her brows at the gesture and accepted the glass with a smile. She sipped delicately on the drink, eyeing Agatha still as she did so and allowed the fizz to wrap around her tongue as Agatha settled back some more in her seat, meeting Rio’s gaze with a curious expression on her face.</p><p>“It’s delicious,” Rio said with a smile back at Massimo as he went to filled their glasses. “Thank you.”</p><p>As the man placed the bottle in the little bucket by the table he announced, “Saluti!” Before disappearing off back into the busier part of the restaurant.</p><p>Rio looked back up again as Agatha held her own glass across to her to cheers, but she remained silent as the glasses lightly tapped each other and Rio took another sip, feeling suddenly scrutinised by her silent companion.</p><p>“I <em>am</em> sorry I kept you waiting.”</p><p>Not expecting a response Agatha surprised her by saying quickly and quietly, “I thought you weren’t going to show.”</p><p>“Why would you think that?”</p><p>Agatha took another sip of her drink and dropped her gaze to the table before her, still pressed back against the high booth, “You were hard to find. I’m sure it wouldn’t be hard for you to hide.”</p><p>Rio frowned deeply then, racking her brain for anything she’d said or done recently that would lead Agatha to believe that she would leave her high and dry like that. When she came up with nothing she reached her hand out across the table and held it up to Agatha, wanting to take her hand, “Agatha, I asked to have dinner with you because I didn’t want either of us to be… <em>hiding</em> anymore. Because we have things to… discuss.”</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze on Rio’s face, ignoring the hand held out to her and toyed lightly with the stem of her glass as she took this in, still looking cautious, nervous.</p><p>Rio kept her hand out for a few seconds longer before slowly pulling it back and she sighed quietly, “I want us to be honest with each other.”</p><p>“Have I not been honest?”</p><p>“You’ve kept things from me.”</p><p>“Things you don’t need to know. Things that don’t matter.”</p><p>“Really? Because from where I’m sitting in the space between Wanda finding out you hired me and rocking up uninvited to Abigail’s dinner, you seem to have torpedoed your whole career.”</p><p>Agatha’s reaction was immediate. Her stoic features immediately hardened and her gaze, though previously distant and slightly cautious, now became sharp. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“I’m not an idiot, Agatha. Don’t treat me like one.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed then, and she sat forwards a little as Rio straightened her back, fighting to keep her face as neutral as possible as she felt the frustration begin to build within her. Her stubborn streak raising its ugly head.</p><p>Just as Agatha was about to respond Massimo appeared again, opening his mouth to ask… but Agatha had already dismissed him with a flick of her wrist, her gaze not leaving Rio’s for a second. The man only nodded, seemingly used to this behaviour and left as quickly as he’d arrived.</p><p>“Stark’s Bill was all smoke and mirrors. It wasn’t the end goal. He wasn’t interested in the follow through. It doesn’t matter. Washington and the press just need to catch up to that.”</p><p>Agatha’s words were soft, but there was a danger behind them, a sharpness to her tone that still told Rio she wanted the subject dropped, that she wasn’t interested in having this discussion at all.</p><p>“How could that be…?”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t let her finish and she held up a hand to silence Rio, who was so taken aback by this action that she actually did shut up.</p><p>“Enough. I’m finished with this conversation. Now if you could go back to being pleasant, we can finish our drinks and you can show yourself home, little Miss Honesty.”</p><p>Rio felt as if Agatha had slapped her in the face. She stared across at her, unable to say anything. Unable to quite put into words just how angry she was.</p><p>But Agatha had turned away and was busy pouring them both some more, Rio barely needing a top-up and Agatha having finished more than half her first glass. She then sat back against the booth, her gaze past Rio and into the restaurant, her free arm now draped in what looked a defensive position across her own lap.</p><p>Rio remained silent for a few seconds longer, weighing up what had just happened. How Agatha had shut her down. How she’d turned it around. How she’d accused her in calling her ‘little miss honesty’, of being equally as guilty of keeping things. She poked her tongue in her cheek and took a slow breath before she spoke again.</p><p>“Is it that I won’t tell you where I live? Is that it? Is that why you’re lashing out?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed loudly but she’d given herself away in this reaction and Rio tilted her head as she surveyed the woman before her. She was all poise and grace, all power and determination. But beneath that, she was a woman who several times now had tried to get closer to Rio, tried to reach for something that Rio kept private. That she wouldn’t tell her clients. But Agatha wasn’t a client anymore and Rio hadn’t treated her as such. Not since the weekend when lines became even more blurred, when Rio had realised the depths of her own feelings and risked it all to touch Agatha, to go to her at night, to have her close.</p><p>Agatha shifted ever so slightly in her seat and drank half a glass of her sparkling wine, keeping her gaze off of Rio as she spoke, her voice still sharp. “I don’t chase,” she said, blue eyes flickering over briefly to match Rio’s gaze. “I’m not interested in games.”</p><p>“I’m not playing any.”</p><p>“We both know that’s not true.”</p><p>Agatha turned fully then to meet Rio’s gaze. And Rio felt her heart thud heavily in her chest at the withering stare. “I’m not,” she insisted softly, refusing to look away from Agatha. “Otherwise I’d have left it at the weekend. Not contacted you again. Not be sitting <em>here</em>.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence then, Agatha’s features slowly settling back to something less than neutral but certainly not as stern. Rio took it as a good sign and continued on, keeping her voice as soft as she could manage, “Why are <em>you</em> here, Agatha? You knew I wanted to discuss… what’s been happening. Why did you come if you won’t agree to talk about it?”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze then, her eyes focusing somewhere between their hands, both around their own glasses. “I thought that much was clear.” Rio frowned, her fingers twitching where they sat around the glass and she kept her gaze on Agatha, suddenly wanting to reach out and force her to look back at her. Rio took a deep breath before saying: “You don’t need to let me down gently. I can take it.”</p><p>Agatha looked up then, her eyes alive with something Rio couldn’t name and her posture suddenly stiff, suddenly on edge. “<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>Rio felt her stomach flip at the intensity of Agatha’s gaze and she suddenly felt sick, as if the end was coming. And suddenly she wasn’t ready for it. She wasn’t ready for this to be over. For <em>whatever</em> this was to be over. She wanted Agatha however she could have her. She wanted… but before she could think of all the ways she wanted Agatha she felt a soft ankle brush at her calf and she blinked owlishly across at the woman who was now rubbing gently over her calf.</p><p>“This Stark stuff,” she started slowly, allowing the soft brush of Agatha’s ankle to ease her racing heart. “Did… did you do it for me?” It felt exposing. Mortifying. But she had to ask, had to know. “Or for Wanda?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed as she watched Rio, and she stopped the movement of her ankle against Rio’s, causing Rio to feel suddenly faint. “How could you ask that?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice had dropped to barely above a whisper and Rio sucked in a sharp breath, her gaze dropping to the glass in her hand. She lifted it and downed the golden liquid without a second’s thought before her hand reached for her bag on the table and she went to stand.</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>. I was protecting you. I wanted… I did it for <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flew back to Agatha’s, already halfway out her seat when Agatha reached across for her, mirroring Rio’s actions earlier and staring up at her with a deep frown, looking once again like she was nervous, cautious.</p><p>Rio looked between Agatha and the hand held out and slowly settled back in her seat, letting her hand rest against Agatha’s.</p><p>Before either of them could speak again, but just as their eyes met across their joint hands, Massimo appeared. “Signoras? Are we ready?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up at him with a death stare and spoke quickly, “The check please. And a bottle of that to go.” She motioned with her chin to the bottle in the bucket and then turned back to Rio, already dismissing the man.</p><p>Massimo nodded and hurried off to fulfil Agatha’s wishes, speaking rapid Italian to his fellow waiters.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, not allowing herself to relax into whatever truce or truth they’d found and raised her brows slightly, “What happened to dinner? Agatha, we still need to…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha cut Rio off again, but more gently this time. “But I can’t…” she trailed off and huffed softly as her fingers squeezed Rio’s, “Come back to mine?”</p><p>Rio’s frown deepened as she surveyed Agatha, wondering if Agatha were avoiding the issue again, and as soon as she got back to her place, she’d do something that’d make Rio forget herself, make her forget her own name, make her forget that she was a woman who didn’t beg, and make her one who did.</p><p>“Just to talk,” Agatha confirmed, as if reading Rio’s mind, “I promise.”</p><p>Rio relented, nodding slowly as the check arrived and Agatha pulled away to slide her card into the little booklet without even glancing at it. The booklet was whisked away and returned with a smile for Agatha to scrawl a loopy signature and they were done.</p><p>“The bottle is with your driver already, signora.”</p><p>Agatha nodded curtly and said a soft “thank you” as she stood and offered a hand to Rio, squeezing her fingers gently as Rio turned to leave and Agatha walked behind her with a hand resting purposefully on her lower back. Unnecessary, but welcome.</p>

<p>As they both stepped into the warm night air, Rio felt a shiver run down her spine that had nothing to do with the slight temperature change and everything to do with Agatha’s fingers tracing slowly up her spine.</p><p>She glanced behind her to see Agatha watching her closely, a slight hesitation in her eyes. Their gaze met and Rio felt the corners of her mouth twitch up just as a voice rang out over the still night, “Miss Harkness.”</p><p>Rio looked around to see a man standing in a black suit, tie a little loose around his collar and a knowing smile of his lips as he held open the door to a black Jaguar saloon car. She felt then a gentle pressure against her back guiding her towards the man who looked at her with a slight suspicion in his gaze. “Miss Vidal.” His tone was curt but polite as Rio gave him a kind smile and then slipped into the car and slid along the backseats, turning to watch Agatha slide in beside her.</p><p>“Don’t you live just…”</p><p>But she didn’t finish her thought as Agatha raised her brows at her, “Walk several blocks in these shoes? I don’t think so.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but was secretly grateful for Agatha’s choice as her own feet were pinching a little from where she’d ran the few blocks from the subway to the restaurant.</p><p>As Jimmy slipped into the driver’s side Agatha moved her hand to the middle seat, leaving it lying suspiciously closer to Rio’s side than her own but turning her head away to gaze out of the window. Rio didn’t need the hint. She reached down and entwined their fingers immediately, and felt her heart swell as Agatha’s thumb started to brush small circles over her own. They remained like this, in comfortable silence for once, until they pulled up in a tree-liked street and Jimmy had opened Agatha’s door for her.</p><p>Agatha stepped out gracefully and turned to offer Rio a hand, which she took and they remained like that as Agatha told Jimmy to go home and have a good night, accepting the bottle from the restaurant from him. Jimmy smiled at his boss and then gave Rio a slightly less genuine smile before he got back into the car. Rio arched a brow at this reaction but said nothing as she followed Agatha into the building.</p><p>From the lobby, and Rio had already noted that there wasn’t a doorman, the building seemed no fancier than her own. There wasn’t even a night guard to greet them as they moved through the bare lobby, past the cubby holes for post, and to the elevator. This was far from the opulent, luxurious building Rio had expected Agatha to live in - though she knew the price tag for this location would have been extortionate enough.</p><p>As they arrived in the elevator Agatha kept her hand in Rio’s and used the one holding the bottle to press for floor 4. It was only when the cranking of the mechanics started and the doors slowly closed that it hit Rio for the first time that she was about to see Agatha’s home. She knew better than anyone how sacred your own space was and for that reason she shifted closer to Agatha, her free hand moving to the other woman’s forearm as they moved up the floors. Agatha didn’t react to this more than gentling squeezing Rio’s hand and allowing her to step out first once they hit the fourth floor.</p><p>Opposite the elevator doors was a blank wall with two doors either end of the small corridor. Agatha gently tugged Rio to the one on the left and dropped her hand to reach into her bag and pull out her keys. As she held the door for Rio to step through, she glanced over at her and said: “Make yourself at home.”</p><p>As the door closed she felt an arm wrapping snuggly around her waist from behind and she let her gaze drift across plain pebble-coloured walls and the wooden parquet flooring before finally settling on the mirror that ran the length of the hall. There, as if it were a painting by one of the Italian Masters, was Rio, looking at herself and Agatha as she ducked her head in to press her face against Rio’s neck, breathing her in slowly. Rio’s eyes fluttered closed at the contact and she placed a steadying hand against Agatha’s, now splayed over her stomach. “Agatha. We can’t do that. We need to talk.”</p><p>But Agatha said nothing and raised her head to nuzzle against the hollow behind Rio’s ear, placing a gentle kiss there before she pulled back and took Rio’s hand again, pulling her into the first door on the left. “Get yourself comfortable. I’ll sort the drinks.”</p><p>She left Rio standing in a large room with high ceilings, a grand fireplace framed by two alcoves full of books and a large sofa, and two plush armchairs framing the space. Everything was neat and in order except for a coffee mug that had clearly been left since the morning, still containing the dregs of Agatha’s hurried caffeine fix.</p><p>As Rio moved around the couch to look up at one of the sets of shelves she let her fingers dance over the plush fabric, feeling the softness of the couch and absently wondering how many other women Agatha had taken home recently. But her thoughts were elsewhere as she spotted a small photo, framed in thin gold, nestled in front of some of the larger tomes on one of the shelves. The inhabitants of the picture were familiar to Rio. They were: Jen, Alice, and Agatha. They were much younger then, Rio would have guessed early twenties. And Agatha looked more carefree than she’d ever seen her. Alice was on her back, her arms splayed out like she was flying and Agatha was bending down, a wide grin on her face, clearly halfway to laughing. Jen stood beside them already doubled over with laughter. It was a happy picture. And Rio wondered if Agatha had ever been that happy since.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>She turned around and saw Agatha watching her carefully, holding two glasses and the bottle from the restaurant in an ice bucket. “Home is D.C. but… I’ve had this place for a while so, feels almost like home too.” Blue eyes darted around the room and Rio realised that Agatha was nervous again, unsure about what Rio might be thinking about the space, about her home.</p><p>Rio let her gaze wander around too and she started to take more details in, places where Agatha had adjusted the hard lines of what to the uninterested eye would be a relatively undecorated, minimalist room. But she saw Agatha in the details. There was a grey, but soft cashmere throw over the back of the sofa and a plaid throw over the back of the leather armchair that looked like a perfect place to nap, facing the large windows opposite. And the books told Rio everything she needed to know. There were political biographies, art books, books on architecture, and a smattering of well-loved penguin classics. There was a small wooden rabbit that looked hand-carved that sat on the mantle piece besides a Diptyque candle and there were note pads piled on the corner of a cabinet against the wall, evidence of Agatha’s overstocked mind.</p><p>Agatha had curated her home to look like she hadn’t curated it at all. But she was there. Rio saw her.</p><p>Brown eyes moved slowly back to the woman who hid in the details of the room around her and Rio yearned for her to just open up, to let her in properly, not just show herself in flashes.  “It feels very you,” she offered with a slight smile, moving back over to take a seat on the couch.</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze steadily on Rio for a while before she began to pour the sparkling wine, taking a seat just on the edge of the sofa at the opposite end to her guest.</p><p>“The picture with Jen and Alice? You can’t be more than 25. You look adorable. All of you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darted up to where the photo was and then moved back to Rio, “Alice made me put it up the last time she was here. Said a house is sad without any evidence of loved ones.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lower lip and thought of the array of photos haphazardly stuck to her fridge door of all the people she loved: her parents, her childhood dog, her best friend, her  basketball team. She had to agree with Alice.</p><p>“How are they? Jen and Alice? How’s the honeymoon?”</p><p>“Alice has been bugging me for your number, actually. Think she has a crush.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this, trying to detect if Agatha was being serious, whether there was any jealousy in her tone as she was handed a full glass. “She’s cute,” she offered, watching Agatha closely, “Are they open?”</p><p>Agatha almost dropped her own glass then, her eyes snapping up to Rio’s with a sudden look of surprise. “Open?”</p><p>Rio wriggled her brows and reached a hand to rest lightly on Agatha’s knee, almost bent fully over given the size of the couch, “I’m kidding. But I like Alice. You can give her my number if you want to.”</p><p>Agatha still didn’t look thrilled and moved her knee back from Rio’s hand, “And you said you didn’t play games.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and leant back from Agatha, watching her with a slight frown, “What do you want Agatha? Because I can’t keep… this hot and cold. You rush to my aid at Abigail’s, spend all weekend trying to get in my pants, actually <em>do</em> get in my pants and then this week you’ve been checking in and making sure I’m alive but… you won’t talk to me. You won’t even let me make a little joke about <em>your</em> friend when you were the one who said she had a crush.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze remained on Rio, watching her steadily with something like fury, her lips pursing slightly. Rio waited for the onslaught, waited for Agatha to shout or to kick her out. But it never came. Instead Agatha shifted in her seat and ran a hand through her hair to shake it out, giving her time to breathe, time to think before she responded. “You know what I want.”</p><p>Rio shook her head in disbelief, “I don’t. And I don’t think you do either.”</p><p>They stared at each other then, Rio refusing to back down and Agatha looking like she would rather be anywhere else than here. But slowly, as if Rio’s gaze were the key to unlocking something in her, Agatha spoke.</p><p>“Wanda isn’t well-liked. I built her up. I created her company, gave her a start. Her connections, the money she needed to get off the ground. And then she took it in another direction. She started dealing with… she funded wars, genocides. It was small at first, but her name got out there and people knew where to go. This all started to happen after I left her…”</p><p>Agatha paused for a second, her arm moving to rest against the back of the sofa but her gaze still on Rio, who was frowning across at her, unsure why Agatha had decided now to open up about the thing she’d been asking about for a week, “So when she asked me to get her in with Stark, on his Bill, I knew it would be impossible.”</p><p>“But you managed it?” Rio asked with a frown, now turned fully to look at Agatha, crossing her legs beneath her on the sofa.</p><p>“Yes, but I had to promise him something in return. We went round and round for days and…”</p><p>She sighed and bit down on her lower lip, watching Rio with a cautious expression. “He wants the Presidency. And I’m going to get it for him.”</p><p>Rio blinked then, unsure what she’d just heard, but sure of the absurdity of the statement. For one: Tony Stark was a billionaire, Republican, sexist pig. For another: how could Agatha promise that? How could Stark be so sure she could provide it that he’d tank his own bill?</p><p>“Okay…” Rio started slowly, unsure what question to ask next as she watched Agatha toy with the throw on the back of the couch, “But… he’s a republican. He’s… he’s a <em>bad</em> republican.”</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her wine then and dropped her gaze from Rio, focusing somewhere around her midriff, “It was that or letting her have you. I went for the lesser of the two evils.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing, couldn’t quite fathom exactly what was going on in Agatha’s head as she stared across at the woman who had left the safety and security of a Superpower potentially in the hands of a capitalist maniac rather than let Wanda have her way with Rio. It was insane.</p><p>“I can’t believe you did that. I can’t believe…”</p><p>But words failed her and she had to put her drink down for fear she’d end up spilling it everywhere, “But. But you couldn’t get him the Presidency. It’s not like…” she threw her hands, grasping at something, anything to make sense of this. “You can’t just snap your fingers and something will magically happen.”</p><p>“Can’t I?”</p><p>Agatha was looking back at her then, steady, self-assured, her fingers pausing their ministrations on the couch, “He’ll be president next November.”</p><p>Rio blinked across at Agatha, still not believing what she was hearing, completely taken aback by this astronomical promise, this surely impossible task. “So… he agreed to let Wanda in, pretty much tank his bill, in exchange for you… making him President?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio laughed then, a laugh of complete disbelief as she watched Agatha steadily gaze back at her. “Why didn’t…? Why didn’t you tell me. If I… Agatha, I’d have slept with her.”</p><p>But it was Agatha’s turn to look confused over at Rio, watching her with a slight furrow in her brow. “There’s no way I’d have allowed that.”</p><p>“It isn’t yours to allow.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed slightly but she remained where she was, still the picture of confidence. “Anyway. Wanda got what she wanted. And Stark, he’ll get his.”</p><p>Rio’s mind was reeling, completely out of her depth all of a sudden, and Agatha seemed to not want to throw her a rope, pull her to safety again. “You can’t do it. You cannot help that man.”</p><p>“It’s what I have to do.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said, more firmly this time, her indignation at the thought of this man becoming president vastly outweighing her desire to keep Agatha talking, to get more out of her. “No he’s a pig. His stance on immigration… Do you even understand what…”</p><p>But Agatha was moving then, shifting slowly to place her glass down and place herself directly in front of Rio. Her gaze dropped to Rio’s lap and she placed her hands cautiously, almost politely on her bare knees, “I can control that. I’ll be advising him. I’ll be in control. It won’t be as bad as you think.”</p><p>But Rio was shaking her head, her hand coming to rest on Agatha’s shoulder as she forced her to match her gaze again, “You cannot help this man to win.”</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly, her eyes scanning across Rio’s tense features and for a second Rio thought she was going to kiss her, to close the distance and shut her up. But she didn’t, she remained where she was, squeezing Rio’s knees gently, “I can and I will.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily then, her hand falling from Agatha’s shoulder and moving to her own lap as she said, “and if you can’t?”</p><p>“That’s not an option.”</p><p>“Agatha, what happens if he doesn’t win? There’s a real possibility that he won’t. The American public aren’t…”</p><p>“They’re idiots. They’ll take what they’re told and they’ll vote for him. I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>.”</p><p>Blue eyes locked onto Rio’s own and just for a brief second, for a glimmering moment of hope Rio thought that Agatha would relent, that she’d admit it was a stupid idea, the <em>stupidest</em> idea, and that it wouldn’t possibly work. But she didn’t, she said instead, very calmly, almost eerily so, “He will become president. I will make him president.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes then, letting Agatha’s words wash over her, feeling slow hands move their way up her thighs and slowly settle against her hips, tugging gently, pulling Rio closer to her. “Rio.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said just as softly as the sighed name from Agatha’s lips, her eyes opening and her hands moving to the base of Agatha’s neck. “I can’t believe you’d do this. If you had spoken to me first. If you had let me…”</p><p>“There’s no way in hell I’d have allowed <em>her</em> to touch…”</p><p>“And that is not your decision to make.”</p><p>“It <em>should</em> be. It <em>should</em> be my decision. I want…” but Agatha trailed off as she met Rio’s gaze, having been looking down at Rio’s navel as she continued to try and pull her closer.</p><p>“I want you to be <em>mine</em>. <em>That</em> is what I want.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat then and she frowned across at Agatha, her mind somewhere outside of her body, her body screaming at her to let Agatha pull her closer to hold her, and her mind telling her to run.</p><p>“It’s not that simple, and you know it.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze fell again but this time she adjusted her position on the couch, crouching down before Rio, her hands moving to uncross Rio’s legs, focusing on the task at hand as Rio spoke again. “You’re not the kind of woman who could… who could date someone like me, Agatha. Not with the work I do.”</p><p>But Agatha was still pulling at Rio, the younger woman now allowing her to do so, and slowly, she inched into Agatha’s lap, her arms resting over her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze was soft but distant, having relaxed a little now Rio was closer, wrapped around her, and she looked to Rio like she couldn’t make up her mind about what she wanted to say, how she wanted to convince Rio that she <em>could</em> be with someone like her. Like she could set aside her jealousy and make it work.</p><p>“I have enough money,” Agatha started slowly but Rio was already shaking her head, “that you don’t need to take on any more…” but Rio had stopped her, placing a hand on Agatha’s chest, “You know I’d never allow that. I’m good at what I do and for the most part… for the most part I enjoy it.”</p><p>“Even with Abigail?” Agatha’s question came out more harshly than Rio was anticipating and she moved back an inch or so, looking cautiously at the woman who was holding her in place.</p><p>“No. Not with Abigail.”</p><p>Rio moved then, pulling back and away from Agatha to stand up from the couch entirely, turning her back on the blue-eyed woman to gather her thoughts. “This is too messy. I can’t keep…”</p><p>But Agatha had moved up too, was standing at Rio’s side and gently turning her, “I’m trying,” she said softly, “trying to… but every second you’re not with me I imagine her hands on you. Anyone’s hands on you. People I don’t know, people I’ve never met. People I…”</p><p>And Rio kissed her. She leant in and pressed her lips firmly, confidently against Agatha’s, feeling the other woman hesitate for just a second before she kissed her back. Agatha’s hands found her waist again and her own hands moved to bury in Agatha’s hair. As their tongues met, Rio felt the kiss change, felt Agatha moan against her and pull her closer. But she pulled away before it got too heated, before she could lose herself completely.</p><p>“I want…” Rio panted softly, ignoring Agatha as she moved back in to try and capture her lips again and instead resting their foreheads together. “I want you to tell Stark you can’t. To tell Wanda...”</p><p>Agatha’s hands twitched at her waist, tightening as she turned them and moved backwards, falling onto the couch again and attempting to pull Rio with her. But Rio refused, pulling back so she could remain standing and so that Agatha’s hands fell from her body.</p><p>“What you did with Stark… you shouldn’t have done it. Agatha, I want you to take it back. Tell him you can’t do it.”</p><p>Agatha shifted closer to the edge of the couch, reaching for Rio and capturing her hand, trying to get her closer again, apparently not listening to what she was saying. “Come here.”</p><p>Rio shook her head but allowed herself to move to stand between Agatha’s legs, gazing down at her with a deep frown as Agatha’s hands moved up the backs of her thighs, “we need to discuss this.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly, her hands moving with determination now, slipping below Rio’s skirt as she pulled her closer, “I’m not sure there’s much more to discuss.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio sighed, releasing a slight noise of surprise as Agatha’s hands found and squeezed her ass, causing the other woman to grin up at her. “You’re doing an unbelievably stupid thing and I…”</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t listening and was now pressing kisses above the waistband of Rio’s skirt, purposefully trying to distract her from whatever she was about to say. Rio groaned quietly, her hands moving to Agatha’s face to push her back so she could meet her gaze, “What are you doing?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and smirked a little as one hand moved down from Rio’s ass to brush her fingers along Rio’s centre. “No, no,” she chided quietly, “Keep talking. I’m listening. I’m also just… admiring your pretty outfit.”</p><p>Rio licked her lips slowly, just about preventing herself from rocking against Agatha’s exploring fingers as she continued to gaze down at her, “If you don’t back out of this deal with Stark, I’ll…”</p><p>“What will you do?” Agatha asked innocently as she delicately pulled Rio’s panties aside and finally, gloriously began to dance her fingers against Rio’s soaked cunt, swirling just one over her entrance.</p><p>Rio’s hips betrayed her then and she had to clamp down on her lower lip to stop herself from moaning. “You can’t, can’t get out of this by fucking me.”</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha drawled with a grin, “I’m pretty sure I can make you forget your own name.”</p><p>Rio had to bite harder on her lip then as Agatha pressed her index finger slowly inside of her, twisting her hand so her thumb could come to rest against her clit, applying pressure but not moving.</p><p>“But continue, please. Tell me what you want me to say to Stark.”</p><p>Rio groaned in frustration, her hips continuing to betray her as she stared down at Agatha, refusing to look away or give in. “I… I want…” but Agatha knew what she wanted and pressed another finger slowly inside of her, beginning to pump slowly in and out as her thumb began to trace slow circles around the tiny bundle of nerves.</p><p>“You want…?”</p><p>Groaning and scowling down at Agatha, Rio continued to try and keep her thoughts on the task at hand. “I want you to tell him to… go fuck himself.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Tell him,” Rio gritted out, “Tell him… he can’t have you.”</p><p>“Have me?”</p><p>Rio nodded furiously and was rewarded with a third finger and Agatha’s free hand clenching around her ass, “Have me how?”</p><p>“At all… with him… helping him…”</p><p>Agatha chuckled darkly, keeping her gaze up on Rio as she tightened the circles against her clit, curling her fingers in slightly and feeling her walls clench around her, “What if I don’t want to tell him that?”</p><p>Rio groaned loudly all of a second, her posture relaxing slightly, her hips now bucking more into Agatha’s hand, “Fuck… Agatha… you’ll fuck… tell him or…” but her words died on her tongue as she came, a loud moan emanating from her lips as she bucked against Agatha’s hand, the woman now increasing her thrusts without relenting, watching in awe as Rio came undone above her.</p><p>“Fuck me, fuck me,” Rio breathed, panting slowly as she regained some of her mental faculties and glared down at Agatha who smirked back. “One orgasm will not throw me off… I can still hold firm on the fact that…” but Agatha was slowly pulling her fingers from Rio, causing Rio to groan a little and her hips to twitch.</p><p>“Who said we’d stop at one?”</p><p>She raised her fingers to her mouth then and sucked them slowly, keeping her gaze on Rio the whole time, even as Rio carefully lowered herself to straddle Agatha’s waist. Rio captured her lips then, kissing her slowly, languidly, not allowing Agatha to take control and instead revelling in tasting herself on Agatha’s tongue, moving her hands to skim over Agatha’s breasts before tangling in her hair. She pulled back only to take a deep breath and said, with a slightly less foggy mind, “I can’t let you help him. It’s non-negotiable.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly and considered Rio for a second, her own chest heaving slightly as she caught her breath from the kiss, “I told you. He’ll be my puppet. It won’t be what you think it’ll be.”</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly, a slow ache between her thighs begging her to drop the subject and get Agatha to do again what she’d just done, get her to do more, give more. But she fought it and moved her hands down to her own thighs, “I can’t stand by and watch you support him when I <em>know</em> there’ll be a way you can get out of it. When you could use your influence…”</p><p>But Agatha had placed her hand over Rio’s mouth and her free hand had moved up to begin undoing the buttons along Rio’s shirt, “Stop.” The instruction was gentle but firm as she gazed up at Rio, “I know you don’t agree but it’s what I’m doing. It’s what I have to do.”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly and licked at Agatha’s hand to get her to remove it but Agatha just smirked as she kept it there, “Don’t tempt me to use your mouth the way I used it at the pool, honey.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and moved Agatha’s hand away, shifting slightly now her shirt hung open, “We’re not done talking.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little, softer than before and reached to brush some hair from Rio’s face, “Okay. This is an issue for you. I get that. But there’s nothing I can do. Similar,” she relented slightly, looking a little pained as she continued, “similar to my having to share you with… with other people.”</p><p>Rio frowned deeply at this, unable in the moment to express to Agatha that just because she was with other people, fucking them, letting them fuck her, it didn’t mean she was shared. Her professional life and her personal life, they were two separate things. But Agatha would never see it that way, and she knew enough to not try to argue the point.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said, frowning deeply as she did so and not entirely sure they were any further than they had been an hour or so ago.</p><p>Agatha bit the corner of her lip and moved a hand up to cup Rio’s cheek, brushing her thumb over her cheekbone, “Are we done now?”</p><p>“I’m not sure we’re further along than we were before,” Rio admitted with a raised brow, watching Agatha’s face fall slightly.</p><p>“Can’t we agree to disagree on a couple things but otherwise agree that taking our clothes off is the best next step?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at this, briefly feeling some relief in her tense mind, and glanced down at herself, her exposed bra, “I think you were already working on that before we agreed.”</p><p>“Well, I could practically see it anyway… isn’t much different to how it was.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes then and moved her hands to cover her breasts, raising her brows at Agatha, “You cannot fuck me into submission.”</p><p>“Is that a challenge, Vidal?”</p><p>Rio fought the smirk that threatened to grace her lips then and straightened her back a little, “We need to establish some things first.”</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to roll her eyes then as she moved her hands up to pry Rio’s hands away and sighed, leaning in to place one soft kiss to the mound of a Rio’s left breast above her bra. “More rules. Oh good.”</p><p>“Not <em>rules</em>, an agreement. I want to keep seeing you. I want to have you in my life. And I know…” she slumped a little, her gaze softening, “I know what I do is hard for you. And I’m not planning on changing it any time soon but… are you willing to work around it? Try to find some way in which we can maybe… maybe make this work?”</p><p>Agatha’s hands had moved during Rio’s little speech to settle against Rio’s hips and she held her there loosely, her gaze slightly suspicious as she took Rio in, unsure of herself as she spoke. “Will you tell me who you’re with? What they… want they want from you? Where you are?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said gently, “No I can’t do that.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her eyes then, her jaw tightening as she stared down at Rio’s skirt. Rio sighed heavily and went to place her fingers under Agatha’s chin, raising her gaze up, “That’s not how this works. You just need to trust me.”</p><p>“I trust you I just don’t trust <em>them</em>.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip slowly, recognising that she might need to give a little on this one, just slightly. “Okay, I’ll tell you where I am. But not who I’m with or what we’re doing.”</p><p>Agatha glared up at Rio, not really at her, but through her, her voice dropping slightly, “Fine. But I want to know about Abigail. She wouldn’t let you have a phone. What else… how did she want you?”</p><p>Rio shook her head and moved a soothing hand to brush through Agatha’s hair, toying with the ends as she spoke. “I’m not telling you that.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head a little, beseeching Rio as she squeezed her hips, pulling her just that little bit closer, “Was she inside you the morning after?” She didn’t need to clarify what she meant, Rio knew she was asking if Abigail had fucked her just hours after Agatha had. If she’d enjoyed it as much. If she’d wanted it.</p><p>She sighed quietly and shook her head, “No.”</p><p>Agatha frowned then, “I don’t believe you. Wanda said… and if she’s paying…”</p><p>But it was Rio who placed her hand over Agatha’s mouth this time and she held it there, firmer than Agatha had been earlier. “I’ll tell you, just this once. But you cannot ask me about any other client. Okay? Abigail doesn’t touch me. She never has. It’s been over three years of working with her and not once has she been inside of me. She wants me on her. She likes it slow, gentle, and likes to be built up. But she’s never touched me. Only the occasional drunken grope. I charge her extra when she does that but it’s never more than grabbing hands. So, no, she wasn’t inside me after you were.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes had gone wide as Rio spoke, her breath hot and wet against Rio’s palm and her hands now in a vicelike grip at her hips. When Rio moved her hand away Agatha took a second before she spoke, her voice hoarse with the effort it took to try and keep her tone even. “Gentle?” She almost spat the word, almost, “She makes you get down on your knees for her and she doesn’t have the <em>decency</em> to get it over with quickly?”</p><p>Rio frowned, knowing that this reaction was her own fault, that she had these rules for a reason and once again Agatha had somehow convinced her to drop them. “You cannot react like that. You know that everyone…”</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t listening, wasn’t interested in whatever diatribe Rio was about to go on about sexual preferences or kink shaming or not judging what someone wants in the bedroom. Instead she was moving her hands down to push up Rio’s skirt, forcing the tight fabric up to sit at her hips and making Rio squirm in the meantime.</p><p>“Hey, hey,” Rio protested, moving her hands down to grasp Agatha’s as she clenched the skirt, still tugging at it, “I shouldn’t have told you.”</p><p>Agatha paused and closed her eyes, “No I needed to know. I needed to know that she…” but her eyes snapped open as Rio leant in to kiss her and she relaxed slightly, her arms snaking around Rio’s waist again.</p><p>“I need you.”</p><p>And Rio nodded at this, knowing that she needed Agatha too. Possibly more than Agatha needed her, definitely more than she would care to admit right now. “You have me,” she whispered softly, her fingers trailing a line down from Agatha’s cheek to her lips and watching as Agatha parted them to allow her to press in and press down on her tongue. Agatha sucked her fingers slowly, maintaining eye contact as she arms moved back and she began to slowly turn them and dropping her fingers from her mouth she lay Rio down and placed hot, wet kisses to her collarbones.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned, her mind sinking into that delicious numbness that only Agatha could elicit when she had her mouth on her, but she fought against it, trying to get her point across just as she felt herself on the brink. But Agatha wasn’t listening, her teeth were now scraping along Rio’s collarbone and with no explicit instruction not to she quickly nipped at Rio’s pulse point as her hands began to scramble to begin tugging at her panties to get them off.</p><p>“A-Agatha,” Rio warned again, louder this time as she attempted to push the woman’s head away and gazed down into dilated pupils. “Bedroom. Now.”</p>

<p>If Rio had any neurons firing that weren’t screaming just Agatha as they scrambled to the bedroom, all hands and teeth, lips and tongues, then Rio might have been surprised that they made it there in one piece, she also may have been surprised that they were doing this in the first place.</p><p>Agatha had landed first, Rio having pushed her  down before climbing on top of her. Her lips were swollen from where Agatha had been biting at them, and she already had angry red marks smattered over her throat and chest as well as a few scratch marks down her sides, but she wanted more. She wanted Agatha to scream her name.</p><p>As she moved down Agatha’s body, she left a trail of nips and sucks until she got to where she desperately wanted to be.</p><p>“Rio, fuck…”</p><p>Rio sank down to her knees on the floor and wrapped strong arms around Agatha’s thighs, pulling her down the bed towards her.</p><p>Rio didn’t want to be gentle with Agatha. She had enough of gentle and the subconscious comparison of Agatha to Abigail was enough to make her want to devour the complicated, confusing, captivating woman splayed out in front of her.</p><p>Agatha’s dress was up at her waist and Rio’s deft fingers pushed the white lace panties aside to lick a long thick strip through her soaked centre and hummed in delight as Agatha’s hands flew to her hair and held her firmly against her.</p><p>Rio worked her tongue against and inside Agatha like she were the first meal she’d had in weeks. Agatha’s moans settled deep in her lower abdomen and she had to clamp her fingers harshly around milky thighs to prevent herself from reaching down and giving herself some relief.</p><p>When Agatha came she came with a shout of Rio’s name, apparently having no qualms about bothering the neighbours.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop though, she kept her tongue swirling around Agatha’s clit and pushed two fingers inside of her, curling them in just the way she knew would drive Agatha to another orgasm. Agatha was erratic under her, her body convulsing with the power of her first orgasm and now building to her next. She wrapped her legs around Rio now she had some freedom of movement and came with another scream against her mouth not minutes later.</p><p>“F-fuck,” Rio slowed her movements down, unwilling to pull back entirely as she began to lap slowly at Agatha, cleaning her up and moaning at the taste of her.</p><p>Agatha sat up slowly, her chest heaving as she leant on her elbows and she gazed down at Rio like she was something to be cherished. “Honey,” she said breathlessly as brown eyes opened and looked up at Agatha’s, now making slow, deliberate licks against her clit as she gazed up at her, “come up here and let me fuck you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She pulled away slowly, pressing soft kisses against Agatha’s inner thighs before she climbed back on top of the woman again. She was eager. Too eager. But she didn’t care that Agatha knew it. She <em>wanted</em> Agatha to know.</p><p>Just as Rio was leaning in to kiss Agatha, her world span as the woman beneath her flipped them over, now frantically trying to rip Rio’s shirt off properly, making her arch her back as she reached around to undo her bra strap, and falling back down her body as she aggressively ripped her skirt off.</p><p>“Do you have to be anywhere tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio frowned at the question, lifting her hips so Agatha could pull her panties down.</p><p>“No, no, nowhere.”</p><p>Humming in acknowledgement Agatha then began pressing sloppy kisses to Rio’s hip bone, groaning as Rio tried to press herself up and into Agatha, desperate for some sort of relief.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t say anything else and without warning she peeled away from Rio’s wanting body and stripped herself of her dress. Rio took the opportunity to take the view in, her mind empty of any thoughts but of toned arms, soft abs and the scattered freckles that painted Agatha’s torso. Her mouth felt suddenly dry and she wanted to taste every inch of the woman’s skin, let her tongue swirl over pink, pert nipples and let her hands caress across the flushed skin of Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Agatha, come back here,” she whined petulantly as Agatha kicked her dress to the side and moved away from the bed.</p><p>“Are you gonna beg for me again?”</p><p>“You know I won’t.”</p><p>“Lucky for you I won’t make you tonight.”</p><p>Rio groaned at this, scrambling up to sit properly against the headboard and watch as Agatha went to a drawer to pull out her strap. It was the same midnight blue one that Agatha had used on her before and Rio felt a rush of desire flow through her, knowing exactly what the woman was capable of with it.</p><p>Agatha slipped it on and made her way back to the bed, her gaze dark as she took Rio in. “Turn over. I want to take you from behind.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly but did as she was told, moving to rest up on all fours and present herself to Agatha. Just as she had found her balance she felt a hot tongue run through her and hands holding her open, readying Rio for what was to come. She shook slightly at the thought of it, as the anticipation built and she heard a spitting sound before Agatha aligned herself at her entrance and slowly, deliciously entered her.</p><p>Rio released a low groan and saw stars as Agatha bottomed out, her walls clenching around the thick length and her body rocking back slightly to feel as much of the woman as she could.</p><p>“Did you miss this?” Agatha husked, “Miss my cock in you?”</p><p>Rio just whined and began to move slowly, trying to get some friction. But Agatha had a hold of her hips and held her back, keeping her still. “No no this isn’t for you. Not right now.”</p><p>Her hand came down harshly and skimmed Rio’s ass which made her jump and squeak in surprise, her thighs pushing against Agatha’s hold to try and open herself up more, get as much from Agatha as she could.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, leaning over Rio and scraping her nails down Rio’s back until she could grip her ass again, keeping her hips pressed firmly against her. “I’m just enjoying the view.”</p><p>Rio groaned and turned her head as best she could to look over her shoulder at the woman, scowling now. “Next time I’m wearing the strap and <em>you</em> are going to suffer.”</p><p>Agatha quirked a brow at this and experimentally reached around to begin rubbing soft circles over Rio’s clit, “You’re threatening me? That doesn’t sound like a good way to get what you want.”</p><p>With that she pulled back, pulling out of Rio almost fully and then snapping her hips back to enter her again. Rio was almost thrown off balance at the sudden movement and sunk to her forearms, her body betraying her as she moaned into each thrust of Agatha’s hips. Agatha dug her nails into Rio’s hips, thrusting into her with a violent desperation, and Rio was hopeless beneath her, her moans now coming out in almost broken sobs as Agatha kept up her relentless pace.</p><p>Rio came undone with a muffled moan of Agatha’s name as her face pressed down into the pillow and her hands clenched at the sheets. Only then did Agatha begin to slow down, easing Rio as she released her hold on her and brushed lightly against her clit. “Fuck you take me so fucking well,” she breathed softly, leaning back over Rio, still buried deep within her, to trail slow kisses along her shoulder blades and down her back.</p><p>Rio groaned quietly and lifted her head, turning over her shoulder to watch Agatha as she pulled back fully to watch her strap slip fully out of her. Rio shifted then, letting her hips sink fully into the bed and her legs splay out around Agatha, feeling the loss of her and groaning at the ache. “I’m not sure I can take anymore,” she mumbled as Agatha moved over her again, this time kissing up her body and brushing her hand soothingly over Rio’s side. She hummed against her shoulder and pressed the soaked strap against her ass, “Please, baby… I’ll go slow.”</p><p>Rio huffed a little and turned her head to see Agatha, watching her as blue eyes began to travel the length of her body as Rio turned over to face her fully. Agatha looked hungry still, her hand trailing down to between Rio’s legs and pushing two fingers gently into her to test her reaction. Rio hissed quietly and arched into Agatha a little, leaning in to press a soft kiss to the corner of her lips, “Are you trying to break me?”</p><p>Laughing into the kiss Agatha shook her head and slowly pulled out of Rio again, her gaze now settling on Rio’s face, “<em>Never</em>.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and shuffled a little to press herself closer to Agatha, lifting her leg to wrap around her hips and huffing softly as the strap just nudged at her core. Agatha’s gaze softened at the move and she reached to rub over Rio’s thigh, her lips twitching up into a satisfied smile. They remained like that for a few more seconds before Rio closed the distance between them again and they kissed slowly, letting their tongues swirl languidly together as if they had all the time in the world.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha’s hand moved from Rio’s hip to begin positioning her strap against her, and feeling the younger woman moan at the sudden pressure against her core she began to press herself cautiously into her entrance. Rio pulled back and groaned, her eyes fluttering closed as she adjusted, the gentle ache hitting her somewhere in her lower abdomen as she did.</p><p>“It’s okay, baby,” Agatha murmured softly, all heated desire and forcefulness from before gone as she watched Rio’s reaction closely. “I‘ve got you.”</p><p>She pressed in until she was almost bottoming out and didn’t move again for a while until she began a slow, steady rhythm of rocking her hips up to fuck Rio gently, building her up in the gentlest way possible as her hand slipped between them and she rubbed at Rio’s clit.</p><p>Rio’s eyes had opened and she almost shivered at the look that met her as she caught Agatha’s gaze. It was soft, loving, and more gentle than she’d ever seen Agatha look before. They remained that way, Agatha treating Rio as if she were something that <em>could</em> be broken, until Rio came with a cry and shuddered as her walls clenched around the strap.</p><p>Agatha smiled at her lazily, watching Rio’s face twitch as she came down from her high and leaning in to place soothing kisses along her cheeks and down to her lips. When she eventually pulled out Rio whined and reached back for Agatha who had shifted away to remove the harness.</p><p>With her back to her as she sat on the edge of the bed and lightly kicked the toy away Agatha said, “Will you stay?”</p><p>Rio frowned a little as she sat up on her elbow, her stomach dropping as she watched Agatha’s tired muscles stretch and her hair fall in messy waves around her. “Do you not want me to?”</p><p>“No. I do I just,” Agatha turned then, frowning a little as she did. “I was just checking.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and held her hand out to pull Agatha back down with her. As soon as she was back in the bed Rio wrapped her leg back over her hip and pressed against her again, “Will you let me sleep in though? If not I might need to leave now. Get my full 9 hours.”</p><p>Laughing, Agatha wrapped her free arm tightly around Rio’s waist and shivered as Rio’s hand brushed along her spine, “I suppose I can allow that.”</p><p>Rio smirked as she moved a hand to trace her fingers along Agatha’s jaw, her eyes dropping to the hickey beginning to bloom on Agatha’s neck. “I’m assuming I’ll be covered in bruises by morning?”</p><p>“If I did my job right,” Agatha grinned, dipping her head to press her face into Rio’s neck. “I had free rein this time… took advantage…”</p><p>Rio hummed and closed her eyes as she felt Agatha kissing her neck, moving down to her breasts and trailing her hands down her body again as she was turned onto her back. She looked up again and saw Agatha looking down at her, “Do you want anything?” Her hand found Rio’s hip and she traced small circles there.</p><p>“No. I’m just tired.”</p><p>Agatha nodded then and moved to pull up the blanket from the end of the bed and settled back down beside Rio, wrapping herself around her and pressing into her neck again. Rio sighed happily and lightly toyed with Agatha’s hair as she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>The next morning Rio woke slowly as the sun streamed in through the large windows of Agatha’s bedroom. Something like, but not quite, regret, filled her chest and she huffed quietly as she blinked into the brightening room and moved to shield her eyes, only to be met with a soft grunt from the body beside her and a light squeeze around her middle at her sudden shift in body weight.</p><p>She looked around at Agatha Harkness, all hardlines and control, now curled around Rio and pressed snugly against her, her chest rising and falling slowly with her sleep-heavy breathing. Rio marvelled at the sight for a while, having not been granted this view before or the feel of Agatha as she slept. Her fingers danced tenderly over freckled biceps and she settled down a little more against the pillows as time stood still and Agatha held onto her.</p><p>It wasn’t until a couple hours later that Rio woke again, her eyes squinting into the now fully light room and her muscles sore from the previous night’s activities. She stretched experimentally, and rolled away as gently as she could from the woman still clinging to her in her sleep. Having made it to the edge of her bed without disturbing Agatha, Rio took a mental review of her body. She could already see a smattering of bruises blooming on her inner thighs, her hips, her chest and stomach, and one random one on her left bicep. Between her legs she felt achey, but not too uncomfortably so, and her mouth was dry, her hair a complete mess. She was tired though, a threatening, creeping sense of dread had settled somewhere in the back of her mind that she couldn’t quite put her finger on but couldn’t quite shake.</p><p>She pushed off from the bed and went to a nearby cabinet to rummage through for something to cover herself. She settled on an oversized Yale tshirt and traipsed through to the kitchen to seek a glass of water.</p><p>Agatha’s kitchen was neat and compact, a galley space with white shaker cupboard doors and not much in the way of mess or additional gadgets on the countertops. In looking for a glass Rio hadn’t even discovered any slogan mugs or embarrassing crockery. But she wasn’t much of a mind to snoop any more as she turned to chug her water, sloshing some onto the floor when she heard a voice behind her.</p><p>“This is significantly earlier than I was expecting you up.”</p><p>Rio turned to see Agatha draped in a silk floral robe, leaning up against the door frame with a teasing smile on her face. “I was thirsty. But I will be going back to bed. Took me a while to get out actually, you were being quite clingy.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, but her cheeks tinged a little pink as she moved over to Rio to tug at her tshirt, “And you have been rummaging through my drawers?”</p><p>“Is that a euphemism?”</p><p>Agatha ignored this comment and tugged a little more on Rio’s tshirt to pull her closer, “I like you in my clothes.” The comment was light, but Rio caught a hint of something in Agatha’s eyes as she said it, a jealous glint. She moved closer and allowed Agatha to wrap her arms around her waist, leaning into her touch. “Come back to bed?”</p><p>Rio nodded and took her water with her as she followed Agatha back to the large bed. She was pulled until she fell down and rolled onto her back with the older woman hovering over her. “Maybe there are benefits to waking up early.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and kissed Rio, lowering her body weight gently onto her, “Stay for the day? I have some work to do later but I can make you dinner?”</p><p>Rio nodded and cupped Agatha’s cheek gently, her gaze suddenly serious, “I want to talk again, though. About… this.”</p><p>Agatha dipped her head and Rio thought she was about to pull away entirely but instead she  cleared her throat a little and placed a kiss to Rio’s temple. “Okay..”</p><p>“Let’s… let’s see how today goes?”</p><p>Rio bit on her lower lip as she surveyed Agatha, watching a slight frown appear on her face and raising her thumb to brush over the furrow between her brows.</p><p>“Agatha, there are things…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha interrupted softly, rolling off of Rio then to lay beside her and drape her arm across her stomach. Rio sighed and turned over to face away from Agatha, pressing back into her and tightening the woman’s arm around her securely.</p><p>Rio fell asleep again not long after that, comfortable in Agatha’s firm hold and warm under her plush blankets.</p><p>When she woke a couple hours later, Agatha was no longer with her. She groaned and stretched out, easing the tension in her tired body before she slipped from the bed and padded through to find Agatha. She found her in a small room opposite the bedroom, sitting behind a large oak desk and staring intently at a laptop with a pair of glasses perched on the end of her nose.</p><p>“Where’s this sexy librarian look been this whole time?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up and quirked a brow across at Rio, “Do you know what time it is?” Rio looked around as if the answer would be in the room, but she saw no clock and instead another wall full of books and not much else. “Morning time?” She tried with a smirk as she moved around to perch on the edge of the desk. “Just,” Agatha responded with a grin, turning her chair to face Rio. She went to remove her glasses but Rio reached out to stop her, “Leave them on. You look hot.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but her smile gave her away as she went to pull Rio down into her lap, pawing at her thighs as she did so. “You’re very distracting. I have work to do.” Rio just shrugged and kissed Agatha’s nose, causing the woman beneath her to scrunch it and not look at all please. “Well I’ll go and grab us some breakfast and leave you to it.”</p><p>Agatha huffed but allowed Rio to slide back off her lap. “Wait.” She reached out again and tugged Rio’s tshirt up, until it was just below her breasts and Agatha’s free hand moved to trace gently over Rio’s naked form, focusing particularly on the marks she’d left there from the night before. “Hot,” she grinned, her eyes sparkling as she looked up to Rio’s gaze, “But not nearly as many as I meant to leave.”</p><p>“Unbelievable,” Rio scoffed, tugging her shirt back down again and lightly swatting at Agatha’s hand, “Why don’t you just scrawl your name all over me instead?”</p><p>“Tempting.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she walked back out the room and disappeared to find something to cover her lower half. She fixed her hair, grabbed her bag, slipped on a pair of Agatha’s shoes and disappeared to fetch coffee and bagels.</p><p>Although Rio brought Agatha her bagel and coffee, she didn’t actually see Agatha after that for a couple hours.</p><p>Which gave Rio time to explore the house properly. She moved slowly through each room, not exactly snooping but not not snooping. By the time she was done in the kitchen she’d discovered what coffee Agatha liked: rich, dark arabica beans. And that she had a favourite Sancerre.</p><p>In the bathroom, though she drew the line at looking through her medicine cabinet, she sniffed every candle and found she’d like each one more than the next.</p><p>In the dining room, she found nothing of interest other than an old side plate in a cupboard with a strange crest on it, so faded in time she couldn’t make it out.</p><p>The bedroom was where she rifled through Agatha’s crisp suits and endless expensive dresses and she wondered how this woman could possibly have another full wardrobe down in Washington. It was also where she found a small hinged box with purple flower detail containing a small, rose quartz crystal, a couple weathered ticket stubs, and a Polaroid of Lilia, Alice, Jen, and Agatha, all grinning for the camera.</p><p>By the time she was done satisfying her curiosity, she went back through to the living room to pick a book to read whilst she waited on Agatha to finish shouting at whoever she currently was on the phone with in her little office.<br/>
She settled on a book about the history of Salem and was just getting into it when Agatha appeared in the doorway.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio looked up and smiled a little, already closing her book to focus in on the woman before her. “Are you done now?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and moved to sit down in her leather armchair, her body radiating confidence but her face telling a different story. She was watching Rio cautiously, as if she would bolt any second. “Okay, let’s talk.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded, moving herself to sit primly on the edge of the sofa as she stared across at Agatha.</p><p>She knew she had to tread carefully, for her own sake as well as Agatha’s. All she could hope for, all she could pray would happen, is that Agatha would slip back into the person she was all those days ago, holding her in that attic bedroom, admitting to her that she wanted her. That she sought her out. That she could be vulnerable.</p><p>And so Rio opted for honesty.</p><p>“I don’t date. It complicates things. People get… people are funny about my job. And it’s easier for me to keep to myself, maybe meet a girl in a bar and take her home, maybe…”</p><p>“Take her home?” Agatha interrupted sharply, her brow arching slightly at the insinuation.</p><p>But Rio ignored it, knowing she wouldn’t get anywhere if she kept letting Agatha interrupt. And the distance between them was helping her too.</p><p>“I pick girls up in bars and I work with my clients. I don’t date,” Rio continued pointedly. “My life is complicated unless I stick to the rules, a clear set of boundaries between what is personal and what is professional.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent through this, chewing the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“This is clearly a situation that I was <em>never</em> expecting to be in. One that I… wouldn’t have picked. But, we’re in it. And either we decide to be in it, to try and see if we can make it work, or we’re out. Fully out. As in, no contact. Nothing. I can’t accept anything in between.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze had narrowed as she took Rio in, her eyes dropping to Rio’s hands that rested on her knees and her slightly forward posture as she looked beseeching over at Agatha.</p><p>“You drive a hard bargain,” Agatha said eventually, raising her brows as she spoke.</p><p>“It’s only hard if you don’t know what you want.”</p><p>Agatha released a quiet chuckle and shifted in her seat to throw her hair back. “I’ve told you what I want.”</p><p>“I’m an escort, Agatha. You knew that. You <em>hired</em> me. You shouldn’t have pursued me. Shouldn’t have tried to <em>protect</em> me if you couldn’t handle that.”</p><p>Rio’s tone was sharper than before, her frustration at the situation, at Agatha, beginning to rise again.</p><p>“I can handle it,” Agatha said in a defensive voice, her back stretching as she shifted in her seat.</p><p>Rio chewed on her lower lip and thought for a second, trying to keep herself in check. “You shut me out. You use sex, and I let you, to not speak about it. That’s not… it’s not healthy. Not for a relationship to work.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped then and she remained still and silent as Rio shifted. The movement on the couch caused Agatha to look up again and blue eyes met brown.</p><p>“I’m going to be in D.C. a lot over the next few weeks and I know you… you’re <em>busy</em>,” she cleared her throat as if to shake off the meaning behind her emphasised word, “so I’ve made a shared calendar. And I thought.” She cleared her throat again as Rio raised her brows in surprise, “It’s practical. It’s easier. It makes more sense. And means that, if you want, we can see each other when we’re both free. Try and, try and work on… this.”</p><p>As Agatha finished Rio sat up properly, “You set up a shared calendar?”</p><p>“Yes. It’s good to be organised.”</p><p>“Uh huh. And also quite romantic, no?”</p><p>Agatha scowled suddenly and ran a hand through her hair, “If you’re going to make fun…”</p><p>“I’m not! I’m not!” Rio fought against the smile that threatened to spill out across her face.  “It’s a good idea. Thank you.”</p><p>“Whatever. Just want to… whatever.”</p><p>But Agatha looked as if she were pulling away again and Rio shifted once more, moving her forearms to her knees as she leant towards the woman. “So we’re going to try? See if this could work?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said after some hesitation, “I want you. However…” she shifted again and Rio noticed her hands toying with her hair, “However you can let me have you.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and nodded slowly, her gaze softening, “I want you too.”</p><p>“We’ll need to be discreet. I can’t have…”</p><p>“I know, me either.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat then and stood up suddenly, “I have to make some more calls.”</p><p>“Agatha. We’re not done. I want to talk about the Stark thing.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw twitched and she lowered herself slowly back down, “I told you it wasn’t negotiable.”</p><p>“It’s disgusting.”</p><p>“It’s my job.”</p><p>“No, it’s your arrogance.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes then, flexing her fingers against the arm of the chair. “I have no choice.”</p><p>But Rio was shaking her head and sitting back slowly, “You never told me. What happens if he loses?”</p><p>“Look,” Agatha said firmly, “The country is heading that way anyway. Right-wing loonies all over the place.” She threw up her hands as if these loonies were in the room with them right now. “I’m just going to give him what he needs to get them to listen, and to vote. And in eighteen months it’ll be over.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and rubbed her temple, “You’re a registered democrat, how could he want…?”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I’m not a registered democrat. I’m undeclared. Makes it easier when working across the aisles.”</p><p>It was Rio who flexed her jaw then, astounded by the flagrant ambition of the woman before her and beginning to understand just a little bit more about how calculated Agatha could be. “He’ll know you don’t agree with him. You’re a lesbian.”</p><p>“He has no problem with lesbians.”</p><p>“He’s said he won’t stand in the way of conversion-…”</p><p>“He’ll take my counsel on that. On <em>many</em> things. It will not be as bad as you think.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and ran her hands through her hair before cupping them over her face and taking a few seconds to breath.</p><p>“Okay. Okay. We’re not going to get anywhere with this.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent for a long while, with Rio remaining the same. After what felt like an age, Rio’s brain working overtime to try and come up with a way for Agatha to get out of this, to change her mind, to see sense. But her thoughts were interrupted with a soft ask: “Will you come to D.C. with me tomorrow? Stay a couple days. I have things I need to do, people I need to speak to, but I’d like to have you there.”</p><p>Rio frowned at this and stuck her tongue in her cheek as she considered it. On the one hand, all she wanted was more time with Agatha, on the other, she needed to think. Her heart won over her head. “I can stay a couple days. But I have plans this week, I need to-…”</p><p>“You don’t need to tell me, you can put them in the calendar.”</p><p>Rio looked up then and saw that Agatha was smiling, though she still looked cautious, unsure. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and cleared her throat as she stood up and went to kneel down in front of Rio, taking both her hands in her own. “I do have to work now but… this evening, pasta and a movie?”</p><p>Rio nodded only once, taking in the sharp lines of Agatha’s features and the soft, hopeful frown she wore. “That sounds great.”</p><p>Smiling and moving to place a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek, Agatha moved away and Rio watched as the woman’s shoulders visibly relaxed as she left the room. She sighed quietly as she slumped back against the soft cushions of the couch and closed her eyes as she took deep, slow breaths to try and calm her nervous system. It was a lot to take. The woman she was essentially agreeing to date, albeit secretly, had sold her soul to a republican… for Rio. It didn’t sit well with her at all. But Agatha wouldn’t budge. Not yet.</p><p>Rio spent the rest of the afternoon tapping her schedule into the new shared calendar, which she’d found sitting in her inbox with a note that read ‘I might not be around a lot but I’d like to see you when I can’. Her heart ached at the honesty of the message and she almost felt bad for being so frustrated earlier.</p><p>As she flicked through the calendar, getting a little thrill every time she saw Agatha’s entries listed across days as ‘D.C.’, or ‘NYC’. Rio, ever the enthusiast, made her entries more specific, ‘Work’, ‘Basketball’, on the days Agatha had marked as ‘NYC’, Rio had over layed them with ‘Date Night’, she’d also scrolled at all the way through to find her birthday and had marked that in the calendar, noting that Agatha had also scrolled that far and had continued to list which city she’d be in for the next year. Though some entries had question marks around them and the words ‘Campaign Time’ were more and more frequent throughout, the days where they were both free becoming more few and far between.</p><p>It was as she was scrolling through that Rio began to pick up a pattern, at least across the next six months or so. It was so glaringly obvious that she didn’t know why she hadn’t picked it up immediately.</p><p>She went to find Agatha in the little office and interrupted her typing, “Are you only coming back to New York for me?”</p><p>Agatha stopped typing suddenly, her back straightening a little and her lips pursing slightly, “Why do you say that?”</p><p>Rio held up her phone to show Agatha the calendar app, “Because you’re mostly in D.C. and then it’s really just weekends you’re back here. Which means that…” she dropped her phone to her side, “You said last night that D.C. was home. You’re coming through at the weekend because I’m here. It’s not just ‘when you can’ it’s, making an effort to come through… for me.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat then and continued to tap away at her computer, her lips still pursed, “Don’t be ridiculous.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip to hide the grin that threatened to take over her face and she moved over to Agatha, crouching down beside her, “Admit it. You’re making poor Jimmy drive you back every week, or every other week so you can…”</p><p>Agatha huffed and glanced down at Rio, scowling at her, “No. I like New York. No one knows me here and I…”</p><p>“And you might get to see me?”</p><p>“Shut up or I’ll sell this place and stay in D.C. forever.”</p><p>Rio laughed and raised her brows as she placed a hand on Agatha’s forearm, forcing her to stop typing whatever angry email she was in the middle of. Rio had spotted the words ‘egregious’ and ‘waste of my time’. “That’s such a lie.”</p><p>Agatha just shrugged and glanced at Rio, her cheeks a little pinker than before. “My time is precious and I’d…”</p><p>But Rio interrupted her with a smirk, “You want to spend it with me?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at this and turned to look at Rio fully, “Didn’t you just say you wanted all or nothing? I’m-“</p><p>“I’m just teasing,” Rio interrupted, secretly glad she’d confirmed what she thought she’d seen, it making her stomach flip at the idea of Agatha rushing back whenever she could to spend even a day with her.</p><p>“I’ll leave you to it.”</p><p>She stood and kissed Agatha’s temple but was pulled back sharply and Agatha kissed her firmly on the lips before she turned back to her laptop and muttered, “Nonsense.”</p><p>It was over dinner, a large bowl of pasta puttanesca and an even larger glass of red wine that the elephant in the room came up again.</p><p>“So where you’ve put ‘work’ in the calendar,” Agatha said with an effort to remain casual about it, “You’ll be with clients?”</p><p>Rio took a sip of her wine and surveyed Agatha closely, “Yes. I’ve put in everything I know so far… I’m booked up for at least the next eight months.”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha nodded slowly, her gaze falling back to her pasta. “And you’ll be in New York with them? No… no trips?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head and bit her lower lip, “None arranged, no.”</p><p>“Not to the cape?”</p><p>“No. None to the cape.”</p><p>Agatha nodded again, her fingers now toying with her fork, “But will you see her?”</p><p>“We have a recurring session every three months,” Rio said slowly, “Just a night.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat but kept her gaze down, doing everything she could not to look at Rio. “Right.”</p><p>Rio let them sit in the awkward silence until she could no longer take it and she broke it with a, “Agatha? Why does Abigail bother you so much when there are…”</p><p>But Agatha’s fork came down a little too heavily then against her bowl and Rio blinked down at it before looking back across to Agatha. “I think we shouldn’t talk about my clients anymore.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin and took a large sip of her wine then, and Rio watched her cautiously for a few seconds before she stood and moved around to Agatha’s side of the small table, slipping in to squeeze into Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“I <em>like</em> you, Agatha. Please don’t ruin this.”</p><p>Agatha seemed to be fighting with herself as Rio gazed down at her with wide eyes, her hands moving to rest against Agatha’s chest. “Hey. Can we go back to having a nice dinner and maybe fooling around on the couch?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed a little but relented ever so slightly as her arms settled around Rio, “Fine.”</p><p>Rio grinned, but knew the conversation was far from over. It would keep coming up. For now, though, she settled for ‘fine’ and pulled away to finish the rest of her dinner.</p><p>The rest of the evening was easier, they watched a movie they’d both seen a million times before, Agatha’s hands for the first half remaining above Rio’s shirt, and only slipping beneath once her attention really started to drift and she found a different way of entertaining herself. Rio ignored this as best she could.</p><p>When the movie was done, with Rio waxing lyrical about basketball with a vaguely amused but slightly distracted Agatha who had taken it upon herself to now fully map every inch of Rio’s body with her exploring hands, only staying away from between Rio’s thighs because as much as she didn’t care about basketball she was enjoying listening to Rio talk about one of her favourite subjects.</p><p>They fell into bed not long later and after another two orgasms each, they fell asleep in each other’s arms.</p><p>The next morning came and Rio was not prepared for the early morning wake up call, Agatha having not mentioned that the alarm would be going off at 4am.</p><p>But it did. And Rio growled as she tugged the blankets above her head and attempted to block out the noise. Agatha ripped them from her weak, sleepy grasp and laughed as she began tugging Rio to stretch from her curled up position in the bed. “You can sleep in the car.”</p><p>“Noooooo,” Rio huffed, glaring up at Agatha, “Why did you keep me up so late if we had to get up <em>this</em> early?”</p><p>“You weren’t complaining last night,” Agatha sang out as she padded through to the bathroom to shower.</p><p>“You didn’t tell me!” Rio called after her, rallying a little at the prospect of potentially getting to share the shower with Agatha.</p><p>One hot, shared shower later. One more tantrum from Rio and several more eye rolls from Agatha and they were out on the sidewalk being greeted by Jimmy, back in his suit. “Miss Harkness. Miss Vidal.”</p><p>Rio noticed again that her reception was slightly less than warm but she didn’t say anything until she was in the car and Jimmy had pulled away from the curb.</p><p>“Why does he hate me?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and then looked a little sheepish, “When you wouldn’t go with him… I… lost it a little.” She cleared her throat softly, keeping her voice low, “Threatened his job. It’s the first time I’ve… anyway I’m not sure he’s forgiven you.”</p><p>“Oh but he’s forgiven <em>you</em>? That’s insane.”</p><p>“I pay him.”</p><p>Rio scowled at this and settled back more in her seat, “You’re so dramatic.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in acknowledgement and began to toy with the hem of the dress Rio had borrowed for the trip. “I’m dramatic, stubborn, self-sufficient, and always right. Hadn’t you realised?”</p><p>Rio shot Agatha a look but noticed that Agatha looked nervous then, and she didn’t think it was because she was tired. She reached to still her hand and lifted it to kiss her palm, “I had, actually.”</p><p>Agatha looked away then, pulling her hand back to begin tapping away at her phone, “Good. Get some sleep.”</p><p>Rio huffed and shifted to curl up across what little room there was in the back seat and placed her head in Agatha’s lap to do just that. To her surprise she felt long fingers brush through her hair tenderly as she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>She woke up only when they were outside Agatha’s brownstone in the early morning of a mild Sunday in D.C.</p><p>Rio felt a little hazy from the sleep in the car and her neck was tender from where she’d remained against Agatha the whole way there. She wanted to stretch it out, wanted to sleep for five more hours, and wanted to return back to Agatha’s lap all at once.</p><p>But as Agatha led her into the house she forgot all about her tiredness and was instead focused on the hands that settled at her sides and the feel of Agatha guiding her into her home.</p><p>The house was similar to Agatha’s New York home. It was large, impressive, with tall windows and wood flooring. It had original features and impressive art works and chandeliers. But it had soft Persian rugs, throws across almost every sofa, chair, or bench, and Agatha had clearly taken pains to make it feel as warm and inviting as a large house for one person could.</p><p>Rio noticed that in the shelves in the living room and then sideboard in the kitchen there were more photos. Snapshots of days out with Alice and Jen, of Lilia sitting behind what looked like a large, cluttered office desk, and even one of Agatha and Billy, hidden away behind the others. Less surprising to Rio were the photos of Agatha with senators - she noted with a smirk, that they were all Democrats. World leaders even made an appearance on a console table in the upstairs hallway and, much to Rio’s delight, a photo of Agatha and Beyoncé sat pride of place on the dressing table in a guest bedroom. “Jen made me take it. I was mortified.”</p><p>Rio could barely take the place in, it was grand yet cosy, large yet comfortable. And she could once again see Agatha in all the details.</p><p>The proceeding day was interrupted every hour or so with Agatha having to take calls, respond to emails, or write up reports on something or other. But Rio took the time to just be with her, watching her as she worked, until she would be gently kicked out for “more involved conversations, honey, sorry”.</p><p>The rest of her time without Agatha she spent lounging around, exploring the large house and making herself at home.</p><p>The next two days spent in D.C. were some of the more domestic and peaceful days of Rio’s life. Agatha seemed calmer here with Rio in her home, always in the next room whenever she had a spare five minutes to come and see her, kiss her, touch her. Rio realised her presence was reassuring to Agatha and she had no qualms about the soft hands that tugged her closer on the couch when they were done typing away to a late night email or the lips that always found her wanting more in the bed at night.</p><p>Rio left in the early hours of Tuesday morning, more at ease with their situation, but knowing deep down that they were in a honeymoon phase where temperaments were calmer and chats were gentler but that didn’t mean it couldn’t all come crashing down.</p><p>Her time spent with Agatha that weekend solidified her feelings for the other woman and as she stared out the window of the train as she wound her way back to New York - having put her foot down about Jimmy driving her home - she knew she was in too deep with her to just throw in the towel.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The next five months were some of the best, most stressful, most confusing, happiest, months of Rio’s life.</p><h4>June/July</h4><p>After that first Sunday spent at Agatha’s, exploring her house, exploring the area, and exploring what it meant to be fully <em>with Agatha</em> living with her for three days, barely apart and barely able to keep their hands off of each other, Rio knew that she was done for.</p><p>She’d fallen so completely and so hard that it physically hurt her whenever Agatha had to leave for more than an hour at a time to take a call, go to a lunch meeting, or generally be in another room from her.</p><p>That first period spent in Agatha’s home in D.C. soon came to an end as Rio had to make the practical and sensible decision to go back to her own home, and she wound her way back to Manhattan, her thoughts inevitably drifted to everything said, and everything unsaid, during her time with Agatha.</p><p>The Stark issue was never brought up again, though Rio had caught a few tense words through the gap in Agatha’s office door between herself and the senator. And Rio’s job wasn’t mentioned either.</p><p>These were both things that Rio knew could break them and so, at least for now, rightly or wrongly, she wasn’t eager to bring up.</p><p>But two weeks into their new arrangement, Agatha coming back to NYC at the weekends, and on one occasion in the middle of the night on a Wednesday for just a few hours - enough time to leave Rio with a dull ache between her thighs the next morning - Rio was beginning to feel settled, more settled than she had felt in a long time.</p><p>Agatha was constant now. Constantly available when Rio wanted to talk to her (or else a couple hours later if she had an important meeting), constantly there when she said she’d be, constantly obsessed with keeping Rio up all hours of the night when she was with her.</p><p>It was two more weeks into this arrangement when Rio took the plunge.</p><p>She called Agatha, knowing she was maybe an hour away from Manhattan, one balmy Friday night, just past 10pm.</p><p>“Change of plan.”</p><p>“Pardon? I’m on my way. Did something happen?”</p><p>“I want you to tell Jimmy the following address: 624 W, 151st Street.” She paused and hesitated as she heard nothing on the other end of the line, “I’m apartment 12.”</p><p>Silence remained on the line for just a few more seconds and Rio was beginning to think she’d lost Agatha in a tunnel or something until she heard a muffled voice repeat her address. Agatha then returned at full volume and Rio breathed a sigh of relief. “Took you long enough.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled into her phone, “Just shut up and hurry up.”</p><p>She hung up then, her eyes scanning her small apartment for any last minute things she might need to tidy away or fix before Agatha arrived.</p><p>A little over an hour later and her buzzer went, shocking Rio out of her reverie and making her practically fly to let Agatha in. She did a last once over of the small space and opened the door to a smirking Agatha. “Hey.”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio grinned and leant in for a kiss, her fingers settling in the familiar position at Agatha’s lapels as she pulled her into her little apartment. Agatha allowed herself to stumble with Rio, one hand settling comfortably around her waist as her other held her bag and a bottle of Rio’s favourite Shiraz.</p><p>“Hey hey,” Agatha mumbled as she traced a familiar trail along Rio’s jaw and down to her neck, leaving soft kisses as she went. “Don’t distract me,” she muttered, though she was the one doing the distracting as she pressed Rio closer and nipped playfully at her ear, “I need to check out my girlfriend’s apartment.”</p><p>Rio was squirming in Agatha’s hold, laughing as Agatha’s lips tickled her neck but her breath caught as she heard a word they’d both been skirting around but that Rio had secretly already decided was her new favourite word for Agatha.</p><p>“Girlfriend?” She pulled back, a grin appearing on her face as she tried to catch Agatha’s eyes. But the girlfriend in question was now pulling away and striding further into the little living room with an air of curious determination.</p><p>“Mm,” she hummed quietly, almost to herself, but definitely in acknowledgement as she began to move slowly around the space, scrutinising every inch of it. “You have too many plants.”</p><p>“And you don’t have enough.”</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t listening and as Rio moved to perch on the arm she watched as observant eyes scanned the room, lingering on the plants cluttering up the windowsills, the small well-loved couch with the large multicoloured throw, the coffee table strewn with books, the small, old tv in the corner, and the bookshelves stacked with more books and small colourful ornaments. It was small, and a little cluttered, but it was cosy and it was hers.</p><p>It had been a week since Rio had last laid eyes on Agatha and she realised only now just how much she’d missed her. And how much this woman in a cream suit and sharp heels looked so out of place in her quaint little apartment.</p><p>Smirking as she saw Agatha touch a small Puerto Rican flag on her bookshelf she moved to snatch the discarded bottle of red and move through to the adjoining kitchen. “Glass of wine?”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>As she opened the bottle with a soft <em>pop</em> Rio heard the arrival of Agatha behind her, now leaning against the kitchen door frame.</p><p>“Your parents?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow and turned around to see Agatha looking over the photos stuck to her fridge door. The one Agatha must have honed in on was of a young couple, one with Rio’s eyes, the other with her smile, beaming at the camera with their arms around each other. They were about Rio’s age when the photo was taken and it was her favourite photo of them.</p><p>“Yeah, they died a few years ago.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and turned back to pour the wine.</p><p>Agatha didn’t push the subject, though Rio heard her shift slightly where she was standing on the slightly creaky floor she’d been meaning to get fixed for a while. “And that’s Natasha? She’s pretty.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and began to pour the wine. “Yeah, and gets away with murder because of it. Kind of annoying actually.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed quietly and moved to sidle up to Rio against the counter.</p><p>“I’m sure you could get away with a lot worse.”</p><p>“Worse than murder?”</p><p>“If I were judge and jury, yes.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and offered Agatha her glass. Up close and in the brighter light of the kitchen, Rio focused in on the bags under Agatha’s eyes, visible even beneath her makeup. With her free hand she touched her cheek gently, “you look tired. Have you not been sleeping?”</p><p>Agatha averted her gaze and pulled away to move back into the living room, throwing her hand out to brush away the concern. “It’s just been a busy week. Bad day.”</p><p>Rio followed her out and took a seat on the couch beside her, watching as Agatha removed her blazer and draped it neatly over the back of the couch. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>“No, there’s not much to say. Stark’s being a bastard and I’m fighting about a million fires.”</p><p>Agatha shifted then, stretching her free arm over the back of the couch, “I’ll have to leave early tomorrow. I have a breakfast meeting in midtown and then I need to get back.”</p><p>Rio frowned deeply at this and moved her hand to take Agatha’s on the back of the couch, “Is it that bad? Can’t you come back for a while after your breakfast?”</p><p>“I don’t have time.”</p><p>Rio considered this for a second and then put her glass down on the low coffee table, “Then I’ll come back with you? Even for a night. I’ll get the train the next morning and-…”</p><p>But Agatha had interrupted her, placing her own glass on the table too and shifting to lean in and tug at Rio to move closer, “I’d love that but I’m going to be so busy with work that it doesn’t make sense for you to come all the way.”</p><p>Rio frowned deeply then, despite Agatha now wrapping her arms around her, the rejection stung a little, “Okay. Let’s make the most of tonight then?”</p><p>Rio closed the space between them and kissed Agatha, trying to do exactly what she’d just asked. They kissed lazily, Agatha’s tongue now nudging familiarly with Rio’s as she pressed her down onto her back, her hands searching and hungry but not pushing for anything more than the familiar feel of Rio beneath her.</p><p>As Rio moaned and tried to deepen the kiss, Agatha broke it off and pulled away just as her hand had made it to Rio’s breast, above her shirt. They were both panting softly and Rio leant up to capture Agatha’s lips again but the older woman kept it chaste, moving her hand back to instead curl around Rio’s waist, above her ribs, “Tell me about your day.”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio responded, frowning slightly as she attempted to kiss Agatha again.</p><p>“I want to hear about your day.”</p><p>Rio huffed as Agatha dodged her next attempt, managing to just capture the corner of her lips, “It was fine. Can you be quiet now?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, a deep throaty laugh, as she pulled back a little more, adjusting her weight over the woman below her, “I’m serious, I want to hear about it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but began to scratch over Agatha’s back, “Fine. It was fine. Had some uppity kids join the class this afternoon but they were just trying to show off for some girls in the bleachers.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at this and placed a soft kiss to Rio’s cheek, “Oh and you wouldn’t show off for me in the bleachers?”</p><p>Rio was the one to laugh this time but her breath caught in her throat as Agatha moved down to kiss the crook of her neck, “I don’t need to show off for you. You’d already be impressed.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and the feel of her hot breath against Rio’s throat made her squirm a little.</p><p>“What else did you do?”</p><p>Rio frowned, trying her best to concentrate on the Agatha-less portion of her day whilst the Agatha above her was creeping a hand under her shirt to splay across her stomach. “Umm. Had lunch with Nat. Tidied the apartment. Got pretty for you.”</p><p>“See?” Agatha said with a lazy smile, still pressed as close as she could to Rio, “You do try to impress.”</p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes and let a beat of silence pass where she felt Agatha nuzzle at her, a soft, slow breath releasing from her parted lips. “Are you… did you come all this way to sleep on me?”</p><p>“<em>With</em> you,” Agatha corrected softly, her hand scratching a little across Rio’s abdomen, “Can’t I?”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and attempted to shuffle down to look at Agatha properly but the woman had her trapped, “Shall we move to the bed? It’s comfier. And we can take off your clothes.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and sat up slowly, gazing down at Rio with a sleepy smile, her hand still up her shirt. “Are you trying to seduce me?”</p><p>“Well usually I don’t have to <em>try</em>.”</p><p>Agatha hummed with a smirk and slowly peeled away from Rio, following the logical route that must lead to the little bedroom. Rio grabbed Agatha’s bag and followed closely behind, watching as Agatha’s eyes found the row of potted plants between the bed and the window, leaving very little access space to the left side of the bed. She even saw her glance at the photos and stickers stuck to the mirror above the set of drawers: ‘Raging GOATS’, her basketball team’s name; Four small photo booth pictures of her and Nat; and another photo of her parents, this time with her as a little girl.</p><p>But Agatha wasted no time in stripping down to her underwear, removing her bra and making eye contact with Rio as she did. “Toothbrush?”</p><p>“Spare one under the sink,” Rio said with a grin that gave away how delighted she was every time she saw Agatha out of her clothes.</p><p>She flopped down on the bed after changing into her own pyjamas, a stolen Yale tee from Agatha’s apartment, and her briefs. When Agatha came out, still only in her panties, Rio sat up on her elbows and watched her approach her, moving to straddle Rio’s hips with a lazy but happy smile, “Stealing things now?”</p><p>“You have more than enough clothes you don’t need this.”</p><p>Agatha hummed as Rio’s hands found her hips and her lips found Rio’s neck, “You’re lucky you’re cute.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio groaned, her eyes now closed as she let Agatha place a soft trail up to her lips. She kissed Rio and as hands moved down to her ass she pulled back slightly, her brows raised, “What happened to sleeping?”</p><p>“You are the practically naked one on top of me,” Rio accused right back but her grin softened as she took in the now makeup-free Agatha, watching her closely, looking almost shy. Rio suddenly felt a strange protectiveness flare up in her chest and she moved her hands up to hold Agatha’s face, “Let me brush my teeth and I’ll be right with you.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing then as she rolled over and crawled to the top of the bed where she slipped beneath the blankets.</p><p>Rio sighed and went to wash her face and brush her teeth, returning not five minutes later to a classic Agatha Harkness vignette: she was laying in the middle of the bed with one arm splayed out beside her and her other dramatically flung over her eyes like she’d just fainted in a Victorian novel.</p><p>Rio crawled to her, burying herself under the covers and reaching for her without hesitation. Agatha shifted in her hold, returning to their previous position on the couch; half on, half off Rio, and her face pressed into her neck. Her hand, this time, was again under Rio’s shirt and wrapped tightly around her hip.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Agatha’s breathing to even out and for her body to go limp around Rio but Rio’s hold never wavered, she kept Agatha close, her hand gently toying with her hair as the older woman slept.</p><p>This was the first night they’d spent together where they hadn’t had sex. It wasn’t that Rio needed to have sex with Agatha every night, though she wanted to, it was that Agatha usually initiated. Usually couldn’t keep her hands to herself. Even when Rio was cooking. Even when she was napping on the couch. Even when she was telling her a story about her day.</p><p>But the Agatha that had arrived tonight was different. She was tired. And Rio realised that for maybe the first time since they’d met, she was needy for her in a way that didn’t involve Rio taking her clothes off.</p><p>All these thoughts swirling around in her head made it hard for Rio to fall asleep, even with the comforting weight of Agatha around her. But eventually she did, her subconscious giving her a reprieve from worried thoughts of Agatha being in too deep for her own good.</p><p>When she woke, Agatha wasn’t on top of her. Or beside her. Instead, she was sitting at the edge of the bed, her cream suit, a little wrinkled now, but back on. “Morning,” she groaned quietly, blinking into the light of the room as she focused in on those blue eyes. “Do you have to go already?”</p><p>Agatha smiled slightly and leant down to kiss Rio’s temple, “Can I come back next week?”</p><p>Rio frowned at this, shifting in the bed to reach for Agatha, “Yes. There’s a set of keys on the shelf by the door. Take them. Come back.”</p><p>Agatha looked taken aback but touched by this and leant in again to kiss Rio, though Rio was a bit reluctant having not brushed her teeth.</p><p>Ten minutes later and Rio was alone again. The small apartment now felt empty, filled now only with her plants and the soft scent of Agatha on her stolen tshirt.</p><h4>July/August</h4><p>That night in mid-July when they had established that they were girlfriends had been one of the best and worst nights of Rio’s life. It was the night Rio realised that she’d be seeing even less of Agatha than she liked, and when she did get time with her, Agatha might not always have had a good day. But it was also the night that Agatha had confirmed how she felt about Rio, in her words and her actions. She’d claimed her as her own physically oh-so many times. But she’d never said it out loud. Not ‘girlfriend’, not a word that meant so much but not enough for Rio to be able to explain just what Agatha was to her now.</p><p>Because she was everything.</p><p>She wanted to stop time. Rewind back to having Agatha all over her on the couch so she could hold her for longer, feel her against her, where she’d always be safe.</p><p>But time had a way of continuing on even as Rio wished it wouldn’t.</p><p>They started to see each other less as Agatha’s schedule in D.C. picked up and between Rio’s clients and her basketball schedule she barely had the time either.</p><p>One warm Saturday afternoon, Rio had just hung up from Agatha, having been complaining about the heat in New York and the stench of the subways, but mostly about missing her, when she arrived at her usual park to play basketball with her team.</p><p>It wasn’t half an hour later that Rio was in full swing, throwing orders across the court and screaming at her teammates who would just not “Pick. Up. The. Pace!” She was sweaty and determined, her baggy burgundy jersey flapping about as she ran, ducking and dodging around the opposition to get the ball in the net.</p><p>Her mind was clear, her concentration exact, her feet flying, until her gaze landed on a familiar face in the bleachers and she fumbled an easy pass, giving the ball away to the opposing team.</p><p>“Fucksake, Vidal!”</p><p>But Rio’s mind was elsewhere as she stared across at Agatha Harkness, sitting across the bleachers with an iced coffee in her hand, a burgundy cap, and a smirk across her face. The only thing that brought Rio back to earth was one of her teammates shoving at her roughly as she went past.</p><p>She stumbled and snapped out of it, focusing back in on the game at hand, now more determined than ever to win… now that she had someone in the stands to impress.</p><p>More screaming, more shoving, and several more fouls later, and Rio’s team, The Raging Goats, had won. Rio was piled upon by her teammates and bandied from one to the other as they screamed in unison, all ecstatic that they’d absolutely destroyed the other team. As Rio scrambled up, promising her friends she’d be back shortly, she jogged towards the bleachers and wiped the sweat from her brow as she saw Agatha speaking to one of the other team’s players. Specifically, a bitch who had purposefully stamped on Rio’s foot.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio announced loudly, frowning between the two women and not at all pleased to see Agatha’s hand on the girl’s jersey.</p><p>Agatha glanced up and smiled brightly, her hand dropping from the woman’s top as she did so, “Hey!” Rio moved in to stake her claim quickly and kissed Agatha firmly on the lips, keeping her there for a lot longer than necessary but a lot less than she’d have liked, ignoring the woman standing watching them. “I thought you had to work today.”</p><p>“I managed to get away early. Laurie here was just telling me,” Rio’s head snapped to Laurie and she raised her brows, surprised at the woman’s confidence to lose a match so abysmally then saunter over to a woman in the stands and start flirting with her. “That you’re quite the maniac on the court. Mentioned broken noses and all sorts.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned back to Agatha, “All accidents.” She went to take Agatha’s hand and pull her away but Agatha stayed where she was on the bleacher and Laurie spoke this time, “You’ve never brought a girl before, Vidal. Must be serious then? You’re off limits?” Her gaze settled on Agatha and blue eyes twinkled with something Rio couldn’t place but she knew she didn’t like.</p><p>“Oh I don’t know about that… we’ve not really established <em>rules</em> so if you wanted to shoot your shot, so to speak, then please do.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped and she felt as if her head might explode as she stared down at Agatha, not believing what she was hearing.</p><p>Laurie grinned and reached down to fish out her phone but Agatha held up her hand, “Ah. Put your number in mine instead.”</p><p>The woman did so with a shit-eating grin on her face and passed Agatha’s phone back with a smirk in Rio’s direction. “I’m sure I can show you a much better time than Vidal.”</p><p>With that, she disappeared back to the court and her commiserating team.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Rio all but bellowed, her body practically shaking as she glared down at Agatha who smiled serenely up at her.</p><p>“Honey, you look incredibly sexy. You have no idea.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide, her mouth struggling to find the words to express just how angry she was, as Agatha stood and slipped her hands into the sides of her jersey over her sports bra and murmured against Rio’s lips, “Now take me home and show me how jealous you are.”</p><p>So Rio did. Jimmy had been waiting just outside the park to get the two of them back to Rio’s tiny apartment as quickly as possible and Rio couldn’t believe she’d fallen for this, whatever this was. If she hadn’t missed Agatha so much and been so desperate to stake her claim on her, then she might have been mad at her. But she was desperate. She <em>had</em> missed her. It had been too long since she’d felt her against her, inside her, and so her anger was channeled instead to fury that anyone else would even look at Agatha, let alone attempt to charm her, think they could take her out, touch her.</p><p>After getting the key in the door, Rio wasted not time in throwing Agatha up against it, furious that the woman was still smirking, that she still looked thrilled at this outcome. That she wasn’t even the least bit sorry that Rio was now worked up into a frenzy.</p><p>Rio devoured the woman before her, not caring or much noticing that their teeth were clashing, that her body was sticky with sweat, that her hands were clawing.</p><p>Agatha had relinquished control but was fighting back every so often, making Rio clutch harder, groan louder, and be rougher, just to claw some dominance back.</p><p>With her fingers inside her and her teeth at her throat she asked, “Is this what you wanted?”</p><p>“God. Yes!”</p><p>Rio didn’t stop until Agatha came four times, twice against her hand and twice against her tongue.</p><p>Agatha was fully naked, panting heavily and slick with the sheen of sweat as she lay there and Rio crawled back up her body with a satisfied but still furious gaze, still in her basketball kit.</p><p>“Do you see now?” Agatha panted out, her eyes still dark with lust as she gazed up at Rio, “What you do to me? What I… how it feels?”</p><p>Rio frowned down at Agatha, her mind slow and hazy from the fury and the one-track desire she’d just been drowning in for the past hour. But as she pressed their lips together again she realised what Agatha had done. Why she’d done it. She wanted to show Rio how she felt. How she must feel every day knowing that someone else’s number was in Rio’s phone, that they could use it to summon her, to buy her, and then to have her.</p><p>As Rio pulled away slowly she sat down on her ankles, still straddling Agatha’s hips, her fingers resting lightly on the damp skin there.</p><p>“Will you delete her number?” She asked in a small voice, all the fire from before now extinguished as she felt the guilt churning in her stomach.</p><p>Agatha raised up slowly on her elbows and watched Rio carefully, still just about catching her breath, “Yes.”</p><p>Rio nodded but dropped her gaze from Agatha, looking intently at her abdomen, where she’d left a particularly big red mark.</p><p>Agatha remained silent for a few seconds before she sat up fully, tugging at Rio to pull her flush against her and dipping her head to capture her lips again with a smirk, “That was so fucking hot.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but kissed Agatha back, letting the woman now paw at and scratch at her back, “You barely let me take control.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and grinned up at Rio, “I beg to differ.”</p><p>Rio laughed and made a move to slide off of Agatha but the other woman grabbed her back and pulled her more into her lap again, “But it’s my turn now.”</p><p>Another two hours and five orgasms later and Agatha had left again for meetings whilst Rio had left to meet her team for drinks.</p><p>Agatha had returned to the tiny apartment just after 11 that night, exhausted and wanting to curl around Rio and fall asleep. But Rio hadn’t answered any of her texts, and the radio silence meant that Agatha stayed awake, waiting impatiently on the couch for any sign of her errant girlfriend.</p><p>It was around 2am that the door finally opened and Rio appeared, half held, half carried by a red head who looked vaguely amused and vaguely annoyed.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio shouted with a lopsided grin as she tried to make a beeline for her, Natasha letting her go and Rio all but tripping into Agatha’s waiting arms. “Missed you,” she mumbled quietly against Agatha’s cheek, placing a sloppy kiss there as Agatha held on tightly, aware that she was holding them both up.</p><p>Natasha watched this interaction closely, shutting the door behind her and pocketing her keys, something that keen blue eyes didn’t miss.</p><p>“You must be Natasha?”</p><p>“I must be.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow and looked over the woman before her as Rio attempted to lift Agatha’s sweater and grab at her hips. Natasha was wearing a fitted black tank top with black jeans and docs. And a smirk on her face that told Agatha everything she needed to know.</p><p>“Come on, honey,” she murmured as she adjusted Rio’s hold on her and began to take her to the bedroom.</p><p>Rio was so drunk she relied on Agatha to prop her up but they made it to the bed in one piece, Agatha laying Rio down gently and lifting her legs onto the bed. “Nooooo,” Rio whined, frowning up at Agatha, Natasha quietly stepping into the room behind them. “Stay with me!”</p><p>Agatha smiled at this as she moved down to remove Rio’s shoes, “In a minute, honey.”</p><p>From behind her, Natasha spoke quietly, her deep voice carrying even as Rio continued to whine and giggle on the bed, “They said she’d done a shot for every point she scored. Which explains a lot.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, not turning to look at the stranger, “And she called you?” She tried to keep her tone casual as she asked but something about Natasha’s response let her know she’d been caught.</p><p>“No. Rebecca has my number. She called me. Knew I’d look after her.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat softly, her gentle movements at Rio’s zipper faltering slightly as she bit down on her lip to prevent herself from biting this woman’s head off.</p><p>“Well thank you for getting her home. I can take her from here.”</p><p>Natasha didn’t move though, her eyes watching every movement with interest. Rio was just about beginning to drift off to sleep, the soft voices of two of the people who meant the most to her in the world washing over her like a comfort blanket and she reached out to nothing with a mumbled, “Stay. Both. Stay.”</p><p>Agatha ignored this and gently pulled away Rio’s jeans, attempting to do so without exposing much of Rio to her friend at the door and pulling the blankets up quickly to cover her over. But Natasha was moving around then, crouching down by Rio’s head to stroke her hair. Rio leant into the touch with her eyes closed and Agatha felt sick about it.</p><p>“Make sure she’s on her side in the night. She gets sick pretty easily.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched at this, “I know.” But she didn’t. Rio had never been this drunk with her before.</p><p>Natasha hummed and stroked her finger gently down Rio’s nose as Rio’s breathing began to steady out fully and her lips parted as she slipped into sleep.</p><p>“She’s told me a little about you. Not a lot. But enough.”</p><p>Green eyes snapped up to meet blue and Agatha narrowed her gaze a little, daring this woman to say what she was thinking. “I don’t trust you.”</p><p>Agatha just laughed, but kept it quiet as Rio slept between them. “You’re what? Her protector?”</p><p>“I’m her best friend.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pursed slightly and she dropped her gaze to Rio’s face, watching as she breathed slowly, heavily. “I would never do anything to hurt her.”</p><p>Natasha remained silent, watching Agatha for a while before she turned to place a tender kiss between Rio’s brows and then she stood up once more, looking down at Agatha.</p><p>“I’ll leave my number on the fridge. Call me if you need anything.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Agatha said, a little harsher than she’d meant it to sound but she cleared her throat and met Natasha’s gaze, “I’m sure we’ll meet again.”</p><p>For the first time, Natasha’s lips quirked into a slight smile and she ducked her head in acknowledgement of the fact, but said nothing as she disappeared to leave her number and then leave the apartment.</p><p>Agatha moved behind Rio then, slipping herself beneath the blankets to wrap her whole body around the drunken woman, holding her steady and praying she wouldn’t vomit in the night.</p><p>The next morning Rio woke with a groan and pressed back into the warmth behind her, already aware that it was Agatha, but remembering nothing about how she’d got home or the conversation that had happened around her the night before.</p><p>“I want to die.”</p><p>“Good morning to you too.”</p><p>Rio huffed slowly and groaned as she buried her head beneath the blankets, “How did I get home? I don’t remember…”</p><p>“Natasha.”</p><p>Rio groaned again and rubbed at her eyes as Agatha’s hold tightened somewhat around her middle, “Is she here?”</p><p>“No, she left.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and with what little energy she had she turned around to blink across at Agatha, “You met her? How did it go?”</p><p>Agatha smiled tightly and placed a kiss in the same place that Natasha had kissed Rio not five hours ago, “Fine. We were mostly focused on getting you to bed.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little, “Good. It’s important you get on.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed and kissed the corner of Rio’s lips gently, her hand moving to encourage Rio’s leg to wrap around her own hips, “I wish they’d called me,” she admitted softly, nudging their noses together. “It should be me they call.”</p><p>Rio’s dreamy smile morphed into a slight frown as she watched Agatha then, raising a hand to her cheek, “I’m not sure picking me up drunk from bars with my rowdy team counts as discreet.”</p><p>“I know, I just… wish it were me, that’s all.”</p><p>Even in her hungover state, these words settled uncomfortably in Rio’s chest and she pressed herself a bit closer to Agatha, wanting to reassure her but not knowing how. “I’m glad you came yesterday though. Saw the game.”</p><p>Agatha nodded a little and closed her eyes as she dipped her hand round to Rio’s ass, not trying it on, just holding her as close as she physically could.</p><p>It wasn’t two hours later that Agatha had to leave again. And Rio faced the prospect of another week without her. Another week of hurried phone calls and late night FaceTimes.</p><h4>August/September</h4><p>The difference with this week though, was that Rio now had to face up to the idea that in a couple of days she’d be at Abigail’s apartment again. Doing all the things she usually did with her. But now, now she had the very real memory of how she’d felt at even the prospect of someone thinking they could touch Agatha, and knowing that her girlfriend would be experiencing that tenfold.</p><p>But the day came and Rio went through the motions. She greeted Abigail as she usually would, with a polite kiss to the cheek and a quick hug.</p><p>They had dinner together in a restaurant that charged a small fortune for a tiny bowl of crab linguine and they went back to her apartment for Rio to perform the usual ritual.</p><p>Only this time, Rio didn’t feel like it. Didn’t feel like it at all. Over dinner Abigail had been mostly on her phone, answering calls or texting. Rio, unable to take her phone out, though having kept it on her person this time at Agatha’s insistence, had mostly zoned out. But not enough to miss one side of an exchange.</p><p>“Well what do you mean she’s running him?”</p><p>“You can’t be serious. Surely she’s playing a bait and switch.”</p><p>“Wanda…”</p><p>“No, I’m with Rachel tonight.”</p><p>“No. No you can’t come over we’re…”</p><p>“No. Not tonight. I’ll catch up with you another time. Okay.”</p><p>Rio had pretended not to be listening, though of course all she could think about was why Wanda was so interested in Agatha’s campaign with Stark.</p><p>But the rest of the evening she had to focus back in on the job at hand. It was painful. But somewhere in the back of her mind Rio had decided it would be the last.</p><p>When Abigail was done with her at about three in the morning and Rio was craving nothing but a hot shower and the feel of Agatha beside her, she’d made up her mind. Her ongoing contract with Abigail would be terminated by the time she got home that day.</p><p>And so she did.</p><p>When she stepped back into her apartment just after midday that day, smelling of Abigail’s expensive soap and wanting to claw her skin off, the last thing she thought she’d find was Agatha.</p><p>Her girlfriend was sitting on her low couch, a cushion on her lap and her laptop balanced on top of it, her frown tired and her hand already held out to Rio. “I thought you’d be back earlier.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip and hovered by the edge of the couch but didn’t move to Agatha, not wanting her to smell the other woman on her. “I had to stop off in a cafe. Write an email.”</p><p>Agatha frowned at this and dropped her hand from where it still hung between them. “Is everything okay? Did she-…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio interrupted quickly, shifting from foot to foot as she deliberated on her next words. “I terminated our contract. I couldn’t… I didn’t want to do it anymore.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha’s gaze went from concerned to surprised and allowed the woman to move over to her, shuffling along the couch until she hit the arm and reached up to hold Rio’s face in her hands. “Are you okay? Was she…? Did she take it okay?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and took Agatha’s wrists in her hands, “I haven’t checked. But she’s not called yet so, maybe she hasn’t seen it.”</p><p>Agatha only nodded but Rio could see that she was fighting herself to not look relieved, to not look like she wanted to scream from the rooftops. She bent down and pressed a quick kiss to Agatha’s lips and whispered, “You can be pleased, Y’know. I won’t hold it against you.”</p><p>Agatha laughed then and her touch on Rio changed from soft and concerned to giddy and possessive as she began to tug so hard that she pulled Rio down onto the couch with her. Rio squeaked in surprise but buried herself into Agatha’s neck and gripped the woman’s shirt beneath her as she began to tug it up, desperate after having Abigail’s naked form beneath her for hours to replace the image in her mind with Agatha’s.</p><p>But they were interrupted by Agatha’s phone ringing obnoxiously on the coffee table and a loud groan emitting from the woman beneath her.</p><p>“It’s Stark. He said he’d call. I have to take this. Policy discussions,” she mumbled as Rio began to move off of her.</p><p>“It’s fine, I need to shower anyway.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced then but turned away to answer her phone as Rio left the room to rid herself for good of everything Abigail.</p><p>The rest of the month Rio spent sifting through her remaining clients and bookings, seeing some people as she usually would, but not taking on either any new clients, or any new bookings. It felt strange, seeing her inbox pile high with requests, with questions as to her whereabouts, with insistent, constant messages from Abigail, but she kept her cool and responded to each one in turn. Always polite, always professional, but firm in her unavailability.</p><p>Her time with Agatha was still few and far between but with her diary opening up a little more over the next few weeks, Rio went and stayed with Agatha in D.C.</p><p>It was here that she realised, when staying in Agatha’s house during the week, just how much work Agatha had to do. She was either constantly out at meetings or constantly holed up in her office.</p><p>The only time Rio saw Agatha happy, relaxed, during this time was when she was curled around her from the early hours until dawn, or Rio was making her moan on the nights when Agatha wasn’t so tired she fell asleep within five minutes.</p><p>Agatha was still possessive, her desire for Rio not diminished even when she knew Rio was slowly culling her clientele, and had removed the one who offended her the most, and Rio sometimes wondered how Agatha had the energy to cause her inability to walk straight the next day but she was grateful she had it. Pleased she could provide a healthy and enjoyable outlet for the woman’s stress.</p><h4>September/October</h4><p>But life was still happening and Rio was still working, albeit much less.</p><p>The one date she still had in her diary, that she’d neither broken off or contacted about a change in arrangements was with Amy Collins, the younger lawyer who wanted Rio to help her come to terms with her sexuality, help her to be confident enough to be seen in public with a woman, to come out to her friends and family, and to know what to do in the bedroom.</p><p>Amy was 36, pretty, smart, and from what Rio could tell, very shy. She’d been brought up Mormon, was from Utah, had five brothers, and a close knit family. She’d left the church when she was in her mid-twenties after she’d graduated from law school. And it was only in the last couple of years she’d been beginning to think that dating men just wasn’t for her.</p><p>Rio had, as she usually did, put a lot of effort into how she’d work with Amy. The woman had been honest about her budget, so Rio knew that a day and night with her was all she had. She’d asked for the basics, when it came to intimacy. She wanted Rio to teach her what pleasure could be, and how to give it to another woman.</p><p>So Rio had planned a proper date day. A day she would want to have with Agatha. She had arranged to meet Amy at the top of the park on the east side, where she brought her her favourite coffee and kissed her sweetly on the cheek - easing Amy into physical affection slowly, knowing they’d have to work their way up.</p><p>But Rio knew that she could provide easy smiles, soft touches, and gentle encouragement without really trying. Within ten minutes of strolling through the park, Amy had already taken her hand and Rio had interlocked their fingers with a grin.</p><p>They talked easily, Amy’s gaze never far from Rio even as Rio took in the sights and sounds of a busy and warm Saturday in the park. By the time they hit the boating lake, Amy’s hand had found Rio’s arm as they sat close on a bench and Rio had turned to her more fully, “So, check in? How’re you feeling?”</p><p>Amy blushed at the question and looked away quickly to hide it but Rio brought her back around with a gentle, not unkind laugh, “Hey. Relax. I’m just checking in. Too much? Not enough? We have a long day ahead if you’re not…”</p><p>But her words were cut short as soft lips found her own and she blinked in surprise but returned the kiss gently, pulling away only when Amy did.</p><p>“Sorry. I just… I’ve been wanting to do that since you arrived.”</p><p>Rio smiled in understanding and even though it felt more like a betrayal than any other kiss in the past few weeks had, she kissed Amy again.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon was spent like this, hand in hand as they explored the park, then hit up the museum, had lunch in a nearby cafe,  then walked the length of Manhattan to hit the village.</p><p>They remained hand in hand almost the whole time, with Amy getting slowly more confident as the day went on. Even to the point of requesting Rio kiss her on a quiet street corner in the depths of midtown.</p><p>Rio insisted they didn’t have wine at dinner. She knew Amy was nervous, could see it in her gaze and the slight warmth of her palm against hers over the table, and she didn’t want her to lose sight of what exactly she was comfortable with and what she wasn’t as it got closer and closer to Rio taking her to bed.</p><p>After dinner, Rio took Amy to a small dive bar not far from Amy’s apartment and suggested they get just one drink each to calm Amy’s nerves.</p><p>As she took her seat on the stool, she reached over and placed a reassuring hand on Amy’s thigh, squeezing it gently as she ordered a gin and tonic and a vodka soda.</p><p>“You’ve been very patient,” Amy said quietly, her hands now toying with Rio’s fingers. “But I’m not sure I’ll be very good at…”</p><p>But Rio interrupted her thought with a hand against her cheek, “But I will make sure that by the end of the night, you’re incredible, okay? Women will be lining up down the block to get to you.”</p><p>Amy grinned then, the faint blush returning to her cheeks as she gazed across at Rio. “You sure about that?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m positive,” Rio beamed at her, moving closer to kiss her softly, testing her confidence now she’d had half a drink and was in the dim, comforting light of a noisy bar.</p><p>Amy leant into the kiss and deepened it of her own accord for the first time, experimentally pressing her tongue into Rio’s mouth and moving her hands to Rio’s waist.</p><p>They kissed like that for a while, Rio allowing Amy to take the lead, aware she’d never kissed a woman like this before, let alone in a bar.</p><p>But in the pit of her stomach she could feel the gnawing, cloying guilt settle again, feeling the betrayal thicken with every brush of Amy’s tongue against her own.</p><p>It was when they pulled back, both smiling and slightly out of breath that the mood changed suddenly. Amy’s gaze was shy but pleased as she glanced past Rio, but it became surprised and her face flushed a deep red all of a sudden. “Alice! Oh my god! What are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio’s world span in the split second it took her to whip around and stare at this Alice, knowing before she even laid eyes on her who it would be.</p><p>Alice stood just two feet away from them both, staring open-mouthed at Rio, her eyes wide before they narrowed and Rio felt her stomach flip at the death-stare she was receiving from the other woman.</p><p>Alice Wu-Gulliver was going to kill her.</p>

<p>Alice Wu-Gulliver was going to fucking kill her.</p><p>In the split second it took Rio’s worst fears to be realised, for her to recognise Alice, she had many thoughts.</p><p>All, quite naturally, pertaining to Agatha.</p><p>It was as if she’d been hit by a truck and her life were flashing before her eyes. Only in this instance her life was Agatha.</p><p>One of the very first things Rio had promised Agatha on the flight where they’d met was her absolute, all-encompassing discretion. She had reassured her multiple times that she could pull the wool over her friends’ eyes and that her secret was as safe as safe could be.</p><p>And in the months after their first meeting, in her words and in her actions, she’d reassured Agatha again and again that what they had wasn’t just secret, it was sacred.</p><p>But now, the woman who Rio had found an easy, a quick, a true, friendship with over the week they’d spent together in London, was staring at her like she was a piece of shit. And if Rio had more time to dwell on it, she might have agreed with her.</p><p>But before she could say anything, before she could so much as blink, Alice was speaking: “What the <em>fuck</em> do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>“Alice…”</p><p>Practised hands found their way to Rio’s collar and to her hair just as Rio had begun to swing her legs round on the stool. Without so much as a warning, she was flung from her seat with a harshness that took her breath away even if the sharp pain of the table she’d been thrown into hadn’t.</p><p>Rio gasped in pain as she doubled over the table that had once been opposite her, turning around with her hands raised in surrender just as a voice entered the fray.</p><p>“Hey, that’s-… that’s my girlfriend.”</p><p>Amy had stood from her own stool, her eyes wide and frightened.</p><p>If the situation hadn’t been so volatile, Rio might have been proud that her client had so openly, so bravely outed herself in that moment. But the danger was still present. And Amy’s words did nothing to calm Alice.</p><p>“Alice…,” Rio began to plead, raising herself to her full height as she kept her hands up in front of herself. “Let me…”</p><p>But Alice took a step and Rio, despite her reputation on the basketball court, took a step back.</p><p>The woman before her was no longer the affable, easy going friend she’d once had. They hadn’t spoken in months but Rio knew Alice asked after her. She knew she’d been bothering Agatha for her number still. She knew she had affection for her, that she had annoyed Agatha so much one day in asking about her that Agatha had described her as a “groupie without the obvious benefits”.</p><p>But this woman was different. This woman had hatred in her eyes and steel in her fists.</p><p>
<em>”Out!”</em>
</p><p>The shout so startled the now quiet bar that even Alice faltered as she made another move towards Rio. This hesitation gave Rio a chance to move aside, to step further out of the shorter woman’s reach even as a bouncer arrived to step between them and physically block Alice’s attempts to get to Rio again.</p><p>Rio winced at not only the sight of Alice trying to get at her but the words she was shouting, and if she were being at all honest, the sharp pain in her ribs.</p><p>“I’m going to <em>kill</em> you,” she screamed. “I fucking knew it, I <em>knew</em> it!”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and choked on it, her body undecided whether she was to cough it up or vomit it up. And she dry heaved silently as she watched the still screaming woman be dragged away.</p><p>Whether impulse or an illogical reasoning that she could fix this, her one working brain cell told her to run, to chase after Alice. Her mind racing even as her body began to betray her, her legs like lead as she turned to Amy.</p><p>“I-I… I have to go,” she stammered out, stumbling as she reached for her purse and briefly making contact with Amy’s arm. “I’ll call you, I-…” but the words died on her tongue as she crashed through the bar to get to the small Asian woman now punching and kicking at the mountain of a man holding her at arm’s length.</p><p>“A-Alice!” Rio shouted after her, throwing herself into harm’s way as she attempted to pull the woman back, not quite thinking this move through as Alice wrestled now with her, rather than the bouncer. Rio fought valiantly, trying her best to hold down grabbing, flailing arms and hold Alice in place but the shorter woman had the upper hand. Rio was in pain. And Alice had momentum. And she had rage.</p><p>She threw them both back into a shuttered doorway, Rio’s back coming into contact with the heavy metal shutters with a loud crash.</p><p>But she didn’t have time to register the additional pain as Alice struggled from her grip and forcefully turned herself around, her hands grasping Rio’s shirt so painfully tightly that Rio actually whimpered. “A-Alice… please. <em>Please</em> let me explain…”</p><p>Long forgotten now by the bouncer who threw his hands up at the women and turned away to continue his watch over the door to the bar, Alice and Rio stared at each other. Rio’s eyes were wide and overflowing with tears and she slumped against the shutters with no real fight in her anymore as Alice’s steely gaze faltered ever so slightly and she adjusted her hold on Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“I trusted you,” she spat, fighting against the affection she’d once had for Rio. The hopes that she was the one for Agatha and the belief that they would be lifelong friends.</p><p>“How could you?” These words came out as little more than a whisper, a genuine question to the woman whom she saw as having betrayed her best friend so utterly, so totally.</p><p>And in Alice’s eyes Rio felt every ounce of that betrayal. She’d let Agatha down when all Agatha had done, all Agatha was currently killing herself over, was to protect Rio.</p><p>A sob escaped her lips and she grasped at Alice’s hands, daring to reach for Alice’s cheek to beseech her, to beg her for any modicum of understanding, of forgiveness.</p><p>“Please… please just… it’s not what you think...”</p><p>Alice scoffed, having jerked away from Rio’s touch, and shoved Rio violently before she dropped her hold on her, sneering as she turned away to storm down the street, but not moving quite fast enough that Rio didn’t see the tears that had fallen from Alice’s anger-filled eyes.</p><p>Rio whimpered again and sunk to the floor with her head in her hands, her sobs racking her body as they came.</p><p>By the time Rio had calmed herself enough to find her phone, she’d convinced herself that Agatha would have no time for Rio after this. That she would never forgive her for being so careless. That she would never get over the embarrassment of having been caught out by her friend catching her supposed girlfriend with another woman.</p><p>Her fingers shook as they hovered over the contact for Agatha Harkness but with whatever ounce of courage she had left, she pressed the name like it was a caress of the woman herself.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She didn’t answer the second time Rio called her either.</p><p>She answered on the third.</p><p>At this point, Rio had wiped her tears and now snotty nose on the back of her hand, on the collar of her shirt, on the sleeve of her light green jacket. She was a mess, and she was sore all over. The empty, broken vessel that was once the poised, confident, cheery Rio Vidal was now stumbling down the street towards Agatha’s apartment, breathing heavily and trying to hold herself together.</p><p>“Rio, honey, are you okay? It’s late and I thought-…”</p><p>But at the sound of Agatha’s voice, Rio had released another sob, and had to stop at the corner of the block to try and keep it together.</p><p>“Agatha, I-… I’m so sorry…”</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath and heard the telltale sign of a heavy duvet being moved, and could picture now the panic in Agatha’s face, across her otherworldly, Hellenistic features that she’d grown so accustomed to, that she’d begun to understand each twitch of muscle in, each variation in expression, as she spoke: “What’s wrong? Where are you?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was panicked but not harsh, not what Rio had expected it to be had Alice already got to her. But she couldn’t hold her own panic as she placed a hand against her chest and took a shuddering breath in, “It’s Alice. She-… she saw me with… she <em>saw</em> me.”</p><p>There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the phone and then silence. Rio closed her eyes and counted the seconds it took before she heard Agatha’s voice again. It was seven.</p><p>“Rio, where are you?”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat at the softness to the question, at the concern in Agatha’s voice. “I-I’m almost at your apartment.”</p><p>Agatha took another second to respond but she heard movement down the line as she did. “Alice will be there. She’s staying, I forgot to tell you, I’ve been… she arrived this morning. Go to the apartment. Stay there. I’ll be there as soon as I can.”</p><p>The words tumbled from Agatha’s lips almost faster than Rio could comprehend them, but they were the encouragement she needed to force her legs to move, force herself to get to the place she’d once considered a haven.</p><p>“O-okay,” she stammered out, her breathing still uneven. “Agatha?”</p><p>There was silence again and Rio had to check to make sure Agatha hadn’t already hung up, but she heard a door open and close and a voice shortly afterwards, “It’s okay. I’ll stay on the line until you get there.”</p><p>Rio swallowed down her tears as they threatened to come again, the reassurance she had desperately hoped for not quite there in Agatha’s voice.</p><p>“I-I’m sorry. I-…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha murmured quickly, her tone a little softer this time. “I know.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, and stepped out into the street without looking, causing a car to aggressively honk at her, and for her system to shock itself into waking up, paying attention to the world around her. She stumbled up the opposite curb and muttered a curse as a stubbed toe was added to the pain in her bruised body.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“I just… wasn’t looking.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha started, “I need you to be in one piece when I get there, okay? Just… look where you’re going.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything after that, concentrating on her breathing as well as the soft distant movements of Agatha on the other end of the line. All she wanted was to have the woman in front of her, for Agatha to appear in the street and tell her it was all fine, that she hadn’t messed up possibly the best thing that had happened to her in a very long time.</p><p>It was when she heard a car door open and close against her ear, rather than in the street, that she finally spoke again, her voice a little more steady. “Are you on your way?”</p><p>“Yes. I’ll be as fast as I can.”</p><p>Rio took in a slow breath at this news, mentally calculating that even with the night traffic at a minimum it would still be another four hours for them to arrive, even if Jimmy broke every speed limit imaginable.</p><p>“What will I say to Alice? She wants to… she was so <em>mad</em>, Agatha.”</p><p>“I’ll call her. As soon as I know you’re safe. I’ll call her.”</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair and looked up at the sky, closing her eyes for the briefest of moments and this time making sure that she was in the middle of the sidewalk, nowhere near oncoming traffic.</p><p>“Agatha, will we be okay?”</p><p>The question came from somewhere deep inside of her, somewhere that felt like her most vulnerable self. But until it was answered, Rio wasn’t sure she could go anywhere near Agatha’s apartment.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha started softly, her tone back to the soft, almost whispered timbre it had been so many times before. Times when Rio hadn’t ruined everything. “Can you just get to the apartment? I-I… I just need to know you’re safe. You don’t sound… please just get there.”</p><p>Rio felt it deep within her chest, the very real potential that this was the end of the road.</p><p>She whimpered despite herself and the tears she’d thought had dried up began to fall again, silent companions as she continued along the few blocks left to Agatha’s on Jane.</p><p>When Rio found herself outside the familiar building, she hesitated, chewing on her lip as she wiped hurriedly at her eyes.</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>“Good, okay, I want to hear you go in. I want to know you’re with Alice.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily, clearing her throat as she weighed up her options here. “Agatha, I don’t know if this is a good idea. I think that…”</p><p>“Rio, please,” Agatha sounded firm again, “Please go inside.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried again, taking in a shaking breath, “Alice really isn’t…”</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. Just-…”</p><p>But Agatha huffed out a heavy breath as Rio blanched a little at her sudden harshness.</p><p>“Just, <em>please</em>, go inside. Please.”</p><p>Rio sighed again then, too tired and too emotionally raw to fight anymore, too convinced of Agatha’s changed feelings towards her, and her own guilt, that she accepted her fate. She said nothing and listened to the soft sounds of Agatha’s breathing down the line to try and steady her, consciously trying to absorb every last piece of her as she stepped into the small lobby and went to the elevator.</p><p>As Rio pressed the button for Agatha’s floor she heard a quieter, “Rio?”</p><p>It made her heart clench, and she wondered how many more times she’d hear Agatha say her name, how many more times she’d hear that soft voice reserved only for her.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I’m sorry I’m not there.”</p><p>Rio’s face collapsed in on itself then, a deep crease forming between her brows as she tried to keep it together, tried desperately to hold in her tears again as they threatened to spill. A soft noise from the base of her throat gave her away as she struggled to keep herself together, prevent the dam from breaking again.</p><p>But she was saved from responding by the ding of the elevator doors and she stepped out into the hall, wiping roughly at the dried tear tracks against her cheeks. She took a shakey breath and focused on getting her breathing back to normal.</p><p>Awaiting her in Agatha’s apartment was surely a het up, angry Alice, who wouldn’t take any pleasure in seeing Rio again. Let alone seeing her looking so broken, so sorry for herself. So she remained on the line with Agatha, standing still in the hall until she was confident that no sobs would pass her lips again, until her breathing was more even, until her hand shook less at her side.</p><p>When, and only when, Rio felt like she could have a conversation with Alice without breaking down, and that she might be able to even hold her own against her if she jumped her again, Rio finally spoke into the phone.</p><p>“I’m here. You’ll call her? As soon as I’m in?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha breathed immediately, sounding so breathless that Rio wondered if she’d been holding her breath in the time Rio had taken to gather herself.</p><p>Rio nodded silently, and reached into her purse for her keys, finding Agatha’s small gold one and slotting it into the lock with the soft noise of the metal gears finding their home. She turned it, then pushed the door to, taking a breath as she said, “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha released a breath of relief and Rio heard a shifting on the other end of the line before her voice came floating back to her ear and settled somewhere between her ribs, somewhere between hope and loss. “Call me again if you need me. I’ll be there as soon as I can.”</p><p>Rio nodded again, her voice failing her as she stepped into the apartment. She hung up, her thumb finding the red button before her brain to could tell her not to, and as she closed the door behind her she felt the apartment wrap itself around her. As if it were Agatha herself. As if her strong hold and her constant presence had settled about her, welcoming her into the warmth.</p><p>But there was no warmth waiting for her as she stepped towards the living room, avoiding looking in the mirror for fear of what she’d see.</p><p>There was a lamp on, a tall freestanding lamp that arched over the chair Agatha always took. The chair she often pulled Rio into with her, just to be closer, just to hold her. But the occupier this night was Alice.</p><p>She was curled in on herself like a cat about to pounce, her dark eyes flying to Rio and narrowing immediately as she took in the sight of this red-eyed, broken creature.</p><p>“You’ve got some fucking nerve.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and stepped further into the living room, her keys held in one hand, her phone still clutched in her other. Lifelines. Talismans that said she belonged here, that said Agatha had granted her access, had walked her to this place.</p><p>“You just need to listen,” Rio started softly, her voice catching ever so slightly as she stood still, unsure what Alice would do if she moved any closer. But Alice hadn’t moved yet, hadn’t even twitched as she kept her gaze on Rio, her eyes darting over her body, looking for any sign that she should have known this would happen, that she bore the same telltale signs that Wanda always had. But Rio was different, Alice had liked Rio. Alice had fallen for her bright smiles and her loud laugh, her ability to bring out the same in Agatha.</p><p>“Listen? I’m not sure anything needs to be said. Your tongue was so far down her fucking throat you could have been-…”</p><p>But she was interrupted by a loud vibration, a sudden second light in the dark room. Her phone shook on the coffee table in front of her and two sets of brown eyes turned to look at it.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Alice jumped then, snatching the phone like it was her prey and she’d been waiting patiently in the brush for it to appear.</p><p>“Agatha. I’ve been trying to call.”</p><p>Rio released a slow breath as she stepped closer to the couch, her hands releasing her protective charms and instead clutching the back of the sofa as she stared intently at Alice, trying to figure out what was being said, how she’d take it. How Agatha was.</p><p>“What-… fuck no, this is <em>about</em> Rio.”</p><p>Alice threw her hands up in the air then, her anger beginning to come out in full force as whatever Agatha was saying was setting her off again, “No, <em>Agatha</em> I don’t give a flying <em>FUCK</em> how she is, she’s just had her <em>tongue</em> down another woman’s throat!”</p><p>There was a pause where Alice released a frustrated huff and clutched at her head, beginning to pace.</p><p>“Agatha, you’re not listening…”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“No. Fuck. No.”</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>“Agath-…”</p><p>A pause again. Longer this time.</p><p>And then Alice stopped in her tracks and she turned to look at Rio, her eyes wide suddenly, her mouth moving around words she couldn’t quite say as she continued to listen to the woman on the other end of the line.</p><p>Rio didn’t look away from Alice, she kept her gaze on her, wondering just how much, if anything, Agatha was divulging. Was she telling her the truth? The partial truth? Nothing but the truth?</p><p>Her hands felt sweaty as she gripped the fabric beneath them and she swayed slightly where she stood, gazing across at the woman now closing her eyes and breathing out slowly through parted lips.</p><p>“Agatha, I… you should have told us…”</p><p>There it was. Some confirmation that Agatha had opted for some sort of truth, that she’d given Alice at least a little piece of their shared secret. Enough to make Alice’s hand rise up and clutch at her own throat as if she were choking on something, enough to make a silent tear fall from one eye, and enough to make her gulp so thickly that Rio watched her throat bob.</p><p>“No,” her voice came out much softer then, like the voice she’d used to quietly ask Rio for a shot of tequila before her wedding, like the voice she’d used when making crude jokes in the gallery all those weeks ago. “No, she’s here she’s… I’ll make sure she’s okay.”</p><p>Alice hung up her phone then, dropping it to hang lamely by her side as her eyes opened and she stared across at Rio. Rio’s breath caught in her throat at the contrast in Alice’s expression now versus just ten minutes ago. She looked guilt-ridden, she looked devastated.</p><p>“You’re an escort?”</p><p>The question was quiet, the kind of question you might ask a sick person in their bed: ‘how’re you feeling?’ ‘Do you want me to fetch the nurse?’</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond but found the words wouldn’t come, her shock at Agatha having told the truth, especially when she wasn’t with Rio, making her mute. She nodded.</p><p>Alice nodded too, her gaze dropping down somewhere between Rio’s stomach and her chest, “I’m sorry. I’m… I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio knew what she meant, what she was apologising for. She’d reacted instinctively, aggressively, protectively. In any other circumstance Rio might have acted the same way. Anything, any how, to protect Agatha.</p><p>She shook her head, brushing off the apology and forcing a tight smile in Alice’s direction that surely came off as more of a grimace.</p><p>But Alice was moving, closing the distance between them and rounding on Rio with a sudden urgency that made Rio cautious of her next move.</p><p>“Can I…?”</p><p>Alice’s phone was forgotten with Rio’s on the couch, her hands now held out to her. And Rio nodded gently, keeping facing forwards and leaning on the couch but lifting her arm out of the way so Alice could access her right side.</p><p>There was silence in the grand living room of Agatha Harkness’s apartment. The only sounds now the laboured breaths of two women fighting their own guilt, their sudden shame at their actions from the night.</p><p>Alice’s touch was tender but her fingers were rough as they skirted over the skin at Rio’s side, causing her to take in a sharp breath that did nothing to dull the still sharper pain.</p><p>Alice held her shirt up just enough to see the injured area, no bruise yet showing but Rio’s laboured breathing and her tense body enough to tell her that she should be ashamed of herself.</p><p>“I’m going to take you to the hospital.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio lied quietly, turning her head to catch Alice’s eyes and offering another tight smile. “Really. I’ve had worse.”</p><p>But Alice couldn’t even attempt to match Rio’s smile and as she let her shirt drop again she frowned deeply at Rio, her hand moving to hers on the couch, “Rio, I’m so fucking sorry. I saw red. I thought-…” she stopped herself and closed her eyes as she took in a slow breath, “I couldn’t let it happen again. I couldn’t watch Agatha go through it.”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio started softly, turning fully to the shorter woman but keeping her hand in hers, “I probably would have done the same. Is… how did she sound?”</p><p>But Alice had moved away again, going back to Agatha’s chair and placing her head in her hands, “Fuck! This fucking woman!”</p><p>The sight of her, the image of one of Agatha’s friends so distraught, made Rio want to breakdown all over again, but she took in a steady breath and instead moved around to perch on the couch, as near to Alice as she could be.</p><p>“Alice,” she tried again, clutching the cushion beneath her to ground herself as she focused on trying to calm down, “How much did she tell you?”</p><p>“She told me she hired you. And that…” Alice’s hands dropped then, and Rio saw that she was crying again, “and that it became something more.”</p><p>Rio’s heart leapt into her throat and she dropped her gaze to her knees as she processed this. Agatha had told Alice what she did but she’d also admitted the relationship. She claimed Rio.</p><p>“Has it?” Rio gazed back at Alice, frowning a little at the question, “has it become more? Is this… is it real?”</p><p>“More real than I can even say,” Rio admitted at barely above a whisper.</p><p>Alice roughly wiped at her eyes then, nodding as she continued to study Rio. She looked as if her heart had been broken that night and in thinking of it, Rio wondered if Alice had told Jen. If Lilia knew. If she’d always known. If Billy knew.</p><p>“You look like shit,” Alice said suddenly, apparently unsure or unable to say anything else for fear she’d start crying again.</p><p>The comment caught Rio by surprise and in spite of herself she laughed, a real, true laugh that caused the sharp pain in her chest to intensify and she groaned as she clutched her side, “Fuck. You got me so good.”</p><p>Alice’s mirth had turned to concern and she went back to sit beside Rio, her hands hovering again but unsure, unwilling to touch without knowing what to do or how not to cause Rio more pain.</p><p>“She’ll kill me for that, you know.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio groaned quietly, shuffling to lean back into the cushions, “I’m not entirely convinced she doesn’t want to kill me either though.”</p><p>“She doesn’t,” Alice said quickly, biting down on her lower lip all of a sudden as if to stop herself from saying something. “All she was worried about was that you were okay and I wouldn’t let you leave.”</p><p>A feeling very similar to relief began to flood into Rio’s stomach but the churning, gnawing guilt was still there, not allowing it to grow beyond the small glimmer of hope.</p><p>“Maybe it’s for a quick double homicide,” Rio offered, anything to distract from the pain and the cloying fear in her stomach.</p><p>“Maybe. Think we can hold our own though.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and closed her eyes as her fingers tentatively pressed into the injury at her side. She wondered vaguely if she’d broken a rib but surely she’d be in much more pain than that? Just as she was beginning to focus more on her physical pain than her mental anguish Alice spoke again.</p><p>“I like you, you know. I… I liked you immediately. I never did with Wanda. Or any of the girls Agatha dated in college. She always… they always took advantage. Of her money, her status, her heart.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, turning her gaze to Alice who was now frowning down at the floor, lost in her own thoughts, “She hadn’t… she’d never had love at home. But then she had us. And we loved her fiercely, but it wasn’t the kind of love she craved. And then Wanda came along and she was... She love-bombed her. Gave her everything. Convinced her she was the one, the one who could give her everything she’d never believed she could have. She clung to her arm like she was a fucking limpet. Jen and I couldn’t get close for years, not without <em>her</em> there. She preyed on her goodness and by the time Agatha realised what had happened, what she’d done, it was too late. They were married and Agatha was too… too damn arrogant to admit she’d been manipulated. To say she’d been wrong.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a slow breath and exhaled gently, her fingers still twitching lightly at her side.</p><p>“It was me who told Agatha what Wanda had been doing behind her back. All those women… for years she’d been doing it. Years and fucking years. She never fucking cared about her. She convinced her she was in love and then tore her down piece by fucking piece.”</p><p>Alice stopped then, wiping at her eyes roughly and sniffing. Rio instinctively reached for her hand and interlocked their fingers, feeling the slightly rough pads of Alice’s brush over the back of her hand.</p><p>“She just took and took from her until there was nothing left and… she shut us all out. She wouldn’t speak to us for a whole year. She hid and she buried herself in work. And then one day she appeared on our doorstep when we lived on the upper west side. She’d bought this place and was the Agatha we knew again, the Agatha we <em>loved</em>. And I…”</p><p>But Alice’s voice had broken then, her face crumbling in on itself as she tried to hold back her tears, “I saw you… and I thought… I thought it was happening again.”</p><p>Rio’s own tears were flowing freely now, unbidden, unchecked. And she didn’t hesitate as she threw her body around and gasped loudly as she wrapped her upper half around Alice, pulling her into an impossible hug that set her whole body alight with pain.</p><p>Alice began to sob then, clutching at Rio’s now sodden shirt as she did so. Rio couldn’t see for the tears, couldn’t think for the pain, but she held onto Alice for the love she’d given Agatha, for the pain she’d endured for her, through her, and as a silent thank you for protecting her.</p><p>They stayed like that until Alice’s sobs had calmed and Rio thought she might pass out from the pain. She pulled away slowly, her face now contorted in agony as she settled back against the cushions and closed her eyes.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice mumbled shakily, reaching for her side again and watching as Rio’s body reacted with a violent jerk, “Hey… I gotta take you to the hospital. I can’t leave you like this.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio breathed slowly, “I’m fine, really. I just need to not move for a while.”</p><p>But Alice was moving, moving up and away, pulling now at Rio’s arms, “I’ve broken your fucking rib. Come.”</p><p>But Rio wouldn’t budge, wouldn’t move an inch if it meant being further away from Agatha, making her wait one more minute to see her.</p><p>“I’m not going,” she insisted, her eyes opening now to stare stubbornly up at Alice. “They can’t do anything anyway. I just need to rest.”</p><p>Alice scowled but stopped her pulling and dropped Rio’s arms, “Can I put you to bed at least?”</p><p>Rio weighed this option up silently, knowing a couple hours sleep would get her closer to Agatha’s arrival with less pain in between but she wanted to stay up, wanted to talk to Alice more, wanted to know more about the woman she’d been crying over all night.</p><p>“Does she talk about me?”</p><p>Alice raised her brows in surprise but ducked her head to hide the smile that had threatened her stormy features. “Yes. Almost exclusively.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched then and she patted the space beside her for Alice to sit back down, “Yeah?”</p><p>Alice hummed and nodded, still watching Rio cautiously, “She told us you’ve got a mean friend.”</p><p>“Mean?” Rio laughed, despite the pain. “Natasha. She’s not mean. She’s a little like you actually. She might have thrown Agatha through a window though so I got off lightly.”</p><p>Alice didn’t seem to find this funny and shifted to grab a cushion and place it just behind Rio’s back to prop her up slightly.</p><p>Rio made a soft noise of protest but caught Alice’s eye and saw that she not only looked concerned but that she looked genuinely scared for her. “I’m fine, Alice. I just want to see Agatha.”</p><p>Alice didn’t say anything after that but she kept a close eye on Rio, her hands fidgeting in her lap until Rio reached out and took them in her own, holding them still.</p><p>They remained quiet together in this strangely intimate position for a few minutes as Rio’s mind, and she was sure Alice’s too, whirred with the newly acquired knowledge of Agatha’s past. Her lack of love in her home life. The fake, manipulative love of Wanda. The self-imposed exile from the few people who did actually love her. And the unavoidable reality that Rio’s job, the thing she’d worked for all her life, one of the things she was proudest of, the thing that her brought Agatha into her life, must have been one of the greatest sources of pain for Agatha.</p><p>Her aching ribs were the least of her concerns as she thought back to every conversation they’d ever had about Rio’s job. Of every heated discussion. Every look on Agatha’s face when she’d seen her with Abigail. When she’d heard that Wanda had tried it on.</p><p>The phantom hand of Wanda across her ribs made her twitch suddenly, as if shaking off the ghostly aberration and Alice moved suddenly, panic settling into her features as she turned to look at Rio more fully. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded and produced a tight smile at this, her fingers curling more tightly around Alice’s. “Fine. Just… thinking.”</p><p>Alice seemed to understand and placed her head back against the couch cushions again as she watched Rio closely, “When did you know?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow and turned curiously to Alice, guessing at what she was asking. “The moment I saw her on the plane. She was… rude, haughty, magnificent. I was hooked.”</p><p>The slightest of smiles played on Alice’s lips then and she responded, “Quite different to poor Amy. What happened with her?”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily, adding to the guilt she already felt was the sudden memory of her failed date with the sweet, shy, Amy. “She hired me to help her,” she glanced at Alice briefly but knew the jig was up already so she wasn’t technically doing anything wrong as she said, “come out. She wanted someone to practise being out in public with. And to…” she trailed off and looked down at their joined hands, wandering if Alice would have a problem with the confirmation that Rio wasn’t just for show with her clients.</p><p>“Sleep with her?” Alice finished softly, so Rio wouldn’t have to say it.</p><p>“Yes. She’d never been with a woman and… she wanted help.”</p><p>Alice nodded slowly, her gaze now sweeping steadily over Rio’s torn features, “And Agatha knew you were still…?”</p><p>“Yes. She wasn’t happy about it. And we never discussed it. Not properly. But she always knew when I was with a client. She always checked in. Always…” she squeezed her eyes shut as a tear betrayed her and fell across her cheek, “always made sure I was safe.”</p><p>Alice remained quiet for a while before she spoke again, softer this time, “I met Amy through work. I don’t know her well but she always seemed kind. Was she… was she kind?”</p><p>Rio could feel the meaning behind Alice’s words, knowing that her protective instincts were suddenly flaring up again, not for Agatha this time, but for Rio.</p><p>“She was kind,” Rio confirmed, squeezing Alice’s hand a little.</p><p>“And the others? All kind too?”</p><p>Rio didn’t have the heart to tell Alice that, no, they weren’t all kind. She didn’t want her to think less of her, to think that she was weak or stupid and couldn’t stand up for herself. So she lied, though she guessed Alice could see through it. “All kind.”</p><p>They fell back into silence then, each in their own little hells as they thought on what had happened, what they’d done, and what would become of them when Agatha was back.</p><p>After a little longer spent in silence, Alice got up to fetch Rio pain relief. Though she refused anything that might make her sleepy or woozy.</p><p>They then returned to their positions on the couch, cautiously close, like two frightened rabbits waiting for the headlights to hit.</p><p>Time felt slow and fast all at once as they waited on Agatha. Rio’s brain was starting to feel hazy from the pain she was in and her body ached all over, her back uncomfortable and the slight scratches on her arms from her scrap with Alice twinging whenever she pressed at them.</p><p>Alice suggested the hospital every half an hour or so, watching as the light steadily dulled in Rio’s red eyes as she got more tired, more uncomfortable. But Rio refused every time, focusing on only the arrival of Agatha.</p><p>By the time they heard a key in the door and the familiar, confident stride of their mutual obsession that evening, Rio felt like she might faint.</p><p>But she shifted as she heard the living room door push open and turned to see a scared looking Agatha standing in a long overcoat, her phone clutched at her side and her bright blue eyes focused on Rio.</p>

<p>Up until this point, Rio’s life had been very organised. Very disciplined.</p><p>Work, <em> clients </em>, were between the hours of 9am and 7pm. Emails were professional, formal, even. She met them before she engaged with them. Or else, they spoke on the phone.</p><p>Her life was organised, planned, easy.</p><p>Until Agatha came in to it. Agatha who brought chaos. Made even her regular basketball schedule different (and difficult) because she was unavailable other than the weekends, and usually only had time spare when Rio was due to play. She was tempestuous and passionate: both things that made an easy time of it more difficult. But she was everything Rio wanted but didn’t know she needed.</p><p>So when she walked in that night: the night she had feared everything would fall to pieces around her, that she may have to go back to her quiet, easy life, she panicked as she saw the woman of her dreams, the woman who had changed everything, walk in.</p><p>Blue eyes the colour of a clear stream on a bright day bored into Rio’s darker brown ones as she stood in the grand room, out of place, looking furious and grandiose when Rio and Alice looked broken, tired, a mess. Rio stood slowly to greet the woman who had occupied her thoughts, not only this night, but every night since she’d received her email all those months ago.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio’s voice caught in her throat somewhat as she took a slow step towards Agatha who practically fell over herself to get to Rio.</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice warned softly, similarly rushing to Rio’s side, getting there just before Agatha did because she’d already been so close, but standing behind her, her hand hovering just behind her lower back as if to catch her in case she fell.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darted frantically over Rio’s face and body and briefly landed on Alice’s outstretched arm as she read between the lines.</p><p>“You’re hurt.”</p><p>“No, I’m fine.”</p><p>“Agatha-.”</p><p>“Where. Where are you hurt?”</p><p>Agatha had stopped not a foot away from Rio, her gaze sweeping still over her body as if she’d be able to spot the injury, as if she already knew she wasn’t right - her mind working overtime at the possibilities of how Rio could have come to be physically hurt. But Rio had stepped closer, moving faster than she thought she would be able to and she placed her hands cautiously on Agatha’s cobalt blue sweater, beneath her oversized charcoal coat, “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha frowned deeply then, all memory of the night’s drama forgotten as she focused on the biggest issue at hand: Rio in pain.</p><p>“Where?” She repeated firmly, her eyes now darting over Rio’s pained features and her hands remaining, twitching, at her sides.</p><p>“It’s her ribs,” Alice volunteered quietly, “I think they’re broken but she won’t let me take her to the hospital.”</p><p>Blue eyes moved from Rio to Alice and back again and a dark shadow swept over Agatha’s tired features as she took this information in, “How?”</p><p>Rio winced at the tone, hopes of a happy reconciliation dwindling as she fisted the fabric of Agatha’s sweater and stepped in closer. But she had had enough time to think on how this might go if she weren’t careful with the truth and so she glanced back at Alice, speaking before the smaller woman could admit fault, “Alice. Can you give us a minute? <em>Please?</em>”</p><p>But Alice didn’t move. And neither did Agatha.</p><p>“Rio. What <em>happened</em>?”</p><p>Rio shook her head as she turned back to Agatha and just as she was about to speak she heard Alice’s voice again.</p><p>“Agatha, I…”</p><p>“It was me. I pulled her from the bar and she landed on the table.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped as she saw this news play across Agatha’s face. Her hands remained gripped tightly in the fabric of her sweater, so tight that her knuckles had gone white and she feared she’d rip the soft fabric where she held it.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t moved, hadn’t spoken yet. She looked like a statue Rio had once seen in an old museum somewhere in Europe; beautiful, unmoving, fierce.</p><p>“Agatha,” she started again, but was interrupted suddenly by the statue coming to life and breathing air once again into the tense room.</p><p>“Get. Out.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was practically a growl, deeper and meaner than anything Rio had heard before. She sounded like she was trying hard to hold something in, to hold herself back, and as Rio’s gaze dropped to Agatha’s hands she saw that the once twitching fingers were now fists.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried again, her own voice now in a deeper register, though with none of the anger of her girlfriend’s. “It was an-…”</p><p>“<em>Out</em>.”</p><p>Agatha had moved her hands to push at Rio’s, trying to free herself of her tense hold on her as she snarled behind her at the third, smallest woman in the room.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was collapsing in on herself. She was holding back from exploding. Resisting the urge to scream and destroy the room around them. To destroy anything and everything but the woman before her.</p><p>“Rio,” the sound of her name shocked her out of her panic and gave Agatha a second to unpeel Rio’s fingers from her sweater but Rio had already turned slightly to see Alice and had less than a second to react to Agatha trying to move around her.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Her arms shot out to catch at Agatha’s waist and she grunted even as she held her firm. Alice had stepped back from the two of them and held her hands out in a position that reflected Rio’s own from a few hours earlier.</p><p>“Hey! Hey. I’m going, I’m going. But it was an-…”</p><p>“Alice I swear to all the fucking gods that I will <em>throw</em> you out if you don’t-…”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t straining against Rio, her hands now on her arm across her waist, almost holding her there, but she was leaning across her, still intent on Alice.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio felt herself whisper before she could stop herself, unsure how to calm the situation, “You can’t just…”</p><p>“She’s lucky I’m not calling the police,” Agatha spat viciously, eyes focused entirely on Alice still even as the smaller woman backed away, her hands still up.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha push a little against her hold and she didn’t know whether she wasn’t forcing it for her sake or if she had some semblance of sympathy for her best friend left that meant she wouldn’t <em>physically</em> rip her head off, and the assault on her would stay verbal, at least for now.</p><p>“Alice, stay,” Rio said firmly, now focusing on the shorter woman who had made it to the door. Alice had paused with her hand on the doorframe and she shot Rio a quick glance before she disappeared round the doorway and they could heard the door close behind her.</p><p>As the noise echoed around the room Rio swallowed and pulled away from Agatha who moved with her like a magnet, following her out to the front door of the large apartment. Rio ignored her, her concern for Alice alone forcing her to keep her back to the woman she’d been thinking about all evening, all day, all the time.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha tried just as Rio rounded into the hall but Rio didn’t stop.</p><p>“It’s three am. She’s-…”</p><p>But as her hand came into contact with the door handle, Agatha’s slammed into the door just above her shoulder.</p><p>“If she’s capable of breaking your ribs she’s capable of looking after herself on the-…”</p><p>Rio rounded then, firmer than she’d been before and fighting against her better angels. “Agatha. It was an <em>accident</em>. She took me by surprise because she saw…”</p><p>She trailed off and closed her eyes as she backed into the door and huffed out a slow breath. But she barely had time to think in her own silence, her thoughts disturbed by the presence of Agatha pressing closer to her, one hand still on the door and her other now at her hip, her body just inches away.</p><p>“She’ll be fine. Safer outside than she would be in this apartment.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open again and saw Agatha’s face inches away, her face still set in anger but her eyes less furious, slightly cautious as she watched Rio closely. “You wouldn’t do anything,” Rio uttered softly, sure that Agatha’s fury wouldn’t breach any physical boundaries even as she saw Agatha’s jaw flex and her gaze drop.</p><p>She was silent for a few seconds, blue eyes unsure, and her fingers flexing and unflexing against Rio’s hip.</p><p>“Can I see?”</p><p>It felt so puerile, so needlessly polite for Agatha to have to ask. Rio’s body had been explored time and time again by Agatha’s fingers, her lips, her tongue. She knew every inch of her almost better than she knew herself. And Rio began to worry that Agatha was distancing, that she was placing quiet barriers between them again.</p><p>But she nodded silently and allowed Agatha to lift her shirt as Alice had done earlier. The fingers that touched her this time were softer, familiar, and she swallowed thickly at the comparison. Alice who had caused this, who had been aggressive enough to do it but scared when she’d touched her, when she’d seen what she’d done. Then Agatha, Agatha who she knew would destroy the world for her, but who pulled away when it became too much, or shut down when things got difficult, who was inaccessible to everyone but a select few and who had promised Rio safety in her words and touches since they’d met. This contradiction, this infuriating kamikaze of passion and fire and tenderness and care. But Agatha was scared just like Alice. For different reasons. Rio felt it in her touch and she saw it in her hooded gaze.</p><p>She looked down to see what Agatha was seeing, having not looked at herself again since her arrival earlier and she groaned quietly at the sight of a burgeoning, large, bruise across the right side of her body: bluish purple, large, offensively contrasting against her lightly tanned skin.</p><p>Her eyes flickered then up to Agatha’s face and she saw what she’d been dreading all evening. Agatha looked angrier than even shed looked with Alice earlier. Her hands shook as she pulled away from Rio and she struggled to even look at her as pulled away entirely.</p><p>“We need to go to the hospital. Jimmy’s-…”</p><p>But Rio bit down on her lower lip and tugged her shirt down again, pushing off of the door, “No. I told Alice-…”</p><p>“I am not Alice. And I am not asking.”</p><p>Rio shook her head as she met Agatha’s firm gaze and she reached out to grasp her sweater again. “You need to calm down.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed then with something Rio knew to be unbidden rage, something she’d never seen Agatha direct her way before, but she didn’t say anything and simply pulled away from her touch.</p><p>“We’re going to the hospital. If it’s actually broken…”</p><p>But Rio was stepping back into Agatha again and pressing her hands down on her shoulders with her own face set, firm. “No. I’m not going.”</p><p>The muscles in Agatha’s jaw seemed to be working overtime then, her mind clearly made up with what they <em>should</em> be doing. But even Agatha knew that she couldn’t make her go.</p><p>“You’re being a brat.”</p><p>“I thought you liked that about me.”</p><p>Blue eyes rolled and Agatha once again looked exhausted as she lifted the heels of her palms to press into her eyes, “Now isn’t the time to-…”</p><p>“I know,” Rio acquiesced, her forced smirk easing a little as she dropped her hands from Agatha.</p><p>“Can I call Alice from your phone?”</p><p>Agatha’s thunderous expression hardened for a second before she closed her eyes and threw up her hands in a dramatic surrender.</p><p>“Fine. Fine. How you can even <em>begin</em> to be okay with this I…” but Agatha shut up then, taking her phone out from her back pocket and tapping a few buttons before she thrust it to Rio, flashing her a defeated look before she turned and swept back into the living room.</p><p>Rio watched her go and sighed as she pressed the call button on Agatha’s phone, slowly following her trail back into the living room.</p><p>As her eyes fell onto her form sat with her legs spread and her back ramrod straight in the armchair she heard Alice’s voice against her ear, urgent and breathless.</p><p>“Agatha? I’ve been trying to-…”</p><p>“It’s Rio. Are you okay? Will you come back?”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed up to meet Rio’s then and Rio refused to look away even as she heard the hesitation on the other end of the line and saw the disgust in Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I’m fine. Rio, I’m so fucking sorry. I’m just-… but I can’t come back. She’ll kill me.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily at this and ran a hand through her hair, wincing a little as she did. “It’s fine. Where are you?”</p><p>“I’ve called a friend. I’ll crash with her. Don’t worry about me just, please, go to the hospital.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and nodded silently, gritting her teeth as she thought it over.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll speak to you later.”</p><p>“Thanks for calling, Rio. Could you… tell Agatha how sorry I am?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio hung up the phone then and let it drop to the couch, raising her gaze again to look across at Agatha who had slumped back in her chair but who was still looking across at her.</p><p>“She’s staying with a friend. And she wanted me to tell you that…”</p><p>“I don’t give a shit what she wanted you to tell me.”</p><p>“Agatha, she really is-…”</p><p>The atmosphere changed in the room then, almost as of a switch had flicked in Agatha’s brain and a thundercloud appeared, dark and ominous. Agatha’s whole body looked coiled and ready, a predator intent on the strike. And she exploded, the rage she’d felt all evening, the fact that Rio wasn’t at all on her side about how fucking terrible this whole thing was, the fact that Alice was still walking, breathing, being forgiven by her girlfriend… it was too much for her.</p><p>“I am <em>IN LOVE WITH YOU</em>! What about that do you not understand?! Alice <em>attacked</em> you and you are <em>hurt</em> and you called me practically having a <em>panic attack</em> on the street because of <em>her</em>. You almost got hit by a fucking car! I will <em>not</em> forgive her. I will <em>not</em> speak to her ever again.”</p><p>Rio felt like she couldn’t breath, couldn’t think, all she could focus on was the fury emanating from Agatha who now stood in front of her chair, her chest heaving and her cheeks and nose pink from the exertion of the bellowing she’d just done.</p><p>But Agatha loved her. This raging, fire-spitting maniacal woman <em>loved</em> her.</p><p>She took a shaky breath in as Agatha turned from her and threw her hands up in the air, growling in frustration.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio started slowly, her hands shaking a little as she clutched the back of the couch.</p><p>“Agatha, what happened tonight… this <em>whole thing</em>. The reason you are killing yourself over the-…”</p><p>“No, do <em>not</em> bring Stark into this, Rio. This is about what Alice has done.”</p><p>“No,” Rio tried again, firmer this time as she moved around, taking steps towards the now pacing woman. “Listen to what I’m saying. All of it is because of me. Because of my <em>job</em>. Because Wanda found out and then because Alice did. And I…”</p><p>But Agatha had turned back around fully, face still the picture of fury and she pointed at Rio, square in the chest. “Alice <em>attacked</em> you. If Natasha had done the same to me…”</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio slapped Agatha’s hand away and froze with her hands up in midair still, her desperation to get her words out overtaking any control she had left. “Alice did this because she saw my tongue down another woman’s throat! She did it because she couldn’t stand the idea of me doing that to you! Of you going through…” but she trailed off and put her head in her hands with a heavy groan. “I have put you through… I can’t do it anymore.”</p><p>The silence rang around the room then as Agatha absorbed these words, her lips parted a little in disbelief and Rio looked back up again in just enough time to see the woman before her shatter.</p><p>“No, I meant, I can’t do my job anymore. I just want you. I <em>love</em> you and I don’t want to… I need to have just you.”</p><p>But Agatha had turned away again, her hands back to her sides, twitching slowly where she stood and Rio released a soft whimper as her lower lip betrayed her and trembled slightly.</p><p>Everything that had happened since they’d met. Everything <em>bad</em> that had come of it was all Rio. The weight of responsibility, of hurting this woman who presented to the world as powerful and fierce, but was fighting battles every day to protect someone who continued to hurt her, it made Rio want to collapse.</p><p>She stepped forwards and slowly, cautiously, traced her fingers up Agatha’s back, her breath uneven and her eyes wide as she felt Agatha turn slowly against her, turning to look at her with a deep frown.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, stepping into her and moving her hands to slip beneath the coat she still wore, tentatively gripping her hips. “I’m so sorry it’s taken me so long. That it’s taken <em>this</em> to happen for me to…”</p><p>Her words were lost then as Agatha moved to hold her face, closing the distance between them with a gentle urgency that made Rio’s whole body set alight.</p><p>Their lips met and Rio forgot herself again. It had been over a week since she’d last seen Agatha, over a week since she’d held her, and over a week since she’d been able to do <em>this</em>. But Rio moved to deepen the kiss, her breath hitched in her throat and she released a sudden whimper at the sharp pain in her chest and Agatha pulled away suddenly, her fingers still tangled in Rio’s hair.</p><p>“Please,” she said firmly, her voice barely above a whisper, all the pent up anger from before gone from her voice and lost in her expression, “Let me take you to the hospital.”</p><p>There was nothing left to do but for Rio to agree.</p><p>They made their way to New York Presbyterian in the back of Agatha’s car, the whole time Agatha held Rio’s hand like it would fall off if she released it even for a second. As they moved through the quiet streets of a sleeping manhattan, Rio felt her body begin to rally against her stil being awake, against her having not taken pain medication for at least two hours now, for her having not slept yet.</p><p>The hand held in hers anchored her to the moment and Agatha’s thigh against her own kept her in her body as they wove their way to the hospital. Jimmy had driven well beyond the speed limit at Agatha’s insistence.</p><p>When they finally arrived, Agatha only release her hand to get her safely out of the car and into the E.R.</p><p>She ushered her through and was already shouting demands to be seen as soon as possible with Rio squirming a little at her side.</p><p>By the time they were placed in a small room - mostly so the staff didn’t have to deal with Agatha’s aggressive huffs and eye rolls as they went through the usual questions - Agatha began to fill out Rio’s patient form for her.</p><p>Rio watched as she filled out all the basic information, contact details, basic medical etc. but saw the black pen hover uncertainly over the section for Next Of Kin.</p><p>“It’s always been Natasha but,” Rio cleared her throat softly, “It’s you.”</p><p>The nib of the pen came into contact with the paper almost reluctantly, but soon loopy handwriting was filling out Agatha’s details without hesitation and Rio couldn’t help but wonder if Agatha had made her signature just that bit <em>more</em> loopy on purpose as if to show off that it was even there in the first place.</p><p>After a small disagreement on Rio having no insurance and Agatha insisting that she pay the bill instead (Rio won but had a sneaking suspicion that Agatha had only let it go because Rio had over-egged her pain a little to try and stop the argument), a young nurse came in to examine the patient.</p><p>Rio lay obediently on the bed and schooled her face into one of calm and neutrality even as the nurse poked and prodded at her abdomen, chest, and ribs.</p><p>Agatha took offence to this, reading in Rio’s expression that which an inexperienced nurse wouldn’t be able to. Within seconds she had the nurse crying and by the time a doctor had been called to sort the situation out and Agatha was firmly asked to “refrain from upsetting my staff”, Rio had kicked Agatha out of the little examination room.</p><p>Rio didn’t see Agatha again until after she’d been sent for x-Ray and had it confirmed that she’d fractured a rib.</p><p>She found her sitting in a small waiting room staring up at a garish landscape of poppies. It took a touch on her arm and her name being called for Agatha to snap out of her hypnosis and she stood immediately with an expectant look on her face.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“Fractured. It’ll be six weeks before I can even think about playing again.”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and reached again for Rio’s hand, staring across at her in concern, “You need to get some sleep.”</p><p>“Says the woman who never sleeps now,” Rio retorted with raised brows as she interlocked their fingers and turned to pull Agatha from the room to the exit. “I’ll pop one of these pills and be out like a light. You should too.”</p><p>“Steal your drugs? I don’t think so.”</p><p>“Why not? Only one step away from lying on my medical forms.”</p><p>“I didn’t lie,” Agatha said defensively as she moved ahead to push open a heavy door for Rio.</p><p>“You said I didn’t smoke.”</p><p>“You don’t. I’ve only ever seen you smoke once.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, “That’s smoking.”</p><p>A mirthless scoff left Agatha’s lips then and she turned to gaze in disbelief at Rio, “You are such a nerd.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha but dropped the subject as they made their way back to the apartment.</p><p>Arriving back at Jane Street, Rio could barely walk in a straight like anymore. She was tired, exhausted, and couldn’t see let alone think of how she could possibly cover the next few meters to crawl into bed.</p><p>But Agatha practically carried her with her. She held her as best she could given her fear of hurting her and once they were in the bedroom she took over fully, her rage dissipated as she focused on sorting Rio.</p><p>Softly, silently, as if this were their routine, Agatha stood Rio beside the bed and calmly began to remove her clothes. Rio’s eyes fluttered shut at the tender ministrations of Agatha’s fingers on her shirt, her jeans, her bra. She winced slightly with every sharp pain when her upper half moved but was soothed down with a soft kiss to the nearest body part Agatha could reach when it happened: her shoulder, her arm, her uninjured side, her stomach, her thigh.</p><p>By the time Agatha had helped Rio into the bed, stripped herself of everything but the tshirt she wore under her sweater and crawled in beside Rio carefully, Rio felt the full weight of the night press down on her.</p><p>She turned her head to Agatha from where she lay on her back and watched as she shifted cautiously over to rest just the tips of her fingers against Rio’s hip. The usually confident, almost aggressively so, woman beside her looked once again tired, and cautious.</p><p>Rio shifted a little, trying to move slightly closer. “I won’t break if you touch me.”</p><p>“You’ve been through enough. I don’t want to hurt you more in the night.”</p><p>“Agatha, please.”</p><p>Rio reached then across to Agatha and winced as she did so, making Agatha frown more deeply and gently roll Rio back over, “Fine.”</p><p>Rio smiled triumphantly as she felt Agatha’s arm drape across her middle and the warmth of her body press in against her good side.</p><p>“See? Not hurting me.”</p><p>“It’s not funny,” Agatha said quickly, anticipating the laugh that threatened to spill from Rio’s lips.</p><p>“It can be,” Rio offered softly, her lips twitching just slightly as she felt Agatha’s hand work its way to her opposite hip and press a little more into her left side.</p><p>But Agatha ignored this, clearly still not at all finding it funny and Rio instead sighed and focused then on repeating her breathing to make sure she wasn’t disturbing her aching ribs too much.</p><p>She let the evening wash over her then, the pull of sleep too strong to fight much against it. It was just as she was drifting off, in that liminal space between sleeping and waking, that she heard Agatha speak again, barely above a whisper.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>If Agatha’s lips hadn’t been just pressed to her clavicle she wouldn’t have even believed that she heard her. But her breath against her skin was warm and Rio shivered slightly at the feel of it; the physical manifestation of Agatha’s earlier admission.</p><p>She fell asleep not long after that, warm in Agatha’s embrace and comforted by the knowledge that Agatha still felt the same, even if it was just a whisper against her skin.</p>

<p>As the sun streamed through the light curtains of the bedroom in apartment 7, it settled on two bodies entwined together, one long and straight, the other curled and protective.</p><p>Rio had fallen asleep almost immediately the previous night. Industrial strength pain meds as well as a general exhaustion pulling her into a deep but restless sleep. Agatha, sans pain meds but with extra exhaustion, had barely slept at all.</p><p>Too conscious of hurting Rio, too aware of the woman beside her, and too frightened to let herself drift off, she’d mostly lay still, allowing the sounds of Rio’s steady breathing to at least calm her still burning anger.</p><p>It was mid-morning now, and Rio hadn’t had much sleep either if you counted the hours, but she woke steadily, throwing her good arm up to cover her eyes and groaned for the light of day and for the aching of her entire body.</p><p>Agatha shifted slowly to gaze down at her and dipped her head to capture her lips in a quick kiss. “Good morning.”</p><p>“Is it?” Rio asked with another groan, her drugs now worn off. Her arm lolling back down onto the pillow beside her head and she blinked slowly up at Agatha who somehow looked more tired than before.</p><p>“Did you sleep?”</p><p>Agatha dipped her head to steal another kiss but didn’t say anything until she offered, “Coffee? Meds?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio scolded softly, feeling something akin to sickness rising in her chest at the idea of Agatha not allowing herself to rest after everything that had happened. “Tell me you didn’t stay awake for me.”</p><p>But Agatha was already moving, already determined on coffee and drugs for Rio rather than conversation.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio called to her retreating form but it was no use. She sat slowly then, her world spinning for a brief second as she settled herself back against the headboard and she focused on what she could control: which was everything but Agatha.</p><p>Taking long, slow breaths, she pushed the limit of her lung capacity, feeling a familiar raw ache across the band of her chest. She stretched out her arms slowly and flexed the muscles in her legs, feeling similar aches there. And she closed her eyes to focus on where the real damage was.</p><p>Agatha, Rio knew, was still torn between raging against Alice and softening herself for Rio. She was pulled between the intensity of her job and her desire to be with Rio. She was stuck between Rio and a Stark place.</p><p>Everything Rio had done since she’d met Agatha had been the wrong choice. She’d stubbornly continued to work whilst knowing it was a sore spot for Agatha. She’d seen how Agatha reacted every time she left her to meet a client, how she grabbed her and touched her when she came back from one, how she was slowly eating away at herself because of everything she’d promised Stark for Rio’s sake.</p><p>It was all because of her.</p><p>As the spiral hit its peak, Agatha appeared beside her, perching lightly on the side of the bed and placing a hot mug of coffee down beside the pills she needed to take on the side.</p><p>“Would a bath help?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open and to her horror she realised that tears were suddenly flowing, silent little traitors to her inner turmoil.</p><p>Warm fingers reached to wipe them gently and Agatha’s voice sounded so soft, so concerned as she asked, “Are you in pain?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried slowly, shuffling a little to try and get closer, wiping at her own cheeks roughly with the heel of her hand before she reached for Agatha again, “I am so sorry about all of this. About-…”</p><p>But Agatha cut her off with a quick shake of her head and a squeeze of her hands, “I don’t want to hear it, Rio. I don’t need to.”</p><p>“You <em>do</em>.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, but the laughter didn’t quite meet her eyes as she dropped her eyes to the bruise now splayed across Rio’s right side where the blankets had fallen down. She reached to ghost a finger over the edge of it and mumbled, “I hired you.”</p><p>Her eyes flashed up briefly to meet Rio’s and when she saw confusion there she looked back down again, “I just <em>wanted</em> you and when Wanda… that’s all on me.”</p><p>Rio shook her head no and reached back out for Agatha’s hand, placing it just below her left breast, above her heart, “What you’re doing now. You don’t need to do anymore. Tell Stark he can…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha smiled a little and leant in to press a gentle kiss to the corner of her lips, her fingers flexing across Rio’s chest, “Let’s focus on you this weekend. Please?”</p><p>Rio huffed unhappily, the guilt still settled between her stomach and chest, and she frowned up at Agatha, shifting forwards some more to grip the collar of her shirt and keep her close.</p><p>Blue eyes softened at the gesture and Agatha closed the distance again to kiss Rio once more, letting their noses nudge together. Rio closed her eyes into the movement and simply breathed Agatha in for a second before she spoke again:</p><p>“Are you working?”</p><p>“No. I’ve cancelled everything for a couple days. And,” she paused and pulled her hand from Rio but didn’t pull from her hold, “When I go back on Monday morning I was hoping you’d come with me. Permanently.”</p><p>A sharp pain suddenly slashed through Rio’s chest as she sucked in a heavy, unexpected breath and she winced so violently that Agatha looked panicked.</p><p>“Move in with you?”</p><p>Nodding slowly and raising her hands to cup Rio’s face, Agatha said with a newfound urgency to her voice, “I know you have a life here and I know it’s a big ask and that you’ll need time to think about it but-…”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched uncertainly and then she pulled them away completely from Rio as Rio shifted and strained herself to move around Agatha and sit in her lap. This new position made her back stretch up more and her thighs ache from supporting her sore body but she needed to be as close as she could, not accepting anything less anymore.</p><p>Even as Agatha looked heart-broken, she didn’t stop her from moving closer, her hands already reaching for her as if instinctively, as if she couldn’t stand to not be touching her.</p><p>“Agatha. I would love to move in with you.”</p><p>It was so simple. So unbelievably obvious that that is what Rio wanted. That living with Agatha would be better than living separately from her. Waking up to her every morning, seeing her face before she fell asleep every night. She wanted that. She needed that.</p><p>Agatha looked pained though, even as her lips twitched slightly at the sides. Her brow furrowed deeply as she gazed up at Rio. Her fingers dancing an uncertain rhythm against her hips as she held herself back from touching her properly.</p><p>“I won’t break,” Rio promised again, echoing her words from the previous night.</p><p>Not for the first time she silently cursed Alice, knowing that Agatha was being too cautious, too withholding, because she was frightened of hurting her more than she already was. But the flames in Rio’s chest, the agony of the cracked bone, was nothing to the desire for Agatha’s hands on her.</p><p>“<em>Mi amor</em>,” Rio uttered softly, leaning in to brush their lips together, trying to coax the Agatha she knew out of her frightened stupor, “I’ll tell you if you’re hurting me.”</p><p>Agatha’s own breath hitched slightly at the soft Spanish from Rio’s lips and she swallowed thickly. Agatha’s warm breath against her lips did nothing to quench the fire now slipping down to Rio’s belly, making her shift her hips closer until she was almost flush against the still unmoving Agatha.</p><p>But long fingers slowly worked their way to slip beneath the waistband of her underwear at her hips and she tightened her grip on her as she pulled at her to press their hips completely flush together.</p><p>Blue eyes had turned darker and Rio saw the telltale dilation in Agatha’s eyes, her breathing a little heavier than before as she fought against herself.</p><p>But as Rio pressed their lips together again she felt Agatha’s body slump slightly, her rigid posture turning into something else, she was leaning forwards into Rio and Rio knew it wouldn’t be long until she had coaxed Agatha out again, seduced the side of her that always wanted Rio, always was desperate for her no matter how many times she’d had her, how completely Rio was hers.</p><p>But Rio had miscalculated Agatha’s fear, and as their tongues met for the first time in over a week and Rio’s chest screamed at her to stop, Agatha pulled away, her head dipping to press her face against the crook of Rio’s neck.</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>The instruction was clear, firm, even as Agatha’s fingers still gripped Rio tightly to her and her lips brushed her skin.</p><p>Rio groaned quietly and moved a hand to lightly scratch the back of Agatha’s head, trying to calm whatever racing thoughts were making her pull away.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said patiently, turning her head and pulling back to try and get a look at the woman. “I really am okay. I’m sure I can…”</p><p>“It’s not even been twenty four hours and I <em>know</em> you’re in pain.”</p><p>“Yes but I also want <em>you</em>. Preferably all over me. Preferably inside of me. Preferably-…”</p><p>Agatha had the gall to roll her eyes at this but Rio’s words didn’t wholly not affect her if her bitten bottom lip was anything to go by.</p><p>“I just want you to take it easy today. And then…” Her brow twitched slightly and Rio couldn’t help but smile as she felt her hips being squeezed, “Then we can negotiate.”</p><p>“Negotiate? Oh <em>now</em> you want to negotiate.”</p><p>In spite of herself Agatha smiled at this and moved her hands down to squeeze Rio’s thighs, “Well if it’s a new career path you’re thinking about then you have to keep those negotiation skills up somehow.”</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to roll her eyes at this but she placed her hands lightly on Agatha’s collarbones and sighed, “Fine. But come in the bath with me. If you won’t touch me I at least want to look at you.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips together but nodded and shifted slightly beneath Rio, one hand moving to the crook of her knee. “Rest here for a bit and I’ll go run it.”</p><p>Rio huffed but reluctantly slid off to her girlfriend and settled back against the headboard.</p><p>“I’m practically naked and you won’t touch me. Maybe I’ll kill Alice too.”</p><p>But this joke didn’t settle well across Agatha’s features and something in her hardened again, her jaw now tense as she stood from the bed.</p><p>“She’s been calling all morning.”</p><p>“She has? And you haven’t picked up?”</p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p>“Agatha. She loves you so much. She spent all night telling me how much she loves you.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” Agatha said flatly, turning from Rio and stalking out of the room without so much as a backwards glance.</p><p>Rio was left alone with the very real possibility that Agatha would never speak to Alice again.</p><p>She toyed with the blankets beneath her and tried to reason how she’d feel if Natasha had done the same to Agatha. How sick with rage she’d be. How intent on making Natasha feel the same pain. But… she knew Natasha loved her. She knew that if she ever did anything to Agatha she’d do it because she loved her.</p><p>And so she couldn’t reason it. Not yet.</p><p>When the sounds of the bath filling stopped, Rio padded through to the bathroom with her half-finished coffee and raised a brow at the sheer amount of bubbles she found in the tub.</p><p>“Did you drop something?”</p><p>“Shut up. This stuff’s expensive. And soothing.”</p><p>Rio smiled at this and turned to Agatha to see watching her, her eyes looking heavier than before.</p><p>“Will you take a nap later? I’ll sit away from you if it’ll make you feel better about actually sleeping.”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“You’re not.”</p><p>“Rio,” her voice more firm now, she turned to the younger woman properly, her brows raised. “Leave it.”</p><p>Rio just shook her head and moved forwards to  tug Agatha’s shirt up slightly, letting her do the rest for herself so she didn’t have to stretch her arms up. Almost in apology, after stripping herself completely, Agatha kissed Rio’s cheek and turned Rio slowly to the bath, guiding her with one hand on her good side and the other pushing her underwear down over her ass to let it fall at her ankles.</p><p>“Now would be a perfect time to-…”</p><p>“Stop it,” Agatha warned quietly, but slapped Rio’s ass firmly enough that it made Rio gasp and she turned over her shoulder to glare at Agatha.</p><p>“Oh that’ll help.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but offered her hand out and half supported Rio into the bath, letting her settle herself in the middle before she stepped in behind her and guided Rio back against her.</p><p>In the warm, bubbly water Rio felt her whole body begin to relax. As the scent of lavender filled her lungs and seemed to dull the ache, she felt Agatha’s left arm wrap around her and she settled more comfortably back against her chest.</p><p>They were silent for a long while, Rio focusing on Agatha’s breathing to calm her own, her fingers lightly running up and down the arm across her body.</p><p>It was Agatha who spoke first.</p><p>“I could support you, you know. If you didn’t want to work.”</p><p>Rio didn’t react immediately to these words, having heard similar before when Agatha had tried to get her to change her career and she knew an instinctive, stubborn “no” wouldn’t ease Agatha’s stress so she paused before speaking again, “I wouldn’t be happy not doing anything. I need to work. I’ll find something. But…” she turned as best she could to look at Agatha and watched as Agatha dipped her head to press a kiss to her shoulder.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha hummed slightly and Rio felt her hand brush slowly up to settle in her left side and squeeze her there as she turned back around to face down the bath.</p><p>“Maybe you could be a landscaper after all.”</p><p>“I do like plants.”</p><p>“And how many of them are going to be moving with you?”</p><p>“Oh all of them. Non-negotiable.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly but said nothing else on the subject, her fingers tapping a soft pattern against Rio’s uninjured ribs.</p><p>Until the temperature of the bath water was no longer tenable and most of the bubbles were gone, the two of them sat there, Rio thinking of how she was going to break the news of her moving to her team, to Natasha, and Agatha thinking of how she could make Rio’s pain subside, how she could possibly continue a relationship with Alice when all she wanted to do was murder her.</p><p>By the time they got out and Agatha helped Rio dry off and change - being frustratingly gentle and proper with her if you asked Rio - it was around midday and Rio was starving.</p><p>Agatha deposited her on the couch and left her to get settled so she could fetch them some lunch, making the most of what she had available and producing a veritable smorgasbord of charcuterie, hummus, bread, and cheese.</p><p>Tucked into the corner of the tray of food was something that Rio wasn’t expecting at all and she stared at it for a long while before she even registered what it was.</p><p>“You’re kidding.”</p><p>“Alice is useful for some things,” Agatha said coolly, running a hand through her hair as she reached for a celery stick.</p><p>Rio reached around her and winced at the strain on her side as she tentatively picked up the neat little joint, holding it below her nose to smell the contents as she stared wide-eyed at Agatha.</p><p>“Are you going to join me?”</p><p>“Eat first,” Agatha instructed, stealing the joint back and motioning to the food.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t hold out any longer and she soon made quick work of the food before her, eating readily even as her eyes kept flicking back to Agatha, watching her curiously as the older woman’s gaze turned every so often to her phone that lit up every few seconds.</p><p>“You should speak to her.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and reached for Agatha’s phone but it was snatched from her before she could reach it and she scowled at Agatha.</p><p>“You’re being unreasonable.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said flatly, her gaze hardened now, “I have restrained myself from ripping her fucking head off. You can’t ask any more of me than that.”</p><p>“That is…”</p><p>But Agatha was moving already, picking up the little joint and placing it between her lips to light it.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and leant back to watch Agatha’s movements, the sight of her inhaling the smoke not doing anything to calm Rio’s need for her.</p><p>But Agatha was quick about it, not luxuriating in the warm burn of the smoke as it hit her lungs and instead exhaling quickly, fully, before she handed the lit joint to Rio, brushing their fingers together as she did.</p><p>Rio kept her gaze on Agatha and with more practiced movements than the other woman she raised the joint to her own lips and inhaled slowly, deeply, feeling the rush of the putrid smoke hitting her lungs and causing her pain to peak as she expanded her chest with it.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were watchful and cautious as she shifted to turn Rio around on the couch, lifting her legs up with rest over her lap so Rio could lie fully down against the arm of the couch.</p><p>Lithe fingers moved up and down Rio’s calf as she closed her eyes and focused on the slow, creeping sensation of calm wash over her.</p><p>Soon enough, her mind felt hazy, her body no longer aching beneath her as she lazily took another drag, humming quietly to herself as she draped her arm over the couch and tapped the joint lightly over the floor.</p><p>“It’s unbelievable how good you look right now.”</p><p>Agatha’s words somehow made it through the relaxed haze and Rio opened her eyes slowly to blink at her, grinning a little lopsidedly as she took her in.</p><p>“Yeah? I feel good.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and squeezed at Rio’s thigh, still watching her closely, “No more pain?”</p><p>“Not much.”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, getting more comfortable where she lay and allowed Agatha’s hands to travel up her legs, drawing lazy circles over her upper thigh now.</p><p>In the liminal state between high as shit and focusing on the very real, very welcome feeling of Agatha’s hands on her again, Rio shifted again as she felt Agatha lean closer in, reaching for the joint for herself.</p><p>Brown eyes flashed open suddenly and Rio grinned as she held it out of reach, eyeing Agatha with amusement.</p><p>“I thought this was just for me?”</p><p>“You won’t share?”</p><p>Rio laughed, more than she would have if she were sober, and shrugged her shoulders, not registering the fact that it hurt a lot less than this would have done an hour ago.</p><p>“I suppose I could.”</p><p>She shifted then to sit up more as Agatha leant back for the spliff between Rio’s fingers but she moved out of her way and instead placed it between her own lips, her free hand moving to grasp Agatha’s face, pulling her closer and squeezing at her jaw to get her to open her mouth.</p><p>Whether desire or surprise was causing Agatha’s eyes to widen and darken suddenly, Rio couldn’t be sure. Her own gaze was hooded and heavy as she leant in and shotgunned the smoke slowly into Agatha’s waiting mouth.</p><p>She registered only that Agatha had gasped quietly at this move, her hands moving to grip Rio’s thigh harder than she’d touched her all day and Rio’s face broke out into a wide grin as she watched the smoke dissipate and Agatha’s mouth remain open slightly even as Rio’s grip loosened.</p><p>Blue eyes had darkened so much that Rio thought they looked practically black and she couldn’t help but wonder if it were the weed talking or if Agatha had just reacted that way to her, despite her self-imposed refusal to touch Rio.</p><p>But she didn’t have much time to think about it, because Agatha was lowering them both back down, stealing the joint from Rio’s fingers and holding it out of the way so she could hover over her on the couch.</p><p>Rio hummed lowly, her chest now aching with something other than the pain from her ribs as she moved her hands to rub up Agatha’s sides, making quick work of seeking out warm skin, and continued to grin goofily up at her.</p><p>“If all it took was a little weed and-…”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha muttered as she moved down to press open-mouthed, wanton kisses to Rio’s throat, nipping at her insistently as Rio squirmed beneath her and moaned at the feeling.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut as her weed-addled brain focused in on just Agatha, the smell of lavender in her hair, the feel of her lips and teeth at her neck, the feel of her hand gripping her side, but then Agatha forgot herself and moved firmly against Rio’s upper half and Rio cried out in pain.</p><p>Unsure whether her mind had taken a while to catch up to what had happened or if Agatha had teleported off the couch, she groaned as she caught her breath and stared up at Agatha, now at least three feet away from her and looking horrified.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha. I’m fine. I’m-…”</p><p>But Agatha was shaking her head, looking suddenly incandescent with rage again.</p><p>“No. You’re <em>not</em> fine and I shouldn’t have let myself forget that.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio said again, too hazy to think of how she could course correct this, how she could adjust the tension in the room from thick and alert back to soft and desperate.</p><p>“Please. Please just come back here.”</p><p>She remained lying down but held her arm out lamely, wriggling her fingers in the hopes Agatha would take them and return to her position over her.</p><p>But she didn’t. She turned to stub out the joint and slowly lowered herself on the couch by Rio’s feet, lifting them again so she could slide a little closer but not leaning over Rio anymore.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she admitted, glancing around at Rio with a pained expression.</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and moved a hand up to experimentally touch her injured side as she watched Agatha. “It wasn’t your fault.”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond to this and Rio was too zoned out to be of any use to her racing mind.</p><p>So she reached a hand to find Agatha’s and remained quiet, watching the thoughts play out across Agatha’s side profile and slowly, reluctantly slipping into a hazy sleep.</p><p>When she woke a few hours later, she woke slowly, then all at once.</p><p>The first thing she felt was Agatha, tucked into her side, her head resting on her left hip and her hand warm and familiar against her stomach where she’d slipped it beneath the old tshirt she’d borrowed. She could feel Agatha’s steady breathing against her and knew she’d fallen asleep like that.</p><p>The next thing she felt was the dull ache in her chest and the return of the sharp sting as she shifted slightly.</p><p>But the last thing she felt was a sense of dread as she registered the key that now turned in the lock, and the sound of footsteps making their way into the apartment.</p><p>It was Jen’s voice that woke Agatha and caused her to jerk up, blinking into the light of the room as she announced: “You fucking bitch.”</p><p>Rio sat up slowly and instinctively moved to block Agatha from getting up even as she made a move to. She grabbed at her side and threw her other arm to rest on her head, knowing Agatha wouldn’t throw her off.</p><p>“Don’t,” she warned quickly, quietly, even as Jen turned to stand the other side of the coffee table, looking regal in a matching lilac track suit that must have cost more than Rio could even fathom.</p><p>Alice stood by her side, looking worried and tired and far less poised than Jen.</p><p>“Get out of my house,” Agatha snapped, her hands moving to try and peel Rio away from her but her eyes on Jen.</p><p>“You kicked <em>my wife</em> out of your fucking house at three in the morning!”</p><p>“Your <em>wife</em> beat up <em>my girlfriend</em>!”</p><p>At this, Rio groaned quietly and began to tug at Agatha’s collar, trying to get her to turn away.</p><p>“Don’t. Agatha. Don’t.”</p><p>“Oh fuck off Rio, piss off back to your <em>other</em> girlfriend and…”</p><p>Jen’s words were the catalyst for a chemical reaction.</p><p>No, a nuclear bomb going off in the room.</p><p>Alice had known, just as Rio had, what was about to happen. She’d stepped infront of Jen, holding her arms out behind her to create some sort of human barrier, and Rio had thrown herself in front of Agatha even as the woman had stood up, trying her best to be gentle but forcibly removing Rio from herself as she managed to get to her feet.</p><p>Rio grunted in pain and frustration but Agatha only had eyes for Jen.</p><p>Her previously thunderous expression was now livid. Her jaw jutting forwards and her finger pointing accusingly at the beauty mogul, now behind Alice.</p><p>“Don’t you <em>dare</em> speak to her like that.”</p><p>“Like what?” Jen accused suddenly, her pitch rising with every word, “Like she’s a-…”</p><p>But the word didn’t make it out of her mouth because Agatha had released a noise halfway between a scream and a growl and had thrown herself across the table to get to Jennifer.</p><p>Alice threw her weight at Agatha to hold her back as she clambered over the low coffee table to get to her. But Agatha wasn’t letting up.</p><p>Alice struggled to keep a hold on her, growling in effort and stumbling backwards, as Agatha tried to reach around her to get at Jen who, despite having known what she was about to unleash, looked shocked and more than a little frightened.</p><p>Rio had moved around quickly, stepping behind Alice and helping as best she could to push her back into Agatha to keep Agatha from overpowering her completely. It took everything she had not to scream in agony as her chest battled her and Agatha’s yells filled the room. “Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha released another angry yell and finally pulled back from Alice, her gaze flickering briefly to check on Rio before she turned with her arms thrown out to the room as she did so, her gaze still furious.</p><p>She and Alice were both panting heavily and Agatha’s cheeks were red form the effort.</p><p>“What! What do you want? You’re lucky I didn’t kill your fucking wife.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio repeated again, now clear of any flying limbs so she could step towards her and press a hand down against her chest. “You <em>need</em> to calm down.”</p><p>“My fucking wife was trying to defend you. Because your head is so far up your own ass that you have been lying to us for <em>months</em> and you’re too fucking proud to admit that you’ve been paying for a fake girlfriend!”</p><p>“Jen that’s not…,” Alice corrected with a frown but was cut off as Agatha yelled over her from her position with Rio guarding her.</p><p>“You have no fucking clue what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were wide and one hand was clutching at Agatha’s collar still as her other moved to lock in at the hair at the back of Agatha’s neck, “Baby. Don’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed slightly and she moved as if to break free but thought better of it as her gaze fell to Rio’s pleading eyes and she remained still in her hold, her fisted hands relaxing slightly to hold Rio’s hips, pulling her back from a furious Jen and a concerned Alice.</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice spoke quickly, firmly, “I thought Rio was… I was just trying to-…”</p><p>But Jen jumped in again, throwing a hand out dismissively, “Don’t apologise! You were trying to protect her!”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily as Agatha’s gaze hardened again and she shot Jen a look that could wither even the boldest of spirits.</p><p>“<em>Don’t</em> apologise? You’ve got some fucking balls, Jennifer Kale!”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio sighed quietly, now turning around to face Jen and Alice, holding her hands up in front of her, “Can we please just all calm down. Alice and I…”</p><p>“Enough from you,” Jen shot out, throwing a hand out towards Rio.</p><p>Agatha behind her growled then, her voice rising to levels it hadn’t even been the previous night, “GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY FUCKING HOUSE!”</p><p>“Agatha,” both Alice and Rio tried, both now rounding on her, Rio turning around and Alice stepping in.</p><p>But Agatha was beyond reason and she refused both of their hands reaching out to her as she stepped back from them.</p><p>“There she goes,” Jen called in accusation, “shutting everyone out so that the only person who will even tolerate her is someone who…”</p><p>But it wasn’t Agatha who shut Jen up this time. It was Rio.</p><p>Rio had wheeled around and with her good arm, smacked Jen across the face with an anger she hadn’t known she’d been holding back.</p><p>“Jen,” Alice gasped and moved to fuss her, nudging past Rio as she did so. She pushed Jen away gently as Jen clutched her cheek and stared in shock at an equally shocked Rio.</p><p>But strong arms were snaking around her waist and Agatha pressed firmly up behind her as if to keep her tethered, keeping her hold low so as to avoid her ribs as she moved them back a couple paces.</p><p>“I-…” Rio started but found she had nothing to say. She wanted to apologise but couldn’t bring herself to. The weight of Agatha pressing behind her reminding her that she’d probably break Jen’s whole body if it meant defending her, let alone just slapping her. But her mouth opened and closed a few more times as she watched Alice check on her wife, watched Jen continue to stare at her, and heard Agatha’s voice in her ear, low and soft, just for her.</p><p>“Don’t, Rio. Don’t.”</p><p>Rio relented fully then, allowing herself to be pulled further away and moved to stand the furthest from Jen and Alice as Agatha turned them, her hands still either side of her as she kept her away from the other two.</p><p>Blue eyes had softened a little, but she still looked ready to strike at any moment and her hands squeezed Rio possessively as she watched for any signs that she’d further hurt herself.</p><p>“Rio is my girlfriend,” Agatha said firmly, her voice carrying this time, even as she kept her gaze on the shocked woman before her, “I am in love with her. I hired her to be my date to your wedding and I fell for her and we have been together ever since. She’s an escort and I’ve had my problems with it but… her job is her choice. I kept it from you because I wanted to protect her. I wanted to…”</p><p>She shook her head and moved a hand up to wipe the silent tears that had begun to fall from Rio’s wide eyes, “I wanted to keep her safe and I didn’t feel I needed to explain what we had to anyone.”</p><p>The silence in the room then was thick, dangerous, and Rio bit down on her lower lip as Agatha shifted her hold on her and turned to look around finally at Jen and Alice, raising her chin up as she did.</p><p>“If either of you have a problem with me or Rio or our relationship then you can get the fuck out and never contact me again.”</p><p>Rio’s heart was in her throat and she watched as both Jen and Alice stared across at their best friend.</p><p>Alice seemed to be fighting back tears, her face scrunched up and small.</p><p>Jen still looked shocked, whether from Rio’s slap or Agatha’s admission, she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>But Rio was mostly concerned about Agatha and she moved forwards to take her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze as Agatha pulled her a little closer, not looking at her but keeping her gaze on the other two.</p><p>It was Alice again who spoke first, “I’ll spend forever being sorry for what I did. But if you’ll let me I’d-… I want to… <em>don’t shut me out.</em>”</p><p>Rio breathed in shakily at these words, and fought back more of her own tears as she caught Alice’s eye and nodded slightly, her free hand moving to clutch Agatha’s in her other hand. But Agatha didn’t move, didn’t react, just gazed over at Jen who looked reluctant to say much of anything.</p><p>Just as Rio thought that this was it, that Jen was giving her answer by giving none at all, she spoke and Alice turned to hold her arm steadily, “You’re a maniac, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha sniffed beside Rio and a little bit of tension was released in her shoulders as Jen’s gaze flicked back to Rio, “I hope you know what you’re getting yourself into.”</p><p>Rio felt like a weight had been lifted, and the tension in the room around them slowly dissipated as Jen’s body relaxed into Alice’s side and Agatha’s thumb brushed across Rio’s knuckles.</p><p>“She knows,” Agatha said with a huff that was haughty but no longer angry.</p><p>Jen nodded once and pursed her lips as she glanced briefly at her wife now smiling across at Rio.</p><p>“You owe me a lotta money for the last minute flight by the way.”</p><p>“Oh sure,” Agatha shot out with an eye roll as she pulled away from Rio to sit down in her chair. She tugged a little on Rio’s arm as she did so and guided her into her lap as she rolled her shoulders back and kept her gaze on Jen. “Worth it for the slap though, right?”</p><p>“Bitch,” Jen muttered as she tugged Alice along with her to the couch and pulled her down beside her with a huff.</p><p>Agatha’s arms slipped snuggly around Rio, always cautious of her injured side, but holding her more firmly than she had all day.</p><p>Rio felt insane. She was torn between fury at Jen, affection for Alice, and concern for Agatha. But there was nothing she could do. And she focused on the fact that Agatha had at least seemed to calm down, that she was speaking at a normal volume, and that her eyes no longer burned with the fury of a thousand suns.</p><p>So, as she stretched in Agatha’s hold she finally said, looking over at Jen, “Sorry about that.”</p><p>“Don’t apologise,” Agatha chided with a scowl, “she deserved it.”</p><p>Rio sighed and leant her left side more into Agatha, draping her arm around the back of her neck as she did so. Her free hand now rubbing up and down Agatha’s tense bicep.</p><p>“I’m quitting, by the way. After what’s happened. It’s not worth it. The woman Alice saw me with, she was my last client.”</p><p>Alice blinked over at Rio and looked sheepish, unsure how she should react to this but Jen spoke before anyone else could. “Hope she was at least hot.”</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha snapped suddenly, her hold on Rio tightening a little even as Rio’s fingers moved to squeeze her shoulder reassuringly.</p><p>“Wouldn’t you rather she was with someone at least palatable than some ugly old…” but she shut up as Alice dug her elbow into her ribs.</p><p>“What will you do?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’ll figure something out. I’m good with people,” Jen snorted at this and received another glare from Agatha.</p><p>Alice spoke quickly to keep Jen from commenting, “I could maybe find you something? You can hold your own. You’d be good in security.”</p><p>Rio smiled at this and raised her brows, “You are smaller than me and you managed to-…”</p><p>But Alice was grinning already, “You were holding back. I could tell.”</p><p>Rio hummed and fought back a laugh even as she felt Agatha’s fingers tighten their grip on her thigh and pull her a bit closer as she sat sideways in her lap.</p><p>“Would you goddamn let go of her already,” Jen said suddenly, clearly already comfortable throwing out more insults. “You’re obsessed. It’s gross.”</p><p>“It’s hot,” Alice corrected with a smirk as she turned back to Jen and took her hand, “There was a time when you couldn’t keep your hands off me.”</p><p>“Other way around,” Jen said with a smirk and narrowed her eyes at Alice playfully.</p><p>Rio laughed as she watched them kiss and jumped a little in surprise as Agatha murmured against her ear, “They were disgusting.”</p><p>She held in a snort and glanced down at Agatha with an amused smirk, “Unlike us?”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and reached to trace her finger lightly down Agatha’s nose, watching her carefully as she saw the tension slowly disappear from her features. But her hold remained strong.</p><p>Jen’s voice broke them out of their joint reverie and Rio glanced back at her with raised brows as she heard her question.</p><p>“So, Rio, what’s your body count?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How many notches on your bed-“</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>“What? We all know each others. Alice is twelve, I’m four, you’re-…”</p><p>“Jen-…”</p><p>“Forty two.”</p><p>Rio looked between Agatha and Jen and saw that whilst one was smirking triumphantly the other was looking incredibly pissed off.</p><p>She hesitated for a second before answering coolly, “A little more than forty two.”</p><p>“How much more?”</p><p>Rio scoffed quietly and shifted in Agatha’s hold, moving her hand to fiddle with her collar.</p><p>“A little.”</p><p>Agatha had shifted too and slid her hand up her thigh to encircle her arm more around her. “Can you just leave her alone?”</p><p>Rio’s hand then slid down to rest above Agatha’s heart, glancing down at her as she felt it race beneath her palm.</p><p>“It’s fine,” she said with a shrug, “I’ve had worse questions.”</p><p>“So we’re talking… over a hundred?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, and cleared her throat, her jaw set. “Jen. Are you trying to live vicariously through my girlfriend or something?”</p><p>Rio laughed and felt the slight twinge in her side she did so but she kept her hands on Agatha.</p><p>“Come on, my wife can beat her up but I can’t ask any questions?”</p><p>“You think I allowed that?”</p><p>Sensing the mood changing already, Rio cleared her throat and leant forward, recognising danger when it was directly in front of her.</p><p>“I’ve slept with a lot of women. Probably more than the majority of people. Clients and non-clients. I always had a choice with what I did and who I did it with. Less so in the beginning, but definitely as I got better at what I did and knew my own mind and limits more.”</p><p>She felt Agatha’s fingers twitch slightly against her and she glanced aside at her before turning back to an intrigued Jen.</p><p>It was Alice who spoke next though, before Rio could continue to answer the questions she thought they’d most likely want to know the answers too, “You were so… <em>yourself</em> though. With Agatha, with us, I mean. It didn’t feel… it was <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows in surprise and she felt Agatha shift a little. She briefly looked to her and turned back to Alice with a slight smile, “It wasn’t as if I’d always put on a front for clients, be different with them… but with Agatha, with you both, it was easier to be me, yes.”</p><p>Rio’s hand moved then to slip beneath the collar of Agatha’s sweater and she scratched lightly at her shoulder as she turned back to meet blue eyes with a soft smile, “I wanted this one to like me.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at this but something in her gaze let Rio know she was pleased. Rio’s hand moved back from under her sweater and into her own lap again as she turned away with a grin. “Plus Jen would have seen through my bullshit and Lilia wasn’t being fooled by <em>anything<em>.”</em></em></p><p>
<em>
<em>“Damn right,” Jen said with a hint of pride, “Besides, at this point I’m not even sure what <em>this one</em> would have wanted you to be. Probably just sexy arm candy.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha laughed at this and shot Jen a glare, “Don’t be insane. If I’d rocked up with someone without a personality you’d have never let me forget it.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“I was surprised you rocked up with anyone at all.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha just shook her head and leant back in her seat, her stance widening as she did so and Rio recognised the telltale sign of her peacocking to get back on top of the conversation. Rio slipped a little in between her thighs and adjusted herself accordingly.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“And yet here we are. Your wife an asshole who punches before she thinks.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Agatha-,” Rio said quickly, snapping her head around to her with wide eyes, “Don’t.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>But Jen was moving, leaning forwards and suddenly looking livid. “If you had just stopped being a bitch and admitted that you’d fallen for an escort then we wouldn’t be in this mess.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Alice reached for Jen then, her hand wrapping around her arm and gently holding her in place. “Jen, really. I take full responsibility for what I did to Rio.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Of course you do,” Agatha sneered across at her just as Rio leant over a little more, almost to block her from view and winced at the movement, frowning deeply at her.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Agatha. There’s no point.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha scowled but nodded slightly and clearly decided to drop it as she turned back to her two best friends, and Rio settled back again too.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“So,” Rio tried quickly, clearing her throat as she focused in on Alice’s concerned features, but it was pointless. The mood in the room had changed.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha was so tense, so coiled and ready to bite that everyone knew it. Jen looked like she could rip someone’s head off and the hopes of a more chilled evening slowly disappeared.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Rio,” Alice tried quietly, watching her with a wide gaze as if willing her to pick up the conversation she was about to offer, “What will you do when Agatha goes on the campaign trail?”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Rio raised her brows and didn’t know how to answer but she knew she had to, if nothing else to keep the chat away from her job, away from anything that might cause either Agatha or Jen to blow up again.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“I don’t know. That’s…”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“We haven’t discussed it yet,” Agatha said curtly, uncomfortable with this line of questioning too. “But Rio’s going to move in.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Here?”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“No. Home.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Rio watched closely as Alice smiled at the news and Jen raised her brows, “And what? Be your little wifey? Available for a quick fuck and a-…”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>But she received an elbow to her ribs once again and shut up, scowling a little at her own wife.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“That’s great news.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Rio bit down on her lip to stop herself from laughing even as Agatha’s face told her it wasn’t something to find funny.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“You’re such a cunt.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Agatha,” Rio chided quietly, turning back to her and frowning deeply, but Agatha ignored her and simply pursed her lips as she continued to glare at Jen.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Sweetheart,” Alice offered soothingly to her wife, shifting to kneel up beside her and place a kiss to her temple as she muttered, “You’re going to get us killed.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Jen just scoffed but soon relented and rolled her eyes, clearly Alice had somehow worked her magic on her.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Look, fine. I don’t have a problem with…” she gestured vaguely to Rio and Agatha, “Whatever this is. Just…” she rolled her eyes again and looked away, “Just don’t fuck it up, okay? I’m not going through that again. She was a fucking mental case and…” she trailed off, brown eyes meeting Rio’s and softening slightly, “Just don’t fuck it up.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Rio swallowed and nodded slowly, not dropping her gaze from Jen even as Agatha shifted beneath her and moved her hand to slip below Rio’s tshirt to hold her more intimately. “I won’t. I love her. I won’t.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>After that, things eased up a little.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha was still finding it difficult to make eye contact with Alice and at one point she cleared her throat very loudly when she walked into the kitchen and saw her and Rio hugging, but she didn’t say anything, didn’t mention the broken rib again.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Rio spent the majority of the evening feeling a little out of it with the strong pain meds she was on but Agatha’s hands were never far from her, grounding her in some sort of reality.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>They ordered in pizza and Alice, Jen, and Agatha shared two bottles of wine between them. At some point around midnight Rio had fallen asleep against Agatha and Alice wasn’t far behind, curled up beside Jen. It was only then that Jen broached the subject of their relationship again, but softer this time on account of their sleeping partners.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Are you sure this is a good idea?”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Jen-…”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Hear me out, okay? She might have quit but I’m sure she wasn’t some street corner…”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>At the sight of Agatha’s glare she backtracked and sighed, “I mean, she would have fancy ass clients. People in the know, people with power and money and… won’t going public with her be difficult?”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha clenched her jaw a little but spoke coolly, “I’m in love with her. What else is there?”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Jen didn’t respond immediately and instead looked down at Alice with a frown, “I just don’t want you to get hurt again.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Rio isn’t Wanda.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“I know.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>She swirled her wine before downing the rest of it and then announced quietly, “We should go. I’m exhausted and Alice gets a bad back if she’s not in a proper bed.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha just scoffed but watched silently as Jen gently woke her wife and they both stood to move over, Alice looking a little frustrated at being woken already.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Jen leant in and kissed Agatha softly on the temple, briefly touching Rio’s shoulder, before she moved to leave the room.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Alice hesitated before she kissed Agatha’s cheek, and, not receiving any backlash from the move, she pressed another kiss to Rio’s, and then left without a word.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>When Agatha heard the lock click she rubbed at her temples heavily, closing her eyes as she focused on Rio breathing soundly against her.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>She let her sleep for another ten minutes before she gently shifted her and began to press soft kisses across her cheeks and nose, trying to coax her out of her slumber.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>“Honey,” she whispered softly as Rio began to stir and groaned a little, “Let me take you to bed.”</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Rio huffed out a breath through her nose but acquiesced and eventually Agatha had manoeuvred her into the bed. Rio was so tired that she barely registered getting there in the first place, her body limb and malleable as Agatha removed her clothes and tucked her into the crook of her arm beside her.</em>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha slept soundly for the first time since she’d last seen Rio over a week ago and it was Rio who woke first the next morning, her body sore but warm and comfortable against the woman she’d be waking up to every morning from now on.</em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The following day was spent mostly on the couch, with Rio, in between her naps, constantly attempting to seduce Agatha, to make her relax enough to touch her, to kiss her, to do <em>anything</em> more than she was currently doing.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t give more than an inch. She allowed Rio to kiss up her neck, to nip at her ear lobe, even to grind slowly against her, but she always held her steady, held her firmly away from her, insistent that Rio rest.</p><p>Secretly, in a very small part of her that Rio would never admit to having, she was pleased of this. Agatha had looked positively feral when Rio had ground her hips down against her thigh at one point in the morning and yet she’d held off, she hadn’t done anything other than hold Rio so she’d stop, her blue eyes flashing dangerously even as her lips said “no.”</p><p>It was a slow and subtle power game that Rio was, to the unobservant outsider, definitely losing.</p><p>But Rio, and Agatha, both knew that Rio was winning. That Agatha was destined to lose control at some point. When Rio was better. When she could handle it. When she could reap the rewards of teasing her girlfriend.</p><p>Rio’s body still ached, still burnt every time she twisted or moved suddenly, but her pain meds took the brunt of the pain away. But she wanted Agatha so desperately, wanted her to be her usual self with her. She wanted to feel normal and to be normal.</p><p>And so even as Agatha remained stoic in her insistence that Rio relax, that she rest, Rio kept pushing.</p><p>But their push and pull was soon interrupted by Jen and Alice who had no qualms about barging in to the apartment as Rio had been insistently kissing along Agatha’s jaw, promising her all the things they could do now she had unlimited time and they had many rooms to christen in Agatha’s large D.C. home.</p><p>And soon she was lounging with Alice on the couch, laughing along with each other good-naturedly as they shared another joint.</p><p>This was the only time Agatha had released her hold on Rio for longer than it took one of them to go to the bathroom and she watched with cautious eyes as her girlfriend and her best friend bonded over a mutual hatred of the Lakers.</p><p>“Golden ball bastards,” Rio had announced much to Alice’s glee.</p><p>“Little bitches,” Alice agreed. And they both broke down into fits of giggles.</p><p>“Understand any of that?” Jen asked suspiciously as she frowned over at her wife and her wife’s apparent new best friend.</p><p>“No. Or that she’s forgiven her so easily.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes and slapped Agatha’s arm lightly, “She told me everything, you know. Rio really did hold back. Maybe she does love you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but flexed her jaw and said nothing as she watched Rio gasp for air, her head lolling backwards as she rolled almost off the couch.</p><p>Agatha made a move as if to go catch her to ask Rio to be more careful, but Jen held her back from their position at the small, round dining table just off the living room.</p><p>“She’s fine. Leave her be.”</p><p>Agatha sighed then, turning more to Jen fully and raising her brows, “How long are you planning on being a bitch about her?”</p><p>“Oh, probably forever.”</p><p>“Great. Just so we’re clear.”</p><p>Jen scoffed and turned to Agatha too, raising her brows at her. “So. Rio was telling Alice that you’ve sold your soul. I knew it was bad but… I didn’t know it was <em>that</em> bad.”</p><p>“It’s not. It’s fine. It’ll be over soon.”</p><p>“Agatha, you have another year of this. And it’s only going to get worse. Besides, now she’s not an active escort, what is he holding over you? He got your nudes or something?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze narrowed at Jen briefly before she turned back to gaze across at Rio, her expression softening as she took the sight in of her still giggling. Rio was now draped across the sofa like an expensive throw, her grin somehow lopsided even as she continued to throw out more and more random insults about various basketball teams.</p><p>“It’s not Stark. It’s Wanda. She was the one who found out about Rio and she’s been… in contact ever since. Turns out that she either wants Rio or she wants <em>President Tony Stark</em>. So I’ll make it happen and she’ll leave her alone.”</p><p>Jen frowned deeply at this information, lifting a finger up to experimentally touch her frown lines between her eyes to see how much of her skin had moved and whether she’d need a few extra CC’s next time.</p><p>“Leave her alone? What? She’s sexting her?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and frowned back at Jen, slapping her hand away from where she’d now been tugging the skin around her eyes back to test the elasticity.</p><p>“No. She wants to embarrass her. To shame her. She wants to use her to get to me. And I won’t let it happen.”</p><p>Jen surveyed her best friend in silence for a few seconds, watching her jaw flex, her chin lift, and then, ultimately, her gaze move back to Rio and she felt a deep affection for the woman she’d known all these years.</p><p>Moving subtly to reach across for Agatha’s forearm she lowered her voice and said, “Okay but does Rio know this? Because from what she told Alice she’s not exactly thrilled with what you’ve got going on with Stark.”</p><p>Agatha released a humourless laugh and threw her head back, pulling her arm away from Jen, “She offered to sleep with her to make it go away.”</p><p>“And?” Jen pulled back with a sudden beaming grin, holding her hands up in triumph, “Yay! Easy! Solves the problem!”</p><p>A subtle shift in Agatha’s expression though told her that it was not a solution Agatha was at all interested in and Jen scowled, her look of jubilation disappearing suddenly, “You’re kidding. She offered to sleep with her so that you wouldn’t actually combust over the next year and you said no?”</p><p>“If it were Alice?” Agatha nodded her head towards the woman now sitting cross-legged on the floor by Rio’s head, listing off players in the WNBA she thought she could beat in a 1-1 game.</p><p>Jen’s gaze fell to her wife then too and her scowl softened and then disappeared altogether. “I’d burn the world.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything after that but continued to watch Rio with an unreadable expression on her face, the sight of her so at ease with Alice making her feel less than okay but more than uncomfortable.</p><p>It was Jen who broke the silence again and Agatha sighed quietly, “What’s stopping Wanda from exposing her anyway? Even when it’s all done?”</p><p>Agatha chewed on the inside of her cheek and huffed out a slow breath, “I’m working on that.”</p><p>Jen raised her brows in question but said nothing for a second before she pivoted, “And this moving in thing… is it fair? Rio moving to D.C. when you’ll practically be flying all over the country in the next few months. Doesn’t she have that friend here? Natalie? Wouldn’t it be kinder to not move in?”</p><p>“Natasha,” Agatha corrected with an arched brow. “And she’ll kill your wife before I do.”</p><p>“Oh stop being such a bitch. Her name is <em>Alice</em> and she’s loved you longer than anyone else in the world. Took me years,” she added with a smirk and poked at Agatha’s arm.</p><p>Agatha shot Jen a glare but softened a little, “I’m hoping she’ll come with me.”</p><p>“All those disgusting motels? All that godawful political chat? I’d rather die.”</p><p>“You think I stay in motels?”</p><p>“Hey, you hire hookers, who knows what else you get up to.”</p><p>Agatha had to bite down on the inside of her cheek to stop herself from laughing, not wanting to give Jen the satisfaction. “If I can’t call Alice ‘your wife’, you can’t call Rio a…”</p><p>But her words were interrupted by a kamikaze in the form of a high as shit Rio Vidal landing in her lap with a soft ‘oomf’.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha shouted in warning even as her arms wrapped securely around the still giggling woman who only briefly looked a little uncomfortable, her brow furrowing even as she still laughed.</p><p>“Jump on me, Alice, and you will be sleeping on the couch!”</p><p>Alice, who was approaching with a loud laugh continued to laugh even as she took the gentler approach and slipped into Jen’s lap. Jen had opened her arms to her wife even as she’d chastised her.</p><p>Rio was now trying to claw at her neck, trying to pull Agatha closer and pressing as close as she could to her as if she could crawl into her skin.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered soothingly, her hands holding her steady at her hips, that same firm hold she’d been keeping on her all day. A self-preservation mechanism as well as a means of trying to keep Rio safe, unharmed.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio beamed, a soft laugh escaping her lips again as she pressed her face fully against Agatha’s, kissing her lazily, a little off kilter, not quite catching her lips properly.</p><p>Agatha had to move back slightly from this, her smile threatening to break her face in half as she watched Rio, her pupils fully dilated in her already dark eyes.</p><p>“Honey,” she murmured, one hand moving to rub up her good side, “You are on another planet.”</p><p>As Rio laughed again, but her face creased slightly as her ribs began to fight the excess work she’d been putting them through, Jen spoke, “How come your girlfriend laughs and my wife cries?”</p><p>“I do not cry,” Alice protested suddenly, though Agatha looked around to see her friend in tears and couldn’t help but laugh at her.</p><p>“Must be because she’s married to you.”</p><p>“Fuck off, Harkness.”</p><p>“I just love you all so much,” Alice sniffed, her own hands pawing at Jennifer’s neck, “And Rio. Rio is the best. I want you to get married and make enough babies so we can have a basketball team and-…”</p><p>But Rio had interrupted this spiel with a loud laugh and she leant away from Agatha, despite Agatha’s protests, to reach for Alice and try to tug her closer into a perilous hug.</p><p>“Alice, estás loca.”</p><p>Agatha grunted with the effort of Rio pulling so fully away from her and trying to hold her at the strange angle that she was now at without holding her in a way that would hurt.</p><p>“Rio, honey.”</p><p>“Fucksake, what is wrong with you two,” Jen huffed as Alice moved in the same way as Rio to capture her in a hug.</p><p>“Jen could you-…”</p><p>But Alice had made contact, mostly due to Jen not bothering to hold her back or help facilitate this mid-air hug, and Rio released a sound that was halfway between a laugh and a cry of pain.</p><p>“Shit,” Agatha growled, leaning fully in now to pull at Rio and try to untangle her arms from Alice. “Alice get the fuck-…”</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Jen chided quietly, pulling now at Alice, “You’re hurting her and Agatha is mad enough.”</p><p>Alice released a howl then, beginning to properly cry, and she pulled away even as Rio stubbornly held on and caused Agatha to huff unhappily, “Rio. Please.”</p><p>Soon enough Rio was back fully in her lap with wide eyes and a slight pallor that hadn’t been there before.</p><p>Rio felt hazy, more hazy than she had been even as she was hurling out insults to the universe about some of the best basketball players in the world. Agatha span before her even as she sat still and Rio’s grip on her collar went a little slack.</p><p>“I need to,” Rio started slowly, her voice breaking, “I need to…”</p><p>Rio swallowed down what she needed to do but began to move urgently, breaking Agatha’s hold on her and stumbling her way to the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha was hot on her tail and slammed the bathroom door shut behind them as Rio sank to her knees and proceeded to vomit into the waiting toilet.</p><p>Gentle hands moved to sweep dark hair up to hold it back and Agatha settled like a protective blanket around Rio, holding her gently as she wretched and cried.</p><p>Jen wasn’t far behind and barged in without knocking, grimacing at the sight and sounds.</p><p>“Christ. What a mess.”</p><p>“Out!” Agatha shouted, even as she continued to gently gather Rio’s hair and sweep it into a loose ponytail using the hair tie from her wrist.</p><p>Jen muttered something but disappeared from the little room again, leaving Agatha alone with Rio to soothe her as she continued to vomit from the exertion of the morning, from the mix of medication and weed in her system, and from the toll of the past two days.</p><p>By the time Rio had exhausted herself, her stomach now empty and her body screaming at her, she slumped back against Agatha and wiped at her eyes, “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha shushed her gently, placing soft kisses to her cheek and temple as she leant around her more. “Nothing to be sorry for.”</p><p>Her hands reached to hold Rio’s and she pressed another gentle kiss to her cheek as she held her through her steadying breaths, “Do you need anything? Some water?”</p><p>Rio remained silent for a while, focusing on the steady breathing of Agatha pressed behind her and using it as a meditative rhythm to dissipate the pain emanating from her chest.</p><p>It was clear to her then what she needed. She had Agatha around her, holding her, but the rest of her heart was somewhere across the city.</p><p>“Could you call Natasha?”</p><p>She felt Agatha’s breath hitch slightly then, and turned her face just slightly towards her but felt Agatha nod against her head, placing a soft kiss to her temple.</p><p>“Okay.”</p>

<em>Her hands reached to hold Rio’s and she pressed another gentle kiss to her cheek as she held her through her steadying breaths, “Do you need anything? Some water?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio remained silent for a while, focusing on the steady breathing of Agatha pressed behind her and using it as a meditative rhythm to dissipate the pain emanating from her chest.<br/>
It was clear to her then what she needed. She had Agatha around her, holding her, but the rest of her heart was somewhere across the city.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Could you call Natasha?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She felt Agatha’s breath hitch slightly then, and turned her face just slightly towards her but felt Agatha nod against her head, placing a soft kiss to her temple.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Okay.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha began to peel away slowly, reluctantly, keeping her hold on Rio for as long as she could. “Let me take you to bed first.”</p><p>Rio acquiesced, but requested she brush her teeth first, the tang of bile in her mouth a heady reminder she wanted rid of.</p><p>Agatha held her steady as she stood at the sink and brushed away the remnants of her indignity.</p><p>She could barely look at herself in the mirror, afraid to see the ghostly pallor and tired eyes staring back at her.</p><p>But when she looked up she caught Agatha’s gaze, as soft and concerned as ever and she reached back to her to pull her closer, feeling woozy now for different reasons.</p><p>Agatha held her carefully and then walked with her.</p><p>Alice was in the hall, waiting patiently to check on her friend, though still crying, but Agatha dismissed her with a look and Rio only smiled tightly at her as they passed.</p><p>Once Rio was safe and wrapped in plush blankets, Agatha disappeared to make the call to Natasha.</p><p>Though Rio had pulled her down for a quick, apologetic kiss before she’d hidden herself in the covers. Her high dissolved amidst the torrent of emotions now battering her tired mind and body.</p><p>Agatha left with a heaviness in her chest, leaving her heart tucked under the covers with Rio.</p><p>She’d saved Natasha’s number weeks ago, when the woman had left it scribbled on a note in Rio’s kitchen for emergencies. But she hadn’t thought she’d ever really need it.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>“It’s Agatha. Rio wants to see you.”</p><p>“What’s happened?”</p><p>“Could you come to us? I’m on Jane-…”</p><p>“What’s happened?”</p><p>“Apartment 7, 9 Jane Street.”</p><p>Agatha heard movement on the other end of the line and then nothing. She pulled the phone away from her ear and saw that Natasha had hung up.</p><p><em>Bitch.</em> She thought.</p><p>Half an hour later, Agatha peeled away from Rio’s now sleeping form in the middle of the bed and went to buzz Natasha up after hearing the telltale sound of the intercom in the hall.</p><p>She waited impatiently by the door, tapping her foot.</p><p>A brief, sharp knock alerted her to Natasha’s arrival and she opened the door to Rio’s furious best friend.</p><p>“Where is she?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips at the impertinent question and stepped back to allow Natasha to enter, about to respond when she heard Jen’s voice from the entrance to the living room.</p><p>“God, <em>this</em> is her best friend? It’s a shame you don’t share because that would be an excellent three-…”</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha snapped even as she pointed in the direction of the bedroom.</p><p>Natasha barely glanced in Jen’s direction and stormed past Agatha to find Rio.</p><p>Swallowing down her anger at this, Agatha shoved at Jen’s shoulder as she went after the red head and Jen had the decency to at least look a little sorry. But just a little.</p><p>As Agatha caught up to Natasha and entered the bedroom after her she had to bite her tongue as she watched the woman slip onto the bed and stroke her girlfriend’s cheek.</p><p>She lingered uncertainly by the end of the bed, her fingers twitching as if to rip Natasha’s hands away from Rio, but she didn’t say anything.</p><p>How could she, when Rio had specifically asked for this. For her.</p><p>Natasha coaxed Rio from her sleep as if she’d done it a million times before, her tone soft and hushed and Agatha felt sick as she realised that she was speaking Spanish to her.</p><p>Something Agatha couldn’t do.</p><p>As Rio turned to Natasha and blinked into the light of the room Agatha moved a little closer, wanting Rio to know she was there. Wanting Rio to ask for her.</p><p>But Rio’s gaze was heavy and her movements slow as she winced and pushed herself up off the bed, moving to sit up.</p><p>Natasha’s hands went to touch Rio’s waist and both Rio and Agatha said a quick, “Don’t.”</p><p>Natasha pulled back a little, her eyes flying over Rio’s face and her body suddenly rigid, “Tell me.”</p><p>For the first time since she’d left her in the bed<br/>
Agatha’s gaze met Rio’s and she saw in it an unfamiliar hesitance. Rio had always looked at Agatha with certainty. Even when she was mad. Even when she hadn’t been sure about their relationship in the very beginning.</p><p>And Agatha felt her chest tighten at the sight of it.</p><p>But Rio was already looking back at Natasha, reaching for her to pull her hand into her lap.</p><p>Natasha allowed it and even as Agatha shifted uncomfortably, Natasha’s free hand cupped Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Rio glanced back at Agatha then, “Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha felt like Rio had slapped her. She was being dismissed. But she nodded and silently, reluctantly, left the two of them alone.</p><p>“You’re leaving the two of them alone together with a bed? My, my, you are sure she loves you.”</p><p>These words greeted Agatha as she stepped from the bedroom and she sneered over at Jen who smiled in amusement back at her.</p><p>“Fuck off, Jen.”</p><p>She dragged her by the arm back through to the living room and looked over to see Alice now curled up in her armchair, looking sheepish.</p><p>“Is she okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and motioned instead for Alice to shift it, and when she did, she replaced her in the chair.</p><p>“I don’t know why she likes her so much. She’s such a-…”</p><p>“What?” Jen laughed, “a bitch? A bit like you? Yeah it’s a mystery.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes over at her best friend and ran a hand through her hair. “She asked for her. She…”</p><p>But she didn’t voice her fears. Knowing that speaking them to the universe would give them power. Lilia had got to her at least that much.</p><p>Agatha was able to give Rio time alone with Natasha for an hour before she had to intrude again. Only her respect for Rio’s love of Natasha made her pause at her own bedroom door and knock before entering.</p><p>She didn’t receive a response. So she came in anyway.</p><p>The sight before her almost made her collapse. Or scream. Or attack.</p><p>Rio was lying in a position she’d been in many times with Agatha: her head against her chest, her body curled in between her legs, Rio safe and warm encircled in her arms.</p><p>Only this time it wasn’t Agatha. It was Natasha.</p><p>“Was that Alice? In the hall when I arrived.”</p><p>The question took Agatha by surprise and she looked from Rio’s sleeping form to the asker, who sat up against the headboard, keeping her voice low and her arms still tight around her best friend.</p><p>“What? No. That was Jen.”</p><p>Natasha didn’t acknowledge the answer and instead said. “She told me everything.”</p><p>Green eyes flashed a little but otherwise Natasha gave nothing away, still talking in that frustratingly flat tone that made Agatha want to throttle her.</p><p>“I knew something was wrong when she didn’t tell me she was home safe.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, having known already that Rio always checked in with Natasha before and after meeting clients and she was big enough to be pleased that Rio had someone else looking out for her but it stung all the same.</p><p>“Is she okay?”</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>Natasha raised her chin a little as she responded, and Agatha recognised the challenge she’d thrown her way but she didn’t rise to it, not whilst Rio was in the room, blissfully unaware of what was happening.</p><p>“Alice and Jen-…”</p><p>“Alice shouldn’t be anywhere near her.”</p><p>“Believe me I want to kill her too but-…”</p><p>“Then why is she still breathing?”</p><p>The question caught Agatha off guard again and she opened her mouth to respond but closed it just as quickly, a fist forming at her side.</p><p>“Rio won’t let me near her.”</p><p>“Rio doesn’t know what’s good for her.”</p><p>Agatha sneered at this, knowing it was another dagger thrown her way. But Natasha wasn’t done, wasn’t near being finished with the woman who now stood stockstill at the end of the bed.</p><p>“You’re not good enough for her.”</p><p>All semblance of decency disappeared from Agatha then, her mind catching up to what her body already knew: she wanted to rip Natasha away from Rio. She wanted to rip her head off.</p><p>“You’re in love with her?”</p><p>Natasha’s lips twitched slightly at this, her gaze raising from Agatha’s clenched fists up to meet her gaze.</p><p>“Am I.”</p><p>There it was again, that tone. That sickening flat tone that made Agatha want to scream, want to yell until she could force a reaction from this woman. Something that wasn’t smugly self-assured, something that didn’t stink of a confidence that Rio was <em>hers</em>.</p><p>“Rio’s made her choice. She’s moving in with me. And whether you-…”</p><p>“Your best friend attacked Rio not two days ago, broke her rib, and you thought then was a good time to ask her to move in. When she was at her most vulnerable. Don’t even get me started on her quitting her job to follow you.”</p><p>Agatha gaped at the woman before her, knowing that if Rio hadn’t been tucked in against her, she’d have destroyed Natasha Romanoff.</p><p>“How fucking dare-…”</p><p>But her voice had picked up, where Natasha’s had stayed low, soft, just an inch or two above Rio’s head, and Rio stirred unhappily, shifting to rub at her eyes and in a move that made Agatha see red, she’d turned her head into the warmth of Natasha’s chest and nuzzled against her.</p><p>Natasha didn’t break her gaze from Agatha and only moved a hand that had been below the blankets and on Rio’s waist up to hold her shoulder gently, “Your girlfriend’s here.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly and rubbed at her eyes, turning to blink across at Agatha. The sight before her made her frown and she shifted in her position, wincing a little as she turned in Natasha’s arms and sat up fully to gaze across at Agatha.</p><p>Her head was spinning and she felt hollowed out. But she recognised the tension in the room. Saw the anger on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“What’s happened?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed but she shook her head just once and forced herself to soften for Rio’s sake even as the still frowning woman began to move fully from the bed to get to Agatha.</p><p>Natasha didn’t move, just watched the interaction closely, remaining seated against the headboard.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered softly, reached to turn the woman to look at her and already feeling a little faint, her body still exhausted.</p><p>“It’s fine. We were just-…”</p><p>“I was just asking Agatha why Alice is still alive.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and rubbed at her temple, “Natasha, we’ve discussed this.”</p><p>“Ella es mala para ti.” <em>She’s bad for you.</em></p><p>Rio turned to look at her best friend and shook her head slowly, watching as Natasha raised a brow in challenge, demanding a rebuttal.</p><p>“I can guess what that means,” Agatha muttered under her breath, her hand instinctively unfurling from its tight fist so she could reach for Rio.</p><p>“Nat. Can you try to be nice, please. Agatha has done everything-…”</p><p>“I’ve had enough of this,” the red head said, her voice still the infuriating mix of low, deep, and flat.</p><p>She stood from the bed and avoided Rio as she reached for her, storming from the room and leaving the other two in her wake.</p><p>“Natasha.”</p><p>Rio charged after her, Agatha close behind and holding her arm back to try and keep Rio out of harm’s way, knowing whatever was about to happen wouldn’t be pretty.</p><p>“Rio. Don’t.”</p><p>But Agatha was curious to see what would happen. Because her love for Alice had held her back even a little bit. Her love for Rio even more so.</p><p>But Natasha. Agatha had no idea how much her love for Rio would temper her anger.</p><p>And a small part of her, the furious, uncompromising piece of her that still wanted to strangle Alice for laying a finger on Rio, wanted to see what Natasha would do.</p><p>By the time they rounded the corner into the living room Agatha, and Rio, saw exactly what she’d do.</p><p>They saw Natasha grabbing Alice by her collar and pulling her to her feet.</p><p>“Alice?” She asked, but knew the answer already, throwing Alice at the wall like she was a rag doll and thrusting her forearm up against her throat to hold her there.</p><p>Alice attempted a slight struggle but was still in the throes of her trip, a little woozy, and puffy, exhausted from all the crying.</p><p>And Natasha had moved like a thief in the night.</p><p>“Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!” Jen was on her feet, flailing. But she didn’t try to grab Natasha and looked instead to Agatha and Rio with wide eyes: “Do something!”</p><p>Rio was shouting for Natasha to stop and struggling against Agatha’s now firm hold, Agatha having decided that whatever hurt Rio would get from her holding her would be better than whatever might come of the violent performance in front of them.</p><p>But soon Alice looked on the verge of collapse and Agatha pulled Rio back to step around her and grab Natasha.</p><p>Growling as she tugged Natasha back by her arms, she held her in a vicelike grip.</p><p>But it wasn’t necessary.</p><p>Natasha didn’t struggle.</p><p>She barely reacted to being pulled away, having expected it at some point, having done just what she meant to and no more.</p><p>She allowed her arms to be pulled behind her and allowed Rio to crowd her from the front, grasping her shirt and shouting in her face, “What the fuck! What the fuck, Nat! I told you! I told you it was sorted! You promised!”</p><p>Green eyes flashed up to meet familiar brown and saw in them a wildness that she’d only seen a few times before. For the first time that night, at least in front of more than just Rio, Natasha let her guard down and she turned her head slightly, leaning as much as she could in Agatha’s hold so their cheeks brushed and she could turn her head to let her lips graze Rio’s cheek in a quiet, personal act of contrition.</p><p>Natasha’s lips against her cheek awoke something in Rio that calmed the raging beast within her.</p><p>Natasha was her Alice. Natasha had done what Alice had done two nights ago. And for that reason she couldn’t be angry at her. Not truly.</p><p>Her shoulders slumped a little and she dropped her gaze to where Agatha was holding her best friend steady, though Natasha still didn’t pull against her, only stood still, watching Rio closely.</p><p>Alice had slid slowly down the wall, crumbling in on herself on the floor as she battled to catch her breath, clutching at her throat as Jen ran to her side.</p><p>The movement made Natasha look away again, set her jaw again, her gaze moving from Rio and down to the woman now curled in on herself on the floor. She barely reacted to the sight, not in the way she’d reacted to Rio. Agatha kept a hold of her.</p><p>“She deserves worse.”</p><p>“Natasha,” Rio groaned, moving her hand up to turn her face towards her again and brushing her thumbs across her cheeks, her volume now normal and her tone desperate, “Natasha. You said you wouldn’t.”</p><p>“I said I wouldn’t kill her. I didn’t say anything about scaring her.”</p><p>“That was more than scaring her you psychotic bitch!”</p><p>Rio glanced aside and saw Jen move up to them, looking insane with rage and Rio instinctively moved to cover Natasha even as Agatha dropped her hold on the woman and moved quickly to begin pulling Rio away.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t,” Rio said quickly, quietly, to Agatha, but Agatha didn’t let up and kept her hold on Rio, trying to pull her away from danger as she watched Jen tower over Natasha and the smaller woman square up to her.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were insistent and she pulled Rio a couple steps back.</p><p>“Do you think you’re some sort of vigilante or something?! Touch her again and I will kill you!”</p><p>Natasha scoffed and tilted her head, “With your crystals or your super serums?”</p><p>“Natasha.”</p><p>Rio stuggled a little more in Agatha’s hold but Agatha held firm and squeezed Rio’s waist where she held her, “Honey.”</p><p>Alice, from the floor, spluttering slightly, spoke up just as Jen stepped towards the woman who’d attacked her wife.</p><p>“Jen, it’s fine. Jen. I…”</p><p>“She deserves it,” Natasha finished for her, giving Jen a final once over and reading it correctly that she wouldn’t go for her.</p><p>She then turned back to Alice, “Go near her again and I won’t let up.”</p><p>“Natasha,” Rio pleaded, reaching for her and just about making contact with her shoulder to tug at her as Agatha refused to let go of her. “Nat, it’s too much.”</p><p>Natasha nodded just once as she met Rio’s eye again and glanced behind her to meet Agatha’s steely gaze.</p><p>But she spoke to Rio and Rio alone: “You should come home with me.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed and she raised her chin, her hold on Rio slackening a little but she didn’t say anything.</p><p>She knew if she did she wouldn’t be able to stop herself from ripping into the redhead. So she bit down on her tongue and refused to look away.</p><p>Rio sighed and pushed Agatha’s arms away, finally breaking from her hold as she crowded Natasha again and began ushering her out the door, glancing briefly back to check on Alice and giving Agatha a quick, what she hoped was, reassuring look.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said to the room, leaving behind a panting Alice and a shell shocked Jen.</p><p>But Agatha was already moving and by the time Rio had hurried Natasha into the bedroom, Agatha was right behind them, looking furious.</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio warned quickly, turning to see Agatha open her mouth as if to speak, but knowing she was about to shout.</p><p>But she wasn’t annoyed that Agatha had followed. It was just what it was. An inevitability.</p><p>Agatha leant back against the door, her eyes following Rio as she moved towards her best friend. Her teeth still pin wring her tongue, threatening to spill blood, but refusing to relinquish their hold.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have done that. I’d handled it. I’m fine.”</p><p>“Far from it.”</p><p>“Natasha.”</p><p>“Tell me that Rio a year ago would have allowed someone to break her ribs.”</p><p>“It’s different. This is so different. She did it because-…”</p><p>“Because of her.”</p><p>Rio stiffened and for the first time in her life, for the first time in almost twenty years, she wanted to slap Natasha.</p><p>She took a slow, steadying breath and felt her chest sting with the weight of it before she took a slow step towards her and felt Agatha mirror this movement behind her.</p><p>“It was a misunderstanding.”</p><p>“You’re not safe with her. And you never will be.”</p><p>Green eyes flashed then and Rio’s breath hitched: both reacting to the same stimuli. Agatha had wrapped her arm around Rio. But it wasn’t her usual hold, protective and firm. She held her loosely, almost as if her arm had ended up there by accident.</p><p>Rio’s body tensed, prepared for Agatha to shout or to fight Natasha. But she didn’t. She heard her take a slow breath and saw Natasha’s brow furrow just slightly as she watched the woman now directly behind Rio.</p><p>And the voice that spoke then, the voice that could make Rio shiver or make her feel safe, or both, suddenly made her want to cry.</p><p>“You should go home with her.”</p><p>Rio turned in Agatha’s hold and stared at her in disbelief, “What? That’s… I’m leaving with you tomorrow.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha’s voice was firm again but her eyes looked glassy, like she was fighting against something and losing the battle, “No you should go with her. You need to rest and I’ll deal with those two. Staying here will… it won’t help anything.”</p><p>“Finally we agree on something, Harkness.”</p><p>“It’s been a long weekend and you’re not,” Agatha began but took a sharp inhale in as Rio shook her head and pulled away from her, “You need some time to recover. To think.”</p><p>“Think?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha continued slowly, suddenly unsure of herself, “But I want you to move in with me.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to speak but couldn’t find the words and instead took another step back even as Agatha moved in to hold her, “I want you to move in with me <em>desperately</em>.”</p><p>A touch to her lower back let Rio know that Natasha was there, wanting to leave, but all she could focus on were deep blue eyes that bored through her, and the soft hold of Agatha over her jaw.</p><p>“No. No. I don’t need to think about it.”</p><p>She was practically sandwiched between the two women she loved most in the world. The only two women she’d ever truly loved and instead of feeling comforted, she felt sick.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed out quietly, her fingers moving back to slip into Rio’s hair, holding her steady and moving in closer.</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha’s breath against her lips and she clutched at the front of her shirt, tugging at her gently, desperate for her to take it back.</p><p>“Take a couple days. Then come to D.C.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio insisted, frowning as she kissed her once, twice, three times, unsure why this was suddenly happening. Why Agatha wanted her far from her when the past two days she’d done nothing but be close.</p><p>“I love you. Be with Natasha for a couple days. Take as long as you need and then… come to me.”</p><p>Rio frowned still, her tired mind struggling to keep up with this new plan. But Natasha was behind her, now moving her hand to her waist and tugging her backwards, trying to manoeuvre her away.</p><p>“Wait,” Rio protested quietly, glancing around her at Natasha for a second before turning back to Agatha. “You haven’t changed your mind?”</p><p>“Never.”</p><p>Rio hesitated then, knowing that Agatha wouldn’t be doing this without reason but she couldn’t figure out what it was, not with her mind still blurry and her body torn between exhaustion, anger, and pain.</p><p>“Okay,” she finally breathed out, watching the way Agatha’s lashes fluttered and she dropped her gaze to Rio’s lips.</p><p>Natasha’s touch became firmer and so Rio only let herself press a gentle kiss to Agatha, lingering for a while before she pulled away.</p><p>She moved then to the door with Natasha close to her side and paused to look around, catching Agatha’s gaze for just a second and seeing it drift from her own to the woman beside her.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed a little when it did, and Rio could have sworn she saw her nod once but Natasha was ushering her out the door before she could think much of it.</p><p>They disappeared from the room, from the apartment, and out into the cold afternoon in New York.</p><p>Exhausted both mentally and physically, Rio couldn’t quite understand what had happened and why Agatha was telling her to take some time to think.</p><p>But Natasha was leading them home, holding her hand firmly, and not letting go until Rio was inside her apartment and tucked under her own blankets.</p><p>Natasha stayed with her as she slept, neither having spoken since leaving Agatha’s.</p><p>Rio slept soundly until the next morning, and woke reluctantly, slowly, blinking into the mid-morning sun. She reached out instinctively and found a soft body beside her that was familiar and welcome, but not the one she was looking for.</p><p>“Was it a dream?”</p><p>“Which part?”</p><p>“All of it.”</p><p>Natasha shifted where she lay on her side next to Rio and frowned a little, “Agatha’s called twice this morning. I think you’ll find she’s text you. Your phone’s been lighting up since we got back.”</p><p>“She called you?”</p><p>“Twice.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and nodded, moving her hand to twist against Natasha’s shirt, “I’m going to call her and then we need to talk about it. What you did yesterday.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Her best friend smiled a little at her, gentle fingers flexing over Rio’s tired ones and not for the first time Rio wondered what she’d do without Natasha. Until she met Agatha she’d been her sole protector. Her family.</p><p>She sighed and rolled away, wincing as she reached for her phone that Natasha had plugged in to charge over night.</p><p>“Take your meds first.”</p><p>Rio hummed and allowed the kiss to her shoulder as she reached for her meds and took them with the help of a sip of water.</p><p>She heard the telltale signs of running water and the churn of her old boiler switching the heat on and knew Natasha was giving her some privacy to call her girlfriend.</p><p>Natasha was right. Agatha had text. As had Alice.</p><p>11:07pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Can you let me know you’re okay?</p><p>12:33am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’m assuming you’re asleep. I love you. I’ll call in the morning.</p><p>02:29am<br/>
Alice Wu-Gulliver: I’m so sorry. Can you call me later?</p><p>05:37am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’m on my way home. Call me when you can.</p><p>10:12am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’ve spoken to Natasha. Call me when you can.</p><p>She had three missed calls from Agatha.</p><p>Rio reached for the glass of water by her bedside and gulped down the rest of it before she clicked the call button against Agatha’s name.</p><p>She picked up immediately.</p><p>“Rio. Are you okay?”</p><p>“Why did you change your mind?”</p><p>There was silence down the line and Rio began to toy with her sleep shorts, staring at an umbrella plant she’d had for years, counting the seconds until Agatha spoke again.</p><p>“I didn’t. I want you to move in. But I don’t want your moving in with me to make Natasha hate me forever.”</p><p>“What did she say to you?”</p><p>“She’s your family, Rio. You wouldn’t be happy if she didn’t approve.”</p><p>“She already doesn’t.”</p><p>“I know. And maybe that won’t change but… she was right. In the space of two days where you’d been through so much, <em>too much</em>, you changed your whole life. For <em>me</em>. And I want to make sure that-…”</p><p>“You think I don’t want this?”</p><p>Agatha sighed and was silent for another while, giving Rio time to begin counting the leaves on the plant opposite her.</p><p>“Being with me means a lot of sacrifices for you. I don’t take that lightly, and you shouldn’t either.”</p><p>“Being with me means a lot of sacrifices for <em>you</em>”, Rio countered, her fingers fisting the fabric of her shorts, “You’re killing yourself.”</p><p>“Just focus on you. Please. When you want to come, if you still do, I’ll send Jimmy. I’ll arrange for all your stuff to be packed and brought down.”</p><p>“Not if, Agatha. When. I want this. I want you.”</p><p>There was a noise behind her then and Rio registered that the water had turned off, the thrum in the walls from the boiler was no more, and there was a shift in the mattress that let her know Natasha was behind her.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as she heard nothing but silence down the line.</p><p>But Agatha was gathering herself, torn between telling Rio to just come, to just blow it all up with Natasha and the practical, logical self that knew that to win the war you had to lose a battle or two - despite how much she hated losing.</p><p>She hadn’t built her empire without a few, necessary sacrifices along the way.</p><p>“Stay with Natasha. Talk to her. Talk it through. I’ll be here. Call me whenever you want. I love you and I want you here with me.”</p><p>As Rio’s shoulders slumped, she felt a hand reach for her side and she allowed Natasha to support her silently as she finally said:</p><p>“Okay. I’ll call you later.”</p><p>“Call me,” Agatha requested softly, though Rio had just promised she would, and Rio nodded into the phone before she hung up.</p><p>As her phone rested again in her lap, Rio took a deep steadying breath and felt the now familiar sting of her lungs expanding.</p><p>“Coffee. Coffee and food. You need to look after yourself.”</p><p>Rio sighed and rubbed at her eyes, turning slowly to look at the other person who loved her most in the world and nodded.</p><p>“Only if it’s-…”</p><p>“Bacon, egg, and cheese on poppy from Santaigo’s. Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>A slight smile twitched at the corners of Rio’s lips then as she watched Natasha move from the bed and head out to the door, “You should shower. You’re gross.”</p><p>So Rio did just that. She took a long, hot shower and felt her body ache and creak with every movement. But by the time she was done and changed, Natasha was back, sitting on the floor against the small couch with two tinfoil wrapped bagels and two steaming coffees: Rio’s with cream and sugar, Natasha’s black.</p><p>They sat and ate in silence, but Rio felt her friend’s gaze on her every so often and ignored it, wanting to get some strength first before they broached the inevitable subject.</p><p>“Say it. Say whatever it is you want to say,” Rio finally said after she’d settled back more against the couch cushions and looked down at Natasha.</p><p>“I don’t trust her.”</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>“I don’t trust her with you.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“What else is there to say.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily but pulled her legs back and her knees up so Natasha could move to sit opposite her on the couch.</p><p>“I told you yesterday. I’m in love with her. She has done everything to-…”</p><p>“And yet here you are, broken and bruised.”</p><p>“That’s not fair. Alice did to me exactly what you did to her. She did it for Agatha. And you did it for me.”</p><p>Natasha raised her brows and was silent for a while as Rio shifted and stretched her feet out to slip in the gap between Natasha’s thigh and the couch cushions.</p><p>“You could have taken her. She’s small. Did you think you deserved it?”</p><p>“Don’t psychoanalyse me. I’ve not even finished my coffee.”</p><p>Natasha’s lips twitched a little, “Did you?”</p><p>“She took me by surprise. I told you.”</p><p>Natasha stretched her arm over the back of the couch and settled back more, “You’re changing too much for her. Making too many allowances. Excuses.”</p><p>“We both knew the day might come where I’d have to quit. You <em>hate</em> my job anyway.”</p><p>“I hate it because I have to worry about you all the time. I have to think about those lousy women with their hands on you.”</p><p>“Then what is the problem?”</p><p>Natasha sat up then, leaning forwards and placing her hand down beside her to clasp Rio’s shin, “The problem is: you’ll be a kept woman. You’re too independent for that. And,” she sighed and threw herself back against the cushions, reaching down to grab her coffee.</p><p>“We discuss these things. It’s a discussion.”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek and slowly sat up, mirroring Natasha’s moves just a second ago, “I’m not leaving you.”</p><p>Natasha’s face was impassive still, but Rio felt her fingers twitch against her leg and so she let her sit in it for a second, knowing she needed a minute.</p><p>“I don’t want you to lose yourself in her.”</p><p>“I won’t. I love her. And I love you. That will never change.”</p><p>Natasha raised her brows at this but went silent again, moving across to grab Rio’s coffee and handing it to her in a silent gesture that Rio knew meant ‘okay, I’ll support you’.</p><p>“What did you say to her yesterday?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“She told me to take time to think. What did you say.”</p><p>“I told her she was taking advantage. That you were vulnerable and she-…”</p><p>“Natasha I’m not a child.”</p><p>“Then don’t act like one.”</p><p>“I love her. What about that don’t you understand?”</p><p>Natasha shook her head a little and dropped her gaze from Rio then, looking torn. “I don’t trust her. She’s a professional manipulator. She was married to the worst thing to come out of Eastern Europe since-…”</p><p>“What?” Rio raised her brows then, “Finish that sentence. I beg you.”</p><p>Natasha scowled then and looked back up to Rio. “You know what I mean. If she could marry her then she has got to have-…”</p><p>“Agatha is kind and good. And she loves me. You shouldn’t need to know anything else.”</p><p>Natasha remained silent then, her gaze dropping once more.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and continued to watch her best friend for a while, watching her return her hand back to her leg and sip at her coffee.</p><p>She thought back to when they’d first met.</p><p>When Natasha had been nothing but an attractive mystery in her Comparative Lit class who’d approached her one day to attend a ‘Languages Ball’ as her date and offered her $50 for the privilege, she’d become a fast friend, a confidant, and eventually: family.</p><p>It hadn’t taken long for Rio to invite Natasha into her life. To bring the orphaned Natasha who had been passed around foster families all her life home with her every time she visited her parents - which wasn’t often, but whenever she could afford.</p><p>The first thanksgiving of their first semester at college, Natasha had been effectively mute at the table, unable to keep up with the rapid fire conversation in animated Spanish even as Rio diligently translated for her.</p><p>But she came back again the next year, and the Vidal family home in rural Delaware on a cold thanksgiving night had been the one time they’d mistaken their affection for each other as something else.</p><p>That year Natasha had shown up to the Vidals’ practically fluent in Spanish so she could converse properly with Rio’s parents and speak to Rio in her mother tongue, surprising not only Maria and Luis but Rio too.</p><p>They’d crashed into Rio’s tiny twin bed late at night, full of the cheap Rioja Rio’s dad had plied them with all evening. Blanketed in the comfort they both only got from the other.</p><p>They kissed and groped, touched and tasted, but before anything could go too far, before they made each other their own, they’d pulled away breathless and laughing into each other’s mouths.</p><p>From that moment on, they’d been officially inseparable.</p><p>No other woman stood much of a chance even though they both flew through them at college parties, flirting with anyone and everyone, sleeping with almost anyone they desired, and always ending every night (or early morning) back together in their college dorm swapping notes, stories, and indulgent giggles.</p><p>They’d shared everything and become each other’s most loyal protectors, comfort, and lifelines.</p><p>When Rio had first started earning enough, more than she ever thought she’d earn, she’d paid off her parent’s mortgage, then Natasha’s student loans.</p><p>She helped her buy her apartment when she earned more, making sure she’d never have to worry about making rent ever again.</p><p>And Natasha, she repaid Rio with a steadfast, constant security that helped Rio feel safe in her job. In life. In everything.</p><p>She taught her krav maga, at least a mediocre amount of Russian (enough to be able to gossip together without anyone in their vicinity knowing what they were saying) but perhaps most importantly: she was her only family left and she grieved almost as much as Rio did when Maria and Luis Vidal died in a car accident the year they turned 29.</p><p>But payback or favours owed weren’t really a thing when you had what Rio and Natasha had.</p><p>So Rio understood how she felt about Agatha.</p><p>An interloper on their little family.</p><p>But that wouldn’t change how <em>she</em> felt.</p><p>“This Alice,” Natasha finally said, “You like her.”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“She’s growing on me. I’m growing on her. Maybe not after what you did but… we’re getting there.”</p><p>Natasha nodded and leant to put her empty coffee cup down, “I know people who could have actually killed her. And you do too.”</p><p>Rio pushed her legs forwards then, dislodging Natasha a little where she sat, “Shut up. It’s me. You don’t want to kill anyone. You just want a quiet life with no one but me bothering you.”</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes, “I could have you killed too.”</p><p>“You don’t want me to move to another state. You’d never have me killed.”</p><p>Rio grinned brightly at her best friend, bringing out a smile in her that only brightened Rio’s own.</p><p>“Agatha will grow on you. She’s charming. And hot.”</p><p>“Not my type.”</p><p>“She’s <em>everyone’s</em> type.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> are everyone’s type.”</p><p>“And yet we took that off the table years ago.”</p><p>“Let’s rethink. I could keep you safe. None of my friends would beat you up.”</p><p>“You don’t have any other friends.”</p><p>Natasha smiled a little at this, “Exactly. Marry me, Vidal. Let’s make a go of it.”</p><p>“Is this really how much you hate my girlfriend? You’d be willing to marry me to get rid of her?”</p><p>“Needs must.”</p><p>“Charming. As usual.”</p><p>Natasha moved then, shifting up the couch to sit by Rio’s hip and place a hand on her cheek. “Promise me you’ll look after yourself.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly but reached for Natasha to pull her closer, smiling a little as she took in her open features, “I don’t need to. You’ll do that for me.”</p><p>Natasha pursed her lips but nodded and pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek, hovering for a few seconds before kissing her there again.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon went easily after that. Rio spent most of the time horizontal and Natasha fetched her whatever she needed, from water to coffee to more snacks from the nearest bodega.</p><p>By early evening Rio called Alice, speaking to her for less than five minutes because Jen wanted her attention and was suspicious of Natasha’s influence over Rio:</p><p>“Rio, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“Are you okay? Is your throat…?”</p><p>“I’m fine. I’m fine. I deserved it.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and looked up to see Natasha watching her, arching a brow, unimpressed with her checking in on the woman who’d injured her.</p><p>“How long are you in the states? I’d like to see you.”</p><p>“I’m leaving in a couple days. I have clients to meet so I’m not sure I have time but… come over? Come to London?”</p><p>“I’d love to. Maybe soon.”</p><p>“I want to repair this, Rio. I want us… I think we could be friends.”</p><p>“We are friends.”</p><p>Rio felt Natasha nudge her thigh with her foot then and shot her a look.</p><p>“Call me in a few days?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“And hey, I know it’s been difficult but, Agatha’s never been this happy.”</p><p>Sucking in a slow breath and aware of her friend watching her, Rio just nodded, “I’ll speak to you soon.”</p><p>“Bye, Rio.”</p><p>After dinner, Rio called Agatha and found that she was missing her more than ever, hearing a quiet panic in the other woman’s voice when she answered.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“How are you? How’s your pain? Have you…”</p><p>“I’m fine. It’s fine. I’ve missed you.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet then but soon said, “I miss you too. Do you think you’ll still… can I get Jimmy to come and get you?”</p><p>“How is Wednesday? I can always get the train.”</p><p>“No. No. Jimmy will get you. I’ll get people to pack up your stuff and bring it down in the next week or so.”</p><p>Rio thought she heard Agatha sigh then and knew she was releasing a breath of relief but couldn’t be sure.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Are you sure this is-…?”</p><p>“I’m sure about you.”</p><p>After saying goodbye to Agatha, murmuring an ‘I love you’ into her phone, Rio soon settled more comfortably on the couch.</p><p>She fell asleep with Natasha, watching Jurassic Park, by her request.</p><p>As the velociraptors terrorised Lex and Tim in the kitchen and Rio was fast asleep with her head in Natasha’s lap, Natasha sent a text.</p><p>9:37pm<br/>
Natasha Romanoff: A truce.</p><p>10:14pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: A truce.</p><p>The next day Rio spent with Natasha talking more about Agatha, about Rio’s plans, about how unsuited Rio would be for Natasha’s world: the world of professional translators.</p><p>“You’re good with languages.”</p><p>“You speak seven. I speak two.”</p><p>“Three.”</p><p>“Barely.”</p><p>“You’re good with people.”</p><p>“Talking <em>to</em> them not <em>for</em> them.”</p><p>“Think about it.”</p><p>Natasha wouldn’t let up though, insistent that Rio would be a good fit. That she could teach her more languages. That she would excel.</p><p>But Rio was more insistent that she find her own path and so Natasha eventually dropped it.</p><p>The rest of the day was spend with Rio mostly horizontal again, despite her many protests. But if Agatha had been insistent, Natasha was practically dogged.</p><p>Agatha called three times throughout the day and Rio answered almost immediately every time.</p><p>Natasha kept a close eye on her during these conversations but said nothing about it.</p><p>They were back to their old selves, lounging, snacking, bickering. By midday, Rio had made Natasha laugh again, her resolute obstinance finally breaking in favour of enjoying the time she had left with her best friend.</p><p>By the time it was late in the night, they were curled up together in Rio’s bed, in the same position they’d found themselves in every evening they spent together since they were freshman in college; Rio tucked into the crook of Natasha’s neck, her arm thrown haphazardly over her stomach and Natasha toying with Rio’s hair.</p><p>They were still and silent for a long time, Rio focusing on the familiar feel of Natasha, when she heard her voice, soft and low:</p><p>“I hid an AirTag in your purse.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, having been on the verge of sleep when she heard Natasha’s admission.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“For that bitch in the cape. ‘No phones’. I couldn’t track you using your phone so I sewed it into the lining of your purse. That little black one you take everywhere.”</p><p>Rio shifted to sit up a little and gaze down at Natasha, “You’re kidding.”</p><p>“I heard about her at work. I didn’t tell you because I thought you’d think I was making it up but. She wasn’t good people. So I just wanted to keep an eye.”</p><p>Rio frowned as Natasha moved a finger to trace down her nose, “Who?”</p><p>“Russia. Sokovia.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and nudged her face up to bat away Natasha’s finger, “Wanda Maximoff.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Natasha, you know who-…”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Agatha wouldn’t-…”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and closed her eyes as Natasha moved her finger back to trace Rio’s nose again.</p><p>“Go to sleep.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered open and she watched Natasha for a second before she snuggled back down against her.</p><p>It took her longer to fall asleep than usual that night, her mind racing with what Natasha could possibly have heard that would make her break Rio’s trust, her explicit instructions, to track her.</p><p>If she thought Abigail were dangerous then to track her in the first place, to place a tracker in her bag, she would have known would put her at risk. But she did it anyway.</p><p>Her mind reeling with thoughts of Abigail. Of Wanda. Of Natasha and Agatha. She slept restlessly, and woke groggily with her alarm at 9am.</p><p>Natasha was already awake but hadn’t yet moved from her hold of Rio and was waiting for her to stir.</p><p>“Morning.”</p><p>“Mm. Morning.” Rio groaned quietly and rolled onto her back, experimentally stretching out from where she’d been curled up all night.</p><p>“Shower. Take your meds. I’ll grab breakfast.”</p><p>Rio huffed as Natasha rolled from her and disappeared away and Rio faced the prospect of her final shower in her little Washington Heights apartment as her official home.</p><p>By the time Jimmy arrived - promptly, at midday - Rio was feeling more and more anxious about leaving Natasha.</p><p>But her best friend made it easy for her. She kissed her cheek and held her gaze with a soft smile, “Call me. Whenever.”</p><p>Rio leant into her and returned her kiss with a soft one to her lips, “I’ll come and visit. All the time. You’ll be sick of me.”</p><p>A laugh escaped Natasha’s lips and she pulled away, “That a promise?”</p><p>By the time Rio was settled in the back of the car, on her way to Washington, she felt much more secure. The prospect of seeing Agatha more than making up for her last minute butterflies.</p><p>But the butterflies turned out to be desperate, hungry things, as she pulled up in front of Agatha’s house and saw what was waiting for her on the doorstep.</p><p>Agatha, dressed in a deep purple woollen sweater, her hair loose and wild about her, and the blue eyes she’d thought about every second since she’d last seen them.</p><p>Rio stepped out of the car and hesitated, unsure how to greet the woman she’d agreed to live with. She’d never done it before: never lived with another human that wasn’t her parents or Natasha.</p><p>But she didn’t have to think. Didn’t have to dwell on it as Agatha flew down the stairs to greet her.</p><p>Rio’s back hit the car door gently, her breath stolen from her as Agatha’s hands held her face and she kissed her with all of her usual desperation, just tempered, as gentle as she could be in her fervour.</p><p>“Rio,” she murmured against parted lips, smiling into them as she moved her hands down to rest against Rio’s hips, “Welcome home.”</p>

<p>Agatha’s presence was like a breath of fresh air into Rio’s aching, hungry lungs.</p><p>She was so happy that she didn’t just smile; she laughed.</p><p>But Agatha was already pulling her away, though in her keenness to get her inside she managed to remain gentle, forever conscious of Rio’s injury.</p><p>“Jimmy, bring her bag up and then you can go home.”</p><p>Rio glanced back around at the man in the dark suit, tipping an imaginary cap and looking pleased that he’d be heading home much earlier than usual.</p><p>But Jimmy was the last thing on her mind as she was dragged across the threshold to the old townhouse that was to be her new home.</p><p>“I’d carry you but I’m not sure your ribs could take it.”</p><p>“Isn’t that for brides?”</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and turned from Agatha then to see a ridiculous sight before her. The entranceway was covered in gold balloons.</p><p>“What is-…”</p><p>“Alice got her voice back fast enough to place an order for about a million of them,” Agatha explained with just a hint of amusement as she pulled Rio through the teaming river of gold.</p><p>“Is she okay?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, kicking randomly to try to disperse the deluge of gold. “Jen’s furious though. Not sure she’ll be okay for a while.”</p><p>Rio actually grimaced at this and Agatha turned around, suddenly cautious as she watched Rio closely, “She doesn’t blame you.”</p><p>“That’s a lie,” Rio raised her brows and moved her hand up to cup Agatha’s cheek, letting her thumb brush along her lower lip.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>“You’re here. Why wouldn’t I be.”</p><p>Rio bit in her lip and was about to say something else - to broach the subject of Natasha’s comments - but Agatha was looking at her in a different way now, her hand dipping behind her to squeeze her ass.</p><p>“Oh. <em>Now</em> you want to touch.”</p><p>Agatha grinned and Rio laughed again, glad she’d only just taken her meds because it didn’t sting nearly as much as she thought it might.</p><p>“I was thinking. If I’m very, very gentle, we could maybe…”</p><p>Rio hummed and leant in to capture Agatha’s lips again, nipping and tugging on her lower lip. “‘Very, very gentle’?”</p><p>Agatha grunted a little after her lip slapped back and repeated with a lower register than before, “Very, very gentle.”</p><p>Beneath Agatha’s dark stare, Rio felt a familiar flutter settle in her lower abdomen as her grip tightened on her ass and she pulled her a little closer.</p><p>“I’m sure I could handle that.”</p><p>That was all Agatha needed to pull away, moving her hand to take Rio’s and drag her through the balloons - Alice really had gone all out - and up the stairs to the main bedroom.</p><p>Rio laughed at the intensity of it all, at Agatha being still so cautious with her, as if she’d crumble beneath her at any moment, but it was when the backs of her thighs hit the bed and Agatha pushed her down gently that the laughter died on her lips.</p><p>Agatha was moving to straddle her, her blue eyes softer than they had been before, but no less intense. Instinctively, Rio sucked in a sharp breath as gentle fingers caressed her jaw and Agatha whispered, “If it hurts at all-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio reassured, her voice taking her by surprise at how firm it was when she felt like jelly beneath her girlfriend. “You could never hurt me.”</p><p>She placed her hands on Agatha’s thighs then and rubbed them gently, feeling the muscles beneath her fingers flex.</p><p>Agatha remained still for a moment, watching Rio closely, as if to see if she could spot the telltale signs of Rio already hurting. But she nodded and kissed Rio’s lips softly before pulling back and sliding from her lap.</p><p>“Oh don’t tell me that was-…”</p><p>Agatha may have been standing now, but she was dutifully leaning in to undo Rio’s jean zipper, her brow arching a little.</p><p>“Shut up and lay back.”</p><p>Rio huffed and was on the verge of throwing herself back but stopped at the last minute, knowing she’d be in for a world of pain as well as another telling off.</p><p>Agatha kept silent as she worked to slowly remove Rio’s pants, then her underwear, peeling them gently from her toned legs before she settled on her knees between them.</p><p>But Rio had missed Agatha. She wanted to see her. But it was a mistake.</p><p>She sat up quickly, her desire to see her girlfriend’s head between her legs too strong to fight, and she sucked in too sharp a breath at the sudden twinge in her side and the sight of Agatha on her knees.</p><p>Agatha’s arms had slipped under Rio’s thighs and her hands now rested on their tops. Her lips were parted and her eyes were that dangerous blue between twilight and midnight that made Rio feel weak.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered softly, her warm breath hitting her exactly where she wanted her to be. “Be careful.”</p><p>But Rio’s lips were parted and she shook her head a little, partly to shake off her haze and partly to shake off Agatha’s concern.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for just a second before she leant in, her eyes still on Rio’s as her tongue slipped out and her lips enclosed over the hood of Rio’s clit, and Rio released a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding and sucked in sharply again.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>But Agatha pulled away cautiously, even as her hold on Rio’s thighs tightened.</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched a little and she took a breath before moving closer again, experimentally pressing her tongue against Rio again.</p><p>Rio’s breathing had picked up already, and as Agatha continued to eat her out slowly, pausing every so often, sometimes barely touching her, Rio began to become more desperate.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha. Please.”</p><p>Her hands tugged at Agatha’s hair, trying to force her closer, but Agatha held firm, not allowing Rio to take control, unwilling to give in to her.</p><p>Torn between the twinge of pain with every laboured breath and her overwhelming desire for Agatha to devour her, Rio began to whine, her fingers flexing and unflexing against Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha whispered as she pulled back slowly, gazing up at Rio with a slight smirk.</p><p>“I’m not giving you more. If you can’t control your breathing, if you can’t be quiet…”</p><p>But she stopped talking, pulling away fully from Rio and reaching across to grab her discarded underwear from the edge of the bed.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>But Agatha was standing now, her brows raised in challenge as she tilted Rio’s head up with a finger below her chin. “Open up.”</p><p>“You cannot be serious.”</p><p>“Open.”</p><p>“Agatha. That will not stop me from…”</p><p>But Agatha had turned her hand around and had placed her thumb over Rio’s lower lip, tugging it down to guide her mouth open. And Rio obliged, as she always would.</p><p>Agatha balled up Rio’s underwear and placed it in her mouth, watching her with a satisfied grin even as Rio scowled.</p><p>“Now. Quiet. Relax. Breathe through your nose. No sudden movements, sounds, or breaths. Or I’ll stop.”</p><p>But all Rio could do was scowl.</p><p>Agatha returned to her previous position and continued not to rush. Rio eventually flopped back onto the bed and focused on doing as Agatha had said because she knew she would be true to her word and stop completely if she didn’t.</p><p>If Rio hadn’t been so worked up, having missed Agatha for so long, then this might have taken a while.</p><p>Agatha was being so painfully delicate, her attention half on the task at hand and half on the soft breaths of the woman above her.</p><p>If Rio had any thoughts in her head at that moment she may have cried from the tenderness.</p><p>But Agatha still knew what she was doing, still knew just when to kiss and lick and suck and Rio soon came completely undone against her, her orgasm hitting her from nowhere as Agatha’s hands stroked soothingly along her thighs.</p><p>It hurt. It ached. But it was worth it. And Rio wouldn’t give Agatha the satisfaction of letting her know that maybe for now, slow and gentle was best.</p><p>Agatha moved from her knees to cautiously straddle Rio’s waist, removing her underwear from her mouth as she did.</p><p>“Unnecessary,” Rio grumbled at the smirking woman above her, but was already tugging her up to try and get her to move up her body.</p><p>“No,” Agatha protested with a laugh and a quick kiss to Rio’s lips.</p><p>“I’ll break you.”</p><p>“Agatha, <em>please</em>. I want to taste you. Would you just let me-…”</p><p>But Agatha was moving off and lying by Rio’s side with that same smug grin. “Not tonight, honey.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed and tugged at Rio’s top, “Yes?”</p><p>“You are being insane.”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed with something that Rio couldn’t quite place and she sighed, slowly shuffling up the bed so she could lie with her head on the pillows.</p><p>“Hey. Where are you going?”</p><p>Agatha moved up with her and Rio smiled as the woman settled at her side, leaning up on her elbow and placing her hand protectively over Rio’s clavicle.</p><p>“Touch yourself.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes bulged in surprise as a soft flush fell to her cheeks.</p><p>“Don’t be shy,” Rio cooed, intimately aware of the affect she could have on Agatha when she got it just right. She leant in to press a soft kiss to the corner of her lips and whispered again, “Touch yourself.”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“I won’t do anything. I’ll just be here, guiding you through.”</p><p>Fingers twitched against Rio’s shirt then but slowly, cautiously, Agatha moved her hand away from her and shifted a little to push down into her pants.</p><p>As a soft noise left Agatha’s lips Rio grinned and leant in again to kiss her, lingering close as she felt the movements on the bed of Agatha doing exactly as she’d asked.</p><p>“Are you wet?”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“All for me?”</p><p>Agatha nodded again.</p><p>“Focus on your clit, <em>mi amorcito</em>. Slow and soft.”</p><p>Agatha nodded again and Rio smiled at the sight of dark blue eyes boring into her own, fascinated with the usually bossy, verbose Agatha now rendered mute from just a few seconds of softly whispered words.</p><p>She raised a hand to trace the lines of Agatha’s cheek and jaw and leant in again to kiss her, hearing Agatha whine a little against her.</p><p>And she knew that as much as she wanted Agatha, Agatha wanted her.</p><p>She pressed her upper half closer and moved a hand down to brush over Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Do you wish it were my fingers? My tongue?”</p><p>Agatha only moaned in response, her breathing picking up as Rio kissed her again.</p><p>“When you’ll let me, I want you to sit on my face. I want you all over my lips and tongue. I want to taste you for days.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed out, her hips rocking a little now.</p><p>Rio just smiled and opened her lips to suck lightly at Agatha’s lower lip, soon sucking it fully into her mouth and releasing it with a <em>pop</em>.</p><p>“You look so beautiful like this. So beautiful for me.”</p><p>Agatha moaned again, her brow now furrowing a little as she tried to control herself.</p><p>But Rio kept pushing, grinning against her lips and tracing her upper one with the tip of her tongue.</p><p>Agatha’s body shivered against her and Rio squeezed a little over her breast as she whispered, “You can come for me, Agatha. I know you’re close.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened fully then, as Rio pulled back to look at her properly, relishing in the open, unguarded look in her girlfriend’s eyes as soon her body convulsed and she same with a cry.</p><p>Smugly, slowly, tenderly, Rio kissed Agatha, capturing soft sighs and delicate moans in her mouth. Agatha only pulled away to breathe, removing her hand from against herself with a groan.</p><p>“You did so well.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at this but her breath caught in her throat again as Rio took her hand and lightly sucked her fingers clean, smirking a little as she saw Agatha’s cheeks flush again.</p><p>“I’ll only allow this ‘no touching’ thing for so long.”</p><p>Agatha, shaken back to her usual self, narrowed her eyes at Rio, “You’ll allow it until you’re better.”</p><p>Huffing and pushing at Agatha’s shoulder, Rio kept the pressure until Agatha was on her back again and pressed a kiss to her shoulder.</p><p>She grinned lazily at the sight before her, Agatha catching her breath with her lips parted, her hair wild and splayed out beneath her head like a halo, but her gaze turning to Rio, always turning to Rio.</p><p>“I can’t believe you won’t let me touch you.”</p><p>“I’ve been googling,” Agatha protested, a small, pleased smile was tugging at her lips. “You need to rest. No sharp movements or exercise.”</p><p>“I’d hardly call it…” but her fingers were dancing down Agatha’s stomach and almost made it to the waistband of her pants when Agatha stopped them.</p><p>“The more you rest now the quicker you’ll heal. And I’ll make it up to you. For being so good.”</p><p>Rio’s hand was raised to swollen lips then and she scowled at Agatha even as she placed soft kisses to each finger.</p><p>“You can’t deny me for weeks.”</p><p>“I’m not, honey. I’m going very, very gently on you for weeks.”</p><p>With that Agatha rolled back into her side and grinned a smug grin that was infuriatingly hot. “Do you want some champagne?”</p><p>Rio huffed and nudged at Agatha’s shoulder, “No. I want you.”</p><p>Agatha continued to grin and began to toy with Rio’s shirt, “You have me.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but softened slightly as her gaze dropped down to parted lips and the soft breaths of Agatha Harkness as she leant in to kiss her.</p><p>“Agatha,” she murmured quietly, stopping her before she made contact.</p><p>“Natasha told me what she said to you.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers froze, and if Rio weren’t so atuned to everything <em>Agatha</em>, she might have missed it.</p><p>“I told you. I wanted you to take some time to be with her. To recover a little. And she needed to see that… Before-…”</p><p>“She told me she accused you of taking advantage. Of manipulating me.”</p><p>Agatha went silent then, her gaze dropping to where Rio’s hand now reached for her own.</p><p>“She’s very good at planting a seed and letting you water it yourself.”</p><p>Agatha remained quiet.</p><p>“Did you believe her?”</p><p>The silence lasted longer that time, and Rio found that there was suddenly a deeper pain in her chest. A different one. One that made her want to claw at Agatha, make her see what she saw when she looked at her.</p><p>“She was holding you. When I came in. She was holding you and it looked so…”</p><p>Blue eyes as soft as a sigh looked up to meet Rio’s gaze then. “And you looked peaceful. And then I thought, maybe she was right. Maybe you’ve just been swept up in this and I’ll wake up tomorrow and you’ll be back in her arms.”</p><p>“<em>Mi vida</em>,” Rio breathed out, frowning deeply as she watched the emotions dance across Agatha’s features. “I want you. More than I’ve ever wanted anyone. I <em>love</em> you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, torn between believing Rio and dwelling on the sight of Rio and Natasha, of Natasha speaking to her in a language she didn’t understand, of the knowledge that Natasha hated her and didn’t think she was good enough. And, even so, that Rio still loved Natasha.</p><p>“Agatha, it’s not like that with Natasha. I promise.” Rio insisted, sitting up slowly and turning to gaze down at the woman.</p><p>And for the first time, she looked at Agatha move closely and saw the bags she’d hidden under her eyes with makeup, saw the tiredness in her blue eyes.</p><p>And Agatha rolled back over onto her back again to gaze up at Rio, and to Rio’s horror blue eyes were filling with unshed tears.</p><p>“No no no…”</p><p>Rio scrambled into her lap, feeling her own eyes fill with tears as she held Agatha’s face in her hands and pulled her into a sitting position and brushed her thumb steadily against the delicate single tear that fell from blue eyes.</p><p>“Please believe me.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands found their home then, reaching for Rio and pulling her closer, and Rio’s breath hitched slightly as she pressed their foreheads together.</p><p>“I’m sorry I… I didn’t realise. I wasn’t thinking. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>But Agatha shook her head and gulped as she puffed out a shaky breath. “I believe you. It’s okay.”</p><p>“Will you tell me if you ever feel like this again?”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>“Will you promise to hold me for the rest of the night?”</p><p>Agatha laughed a little at this, a slight spark coming back into her eyes, and leant up to graze her lips against Rio’s. “I will.”</p><p>“And do you love me still?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>And Rio kissed Agatha properly then, her fingers slipping back to hold her head so Agatha couldn’t move away when she thought it was too much, that Rio’s cracked bones couldn’t handle it.</p><p>And she kissed her until her lungs were on fire and all she could still taste her on her tongue when she pulled away.</p><p>“Do you have the rest of the night?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut as Rio began to place soft kisses across her cheeks, moving to her nose, then over her eyelids.</p><p>“Yes. It’s just us. I’ve turned my cell off.”</p><p>Rio smiled against Agatha’s cheek, tasting the remnants of salty tears there and feeling the thrum of guilt settle in her stomach.</p><p>If it were up to Agatha, they’d have remained like this all night: Rio in her lap, Rio’s fingers scratching a soothing pattern over her scalp, Agatha’s fingers stroking the soft skin at Rio’s sides below her top, below her injury.</p><p>So Rio let her for a while. Tucking her face in against Agatha’s neck and breathing in her the soft hints of bergamot from her perfume.</p><p>She thought of Natasha, who smelled like citrus, who had used the same shampoo for ten years, who always stole Rio’s expensive body wash. Natasha who was warm and familiar but not in a way that set her body on fire. Natasha who she’d grown up with, grown accustomed to.</p><p>The way she held onto Rio when they watched a movie. The way she dragged her closer when Rio slept at the edge of the bed (splayed out like a starfish, very inelegantly), the way she always held her attention in public or caught her eye across a room.</p><p>And Rio knew it would have to change.</p><p>But she couldn’t find the words to tell Agatha all of this, all of anything, and so she rested against her, enveloping her as much as she could without straining too much.</p><p>It was Agatha who eventually broke the spell around them and she turned her head into Rio slightly and whispered, “I thought we could have some champagne and then… I want to show you off.”</p><p>“If you’ll let me.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, stupidly, having been so lost in her thoughts that she almost completely missed what Agatha said and she pulled back to smile at her.</p><p>“Oh? This is new.”</p><p>“Well,” and Rio thought Agatha looked a little cautious, a slight frown where there should have been a smile. “I want to treat you.”</p><p>As hands moved to slide down against her still bare thighs Rio moved in to press a soft kiss to the tip of Agatha’s nose. “I didn’t bring anything fancy with me.”</p><p>“That won’t be a problem.”</p><p>Rio laughed then as Agatha raised her brows and began to shift her off of her and onto the bed.</p><p>“You bought me clothes?”</p><p>“I know your size and your taste. Stop complaining.”</p><p>“Ah so you bought me shorts and a basketball jersey.”</p><p>“You wish.”</p><p>“No, <em>you</em> wish.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and tossed her hair back as she moved to the closet and returned with a long thin box that read ‘VERSACE’.</p><p>Rio blinked at it, shuffling to cross her legs beneath herself and tug her shirt down a little to give herself at least some dignity as Agatha placed the box down gently in her lap.</p><p>Tentatively, Rio opened the box and moved the delicate tissue paper to reveal a red dress with a plunging neckline. She glanced at Agatha and saw a slight smile playing on her lips as she held it up to fully to take it all in.</p><p>“It’s beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed and kissed Rio’s cheek before she sauntered off to fetch the matching shoes and bag she’d bought for her. “We should celebrate you moving in in style.”</p><p>“I thought that’s what the balloons were for.”</p><p>Agatha laughed loudly and shot Rio a look, but Rio was already moving, already straining to shimmy from her top and just about had it over her shoulders when Agatha moved back to help.</p><p>“Don’t hurt yourself.”</p><p>Rio huffed but allowed her to help.</p><p>Whilst Rio slipped on the dress and went to the mirror to sort her hair, Agatha disappeared down the stairs to fetch her bag.</p><p>They changed quickly and quietly and Rio shot furtive glances at Agatha as she sorted her makeup, ran her fingers through her hair, and eventually turned around to see Agatha dressed in a deep tan suit, her sleeves rolled to halfway up her forearms and black stilettos waiting for her on the floor beside the bed.</p><p>“You look-…”</p><p>But her words failed her as her eyes roved up Agatha’s form to catch her gaze. She looked hungry again, suddenly desperate as she watched Rio, standing stock-still as Rio slowly moved towards her and leant in to place a kiss to her jaw, wiping away the slight remnants of lipstick when she pulled back.</p><p>“Do we have to go to the restaurant. Can we just stay here and…?”</p><p>Rio’s fingers were toying with the buttons on Agatha’s shirt and just as she managed to pop one out of its fabric home, Agatha gently moved her hand away.</p><p>“Don’t tempt me.”</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>Agatha smiled only a little as she leant in to capture pouting lips in a soft kiss. “I told you already-…”</p><p>“Yes, yes,” Rio breathed. “You’ll make it up to me. Blah blah.”</p><p>Agatha grinned at this and turned from Rio to begin pulling her from the room, stopping briefly to scoop up her shoes as they went.</p><p>Rio huffed her way down the stairs behind her girlfriend but couldn’t find it within herself to be <em>actually</em> mad.</p><p>This dinner, this move with the dress, this was all further evidence of their lives meshing. Of Agatha proclaiming her as her girlfriend. And Rio, for the first time in her life, wanted all eyes on her. All eyes on them. She wanted people to see Agatha pour her more wine at the table. Agatha holding her hand above their dessert plates. Agatha touching her thigh as they drank their wine.</p><p>Because people could look. But Rio would only have eyes for Agatha.</p><p>Soon enough, Agatha had kicked away many a balloon, cursing Alice softly under her breath, and had poured them both a glass of Bollinger from a magnum sitting in a champagne bath on the kitchen island.</p><p>“To us,” Agatha said softly, indulging in her fingers skimming Rio’s knee softly as she held her glass up to her where she stood before Rio on her stool.</p><p>“To us,” Rio agreed with a smile, tugging Agatha in for a kiss after clinking their glasses together.</p><p>As the evening went on, and Agatha relaxed more and more in her presence. The spark in her eyes came back even when she wasn’t touching Rio and it was Agatha who offered to show Rio all the wedding photos that Jen had finally shared - having delayed the rollout until she was totally happy with the final selection and could feel comfortable enough to send them to critical eyes.</p><p>There were many of the happy couple: Jen resplendent and practically glowing, whether from sheer happiness or the incredible way her skin reflected the light, and Alice, looking happier than Rio had ever seen her, looking beautiful and delighted in every photo.</p><p>There were pictures of Agatha and her friends, of Rio and Agatha standing side by side making small talk with people, pictures of Agatha and Rio dancing, both grinning, both a little drunk looking.</p><p>But the one that caught Rio’s eye, the one she made Agatha zoom in on, was the one of Rio in Agatha’s lap at the top table.</p><p>It had to have been taken from the side of the room, because both their faces were in full view and the photographer had clearly zoomed in to capture a moment: <em>the</em> moment.</p><p>Rio’s arm was draped around Agatha’s shoulders and her free hand was raised with her fingertips just touching Agatha’s jaw to tilt her head up to her. Agatha’s gaze was soft and tender as she returned Rio’s smile with one of her own and the Rio now looking down on it remembered this moment with a song in her chest.</p><p>“I think I knew I loved you then.”</p><p>Rio glanced up in surprise and raised her brows at Agatha, watching her closely.</p><p>“It was just after Jen’s speech. And she was talking about having everything she needed and I… I felt the same.”</p><p>Rio released a slow breath and placed Agatha’s phone down again to reach for her instead, “I think I knew too. I was imagining…”</p><p>But she trailed off and bit down on her lip to stop herself finishing the sentence: <em>it was us.</em></p><p>Agatha moved then, taking Rio’s hand and pulling her into the main living room and motioning to the lower shelf on the floor to ceiling bookshelf where there sat a new picture  in a new frame, the very same picture Rio had just been looking at.</p><p>“You know all that nonsense Alice spouts about having pictures of people you love…”</p><p>A laugh left Rio’s lips again, a happy one, and she pulled Agatha in for a firm kiss. “You’re adorable.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>The rest of the evening went by slowly, because Rio was now on her third glass of champagne and Agatha would not. Let. Her. Touch. Her.</p><p>But Agatha did touch her in every way she could: fuelling the fire for both of them and making it almost impossible for Rio to think how she’d get through this dinner, hell, the next few weeks if Agatha wasn’t going to put out properly.</p><p>They spoke of nothing consequential, Agatha listening with interest as Rio told her her team’s reaction to her leaving, of where she wanted to put her plants, of her wondering if she could still teach at the nearest Y.</p><p>And Agatha spoke of everything that wasn’t Tony Stark. She told Rio all about the fallout after she and Natasha had left, how Jen had raged for hours afterwards and how Alice had eventually calmed her down. She spoke of the space she’d cleared out for Rio in her closet, of the food she’d bought in that she knew Rio liked, and the changes she’d made to her schedule over the next week to be around more.</p><p>By the time it was time to leave for dinner, Rio had a pleasant buzz about her, both from the wine and Agatha’s undivided attention.</p><p>Agatha called a cab and slipped a large black overcoat over Rio’s shoulders even as she protested and made to go for a jacket she’d brought from home. But secretly she didn’t mind. It smelled of Agatha and there was something about wearing something of her girlfriend’s that she just couldn’t say no to.</p><p>The cab that arrived to pick them up was a black Mercedes, because of course it was. And soon they were moving through the quiet, cold streets of Washington to arrive outside a small French restaurant that was to be their destination for the night.</p><p>Agatha seemed to be at pains to make this evening as romantic as possible and she opened Rio’s car door for her before she had the chance to even slide across to follow Agatha out.</p><p>She kissed her sweetly on the cheek in thanks and then followed her, hand in hand into the little restaurant.</p><p>The staff seemed to know Agatha well and greeted her as if she were a visiting dignitary.</p><p>They were swept to their table, Rio’s coat politely taken away, and her chair moved for her by Agatha (after shooting the man who tried a look), and Rio soon found a glass of Chablis being poured for her to taste.</p><p>“So?” Agatha asked expectantly after she’d ushered the waiter away and their wine glasses were both filled.</p><p>“You didn’t need to go to all this effort.”</p><p>“I wanted to,” Agatha said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>“I want us to be open. I want everyone to know. I hated hiding you.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said quietly, feeling that same guilt claw at her stomach. “I want that too.”</p><p>She reached across for Agatha’s hand and found Agatha had done the same. They caught each other’s eye and Agatha laughed.</p><p>By the time the first course was done, Rio had slowed down on the wine, feeling a little more than tipsy, and Agatha was watching her closely as she said.</p><p>“In the new year I’m going to be travelling a lot. I know you want to work and I don’t want to get in the way of that but, would you consider coming with me? Not everywhere maybe but… but sometimes?”</p><p>Rio’s brows shot up and she watched the curious mix of fear and confidence clash in the woman before her. Watched it make her lip twitch slightly, her chin raise a little.</p><p>“I’m sure I could do that. I’d rather be with you than away from you. Even if it’s in some backwards town in bumfuck Idaho.”</p><p>“Hey, I’ll have you know that Bumfuck Idaho is very pretty in the spring.”</p><p>Rio grinned and squeezed Agatha’s hand where she’d reached for it again as soon as they were done eating.</p><p>But by the time the second course was done, their little bubble was burst as someone approached the table.</p><p>It was Agatha who reacted first, Rio had been reaching for her water glass.</p><p>“Jeremy.”</p><p>Rio looked up to see a tall, portly man with a beard and thinning hair and felt Agatha’s hand slip from her own on the table.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness! Entertaining, I see?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow at this kept fought to keep her smile neutral as Agatha huffed out a breath, “This is Rio, my girlfriend. Rio Vidal, Jeremy Jones; Jeremy Jones, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure why this introduction took her by surprise but it did and she gazed at Agatha with wide eyes as Agatha gazed back with a smug smile, enjoying both Rio and Jeremy’s reactions.</p><p>The man beside their table released a loud, “Oh ho!” And reached for Rio’s hand, shaking it firmly in two of his own, “A pleasure, dear. This one deserves some happiness.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the delighted laugh that escaped her lips at the man’s enthusiasm and she grinned up at him, her surprise from before completely dissipated.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Rio got out, shaking his hand right back.</p><p>“And the Chablis! Fine, fine choice. ‘97? Yes. Fantastic. Another, garçon!”</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to look surprised then as this Jeremy took a seat from a nearby table and plonked himself down with aplomb, after having waved maniacally at a waiter.</p><p>“Um,” Agatha started, her face a picture of startled surprise and her fingers twitching against the table cloth.</p><p>But Rio had already picked up that this was perhaps not Agatha’s idea of a romantic evening together and so she leant in and placed a hand on Jeremy’s arm.</p><p>“Jeremy? Whilst it would be beyond lovely to have you join, Agatha and I are celebrating moving in together tonight. Would you mind if we…?”</p><p>And the man practically threw himself from his seat with all the flare that Rio knew Agatha could muster in a heartbeat.</p><p>“Oh! My dears. My dears.” He fumbled to his feet again and waved for the waiter, making the whole restaurant turn to him in horror, “Garçon! Garçon! No Chablis. Champagne. Your finest! Tout suite!”</p><p>Agatha groaned softly and Rio mouthed an ‘oh no’ at her, having already had more than enough wine that evening.</p><p>But Jeremy was turning back to them with a wide, toothy grin, “On me, my dears. Agatha here did me a great favour once and I shan’t forget it any time soon. In fact, your whole meal-…”</p><p>“Jeremy, no. Please. Champagne is more than enough. You know what they charge-…”</p><p>“I won’t hear a second of it! Now, eat, drink, and be merry! Agatha, I shall see you on the Hill soon, hmm?”</p><p>He shot Rio a friendly but slightly off-kilter wink and then flew off to the bar at the back of the restaurant.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha huffed unhappily, looking thoroughly displeased with the whole thing.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, was beaming. “I love him. When can I see him again?”</p><p>“<em>That</em>,” Agatha said with a huff, “is the most annoying man in Washington. He will not stop talking. And he flounces about the place like he’s in his own personal production of a Gilbert and Sullivan show.”</p><p>Rio laughed so hard she snorted and tried to cover herself by taking a sip of water, “You’re exaggerating.”</p><p>But Agatha had relaxed a little at the sight of Rio laughing. “Oh am I? He once burst into song when I walked into his office.”</p><p>“What song?”</p><p>“Unimportant.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>Rio moved her leg to rub against Agatha’s shin and grinned suggestively over at her. “What song?”</p><p>“<em>When You’re Good To Mama.</em> Chicago.”</p><p>Rio had to bite down <em>hard</em> on her lip then to not cackle.</p><p>She managed, magically, to keep herself in check as she stared determinedly down at her empty plate.</p><p>“You can laugh.”</p><p>Rio released a breathy snort then, looking up to Agatha with a grin, “I love him.”</p><p>“Yes I thought you might.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but placed her hand back out to Rio even as the champagne arrived.</p><p>They both looked at it with trepidation but accepted the glasses poured for them with flare by the young French waiter.</p><p>After toasting to good musicals and even better champagne, they enjoyed the rest of their meal uninterrupted. Both soon full, and verging on a little bit drunk.</p><p>But the bill was paid and all that was left to do was for Agatha to bundle Rio up in her coat and arms in the cab and hold her close until they got back to their newly shared home.</p><p>Rio’s whole body felt warm and the kinda fuzzy you only really got from drinking champagne and being with the woman you love.</p><p>They’d made it through one more glass each, both nursing it, until Agatha made the executive decision that dessert should be had in bed instead.</p><p>Rio had welcomed this idea with a lopsided grin and a squeeze of Agatha’s hand.</p><p>And so, not long after leaving the restaurant, Rio flopped against the nook of Agatha’s arm, wearing borrowed pyjamas that felt like actual real silk (they were) and feeling on cloud nine.</p><p>The promised dessert turned into a lazy, drunken makeout session, with a tipsy Agatha still being too delicate, too gentle, but so delicious, so intoxicating.</p><p>But soon enough, Agatha, for all her “I can just handle my drink better than you, honey”, actually fell asleep before Rio did. She’d slipped down to press her face against Rio’s neck with her arm lazily across her stomach, holding her loosely, but holding her all the same.</p><p>Rio wasn’t long after her and she drifted off into the first peaceful sleep in the place she now called home, knowing there would be many more, and Agatha would always be there.</p><p>They spent many more days like this, so deeply in love that boring things like looking for jobs or unloading the dishwasher actually became tolerable. Because Agatha was there. Or, at least, in the other room.</p><p>Rio’s life became different.</p><p>And she discovered things about Agatha that made her love her more: Agatha made the best pancakes she’d ever had, Agatha hated musicals if they were made after 1975 (unless Catherine Zeta-Jones was dancing about in suspenders), she spoke to either Alice or Jen at least once a day on the phone, and Lilia once a week, and she’d bought a large boring-looking book about the history of Puerto Rico that she read on the couch at night.</p><p>When not with Agatha, she spent a lot of her time looking for jobs, scoping out what she might want to do.</p><p>Agatha had arranged for her things to be brought down from New York and when they’d arrived - expertly packed by an incredibly efficient and expensive courier service - Rio had spent two days sitting with, caring for, and talking to, her plants, which made her think of a career in gardening.</p><p>Or botany.</p><p>Or buying a cottage in the woods and making Agatha move with her so they could spend their days alone amongst the trees.</p><p>But that soon fell by the way side when she thought more of her skill set, rather than her hobby.</p><p>And so, she began looking into how to become a teacher. How quickly and easily she could translate her degree in Spanish Literature to a degree in teaching.</p><p>There was a large language institute across the Potomac that had free courses for adults wanting to learn or practice their English. And Rio wanted to help.</p><p>So as her body healed, she set her mind to work on reaching out to the right people, doing her due diligence.</p><p>During this time, she’d also found a local gym where she could offer her services to teach basketball lessons, referee games, and was soon putting out feelers to join a team.</p><p>She spoke to Natasha almost daily, checking in with her, and found her to be distant and unwilling to hear about her life with Agatha. But she called all the same, hoping that she’d come around as she usually always did. She knew she was punishing her for leaving.</p><p>But her life was Agatha now, and despite the small things that bothered her, Natasha being a large one, and the prospect of what was keeping Agatha up all night being a much larger one, she was blissfully happy.</p><p>She had recovered now, by mid-December. It had been slow at first and then all of a sudden. After twisting rather sharply and Agatha almost having a conniption at the sight of it, Rio felt no pain. A slight twinge, yes, but no more than anyone with a normally functioning body might if they’d thrown themselves around at the sound of a bottle being popped like Rio had.</p><p>From then on Agatha properly relaxed with her.</p><p>She let her hands and lips wander with abandon and held her more firmly, fucking her with more or less no concerns that she might break her. Soon the only bruises on her body were from Agatha staking her claim whenever she could.</p><p>And the second best thing to come of all of this: of Rio finally being better and no longer broken, was that Agatha was more relaxed.</p><p>In living with her and sleeping with her every night, Rio realised that a lot of Agatha’s exhaustion was because she couldn’t get to sleep, couldn’t stay asleep, when she wasn’t with her.</p><p>But within a week of sleeping side by side every night, Rio had almost fixed the issue. If Agatha looked like she’d had a stressful day then Rio would be particularly attentive. She’d stroke her hair and talk to her softly about her friends or her parents or what they could do together at the weekend.</p><p>When she woke in the middle of the night with a yell or a sudden jerk off the bed, she’d soothe her down with soft kisses and hold her until she drifted back off.</p><p>Agatha had been awake because Rio wasn’t with her.</p><p>And Rio felt the pangs of guilt about this more than anything because Agatha was still working hard, still spending every second she had on calls or out at meetings in the west wing, or the capitol.</p><p>And it was all because of Stark.</p><p>And so living with Agatha Harkness came with only a few problems.</p><p>1. Rio found it almost impossible to make it through the day without thinking about new and exciting ways in which she could seduce Agatha, make her forget she had meetings and calls to make. Which meant that Rio basically never got anything done.<br/>
2. Their arguments over Stark were an almost daily occurrence now. Some more volatile than others. Some just gentle discussions before sleep at night.<br/>
3. Rio realised that she’d never loved anyone the way she loved Agatha. She was head over heels for her. Obsessed with being around her and talking to her, touching her. She was done for.</p><p>On a cool Wednesday afternoon in mid December, these three issues came to a head.</p><p>After a particularly difficult discussion the night before where for the first time Rio had fallen asleep turned away from Agatha, not touching her, Rio found that she couldn’t focus on the current task of applying for a teaching course.</p><p>She’d found a position at the local Y to teach kids basketball, sure. But that was voluntary. She needed something else.</p><p>And her thoughts were constantly drifting back to Agatha who had looked so angry the previous night. So tired of the same conversation that kept going round and round between them, in varying degrees of volume.</p><p>Swallowing down her pride, she cautiously went through to Agatha’s office, peeking around the door.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Agatha’s glasses sat primly across the bridge of her nose and she looked intent on something, her fingers flying across the keyboard.</p><p>“Can we talk about it?”</p><p>“I’m busy, Rio. I think we’ve talked enough anyway.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“I don’t have time. So unless you want to…”</p><p>But Rio interrupted her with a huff, “Can you at least…”</p><p>But Agatha was having none of it and pushed her keyboard away to finally look across at her girlfriend, sliding her glasses to the top of her head.</p><p>“Honey. I’m busy and talking about this gets us nowhere so unless you want to shut up and come sit in my lap I don’t have the time.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed at this and she raised her brows, becoming indignant that Agatha thought she could control her like that. Shut her out.</p><p>“You can’t just…”</p><p>“I think the purple one,” Agatha interrupted again, a slow smirk appearing across her features as she eyed Rio, watching her reaction to this closely. “Go get it.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened in shock, watching as Agatha shifted back in her seat and spread her legs a little beneath the desk.</p><p>Rio scoffed and laughed a little, half expecting Agatha to be joking. But she just stared at Rio with that same goddamn smirk on her features and raised her brows, “So?”</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair and shifted where she stood before storming off and muttering under her breath, “Insane.”</p><p>But as Rio stormed up the stairs she fought against the anticipatory butterflies settling in her stomach and focused instead on the indignation settling in her chest, at the knowledge that as annoyed as she was, she was doing it anyway.</p><p>She stormed into their bedroom and made a beeline for the lower drawer of the chest of drawers against the wall, grabbing the purple strap she knew to be Agatha’s favourite. Coincidentally, the largest of her collection.</p><p>Rio eyed it for a second, briefly considering being a brat and swapping it for something else entirely but thought better of it as the potential for what Agatha could do with it made her shiver.</p><p>She returned to the office and tossed it petulantly over the desk to the smug woman before her.</p><p>“This what you wanted?”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hummed nonchalantly, glancing briefly at Rio before returning her attention to her computer.</p><p>Rio scowled at this and placed her hands down on the desk, “So?”</p><p>“I just have to send this email.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed then, not enjoying this part of the game as she moved around to the other side of the desk and slipped into Agatha’s lap, straddling her.</p><p>“I think that can wait.”</p><p>Agatha relented and quirked a brow at Rio with a look too close to triumph for Rio’s taste. But she didn’t say anything and instead reached around her girlfriend to grab the strap, “Well I’ll need to put it on before this can continue.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and slipped back off of her, leaning back against the desk to the side and crossing her arms petulantly across her chest.</p><p>She watched silently as Agatha lifted her hips, slipped off her soft grey slacks, removing her underwear with them, and sliding the harness up to secure to herself expertly.</p><p>Rio’s mouth felt dry all of a sudden, and she couldn’t tear her gaze away from the thick purple length that Agatha now held up between her legs.</p><p>Clearing her throat to capture Rio’s attention, she smirked up at her, “Clothes off, honey. I don’t have all day.”</p><p>Rio scowled at this but slowly peeled her clothes off until she stood naked beside the chair. Unable to give in entirely just yet she turned Agatha’s face to her with her fingers and raised her brows at her, “You can’t avoid this conversation forever.”</p><p>Agatha smiled more at this and turned her head to kiss Rio’s palm but she soon pulled away and made a move to sweep a clearing on her desk, pushing her laptop and keyboard to the side. Her other hand moved to pull Rio back into her lap.</p><p>“I’m not sure you’re going to be in a position to say anything soon.”</p><p>Rio just narrowed her gaze at Agatha but shuffled slightly, glancing down between them at the length now pressed up against Rio’s abdomen.</p><p>She noticed Agatha was looking down at this too and she took the initiative to spit down between them, letting it flow lazily from her mouth until she reached to break the chain and spread it over the cock.</p><p>Agatha hummed in approval and reached her hand between them to feel for Rio’s readiness, pressing two fingers towards her entrance with a grin as she felt her wet she already was.</p><p>“Oh? Excited are we?”</p><p>Rio scowled at Agatha and moved her hands to tug at her collar, shifting her hips a little to get more from her. “Shut up.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and swirled her fingers for a second more before she pressed slowly into Rio, watching as her back arched out and her hips pressed forwards, pressing Agatha’s hand back against the strap still sandwiched between them.</p><p>Rio groaned a little but refused to give in fully still, watching the way blue eyes sparkled with a smugness that she found both aggravating and ridiculously hot at the same time.</p><p>Agatha patiently, infuriatingly so, continued to thrust slowly into Rio, slowly scissoring her fingers inside of her to test her before she made her move.</p><p>Rio’s breathing had picked up slightly and she continued to groan occasionally, more from desperation as her hand moved to encircle the strap, silently trying to get Agatha to use the damn thing rather than just teasing her with the sight of it.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips and glanced down at where the cock sat up against Rio’s body, enjoying the sight of it against her tanned skin for a while before she brushed her thumb delicately against Rio’s clit a few times then moved her hand away from her.</p><p>She added her own spit to the strap for good measure then moved her hands to Rio’s hips and silently guided her up to hover over it.</p><p>“You’re enjoying this too much,” Rio accused with narrowed eyes even as her thighs trembled a little in anticipation.</p><p>Agatha just grinned up at her and leant in to press open-mouthed kisses against Rio’s flushed chest, still thrilled that she could leave her mark on her girlfriend whenever she felt like it now.</p><p>“You will be too in a second.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and acquiesced to the pressure on her hips as Agatha lowered her slowly down, aligning the tip of the strap to her entrance.</p><p>Rio groaned quietly as she sank down inch by inch and felt the delicious stretch that she could never quite get used to with this particular strap.</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath as she bottomed out completely and bit down on her lip as she opened her eyes to see Agatha staring at her with her lips parted and eyes wide.</p><p>“I want you like this every day.”</p><p>Rio smirked a little but groaned as she twitched her hips forwards and felt Agatha’s thumbs rubbing soothing circles over her hip bones.</p><p>“You wish,” she murmured, leaning in to capture Agatha’s lips finally. They kissed until Rio could no longer stand not moving and she broke it only to moan as she began to slowly ride Agatha.</p><p>Agatha pressed soothing kisses to Rio’s throat as she did, keeping her hold on her firm and instructive, controlling her pace.</p><p>Rio’s mind felt blank, the only thing she could focus on was how good it felt to be stretched out by Agatha, to have her watching her like she couldn’t quite believe what she was seeing.</p><p>But Agatha pulled her down and held her hips firmly against her own, rocking up slightly to try and get deeper inside of Rio and making her moan loudly, panting as she clutched at Agatha’s shirt and loudly moaned her name, “Fuck, Agatha… I…”</p><p>Her hips stirred of their own accord but she couldn’t lift up again as Agatha held her down, her eyes dark and dangerous as she stared up at Rio.</p><p>“Be good for me and be quiet.”</p><p>Rio groaned and rocked her hips again, unable to stop herself from mumbling soft curses as she desperately tried to move against the strap but Agatha held her firmly and only leant in to press a kiss to her shoulder as she leant around her and did the unthinkable.</p><p>She picked up her phone.</p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide and she stared at Agatha in disbelief as the woman released her hold on her and leant back in her chair, answering the call as if Rio weren’t currently naked and sitting on her cock.</p><p>“Stark. What took you so long.”</p><p>A slow, fierce blush crept its way up Rio’s cheeks and she glared indignantly down at Agatha as the woman’s hand began to draw slow circles over her firm abdomen, moving slowly closer to ghost over her clit every so often.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio groaned softly, her eyes fluttering closed as she tried to focus on her breathing even as she clenched firmly around the thick strap buried deep inside her.</p><p>Agatha continued to talk to Stark, sounding bored and disinterested, even as she leant back in again to brush her lips soothingly over Rio’s throat, her fingers now gently brushing across Rio’s clit.</p><p>She was enjoying it too much, Rio knew that much, enjoying the control and her ability to silence Rio, to make her take everything she was giving her without complaint.</p><p>And Rio was willing to do it. Willing to give her everything she wanted.</p><p>But her body was betraying her.</p><p>The feel of Agatha buried so deep inside of her, making her thighs tremble and her cunt throb, coupled with Agatha’s attention to her clit was too much. She began to groan quietly, her hips rocking slightly for some sort of relief.</p><p>Agatha’s touches changed then, even as she continued to talk indifferently into the phone, she moved a hand to squeeze at Rio’s throat, bucking her hips gently into her as a warning to remain quiet.</p><p>Brown eyes snapped down to Agatha and she bit on her lip as she saw the intensity of her stare, her hips bucking every few seconds.</p><p>“Right. No that’s just not good enough.”</p><p>Rio frowned deeply, her hands now fisting the silk shirt Agatha still wore, unable to hold it in much longer as her breathing became quicker, more shallow, more audible.</p><p>Mercifully, Agatha began to move then, capturing her phone between her ear and shoulder. Reading her girlfriend well, she lifted Rio slowly, carefully, remaining buried within her as she placed Rio on the edge of the desk.</p><p>“Absolutely not,” she was saying firmly as she pushed Rio onto her back and stood between her legs, now pressing into her firmly, rocking her hips back only an inch or so to get some traction.</p><p>Rio’s whole body was flushed pink and her eyes were wild as she clutched at anything she could to try to get it together, stuck between a scream and a beg.</p><p>But Agatha continued her conversation.</p><p>Her hand moved to scratch Rio’s thigh reassuringly as she watched the woman before her begin to silently beg her, brown eyes wide and pitiful as she opened and closed her mouth with unspoken words: “Please, Agatha, <em>please</em>…”</p><p>Long fingers moved then to continue teasing Rio’s clit and blue eyes fell to watch as she rocked into her slowly, pulling out more until just the tip pressed into Rio’s entrance and she could see the evidence of her desire, her lips parted as she focused in on the sight before her and the conversation she was having.</p><p>“No. No. It can’t go that way.”</p><p>She began to push back into Rio, watching as she so readily took her, and Rio stretched around her cock, making her back arch against the desk.</p><p>Once she was so full of her again Rio thought she wouldn’t be able to breath she heard the phone slap down in the desk beside her.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha husked dangerously, adjusting so she could lean over Rio more, her hips rolling as she remained buried within her.</p><p>Rio groaned loudly, her whole body on fire as she gazed up at Agatha.</p><p>“Please,” she whimpered softly, her hips jerking slightly to meet Agatha’s despite not being able to take any more and Agatha having nothing left to give as she remained pressed within her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched slightly at the sight and she straightened back up, letting her fingers stroke soft patterns from Rio’s throat down to her thighs.</p><p>She was just about to move her hips again, give Rio what she so desperately wanted, what she deserved, when a loud vibration against the desk took them both by surprise and two sets of eyes fell to a phone that was lit up with the one word:</p><p>‘BITCH’.</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply at the sight, a visceral panic flowing through her as Agatha reached out for it.</p><p>“N-no, Agatha!” She scrambled slightly, lifting her upper half to grasp back at Agatha and stop her answering, knowing who was on the other end.</p><p>The idea of Wanda being in Agatha’s ear when she was <em>inside</em> Rio made her feel physically sick.</p><p>The idea of even the red head’s image being conjured up in Agatha’s brain when she was inside of her… It made her suddenly furious.</p><p>But Agatha’s hand was now on her cell. And instead of answering, she threw it across the room and heard it smash against the far wall.</p><p>Rio gasped at this unexpected move but didn’t have time to process as she was pulled further down the desk, Agatha moving her legs around like they weighed nothing.</p><p>But she didn’t have time to process.</p><p>Agatha pulled out fully and slammed back into her again, beginning to thrust in and out of her with a desperate force.</p><p>Rio began to scream her moans, her brain short circuiting as she stared up at Agatha and took everything she could give her.</p><p>Agatha grit her teeth as she continued the brutal pace, reaching between them to bully Rio’s clit with a similar desperation.</p><p>It was possessive and angry, unrelenting as Agatha slammed into Rio in an attempt to dominate her completely, the reminder of Wanda sending her into a white hot fury. She fucked Rio as desperately as she could to remind both of them who she belonged to.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Rio moaned out, her eyes watering and her breathing hot and heavy as she was stretched out by Agatha.</p><p>She came with a loud cry of Agatha’s name and clawed for Agatha even as she couldn’t reach her, couldn’t bring herself to push up and grasp her.</p><p>Agatha only began to slow after Rio had come but still rocked her hips against hers, her thumb brushing lightly over her clit to bring her down slowly.</p><p>Soft lips began to press a trail between Rio’s breasts as Agatha pulled out fully, enjoying Rio’s groan of protest as she did.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha…” but Rio couldn’t finish her sentence as Agatha moved her way down her body, settling between her legs to kiss where she’d been so aggressive before, letting her tongue soothe down Rio’s swollen clit before she dipped lower to her entrance to taste her properly and enjoy Rio’s hips twitching against her face.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck,” Rio groaned again, her hands reaching down to Agatha’s hair but unable to get to it as Agatha pulled back up and stepped away to slip out of the harness.</p><p>She wouldn’t quite meet Rio’s gaze and instead sat back down at her desk chair and reached for Rio’s thighs to pull her gently back into her lap.</p><p>Rio groaned as she did so but moved with Agatha and trembled beneath her hold as she buried her fingers deep within her long hair.</p><p>“You’ve ruined me,” she whispered softly, knowing it was what Agatha would want to hear, and what she’d been trying to do.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flashed up then and she raised her brows as she moved her hand down between them to press two fingers easily inside of Rio, finding no resistance at all.</p><p>Rio grunted but didn’t complain as Agatha gently caressed her sensitive walls and leant in to whisper against her ear, “Tell me you’re mine.”</p><p>“I’m yours,” Rio whispered back just as gently, frowning as she turned to try and capture Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>“Do you think I’m not?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, moving to hold Rio’s jaw, “No.”</p><p>Rio licked her lips and nodded slowly, watching Agatha carefully before she leant in and pressed her lips together.</p><p>When she pulled back she smiled slightly and placed her hands across Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She took a few seconds to breath, watching Agatha as she watched her and still seeing that slight frown on her features.</p><p>“I thought you were going to answer her call.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze then and began to press soft kisses to Rio’s collarbone.</p><p>“Is she calling a lot?”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a soft breath that made Rio shiver as Agatha pulled her hand away from her and leant back to look up at her, that same frown still on her face.</p><p>“It’s just work.”</p><p>Rio felt something heavy sink into the pit of her stomach but she nodded slowly and brushed a loose strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “Don’t shut me out.”</p><p>“Rio, it’s-…”</p><p>“No. You can’t fuck me like that and not talk to me. I won’t allow it.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and seemed to be fighting against something but she soon said: “She checks in. Every day. Every other day. I usually don’t answer but… she wants to know what’s happening with the campaign. And, and how you are.”</p><p>Rio shifted then, trying to get closer and tugging at Agatha’s shirt a little. “I don’t understand.”</p><p>Agatha sighed again, “Stark winning will do a lot for business. <em>Her</em> business so she’s keen to see that I’m doing all I can to help.”</p><p>“She’s still threatening you? Using me to get to you?”</p><p>Agatha nodded ever so slightly, her blue eyes softer than before, “Let her. Let her do whatever she wants. Let her expose me. I-…”</p><p>“It’s not safe.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>.”</p><p>“Listen to me: I am working on it. I’m working on Stark. And I’m working on Wanda <em>leaving us alone</em>.”</p><p>Rio huffed out a frustrated breath and continued to flower down at Agatha, “Don’t take this all on by yourself. It’s not healthy and it’s not fair.”</p><p>“I promise you that I have this. It’ll be okay.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>But Agatha just shook her head and Rio sighed again, “Natasha mentioned something about Wanda and Abigail. She’d heard something through her work. It sounded-…” but Agatha moved her hand up to place her finger on Rio’s lips and silence her.</p><p>“It’s not good. Wanda isn’t good. And neither is Abigail. I know. I’m looking into it. Which is why I need to be careful and letting Wanda expose you and embarrass a lot of people wouldn’t be safe.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips to kiss the pad of Agatha’s finger and murmured, “I’m more worried about you being safe. I can disappear. You can’t.”</p><p>“Dear old mother left me a lot of money. Worse case scenario, we run off together to Greece and live on a hillside with lots of goats.”</p><p>“Goats?”</p><p>“Weren’t you a ‘raging goat’?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but was glad to see a slight twitch in Agatha’s lips. “Ridiculous.”</p><p>But she relented on the subject, feeling a little more at ease now that Agatha was at least talking to her about things, but she knew it would be a long road ahead and she’d need to keep pushing.</p><p>“Okay… now can we talk about you making me sit on your cock whilst you spoke to Stark? You <em>knew</em> he was going to call. You did it on purpose.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched a little but she didn’t give in.</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Rio laughed and then realised a soft gasp as Agatha and moved around to grab her ass.</p><p>“Unbelievable.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, her shoulders relaxing as she dipped her head to kiss Rio’s jaw again, “If you’d been able to behave I’d have made you sit there all day.”</p><p>“Behave?” Rio almost choked, “Do you <em>know</em> how hard it was to keep quiet? You weren’t exactly helping.”</p><p>Agatha laughed lowly against Rio’s jaw and placed a final kiss there before she pulled back to look at her.</p><p>“Forgive me for enjoying my girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at her and kissed her once again before she began to move from her lap, her legs heavy, “Well I think you’ve enjoyed her enough.”</p><p>“Absolutely not. Where are you going?”</p><p>“Not far,” Rio said with a smirk as she moved to wobbling leg and sank to her knees below the desk.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened briefly at the sight and she licked her lips as she moved down the chair a little, already spreading her legs more for Rio.</p><p>“Patience,” Rio teased with a smirk, enjoying as always, that Agatha was as desperate for her as she was for Agatha.</p><p>But Agatha had no qualms about being impatient and raised her brows down at Rio as she opened her legs as far as she could in the office chair, insistently moving her hips forwards.</p><p>Rio laughed quietly even as she felt the sight of Agatha’s movement land directly between her aching thighs and she pressed them together surreptitiously to focus in on the woman above her.</p><p>“You should invite Stark over,” she said softly, leaning in to trail kisses along Agatha’s inner thigh, her hands moving to lift Agatha’s legs over her shoulders so she could bury herself against her fully.</p><p>“Talk politics whilst I eat you out under the desk.”</p><p>Agatha groaned at this, but was rendered incapable of a witty retort as her fingers tangled in dark hair and Rio licked a thick strip from Agatha’s entrance up to her clit.</p><p>Agatha was soaked. And Rio ate her out sloppily, hungrily, not caring that she was making a mess of her face and the already soaked chair.</p><p>She made Agatha come twice, almost suffocating against her during the first orgasm as Agatha lost herself and wrapped her legs so tightly around Rio with a cry of her name as she came.</p><p>Her second orgasm was purposefully softer and Rio had pushed three fingers inside of Agatha, stretching her out as best she could and coaxing the orgasm out with soft laps of her tongue against her swollen clit.</p><p>When she was done and had cleaned Agatha up, she slid up and up Agatha’s body, returning to her position in her lap and allowing Agatha to hold her ass again, smiling lazily up at her as she did so.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m done with you for the day yet.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio laughed softly and began to pepper soft kisses to Agatha’s lips; glad that Agatha was more relaxed, that the tense conversation they’d just had was dormant again in her face, in her body. “I’m pretty sure I couldn’t be any more tender than I am right now so you’ll have to wait a little, big boy.”</p><p>Agatha scowled at this but squeezed Rio’s ass firmly and then moved her hands up to grasp at her waist, “Don’t call me that if you’re not going to let me…”</p><p>But Rio was already pressing her grin to Agatha’s lips and kissing her slowly, letting their bodies rest flush together. She pulled away as Agatha tried to deepen the kiss and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s nose as a means of getting her to stop.</p><p>“I’m going to go and shower and you are going to think about my request from last night. And Greece. And goats.”</p><p>“I’m not going to quit. But I am going to come and shower with you.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said firmly, sliding off of Agatha’s lap even as she protested. “Maybe I’ll withhold sex until you do.”</p><p>“Then you won’t be getting any until next November.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at this and snatched up her clothes, turning away from Agatha’s frown, “So be it.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and ran a hand through her hair, “Fine, fine!”</p><p>Rio smirked but didn’t turn back around as she disappeared from the room to take a shower.</p><p>The ache between her thighs was worse than ever by the time she stepped out to dry herself but she couldn’t find it within herself to regret it or to be annoyed with Agatha. If anything it made her want her more. And once again Rio shivered with the knowledge that Agatha had such a hold on her that even when she’d practically fucked her senseless and made her ache, she still wanted more.</p><p>After that day the conversation about Wanda, Stark and Agatha’s job continued on.</p><p>Rio brought it up every chance she got to the point where if she weren’t so convinced that Agatha adored her she’d be worried she’d return home one night and have the locks changed.</p><p>But Agatha spoke to her more about it, initially giving her small details about the conversations she’d been having, but soon telling her histories of alliances across the political landscape; who would vote for who, who she needed to convince, who was a safe bet, and who was a lost cause.</p><p>But they fell into a steady rhythm of discussions, fights, and fucks.</p><p>Rio noticed too though that after the night of her sleeping away from Agatha it hadn’t happened again. Agatha had always made sure that they went to sleep on good terms, even if it meant staying up later than her body could handle, she always wanted Rio with her in the night.</p><p>But Christmas soon rolled around and Agatha was still working on the Stark campaign.</p><p>But she had managed to wangle time off from her ridiculous schedule which meant that arguments were now fewer and far between as the two of them got to spend more time together.</p><p>It had been agreed some weeks earlier that Jen and Alice were coming, bringing Lilia with them, and much to Agatha’s annoyance, Billy.</p><p>They’d all landed on the house on the 23rd and brought with them all sorts of chaos and noise. The kind of noise that Rio loved. The kind that Agatha did not.</p><p>As they rocked up on the doorstep, Jen was first in the door, giving Agatha a cursory hug and turning immediately to Rio, “Hello.”</p><p>Rio smiled and moved in for a hug that was only just returned. “Jen. Hi.”</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and moved away, leaving Rio under no misapprehensions that she was still pissed for what had happened to Alice.</p><p>“Any redhead nut jobs around?” Jen asked as Alice swooped in on Agatha then Rio in turn.</p><p>“Because Lilia pulled cards in the lounge and-…”</p><p>But she was interrupted by Alice announcing rather loudly, “Lilia thinks that someone’s getting married.”</p><p>Rio blinked at this and felt Agatha shift beside her, trying to play it off as if the cold breeze from the still open door had caused it.</p><p>“Not exactly what I said, but something along those lines.”</p><p>Lilia appeared in the door then, standing with her arms open and a gracious, keen smile on her face. “Miss me, dear?”</p><p>Rio was still reeling about the marriage thing and didn’t notice that Lilia was addressing <em>her</em> as she walked in and placed a two kisses to either cheek.</p><p>Rio was still unsure about Lilia. Something about her confidence in addressing her, her… witchiness made her suspicious to her. <em>Spooky.</em></p><p>But she knew Agatha loved her and she’d never found her to be rude or mean the handful of times they’d met in London and the few times she’d spoken to her on the phone from Washington when Agatha had her on speaker whilst doing her hair or makeup.</p><p>“We must talk,” Lilia said with a knowing smile up at Rio even as Billy bounded in with hugs and kisses for all.</p><p>By the time everyone had been ushered into the main living area, Rio was feeling much more relaxed.</p><p>At the last minute Natasha had decided not to come. Agatha had done her best to hide her relief and although Rio had been dreading having Natasha, Jen and Alice in the same room she still felt the pang of disappointment.</p><p>It would be the first time she hadn’t spent Christmas with Natasha since they’d met and Natasha’s excuse had been a lame one (“I have a job in Mexico City”) which meant that Rio knew she was avoiding her.</p><p>But Agatha had, the evening she’d found out, just a week before Christmas, cancelled her work plans and spent the night curled up with Rio watching a marathon of naughties rom coms to cheer her up.</p><p>But present day Rio still had Jen’s distaste to deal with and she knew it wouldn’t be easy.</p><p>Alice was back to her usual self, they’d spoken at length, several times, about what had happened and both agreed that they wanted to move forwards and be proper friends again and that meant they both had to forgive themselves.</p><p>So even as Alice looped arms with Rio and walked with her to the kitchen to help fetch everyone drinks, Jen held back with the others and Agatha and announced: “She looks better. Healthy. Not… y’know. Bruised.”</p><p>“It wasn’t a <em>bruise</em> it was a <em>break</em>,” Agatha corrected with a huff, although they’d both been over this discussion multiple times.</p><p>“But yes. She’s fine. I told you she’s back to teaching again at the Y.”</p><p>Lilia hummed knowingly and perched herself on the couch, draping her shawls about herself. “And she’s happy, yes? I’ve seen.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow but knew better than to question what exactly Lilia had “seen” and relaxed back against the couch, “Yes. We’re very happy.”</p><p>Billy made a noise that made everyone turn to look at him.</p><p>“It’s just. Well, Lilia earlier…”</p><p>Agatha glanced between the two of them, “What?”</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and slipped around to settle in the armchair opposite Agatha, making it look more like a throne than anything else.</p><p>“Are you going to propose?”</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, before she could even register the question, Alice and Rio appeared; one carrying a champagne bath large enough for two bottle, the other a tray of glasses.</p><p>Agatha caught Jen’s eye over this commotion and quirked her brow, watching as her best friend grinned at her.</p><p>But Rio, and Alice, had been busy chatting as they entered so they’d missed all of this.</p><p>It was only when Rio turned to Agatha last (having served the guests first) with a glass of champagne and a grin that she spotted something was wrong.</p><p>“What’s-…?”</p><p>But Agatha cleared her throat loudly as Jen piped up, “Oh we were just-…”</p><p>And Billy came to the rescue. “How’s the job hunt going, Rio? You found anything yet?”</p><p>“No,” Rio sighed and Agatha placed a hand over hers as she settled beside her on the couch. “I was thinking of taking a teaching course and teaching adult education classes at a nonprofit. Teaching English to Spanish speakers, Y’know.”</p><p>Alice grinned at this but had know this was a pseudo-plan anyway and she went to sit down beside her wife, squeezing into the armchair with her. “I think it’s a great idea.”</p><p>“It’s something.”</p><p>“You’d be a good teacher,” Lilia said suddenly, for some reason looking at Agatha rather than Rio.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced at Agatha briefly before returning to Lilia with a smile, “Thank you.”</p><p>“So, no psychos joining us?”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip but Agatha spoke for her, “Natasha had to work.”</p><p>“Pity,” Jen said quietly as she wrapped an arm around Alice’s shoulders.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s fingers flex against her own and she settled back more into the cushions, unable to deny that not having Natasha here would make the whole thing much easier for her.</p><p>As the evening went on, more alcohol was consumed and a delivery of Chinese was devoured, Rio found herself alone in the kitchen searching for a bottle opener she was sure she’d left on the counter.</p><p>“This what you’re looking for?”</p><p>She turned around to see Lilia holding the missing tool and smiling at her and Rio sighed in relief as she took it.</p><p>“Thought I was going insane. Thank you.”</p><p>“Agatha has great power, you know.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned to look at Lilia in surprise, wondering if she were drunk. “I… yes I suppose she does.”</p><p>“A mere child when I met her. Barely an adult. She’d already been through so much and yet… there was a fork in the road.”</p><p>Rio blinked rapidly, now thinking that she herself was drunk and hallucinating this conversation.</p><p>“She started down it alone, then met Jen and Alice, and they helped turn her back. Then Wanda came and the road changed, evolved.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, “I’m sorry, Lilia. I’m not entirely-…”</p><p>“And she got lost,” Lilia continued on, “Lost herself, lost her heart. But she never let that turn her from where she was going - where she  <em>could</em> go. She merely,” Lilia raised her hands and flourished them, “Halted.”</p><p>“And then you came along. And she started up again, and now the road she’s on. Well, it’s an entirely new one. It’s the one I foresaw when I first met her. I’ve been waiting years for you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>
<em>Spooky bitch.</em>
</p><p>Rio continued to blink at Lilia, aware she must look a little dense, but unsure how exactly to react to this. She shifted where she stood, still holding up the bottle opener like it was a torch and she were searching for something.</p><p>“Oh. I…”</p><p>“The cards I pulled earlier. Marriage: yes. Maybe. But more than that. It’s destined. It’s divine. It’s already established. The Lovers, The Hierophant, The Devil, Five of Swords, Six of Wands.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this, feeling a little flushed in her cheeks and blushing an even deeper shade when the subject of this strange discussion appeared in the door.</p><p>“There you are. Everything okay?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said quickly, too quickly, and felt Lilia’s intense gaze on her still as she turned fully to Agatha. “Just catching up.”</p><p>“I’m telling her about the road,” Lilia said calmly, a small smile falling to her face.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha rolled her eyes as she moved into the room. “Yes. Okay. Rio ignore whatever she’s saying she’s an old kook.”</p><p>“I thought Rio would be interested to know that she’s your destiny and your destination.”</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eye then and saw she looked a little taken aback. “I think you’re scaring her,” Agatha said quickly but as she moved past Lilia she placed a quick kiss to the side of her head.</p><p>Rio turned then to the task she’d been in the kitchen for in the first place and dutifully began to open another bottle of wine.</p><p>She felt Agatha reach her side and kiss her cheek gently, “She’s been telling me all kinds of crazy shit for years.”</p><p>Rio glanced up to see Lilia smile at this and she couldn’t help but smile back. Spooky, but harmless.</p><p>“I say what I see. And in you, Agatha Harkness, I see much.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a little but didn’t protest and instead dismissed Lilia with a frown and a playful wave of her hand, “Get back out there and scare Billy. Maybe he’ll see sense and take those goddamn piercings out.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Lilia did too but swooped back out towards the living room, leaving Agatha to wrap her arms around Rio’s waist more fully. “Did she scare you?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio teased with a grin, “Being a destiny and destination is a pretty big ask.”</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and dipped her head to begin kissing Rio’s neck in such a way that made her laugh and squirm in her arms, “Hey! Hey! No messing with the destiny!”</p><p>Lilia didn’t mention anything else about tarot that night but both Rio and Agatha were keenly aware that their friends were watching them closely, as if a ring would suddenly appear out of nowhere.</p><p>By the time they both fell into bed a couple hours later, Rio wouldn’t let up about being Agatha’s “destiny”.</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha pleaded as she slipped her hand beneath Rio’s shirt and began to palm roughly against her breast, “It’s very unsexy to be talking about destiny when I want to have sex with you.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes, “There’s a pun in there somewhere about coming and destination but I’m too drunk to make it.”</p><p>Agatha snorted but didn’t let Rio’s constant chatter distract her from eventually getting them both to come and arrive, sweaty and tired, at their final destination: sleep.</p><p>The next day, Agatha had to do some work so Rio took the gang out to a local Christmas market and was on hand to show the sights and sounds of Washington.</p><p>The day was mostly spent in familiar ease now the little group had relaxed into each other. Jen was a bit softer, but not without her usual snark; Alice was as thrilled as ever to have Rio back to her usual self and they spoke mostly about basketball and things neither Jen nor Agatha understood; Billy hung off every one of Rio’s words and seemed as determined as ever to get Agatha to like him; and Lilia watched everything with a warm smile and knowing eyes.</p><p>So Christmas Eve passed by in the way any evening with Jen and Alice usually did. Agatha was relaxed and in her home so had no qualms about holding Rio close or getting drunk and sparring with Jen.</p><p>Alice, now much more relaxed around Rio again, still managed to drink too much and focus most of her attention on the Latina, catching up as only they could do when not limited by their many text conversations or intermittent phone calls.</p><p>Lilia kept watch between Jen and Agatha, allowing them to spar for a while before she’d make pains to cool it down. She’d met them when Jen had dragged Agatha to get her tarot read and something about Agatha had meant that Lilia somehow stuck around. She’d never told them what - not really. From the few times Rio caught this in action it looked as if Lilia nailed the timing of her input impeccably every time. And I’m her slightly tipsy mind, she thought: <em>spooky bitch</em>, though she had a growing soft spot for the woman.</p><p>Billy kept close to Agatha, but was never really involved in what she was saying. And to Rio he looked like such a lost puppy that she’d at one point pointedly nudged her girlfriend and indicated silently that she should include him. Naturally, this lasted all of five minutes before Agatha got irritated and ignored him again.</p><p>And Jen. Jen teased Agatha within an inch of her life about everything and anything: “get your hands off of her, no one’s trying to steal your damn girlfriend”; “Agatha shut up already about politics no one gives a shit and what the hell is a caucus?”; “I hear Stark’s trying to get Pepper pregnant before the primaries. Anything to do with your sick and twisted mind, Aggie?”</p><p>But Rio just watched it all happen. She let Agatha hold her close, let her tug her back to her whenever she disappeared for more drink or to use the bathroom or to show Alice something on her phone.</p><p>The night went on. The night got easier. And even Jen seemed to be enjoying herself; no longer just speaking to Rio when spoken to, actually involving her in conversation.</p><p>And slowly but surely, everyone began to peel off towards bed. Agatha followed Rio up with a steady knowledge that soon she’d be in her favourite place with her favourite person.</p><p>Rio was exhausted from trudging around the city in the snow all day and only just managed to convince her tired body to change into the flannel pyjamas that Alice had bought for everyone, insisting they all wear the same for Christmas morning.</p><p>Agatha very nearly didn’t put hers on either, but for different reasons (mostly class and obstinance) but Rio insisted and only pulled her to her once she’d obliged.</p><p>Rio grinned and was about to kiss Agatha more firmly when she squealed as deft fingers began to tickle over her sides and she fought against her hold, trying to wriggle away; Agatha’s little protest about being made to wear the pyjamas.</p><p>They fell together properly into the bed like that, Rio entirely at the mercy of Agatha’s teasing fingers, breathless and laughing, her cheeks tinged pink.</p><p>And as Eve slipped into Day, they rolled about the bed together soon both breathless for other reasons, falling asleep naked and satiated in each other’s arms, Alice’s pyjamas discarded on the floor.</p><p>Just before 9am the next morning Rio was woken by the sounds of shouts and laughter, music and banging, and she groaned as she rolled over in the bed in search of the warm body she was sure she’d fallen asleep on top of.</p><p>But Agatha was nowhere to be found. She wasn’t even in the en suite judging by the fact that the door was still stood open showing her the empty inside.</p><p>Rio flipped over in case she was going crazy and had missed Agatha on her other side. But she was gone.</p><p>On Agatha’s side of the bed though was a small box with a little card propped against it. Rio’s name was written in familiar loopy handwriting and she fell over herself in the bed to snatch it up and read it.</p><p>To her surprise it was written in perfect Spanish.</p><p>
<em>’Darling Rio,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t have family heirlooms or anything of sentimental value I can give you but I wanted you to have this.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I saw this in Chelsea and thought of you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I was hoping you’d wear it and think of me.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yours,<br/>
Agatha.’</em>
</p><p>Rio’s heart was thudding heavily against her ribs as she reached for the little box, opening it reverently to see what had made Agatha think of her.</p><p>Inside, nestled on a little cushion was a delicate gold ring. The ring had two thin bands that twisted round each other, one plain and gold, the other inset with small brilliant diamonds.</p><p>Rio marvelled at it, the delicate luxury of it, the understated beauty.</p><p>She slipped it on the ring finger of her right hand and smiled down at it before she hurried from the bedroom, grabbing her discarded pyjamas and Agatha’s dressing gown as she went.</p><p>By the time she arrived in the noisy kitchen, having wrapped Agatha’s dressing gown around her and done the belt up snuggly, she was slightly out of breath and desperate to find the woman who had left her such a romantic gift.</p><p>But she didn’t have time to ask for Agatha’s whereabouts as she was descended upon by Alice first, then Billy. Both giving her tight hugs and both wishing her a Merry Christmas.</p><p>Rio returned each with a grin and accepted the glass of champagne that Jen had handed her in lieu of a hug. She didn’t even have to ask for Jen to tell her: “In her office.”</p><p>Hurrying away but not before grabbing another glass, Rio was soon carefully pushing open the door to Agatha’s study, raising her brows at the sight of the woman working studiously at just after nine on Christmas morning.</p><p>“Feliz navidad, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha looked up then and smiled at Rio, arching her brows at the champagne in her hands but pushing back in her chair to move around and lean back against her desk.</p><p>“Merry Christmas,” she returned softly and captured Rio with a firm kiss as she moved up against her.</p><p>Rio grinned against Agatha’s lips and pressed her champagne to her, “Now why would you leave such a romantic note, in Spanish might I add, a beautiful gift, and then run away?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but with her free hand she lifted Rio’s hand to admire her choice. “Well I wanted to give you the privacy of opening it alone in case you didn’t like it.”</p><p>“Insane,” Rio mumbled, wriggling her fingers in Agatha’s hold and gazing down at it as it caught the light. “I love it. Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>“And the Spanish? Where did that come from?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat softly and relaxed back more against the desk, opening her legs a little to pull Rio closer, “I’ve been taking lessons. I was going to wait a while longer to tell you until I was better but I thought… maybe it was more romantic at Christmas.”</p><p>Rio grinned and laughed softly from the sheer preciousness of it all, “I’d say that’s true.”</p><p>Just as Rio was about to lean in to kiss Agatha properly, they were interrupted by a loud shout from the door, “Okay if we could just stop all the kissing and touching for one day that would be present enough for all of us.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and shouted back, “Shut up, Jen. Where’s your Christmas spirit?”</p><p>“In the cabinet with the rest of the spirits.”</p><p>Rio pulled away with a snort and tugged on Agatha’s hand to pull her back out into the chaos and through to the main living room.</p><p>The place was already strewn with discarded wrapping paper and random gifts lying about the place.</p><p>There were boxes of alcohol, neatly folded clothes, a couple of torn-through shoe boxes, various random gifts, and some even looking a little bashed from the plane ride over. Clearly Jen and Alice had been at it early.</p><p>As Rio settled on the floor by the tree she reached for a thin parcel wrapped in garish red wrapping paper with Santa Claus’s face splattered all over it. She reached too for a smaller box, more neatly wrapped, with no Santa in sight.</p><p>She handed both to Agatha with a grin and shuffled closer as Agatha sank to her knees amidst the chaos.</p><p>“This is just a small thing. Your real gift is in this box.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows as she opened the first gift, laughing as she held up in her hands a deep purple basketball jersey with the name Vidal on the back and a number: 69.</p><p>“Obviously I don’t have a new team yet but… this will tide you over until I can replace it with a new one. Plus it’s sexy if you’re wearing my name.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled as she held the purple jersey up to herself and winked across at Rio, “My colour. Thank you, honey.”</p><p>Rio just hummed happily and handed over the smaller gift, her eyes drifting to Alice as she did so.</p><p>Alice sat back with her champagne and gave a small but encouraging smile, watching the interaction as she tugged at Jen who had been talking to Lilia about her new dress to get her to pay attention.</p><p>Agatha watched this curiously and then turned to open the smaller gift with more care than she had done with the jersey.</p><p>When the paper was pulled back and she saw a Rolex symbol staring back at her she raised her brow at Rio before turning back to the gift.</p><p>Inside the box was a men’s Rolex in silver and gold, shining up at Agatha, reflecting in its face the twinkling lights of the Christmas tree.</p><p>Rio had spent a long time thinking about what to get Agatha for Christmas. She wanted to get her something she could keep, something she might even treasure. But Agatha had all the money in the world, the best jewellery, the best everything.</p><p>And so, on a particularly cold day when Rio had been out to the grocery store, she’d taken a detour into an avenue of expensive shops and spotted the Rolex store.</p><p>Inside she’d been practically jumped upon by the sales assistant and ushered to a seat in the back where she was shown all kinds of models and faces, all colours and sizes. But the one that had captured her eye was the men’s sky-dweller. The face was a little larger than the woman’s (gendered nonsense, Rio thought) but she held it up to her own wrist and imagined Agatha’s pale skin there instead, thinking of how it would look below the cuff of her blazers, when she rolled her sleeves up, when she gripped Rio’s waist.</p><p>She bought it on the spot.</p><p>Agatha’s finger reached to trace the edge of the white watch face, and she finally spoke, “Rio, this is… this is too much.”</p><p>But Rio hadn’t finished the gift yet, hadn’t got to the bit she was actually a little nervous about and she shifted closer, clearing her throat as she went to take the watch out of its little holder, turning it so Agatha could read the engraving on the back.</p><p>In small, neat script, it simply read: <em>’Yours, always’.</em></p><p>Rio looked up then and caught Agatha’s gaze, frowning a little when she saw that her eyes had filled with tears and she moved up to hold her cheek, “Hey, is it okay? Do you like it?”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly and nodded, leaning in to capture Rio’s lips with her own and tugging her closer by her collar.</p><p>“I love it.”</p><p>Rio hummed against her lips happily and pulled away only so she could adorn her wrist with her new watch. She adjusted it and clipped the strap in place with gentle fingers before turning Agatha’s wrist over to look down at it.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure which one to get you but I thought you’d suit this one. Slim wrist, big watch. Hot.”</p><p>Agatha smirked at this and flexed her arm out slightly to continue admiring the watch but was interrupted by Jen who looked like she’d accidentally been watching one of those hallmark movies she hated.</p><p>“God you guys are even gross on Christmas.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and moved to kiss Agatha again, shooting Alice a thrilled grin over her shoulder before she settled back in against the couch and tugged Agatha into her side.</p>

<p>“It’s hot,” Alice acknowledged of Agatha’s new gift; looking down to see the watch on her wrist as Agatha settled more around Rio, adjusting herself so she could lean back against the arm of the couch and pull Rio back against her chest.</p><p>Sure enough, the arms that wrapped around her, one holding her champagne, the other sporting her new watch, did make Rio feel a little warm for such a cold winter’s day.</p><p>She reached to touch the cool metal of the watch on Agatha’s right wrist and watched as her ring winked back at her, adding to the shiver that threatened to overtake her body.</p><p>“Agreed,” she said with a smirk, looking back up to Alice with a pleased grin and not acknowledging the fact that Agatha’s watch-bearing hand had slipped beneath her robe and the woman behind her muttered something about “fucking pyjamas” as she tried to wrestle with the fabric to get to Rio’s bare skin.</p><p>“Please,” Lilia called out, “No canoodling. It’s not even mid-morning.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but relaxed her movements against Rio and decided instead to simply hold her close, making do with just one piece of fabric between her hand and Rio’s skin.</p><p><em>“Te amo mucho,”</em> Agatha murmured softly against Rio’s hair, nuzzling against her gently as the others became distracted once again by the presents littered about the place.</p><p>The soft words in her mother tongue settled right in her chest and Rio finally understood what all the poetry written by lovers across the centuries meant. Because Agatha had loved her before but now she loved her in a way she’d been loved since she took her first breaths.</p><p>Agatha, in speaking those words to Rio, the words in a language she’d practiced and conjugated and learnt, became her family.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the grin that fell across her face as she turned her head slightly to look at Agatha, <em>”Te amo tanto, cariño.”</em></p><p>She slipped her own hand into her robe to hold Agatha’s and shuffled back more as if there was any chance she could be any closer at all.</p><p>Despite Lilia’s protestations earlier, Rio stretched briefly and used her free hand to lift up the heavy fabric of her top, pushing Agatha’s hand down and to the newly created gap to allow her in, closer. Agatha’s hand moved quickly up Rio’s stomach and settled just below her breast, above her heart and the steady, familiar rhythm of it made Agatha nuzzle in closer. The bridge of her nose rested against Rio’s jaw and her soft breaths tickled Rio’s skin.</p><p>Rio squeezed her hands gently and felt long fingers squeeze back over her ribs, acknowledging the touch.</p><p>Outside of their little bubble, Billy was handing out the gifts, diligently checking each label before handing it to its new owner. He moved about the place like a prospector sifting for gold, inspecting every gift like it was a precious thing, and not some godawful turban Alice had bought as a joke for Lilia.</p><p>Rio observed all of this with a soft smile of contentment on her face, the pads of her fingers tapping out a soft pattern over the back of Agatha’s hand. This, as the lights twinkled gladly on the tree beside them, felt like home, she thought.</p><p>Just one thing was missing.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts Agatha spoke into her ear again, “Are you happy? Or could you be happier on a beach?”</p><p>Rio smiled a little broader but reached to steal Agatha’s champagne from her hand, her own too far out of her reach for her to bother to move, “A beach couldn’t possibly make this better.”</p><p>She felt Agatha smile against her before she sipped at her champagne, and let the bubbles trace and burst over her tongue.</p><p>“What’re you two smiling about?”</p><p>Rio’s gaze rose to Alice and she caught her infectious grin, shrugging a little as Agatha called over, “None of your business.”</p><p>Alice pursed her lips but made eye contact again with Rio who wriggled her brows playfully at her and she laughed even as Jen shouted right back, her own glass of champagne hovering somewhere between hers and Alice’s heads as she gesticulated, “Get your heads in the game, please. I want my gifts.”</p><p>Rio laughed and held out the glass of champagne (what remained of it) so that Agatha would take it and she could slip away.</p><p>“Ugh,” Agatha groaned even as she took the glass and allowed Rio to pull away, watching her with a scowl as she shuffled up the couch.</p><p>“Why the rush, Jen. You selected your gifts from everyone so you know what you’re getting.”</p><p>“Yes, but I <em>want</em> to get them.”</p><p>And so it began.</p><p>As Agatha knocked back the rest of her champagne Rio stood with Billy to help hand out what was left of the gifts.</p><p>For Alice and Jen: Rio and Agatha had gone in on a gift together, buying them a spa weekend in the Cotswolds on a date of their choice. As a little addition to Alice’s gift, Rio had bought her a new Golden State Warriors jersey (Alice’s hometown team).</p><p>For Lilia: Rio had bought her a small tarot set she’d seen in a local market that looked old and moth-eaten but had intricate designs that she thought Lilia would appreciate. Agatha had bought her something a little more ostentatious: a new charm for her necklace that had a small depictiction of the sun tarot and looked to be solid gold.</p><p>For Billy: Rio had bought him a new sweater that she thought would bring out his eyes and Agatha had bought him a leather-bound diary.</p><p>All of these gifts were met with varying degrees of excitement ranging from thrilled to Alice who practically jumped on Jen in her excitement about a whole weekend of pampering.</p><p>In exchange, Rio received: a season ticket to the Washington Mystics from Alice and Jen; a book on symbols from Lilia; and a candle that smelled like freshly cut grass from Billy.</p><p>Agatha’s gifts were a little more ridiculous, at least from Jen and Alice - everyone in the group knew Agatha could buy whatever she wanted so they were more relaxed about the costs and more focused on how well they could tease her. Alice and Jen had bought her a book called ‘How to raise a plant and make it love you back’, having heard about Agatha inadvertently tipping coffee into one of Rio’s plants and getting a row from her for it. From Lilia, Agatha received an intricately drawn birth chart that Lilia had clearly taken a lot of time over. From Billy, Agatha received a purple Stanley cup that had a little pride sticker on the side that Agatha did not appreciate but that Rio thought was cute.</p><p>When the gifts were all handed out and the first round of champagne was done, everyone started to move through to the kitchen for food and more sparkling.</p><p>Just as Rio went to stand and follow everyone in a strong arm held her back and Agatha pulled her against her again with a soft ‘oof’ from Rio.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going?”</p><p>Rio laughed then and turned her head slightly to try to look at her captor. “Oh you don’t want more champagne?”</p><p>“I want you alone for just a second.”</p><p>“And why might that be?”</p><p>Agatha smirked and moved so she could press a kiss to Rio’s cheek, going back to her previous rummaging so she could slip her hand beneath Rio’s pyjama shirt. Cold metal met hot skin and Rio gasped a little as Agatha pulled her impossibly closer, “There are too many people here. We should go away next Christmas. Just us. You, me… you in a bikini.”</p><p>Rio hummed and closed her eyes as she felt Agatha’s lips press the hollow behind her ear.</p><p>“I wouldn’t mind recreating the last time I saw you in a bikini.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open as Agatha nipped at her lobe and she squirmed out of her hold, pulling away to swing up and onto her knees, glaring at her girlfriend in warning. “Don’t. We have a whole day of festivities ahead of us.”</p><p>Agatha just smiled and stretched her arms up, beginning to attempt to tug Rio down and into her, “We could go upstairs for just a few minutes.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said as she fought against the grin that threatened to ruin her stern look, “Behave yourself. It’s Christmas.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but huffed and leant up to place her hands on Rio’s cheeks. “Seriously. Next Christmas. Just you and me.”</p><p>Rio was the one to roll her eyes then and she placed her hands on Agatha’s arms to hold her in place.</p><p>“You’d miss them.”</p><p>“I’d get over it.”</p><p>“I’d miss them.”</p><p>“You’d get over it.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha and was about to say something but was interrupted by Alice who had appeared back in the room, “Agatha! Pancakes!”</p><p>Smirking a little because she got the last word and assuming she’d already decided their holiday plans for the next year, Agatha leant in to press a kiss to Rio’s lips and then sauntered off to make the best pancakes in the world.</p><p>Alice hung back as Rio began to pile up all the discarded wrapping paper and cleared her throat to get Rio’s attention.</p><p>“Would you?”</p><p>Rio looked at Alice then glanced around suspiciously thinking that if she had a nickel for every conversation she had with one of Agatha’s friends where she had no clue what was going on she would have two nickels. Which wasn’t a lot. But it was weird that it had happened twice.</p><p>“Would I what?”</p><p>“Marry her?”</p><p>Rio blinked and a piece of paper she’d been holding fell from her grasp. She bent to pick it up and by the time she was looking back at Alice the woman was grinning at her.</p><p>“Alice, we’ve never even <em>mentioned</em> marriage before.”</p><p>“Oh come on! You’re obsessed with each other. All Agatha talks about is you <em>and</em> you’ve given up your whole life to be with her. I’m not saying you <em>have</em> to get married but I am saying it would be hella romantic and I do look good in a suit.”</p><p>Rio slapped her hand across her mouth after snorting. Loudly.</p><p>“Don’t laugh! It makes sense!” Alice threw a fistful of paper at her but it fell just a foot or so in front of her.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Rio reasoned with a grin, “How about this: I promise to tell you if we ever discuss getting married. Which I’m sure won’t be any time soon. Okay?”</p><p>She held out her hand to her friend, raising her brows in question. Alice eyed her for a second before accepting it and shaking firmly.</p><p>“Fine. But I’ve placed a bet it’ll be in the next three months.”</p><p>“You’re all betting on us?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio paused for a second and pursed her lips, “What did Lilia bet?”</p><p>But Alice just grinned and turned on her heel to leave Rio standing amongst the ruins of Christmas morning.</p><p>By the time Rio had gathered up and disposed of every last glittery, Santa-strewn piece of paper she could find, the pancakes were piled high and the champagne had turned into mimosas.</p><p>Agatha slid Rio a plate with a pancake already on it as she approached the kitchen island and Rio raised a curious brow at her.</p><p>“It’s the biggest,” Jen filled in for her, not even looking up as she reached for her own pancake from the top of the pile. “Juvenile stuff there, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio just smiled as she took her plate and sat down at the island, watching Agatha as she shot Jen a glare. “Don’t start, Kale.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it, chef.” Jen placed a large bite in her mouth and smiled at Agatha as she chewed.</p><p>“A romantic,” Rio cooed with a grin at Agatha who just rolled her eyes but the twitch at her lips was unmistakable.</p><p>“You used to be romantic,” Alice piped up then, nudging Jen to hand her the syrup, “on our third date you told me you loved me. <em>And</em> you bought me a little necklace with your initial on it.”</p><p>“And it was on a picnic blanket in the park,” Agatha added with a wink in Rio’s direction. Rio had to try very hard not to laugh very hard.</p><p>Jen scowled at her wife but in a way that let her know she wasn’t exactly in trouble. “And when did <em>you</em> tell me you loved me?”</p><p>Alice beamed brighter than she had all morning and leant in to kiss Jen, leaving a trace of syrup on her lips that was promptly wiped off. “About a month later. I was a free agent. Sowing my seed.”</p><p>Jen grumbled at this and Rio laughed.</p><p>“We were young! I wasn’t sure I was ready to be tied down!”</p><p>“But how did you meet? I’ve never heard this story.”</p><p>“Oooh,” Billy crowed from across the room where he’d already eaten three pancakes. “Me either.”</p><p>Alice laughed and Rio reached for her mimosa, watching expectantly.</p><p>“It was a cold, blustery day in old New Haven and the electricity had gone in one of the residences so I-…”</p><p>“Okay, Edgar Allan. A bunch of stoners had been messing around in the basement and tripped a wire,” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“No interruptions please,” Lilia said with a smile as she moved closer to the little group around the large island. “I love this story.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and moved from her position with her plate and mimosa to take the stool by Rio.</p><p>“<em>Anyway</em>,” Alice began again, shooting daggers at Agatha briefly before turning her attention back to the room.</p><p>“The sun had already set and so when the lights went out it was dark. And I mean <em>dark</em>. I’d been in a dorm on the fifth floor when-…”</p><p>“She lived on the ground floor.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“You need to give context.”</p><p>Alice huffed and Jen laughed as she took a sip of her mimosa.</p><p>“Yes I lived on the ground floor but I was on the fifth.”</p><p>“Why, Alice?”</p><p>Rio looked around to catch Agatha’s amused smile and then turned back to Alice in anticipation.</p><p>“Because there was a cute girl on the fifth floor I was trying to-…”</p><p>“She was straight.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and bit down on her lip to stop herself from laughing, her affection for Alice preventing her from indulging even Agatha.</p><p>“Yes. She was straight.” Alice narrowed her eyes at Agatha then turned her attention back to the room. “But you can’t blame a girl for trying. So I was in her room and-…”</p><p>“Naked.”</p><p>“<em>Not</em> naked. I’d just managed to take my shirt off-…”</p><p>“Wait, wait,” Rio threw her hands up to stop the conversation. “If she was straight why had you…?”</p><p>But the look on Alice’s face told her everything she needed to know. “Ah,” she said with a smirk and made quotation marks in the air with her fingers, “straight.”</p><p>“Yes and very religious. So as soon as the lights went out she kicked me out of the room. I think she thought it was a sign from god or something.”</p><p>“This is the good part,” Lilia promised with a knowing smile.</p><p>“Yeah because I’m in it,” Jen agreed with a smirk as she straightened her back and focused in on her wife.</p><p>“Well exactly. I was forced from the room, without a shirt, and straight into the arms of this tall beautiful creature.”</p><p>“Creature?”</p><p>“Angel.”</p><p>Rio shot Agatha an amused smile and Agatha rolled her eyes in response.</p><p>“Anyway, Jen got a bit of a fright and I was mortified but she liked what she saw,” Jen scoffed at this, “and I bit the bullet and asked her on a date.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha corrected with a smirk as she leant more around Rio for the full effect of it, “You both stumbled to a supply closet and fucked.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Billy slapped his hands over his ears and grimaced, “I didn’t need to know that part.”</p><p>“Can we not say ‘fucked’ this early in the morning?” Lilia frowned a little at Agatha but from Rio’s perspective she didn’t look at all mad which made her wonder if there was anyone in the world Agatha’s charms didn’t work on.</p><p>Rio turned to the woman now practically draped around her and reached for her hand to squeeze but focused back in on Alice who looked incredibly smug.</p><p>“Fine. We… made love in the closet and Jen was putty in my hands from then on.”</p><p>Jen released a laugh that was halfway between a scoff and a cackle, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, honey. It was just a bit of fun.”</p><p>“That and a week and a half later turned into an ‘I love you’,” Agatha trilled as she grinned around at her best friend.</p><p>“Alright, smarty pants. How long did it take you to tell Rio?”</p><p>“A while,” Agatha shrugged and her smile faded a little, the memory of when and how she’d admitted to being in love clearly a little too raw still. But Rio squeezed her hand gently and looked around at Jen with a soft smile, “She didn’t need to tell me. It was <em>very</em> obvious.”</p><p>Agatha poked her side.</p><p>“Ah!” Rio laughed and shuffled away a little.</p><p>“It’s true actually, Harkness. You were gross with her even when we’d just met her. And all those hickeys? Control yourself.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a little and sat back in her stool to jab her fork into her half-finished pancake.</p><p>“I can kick you out of this house, Jennifer.”</p><p>“Actually it’s my home too and you can stay.”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a glare but Rio returned it with a smile that softened it slightly.</p><p>“The political fixer and the escort,” Jen mused with a smirk as she sipped her cocktail. “Who knew. Evanora would be turning in her grave.”</p><p>Alice laughed and began to top up everyone’s glasses, “Oh she’d have hated you, Rio. Not just because of your old job. Because you smile and, you know, the Latina thing.”</p><p>“<em>Latina thing</em>?” Rio gasped teasingly, “Oh thanks.”</p><p>“Well and the fact that you’re a woman.”</p><p>Agatha huffed again from beside Rio and reached an arm to place around Rio’s shoulders as she leant around to catch Jen’s eye, “Can we not discuss my mother before I’m even pleasantly drunk.”</p><p>For all the stories Rio had told Agatha about her own parents - all the love and the joy she’d been surrounded by when she was a child - Agatha hadn’t shared much about her own upbringing. But from the little she had shared, Rio knew it wasn’t a happy childhood, and that Agatha had grown up without much love and certainly with no joy.</p><p>Her hand moved down to rest on Agatha’s thigh, not quite acknowledging that silent plea in Agatha’s remark but just letting her know she was there, that she understood.</p><p>Jen, on the other hand, just scoffed, “Oh, come on. You showed that bitch when you made a name for yourself. No one talks about Evanora anymore when they hear ‘Harkness’. It’s <em>Agatha</em> now.”</p><p>“Still. Props on picking the person who could potentially piss your dead mother off the most.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at this and turned in her seat to catch Agatha’s gaze, smiling a little at the frown on her face.</p><p>She leant in to press a soft kiss to the corner of her lips and whispered, “Ignore it.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head into Rio and captured her lips properly.</p><p>“And you, Vidal,” Jen called, ignoring the intimate moment with aplomb. “What would your parents have thought of our dear friend here? Fine with the gay thing? What about her being the daughter of one of the biggest-…?”</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>She huffed and rolled her eyes, looking at Rio expectantly.</p><p>“Fine with the gay thing. Mom said she knew when I was ten and I kept blushing every time a pretty waitress came to take our order at the iHop.”</p><p>Alice laughed and reached for another pancake, “Classic.”</p><p>“And they’d have loved Agatha. Who doesn’t?”</p><p>“Many, many people,” Jen said drily but shot her best friend a smile.</p><p>“The escort thing-…?”</p><p>Billy started but Rio anticipated the question, “They didn’t know. Thought I worked with Natasha, hence the trips.”</p><p>At the mention of Natasha’s name, even from her own lips, maybe the champagne was talking but she felt a knot appear in her stomach and even Agatha’s gentle touch to her lower back did nothing to loosen it.</p><p>But no one else seemed to notice Rio’s turmoil and Billy nodded solemnly and everyone went quiet for a little while. Whether the mention of Natasha or lying to now dead parents, Rio couldn’t be sure.</p><p>“Ever…? With her?” Jen was looking at Rio with raised brows, assuming the response would be in the affirmative.</p><p>Agatha’s hand disappeared from her lower back and Rio knew why that might be. So she slipped her hand back to, and further round, Agatha’s thigh to hold her more.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Really?” Jen looked scandalised, “You’re both hot and gay that makes <em>no</em> sense.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and squeezed at Agatha’s thigh gently, “There was one time. A drunken fumble but we stopped it before it went anywhere.”</p><p>Jen eyed her suspiciously but Rio turned away to check on Agatha, who was staring determinedly at the wall as she sipped her drink, no, gulped it.</p><p>“Jen and Agatha had a thing.”</p><p>Agatha almost spat her mouthful of mimosa out.</p><p>Rio snapped her head around to Billy who looked like he might vomit from fear, having taken himself by surprise.</p><p>“You did?”</p><p>Large brown eyes fell to Jen first, who looked a little uncomfortable and then flew around to her girlfriend who looked furious.</p><p>“It was nothing. I was drunk and horny and Jen was a warm body.”</p><p>“Oh thanks.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and glanced at Rio with a slightly apologetic look in her eyes, but something else was present in her gaze that Rio knew was related to the Natasha discussion from earlier. “It was nothing. Years ago.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this but swallowed down the rage of jealousy and the hurt that in all of their discussions of their past, Agatha had failed to mention that she’d slept with her best friend.</p><p>“It was lousy anyway,” Jen said as she shot her wife a quick smile. Alice didn’t seem too affected, busying herself with pouring out more champagne - she’d heard this many times before so the sting was barely perceptible anymore.</p><p>“Agreed,” Agatha said quickly, and knocked back her champagne before offering it to Alice’s waiting bottle.</p><p>Rio looked between the two women again and then cleared her throat as she said, “Imagine, Alice. You could have bumped into Jen with your shirt off and had to deal with a jealous Agatha rather than getting some.”</p><p>Alice laughed at this and even Agatha seemed to relax a little, shuffling to scooch a little closer to Rio.</p><p>“And neither of us would be here today,” Alice added with a conspiratorial grin.</p><p>Agatha harrumphed at that, “Jen and I would never have worked out. Trust me, it was twenty minutes I’d <em>love</em> to not have spent with this pillow princess.”</p><p>Rio laughed and nudged at Jen’s shoulder with a grin, “Ouch.” But it still stung a little, knowing Agatha had been with, been <em>inside</em> Jen.</p><p>“That’s my wife you’re talking about.”</p><p>Jen just shrugged it off and rolled her eyes, “Whatever, Miss Control.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and as if on cue felt Agatha snake her arms around her waist, practically pulling her half out of her seat in an effort to hold her closer.</p><p>The atmosphere in the room had changed over the past ten minutes. Mention of Natasha had reminded Rio what was missing and knowledge of Agatha and Jen reminded her of what else she could lose. Her body felt tense and even Agatha’s hold hadn’t calmed her. But Agatha muttered a soft, “Come here,” and in spite of herself and how she was feeling, Rio moved with her and onto her lap.</p><p>“Sometimes,” Lilia started slowly, her voice low and gravelly, “We put aside what we want in exchange for what is best for those we love.”</p><p>Rio raised her gaze to Lilia and found that she was looking at her in that strange way again, as if she knew something she didn’t.</p><p>“Whatever <em>that</em> means,” Jen said with exaggerated wide eyes and a laugh as she sipped her champagne and poked the remainder of her pancake about her plate.</p><p>The conversation moved on then to plans for the rest of the day and how much champagne was too much champagne before midday.</p><p>But Rio was tense and felt it in her bones. Agatha’s hold on her remained strong, and she could vaguely acknowledge the fingers that toyed with the fabric on her tartan pyjama pants but her mind was elsewhere.</p><p>She’d seen a few photos of Agatha from her college days; just as beautiful, but with slightly softer features, a gaze that was fiery but not yet fierce. She imagined this Agatha with the young Jen she’d seen. She imagined how one of their verbal spats could one night have turned into something more. Shouted words becoming whispered promises. Angry remarks becoming gentle caresses. It was too much to bear.</p><p>“Billy, clean this up. I need to change. I’m done with these pyjamas. I wasn’t built for flannel.”</p><p>Rio blinked and looked to see the room clearing before her eyes. Billy was moving quickly to try and clean up before he was given another random instruction from his boss but Rio didn’t have a chance to offer him help because Agatha was already pulling her from the room.</p><p>She’d pushed her gently off her lap and had taken her hand, silent and commanding her to follow her up the stairs and all the way up to their shared bedroom but it had been Rio who’d let go of it in favour of moving through to the adjoining bathroom to wash her face.</p><p>She needed the cool splash of water to reset herself.</p><p>Agatha’s, and now Rio’s, bedroom was a sanctuary. A place where the two of them, even with a whole day spent apart, could be together, even for five minutes before sleep, for  longer when they took turns taking each other’s breath away, or for a lazy Sunday morning when Agatha usually had the most time and Rio took advantage by trapping her in bed with her to taste and touch at her leisure.</p><p>The cool water that trickled down Rio’s jaw to splash back in the sink brought her back down to reality, made her focus on what she did have: a growing affection for the other people now in their house, a solid friendship with Alice, and the love of her life waiting for her on the bed.</p><p>After touch drying her face with her towel, Rio came back into the room and watched Agatha, enjoying the sight of her stretched out and waiting, watching her with piercing blue eyes.</p><p>There was a pause, the two of them looking at each other, both silent with so many unsaid things.</p><p>Agatha broke first.</p><p>“‘A drunken fumble’?” She quoted back at Rio with raised brows from where she was lounging on the bed, “What exactly does that mean?”</p><p>Agatha’s tone was less than sharp but it wasn’t exactly relaxed and Rio moved closer to the bed, knowing she needed to be much closer to be able to have this conversation.</p><p>She sighed quietly and ran a hand through her hair as her knees hit the side of the bed, “Making out, a bit of groping. Not sex. It was years ago.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pursed as she took this in and she went to speak again but Rio interrupted her.</p><p>“You were actually <em>inside</em> of your friend. Can we focus on that for a second?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and flopped onto her back on the bed, clearly already done with this conversation. She scowled at the ceiling and Rio knew she wasn’t upset that she’d been found out about Jen and it was more to do with her past with Natasha.</p><p>“It was barely anything. Besides Jen isn’t in love with me.” Agatha’s voice was firmer now as her hand raised up and brushed off the comments as if they had been floating above her in midair.</p><p>But Rio’s stubborn streak was flaring up and she would not be dismissed over this. So she moved and felt the soft mattress dip with her weight as she shifted to her knees and crawled to Agatha.</p><p>She moved closer, crawling up Agatha’s prone body to pin her arms above her head, clasping her wrists firmly and staring down at her in confusion, “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p><em>A nickel,</em> Rio thought. <em>Three nickels</em>.</p><p>She frowned down at the woman before her, her gaze sweeping over Agatha’s stoic features and the muscle in her jaw that flexed and unflexed as she matched her gaze and Rio frowned deeply, out of confusion and frustration at the half-truths of the woman below her.</p><p>“What do you mean, Agatha?” She asked cautiously, watching the thoughts swirl in blue eyes as she gazed down at her.</p><p>“Natasha’s in love with you.”</p><p>Rio blinked. Once. Twice. And then her hold on Agatha’s wrists went slack and released altogether as she sat back on her ankles and frowned down at the woman beneath her.</p><p>“What? No she isn’t.”</p><p>Agatha, the elegant, ethereal, enigmatic strategist with a secret heart of gold and eyes only for Rio stared up at her with a look that in other circumstances might have melted Rio. But her mind was so full, so <em>busy</em> that she couldn’t quite get a handle on how she was feeling.</p><p>And so Agatha gave her a second, leaning up on her elbows where Rio still straddled her hips.</p><p>“I know what loving you looks like and I know that you think you’re just-…”</p><p>“We’re just friends,” Rio finished quickly, watching Agatha but not really seeing her anymore, seeing instead the green eyes she’d grown up with, poured herself into, grown accustomed to.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s true. Not from her perspective anyway.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and for a second snapped out of it, grasping at the reality of the situation before she could tumble further into self-doubt - into an alternate reality she’d never even glimpsed at before, let alone considered.</p><p>“You’re distracting me from the fact that you didn’t tell me about Jen,” she accused, adjusting herself to push Agatha onto her back again and grasp her wrists. But Agatha had the upper hand now. Rio <em>was</em> distracted. And she grabbed her and flipped them easily, soon pinning Rio in the position she’d been in just seconds ago.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha started softly, her voice dripping with condescension as she leant in and brushed her lips across Rio’s parted ones, “where did you go?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes tightly, focusing on what she could feel around her: the soft press of the mattress against her back, the gentle pressure of familiar fingers around her wrists, the warmth of Agatha hovering just over her hips. But her mind kept pulling her back to Agatha’s conclusion: Natasha was in love with her.</p><p>And suddenly Agatha wasn’t Agatha and the soft pressure against her wrists, against her hips, was familiar but different. It was Natasha.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open. Wide. Alert. Horrified.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Agatha pulled back from her, released her hold on her wrists.</p><p>Rio’s lips parted and she stared in horror at her retreating girlfriend, watching as she moved her hands to cup her cheek, feeling the brush of her thumbs over her, her expression changing from concerned to fearful.</p><p>“What’s wrong? What happened?”</p><p>“I…” but Rio wasn’t able to form the words to reassure a now panicked Agatha whose wide blue eyes were darting all over Rio’s face as if to read something there that she couldn’t vocalise.</p><p>Shaking her head to rid herself of any thoughts of Natasha, of hands on her that weren’t the ones now cautious and gentle against her face, she sucked in a heavy breath before she spoke again.</p><p>“I don’t want to think about Natasha or Jen anymore. I just want you.”</p><p>Agatha frowned deeply at this, clearly still concerned at Rio’s reaction and she didn’t move, didn’t react other than to brush one thumb slowly over Rio’s cheekbone, “Honey, I don’t…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio insisted, her own brow furrowing as she watched Agatha shift slightly, torn between fulfilling Rio’s unspoken request and making sure she was okay.</p><p>“Please. I don’t want to think about them. Just you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart was racing and where Agatha’s hand slipped down to trace along her jaw she was sure she could feel it as her fingers grazed her neck. But she didn’t acknowledge it. Didn’t say anything.</p><p>She just watched Rio with the same cautious expression for a while before she closed the gap between them.</p><p>When Agatha’s lips pressed to her own she felt her body return to her and she no longer saw or felt Natasha, only Agatha.</p><p>Agatha had been holding back in her caution, had been concerned for the woman beneath her, worried she wasn’t in her right mind to be asked to be taken. But now Rio was pliant, and needy beneath her, she had no self-control left.</p><p>She kissed her with abandon, her hands grabbing everywhere she could reach as she moved her face down to press open-mouthed kisses to her neck and jaw.</p><p>Rio moaned beneath Agatha as her skin was sucked and nipped and tasted and she wanted to scream at her to mark her more to claim her more to ruin her more.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t wasting time, as her lips moved down, so did her hands, and soon she was dipping her dominate left hand beneath the waistband of Rio’s pyjamas, teasing her with one finger, pressing into her with two, and finally stretching her with three.</p><p>Agatha was moaning almost as much as Rio, her breathing hot and sticky against her chest and Rio couldn’t get a handle on her volume, her lips parted and swollen, heavy moans and curses releasing from them with every thrust of Agatha’s practiced fingers.</p><p>Agatha’s right hand moved up to grasp Rio’s throat and the breath was stolen from Rio’s lungs for a second as Agatha squeezed and flexed her fingers.</p><p>Blue eyes darted down and soft lips parted as Agatha watched Rio’s throat contract beneath her hold. Rio’s lips twitched at the sight of dilated eyes and she gasped softly when Agatha squeezed again, testing her limits as she continued to set a brutal pace inside of her.</p><p>So worked up and so desperate, Rio came in record time over Agatha’s hand, moaning loudly and whining as Agatha continued to bully her clit with her thumb, barely relenting even as her hips twitched erratically and she shivered from the strength of her orgasm.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio groaned quietly, her eyes wide and her hands clutching at Agatha’s back to hold her close even as Agatha pulled out of her.</p><p>Agatha ducked her head to kiss Rio softly, her other hand still gently squeezing at her throat, but before either of them could speak, Rio’s hands were reaching, tugging, until she managed to squeeze one between their bodies and press into Agatha’s pants.</p><p>Agatha gasped and moaned as Rio’s fingers made contact with her soaked centre and she bucked her hips into it as her fingers flexed at Rio’s throat still.</p><p>“Fuck, baby. I need-…”</p><p>But Rio knew exactly what she needed and pressed two fingers inside of her, meeting no resistance at all, as soaked as she was.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was laboured still and she moaned as she felt Agatha clench around her as she began to fuck her slowly, moving so her palm could press against her clit as she did.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were dark and intent on the hand still wrapped around Rio’s neck, watching her own fingers flex and unflex in time with Rio’s slow, strong thrusts and the view of her new watch with Rio’s engraved promise shining back at her.</p><p>“Do you like your gift?” Rio husked as she leant up to brush against swollen lips, pressing gentle kisses there as Agatha gasped, her fingers flexing against Rio in warning.</p><p>Applying more pressure, Agatha pushed Rio’s head back and her gaze once again dropped to her fingers about her throat.</p><p>“Fuck, you look <em>unreal</em> right now.”</p><p>Rio groaned softly as Agatha flexed her fingers again and she adjusted her hand to press harder against Agatha’s clit which caused her hips to stir more readily and she felt her walls flutter around her fingers.</p><p>The control Agatha exuded even as Rio was the one doing the fucking almost made her come in her pants again with just Agatha’s hand around her throat.</p><p>Rio’s hips rocked without her thinking and the woman above her didn’t miss it. Blue eyes flashed with something predatory that made Rio whine a little beneath her hold.</p><p>“Shit, I’m not even touching you and you’re…”</p><p>Rio gasped as Agatha squeezed her throat, her fingers stuttering slightly as she briefly lost her rhythm.</p><p>“…you’re so desperate for me, honey.”</p><p>Rio whined at this, her hips bucking, desperate for some friction, another release, and she pressed harder into Agatha, determined to make her come before she lost it completely.</p><p>But Agatha was smirking, her moans now soft and breathy as she flexed and unflexed her fingers at such a pliant throat, blue eyes flickering between plump lips, and the sight of her own hand against her girlfriend.</p><p>“You want me to fill you up again, baby?”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, unsure how Agatha had so easily taken the control, flipped the dynamic so effortlessly so that even whilst Rio’s fingers were inside <em>her</em>, she was still dominating.</p><p>But Agatha’s breathing was picking up with every thrust of Rio’s fingers and her hips were stirring as Rio turned her hand to press her thumb more harshly against her clit.</p><p>“Shit. You look so pretty like this. My hand around your throat. Fuck.”</p><p>And it was this, her own words combined with the feel of Rio inside of her, curling in slightly, the sight of her wide eyes and stuttering hips that pushed Agatha over the edge.</p><p>She came with a cry of Rio’s name and clenched at her throat, making Rio almost come with her as she arched out and into her and gasped as Agatha stole her breath.</p><p>They both collapsed into the other, Agatha falling into her and Rio having no choice but to hold her fingers still, trapping her hand between them even as Agatha’s hold on her throat went slack.</p><p>Rio laughed softly, still catching her breath as she pressed her lips to Agatha’s neck and slowly pulled her fingers out from her, feeling the woman above her groan as her hips chased the sudden loss.</p><p>“So needy,” Agatha groaned quietly, moving to pull back slightly and look down at Rio again beneath hooded eyes.</p><p>Rio’s laugh turned into a smirk and she raised her head to look into dilated blue eyes, “I’m not sure I’m going to be able to look at that watch on your wrist without thinking about your hands-…” but she didn’t finish the sentence, Agatha had closed the distance again and was devouring her in a way that told Rio that Agatha was needy too, desperate to have more of her before they had to go back.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t allow the kiss for long. She was already pulling back and pressing her thigh between her legs as she dipped down to kiss along Rio’s jaw.</p><p>“I don’t want to share you today. I want you just here, with me. Naked and desperate.”</p><p>Rio laughed a husky, breathy laugh as the words settled in her lower abdomen and she stretched her neck out to allow Agatha more access, feeling her teeth scrape against her sensitive skin, her hips chasing the gentle pressure of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“I’m not sure… I’m not sure I can provide that…”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything and instead nipped lightly at Rio’s pulse point, her hands slipping beneath her shirt to palm at her breast.</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, and just as she was about to begin rocking for hips harder, seeking more, a loud voice reverberated around the room as a fist banged on the door.</p><p>“Enough fucking! I can’t stand either of you. So fucking loud. Hurry up and come downstairs.”</p><p>Jen’s voice began to fade as she walked away from the door, clearly convinced her reprimand would be enough or else fearful she might hear more of what she already didn’t like.</p><p>Agatha huffed an annoyed breath out against Rio’s throat and Rio could feel the tension in her hands where she still clutched her, her own body tense and tight from the surprise of the shout.</p><p>“If we were alone on a beach that wouldn’t have happened.”</p><p>But the reminder of Jen existing. Of the hands now against her and the body on top of hers having once been in the same position with a woman Agatha <em>loved</em> brought Rio crashing back down to earth.</p><p>She bit down on her lip and felt Agatha shift above her, more atuned to her body than Rio was to even her own.</p><p>“I want you,” Agatha said softly, with no dominance or snark in her voice anymore, her gaze now much gentler as she removed her hand from Rio’s chest and instead cupped her cheek, “in every way there is to want a person. In ways I’ve never wanted anyone else before. I want you. And only you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart stuttered in a way her hips had earlier and she sucked in a sharp breath, feeling as though something were constricting at her throat again, though Agatha’s touch was on her face once more.</p><p>Her brow furrowed slightly and she watched for any sign of hesitance, any sign of a trick, and as always when reading Agatha’s feelings for her: she saw nothing but truth.</p><p>And so she nodded, her gaze dropping to Agatha’s lips in a silent request for her to close the distance between them. She did, and they pressed their lips together firmly, moving them languidly until Agatha’s tongue pried open Rio’s mouth and she tasted her again, feeling that fire from before begin to spark up.</p><p>When Agatha pulled away, Rio couldn’t catch her breath, her body still sparking in every way it could as she stared wide-eyed up at the woman above her.</p><p>As her chest heaved, Agatha shifted on top of her, adjusting her weight so she wasn’t so pressed against Rio and could lift a little off of her upper body.</p><p>“I think,” she started slowly, one hand now toying with Rio’s shirt buttons. “I think we should stay here. Just us. All day.”</p><p>Rio came to life a little more and eyed Agatha with a small smile, “We have to go.”</p><p>Huffing and shaking her head, Agatha flopped to her back with a groan. “God, I hate everybody that isn’t you.”</p><p>“You don’t,” Rio reassured as she rolled over to press a quick kiss to Agatha’s cheek. “They’re your family and we should be with them.”</p><p>Agatha actually threw her fist down onto the mattress in a move that reminded Rio of an overgrown toddler and Rio had to bite down on her lip to stop herself from laughing.</p><p>“I’ll make it up to you tonight.”</p><p>Eventually, after a little more convincing, Rio managed to get Agatha to go through to the bathroom with her and take a shower.</p><p>What she wasn’t able to do was convince Agatha that she had to focus on getting clean rather than touching Rio all over, now that she had full access to her body, wet and naked as it was.</p><p>It took another half an hour before they were both presentable again, Rio in a new Christmas jumper that said ‘Feliz Navidad, Bitchachos’ and Agatha in a deep green cashmere sweater that Rio had bought for her just two weeks ago.</p><p>The reception for them was mixed when they arrived downstairs.</p><p>Alice was smirking and Jen looked disgusted. Lilia hadn’t noticed their arrival, too busy flicking through a tarot deck for Billy on the floor and Billy only glanced up with a sheepish but warm smile that Rio readily returned and Agatha didn’t even notice.</p><p>By the time Rio was settled in on the couch again, overseeing the tarot reading, she’d forgotten (mostly) about Agatha’s belief about Natasha, as well as the knowledge that Agatha had slept with another person in this room.</p><p>The rest of the day was spent lounging around, with the dinner already halfway to being cooked - Agatha had ordered all the best food, already prepared by a chef, and just needing heated up for the day. The Turkey had been basted and prepared by Lilia earlier that morning and was roasting slowly in the oven.</p><p>The house smelled like a mixture of cinnamon and firewood as Agatha prepped the fire, lighting it for atmosphere and because she knew Rio’s favourite spot was in front of it, like a cat warming its back on a cold winters day.</p><p>There were discussions and conversations happening between various parties all day. Agatha and Jen were mostly at each other’s throats but the laughter interspersed with the verbal jousting added to the cozy, convivial atmosphere.</p><p>Rio spent most of her day either sitting by Agatha and contributing to her lofty discussions on politics and business with Jen and Lilia or on the floor with Alice and Billy talking sports, London, and pop culture.</p><p>But it was after the fifth bottle of wine was brought out after a luxurious and filling dinner by a slightly wavy Billy that Jen asked the question that might as well have killed Rio Vidal:</p><p>“So. The anticipation is killing me. You bought her a ring with diamonds but not a diamond ring. When will this proposal <em>actually</em> happen? Because I’ve got a hefty bet saying it’ll be before the new year. When will you become the Harknesses?”</p><p>“Vidals.”</p><p>The response was gentle, measured, not quite a whisper but certainly not meant to make the whole room stop and Rio to almost have a stroke.</p><p>“Vidals?” Jen asked in confusion, “What-…?”</p><p>“We’d be the Vidals,” Agatha announced, her chin raised a little and her gaze still only on Jen.</p><p>“I-…” Jen started in confusion and turned to Alice who looked like she wanted to cry.</p><p>Rio’s jaw had gone a little slack and she was studying Agatha’s profile, willing her to turn around and look at her. But she didn’t. She barely moved.</p><p>“But with Wanda you didn’t take her name and she didn’t take yours.”</p><p>Lilia spoke up then, her gaze landing on a still shocked Rio, “This isn’t Wanda.”</p><p>Rio’s brain was working overtime to try and understand what had just happened. All day, ever since they’d arrived in fact, everyone had been making small comments and subtle hints that Agatha and her should get, and would soon be, married.</p><p>But she hadn’t yet discussed it with Agatha and had dismissed it as her friends having fun, ribbing her. But this, this, this meant that Agatha had thought about it. Had <em>considered</em> it. Had <em>planned</em> it.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and shifted for the first time, moving around in her seat where she suddenly felt uncomfortable and when she looked back up Agatha was watching her carefully.</p><p>Her blue eyes were hooded and sleepy from where she’d spent the better part of the day drinking, but they were clear, and sure.</p><p>“I’d keep my name professionally but in private, at home, I’d be Vidal.”</p><p>“If,” she said, a little more quietly, “it were offered to me.”</p><p>Rio frowned then, at least a few synapses firing in her brain as she watched this beautiful moron stare across at her like there was even a slim chance that either a) Rio wouldn’t want to marry her or b) she wouldn’t be screaming from the rooftops that Agatha was proudly bearing her name.</p><p>“I-…” but her voice failed her and her head twitched slightly, her mouth making movement but no sound and for a brief second, hesitation and heartbreak fell to Agatha’s features.</p><p>But Jen had spoken again.</p><p>“So… are we getting an answer? This is happening?”</p><p>Agatha had turned away from Rio then and her jaw was set, “No. Not.”</p><p>Rio felt a panic settle low in her stomach at this and cleared her throat as she found her voice again, “I want to marry you.”</p><p>Her voice was a little squeaky, like a prepubescent boy whose balls had just started to drop and her eyes went wide as everyone, including Agatha, turned to stare at her. But she’d said it. She’d made herself clear.</p><p>And exactly like a prepubescent boy she suddenly felt juvenile, mortified. Like she’d just got her first boner in class.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched ever so slightly and she watched Rio with a steady gaze, torn between amusement and confusion as Alice spoke then: “Of course you do! It’s in the cards, right Lilia?”</p><p>“I believe these two are tied together, yes.”</p><p>Alice looked triumphant then and raised her brows at Jen, “Less than a year and getting married. Why did we take so long?”</p><p>Jen scoffed and tugged Alice closer to her at the table, “Because <em>we</em> needed time to set businesses up and to grow our careers. This one is already the queen of Washington and-…” but she seemed to realise what she was saying and shot Rio a genuinely apologetic look, “Sorry, Rio.”</p><p>Rio, still reeling from her mortifying clarification earlier just smiled tightly and shook her head, her new ring tapping lightly on her glass.</p><p>Agatha’s hand reached out to her then and she tucked it around Rio’s thigh, not saying anything but letting her know it was okay.</p><p>Rio began chewing on her lip, still embarrassed and unable to shake the confusion in her brain. Did Agatha want to marry her? Would it be soon? Was she just humouring her friends so they’d shut up about it?</p><p>Agatha noticed the tension in Rio’s body and moved her hand away from her thigh and to the side of her chair, tugging her closer and then moving her hand back to her thigh to tug her even closer, forcing her to shift across the gap now closed between their chairs.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down at Agatha’s hand on her leg and hesitated before she covered it with her own.</p><p>The conversation continued around the table as Rio began to spiral in her own mind.</p><p>Agatha Vidal.</p><p>Agatha and Rio Vidal.</p><p>Mrs and Mrs Vidal.</p><p>The Vidals.</p><p>A slight movement beside her was what pulled her from her thoughts and she looked to her side to see Agatha watching her closely, her fingers flexing against her thigh.</p><p>“Rio and I will tidy up. You all go through.”</p><p>She stood from her seat and already began to reach for plates, but Billy stood quickly too as if to help, “Let me!”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said sharply, and Billy winced.</p><p>“Geez, Agatha. Relax. We’ll leave you alone to talk to your girl. But if you goddamn propose without me here I will kill you. That’s social media gold.”</p><p>Agatha huffed but ran a hand through her hair as everyone began to move and Rio stood to continue piling the dishes up.</p><p>“Leave it,” Agatha said in a voice much softer than the one she’d just used on Billy.</p><p>Rio glanced up at her and saw in Agatha’s eyes that she looked concerned. A gentle touch to her elbow told her that Alice had just left the room and they were now alone.</p><p>“I just wanted to be clear earlier. I meant that-…”</p><p>Agatha bit down on her lip and sank back down to her chair, sitting sideways on it and gazing up at Rio with that same look, “I shouldn’t have announced that I’d take your name.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly, suddenly concerned that Agatha was taking it back. “I, uh,” but Agatha had taken her hands from where she was sitting and was looking up at her with that same look of concern and she forgot what she was about to say.</p><p>“Harkness has never meant much to me, with my mother… but your family, <em>you</em> being my family…”</p><p>Rio felt her mouth go dry again and she cleared her throat, unsure what to even say to this.</p><p>“I’m going to ask Jen to stop talking about it.”</p><p>Rio could only nod at this, her brow furrowing just a little as she let Agatha hold her hands.</p><p>Agatha was shutting it down. Shutting her down. But she couldn’t argue it. They weren’t ready to talk about marriage. Were they?</p><p>So she continued to nod even as Agatha stood slowly and took one of her hands to cup Rio’s cheek and stop her movements. “Go get comfortable and I’ll bring the wine.”</p><p>Rio nodded again and then before Agatha could lean in to kiss her she pulled away and went to find a seat in the living room.</p><p>The corner of the large couch was available closest to the Christmas tree that dominated the bay window.</p><p>So Rio sat there, curling her legs up beneath herself and waiting for Agatha to come back through. Alice gave her a soft smile and raised her brows in question but Rio just shook her head slightly and went back to chewing on her lip.</p><p>Five minutes later, when the conversation in the room had moved onto Jen and Alice’s next big holiday, Agatha finally appeared.</p><p>She carried with her two bottles of red and placed them on the coffee table before she went to take a seat by Rio, moving to take her legs up and sit beneath them. The hand that rested on Rio’s upper thigh was wearing her watch and Rio glanced down at the sight, counting the seconds as they ticked by and watching the way Agatha’s fingers tapped at her thigh.</p><p>She felt an odd mixture of completely thrown and totally comforted. Agatha had considered marrying her, clearly even before her friends had decided to bet on it and Lilia had drawn cards, but it wasn’t something she’d ever discussed with her.</p><p>And Rio, hadn’t really ever entertained the idea.</p><p>Agatha had been married before and been so burned by it that she’d never considered that she’d want to again. And Rio had never considered herself to be someone who <em>would</em> get married. Her job for one thing made dating something that had to be deprioritised and in the back of her mind she’d always thought <em>well who would want to marry an old, retired hooker?</em>.</p><p>But Rio had no problem with marriage. Had no real issue with being legally and publicly bound to somebody else.</p><p>To Agatha.</p><p>As her mind drifted to matching rings and the image of Agatha in white, with eyes only for her, she got a fright when Jen announced her name loudly and felt the room turn to look at her expectantly.</p><p>“What? I was…”</p><p>“Thinking about your girl, yes we know. Practically drooling.”</p><p>Rio frowned and surreptitiously wiped at her mouth, just in case.</p><p>“I was just saying that despite our issues it’s actually quite sweet to see you having tamed the beast.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this and a large smile cracked her features as she turned to look at the beast in question, seeing her scowl.</p><p>“Beast is a bit strong,” Rio cooed as she raised a hand to brush two fingers along Agatha’s cheek. The hand on her thigh squeezed a little but Agatha only had eyes for Jen and she continued to scowl, “And with what poor Alice has to put up with? Rich, Jen. Very rich.”</p><p>Jen just laughed and threw her hand out at Agatha as if to bat her away but the conversation turned then to more inane chat; half the room half a sleep and the other half not far behind.</p><p>It wasn’t long later that Rio found herself curled up beside her beast in bed, pressing close into her and breathing in the her girlfriend’s familiar perfume.</p><p>“Thank you for putting up with them today.”</p><p>The whisper was so soft, and Rio was so tired, that she almost missed it. But it came with such gravity that she forced herself to focus in, pushing back to blink at Agatha.</p><p>“I didn’t put up with them. I enjoyed them.”</p><p>Agatha kept silent for a few seconds before she spoke again, “I think they all like you more than they like me.”</p><p>“Impossible,” Rio breathed as she moved to press a soft kiss to Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>Agatha just hummed softly as Rio spoke again, stifling a yawn, “Go to sleep.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t protest this and turned more towards Rio, brushing her lips at her temple as she settled.</p><p>Sleep took them both slowly, then all at once. And their first Christmas Day ended in each other’s arms, Rio dreaming of soft white silk and Agatha dreaming of the same.</p><p>The next morning came around all too quickly for Rio’s liking. But she wasn’t woken by a familiar touch of hands or lips but instead by a gentle but unknown hand that shook her shoulder where she slept in the middle of the bed, starfished out like she’d been washed ashore.</p><p>“Rio. Rio, wake up. Agatha needs you.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, words not quite making sense in the hazy morning light as she rubbed at her eyes.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Huffing a soft breath, Rio turned slowly to blink up at Lilia Calderu, concerned in her shawls at the edge of the bed.</p><p>“Agatha needs you,” she repeated more firmly this time.</p><p>The words hit this time. Rio frowned deeply and began to shuffle inelegantly from under the blankets and covers, sliding to the edge of the bed beside Lilia, “What’s wrong? Is she okay?”</p><p>“You’ll see.”</p><p>Rio followed Lilia down with the thickness of sleep still settled in her bones and the panic of Agatha’s unknown plight settled in her chest.</p><p>But she didn’t need to wait long to hear what could be the cause of it.</p><p>Jen.</p><p>As they reached the first landing, Rio could hear Jen’s voice, distorted and muffled through the walls and ceilings, but distinct for its volume.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>“The ties that bind,” Lilia said quietly.</p><p>Rio slipped past Lilia and ran the rest of the way, following the voice through to Agatha’s office where she barged in to a scene already in full swing.</p><p>“You can’t fucking do this!” Jen was screaming.</p><p>Alice was beside her, half holding her arms out to guard her and half to stop her from launching at Agatha, who stood back against her desk, watching Jen with an unreadable expression.</p><p>Other than the shouting, the first thing she noticed was that she was the only one not dressed for the day. Though judging by Billy’s messy hair and hangdog expression it looked like he too had been dragged out of bed.</p><p>But blue eyes had fallen to her as she’d entered the room and Rio noticed Agatha’s throat bob as she gulped and adjusted her position against the desk.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s happened?”</p><p>Rio moved quickly to Agatha’s side, keeping her eyes on her girlfriend and her back to the still furious Jen.</p><p>“She’s sold my fucking company!”</p><p>Rio’s hand froze in midair where she’d raised her fingers to Agatha’s cheek and she looked completely taken aback as she turned to catch sight of Jen, watching her with a deep frown.</p><p>“I didn’t. <em>Listen</em> to me. I’ve done everything and sorted it all so all you need to do-…”</p><p>“You fucking ruthless bitch. How could you? How did you even-…?”</p><p>But Jen’s words died on her tongue and she suddenly looked like she’d seen a ghost, her gaze sweeping suddenly across to Billy.</p><p>“You son of a bitch. You gave her my financials.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped at the sight of the boy cowering up against the bookshelf, looking paler than she’d ever seen him and she made a move to go to him but Agatha had grabbed her wrist and shook her head no.</p><p>“I-… I-…”</p><p>“You’re fucking fired you little traitor.”</p><p>“Jen,” Alice said urgently, her hovering hands now working their way to Jen’s arms, “Jen. Listen to Agatha. What’s she’s saying makes-…”</p><p>“No!” Jen screamed, winding her arms around to knock her wife’s hands off of her, “No. I have worked and worked for this-…”</p><p>“You fucked yourself when you went into business with her,” Agatha explained, her voice steady but her lip quivering ever so slightly, for only Rio to notice.</p><p>“I’m just unfucking it for you.”</p><p>“You <em>cannot</em> sell my company.”</p><p>“I know. You need to do it. You need to sign the papers.”</p><p>Jen released a cry that was somewhere between a scream and a yell and threw her hands up again, making as if to strangle Agatha but not moving from where she stood.</p><p>“I am trying to protect you.”</p><p>“You are trying to be in control! Trying to be the big saviour! The big ‘I am’!”</p><p>Agatha took in a slow breath and shifted where she stood, “Jennifer. If you don’t sell you will be ruined.”</p><p>Jen just scoffed and shook her head in disgust. “I see it now. I see why she cheated and why you had to pay to get someone to be with you. Agatha Harkness has power over everyone. But not me. You have no power over me! Fuck you and fuck your contract.”</p><p>“Jen,” Alice pleaded even as Rio stepped in front of Agatha and was pulled back by the same hand still on her wrist.</p><p>“No. Fuck this. Fuck her.”</p><p>Jen stormed from the room then, leaving a shocked silence behind her and an unsure, torn Alice who turned to look at Agatha. “She didn’t mean-…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha said with none of her usual verve. “Go after her.”</p><p>Alice turned on her heel and left.</p><p>Rio’s first concern was for Agatha and she turned around to see that blue eyes had filled with tears and her face was slowly, painfully crumbling in on itself. But Agatha pushed her away as she went to cradle her cheeks and turned from her to take a seat at her desk.</p><p>“I’m fine. Take Billy. I have work to do.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio insisted with a frown, moving around to her but a hand was held up and Agatha kept her gaze away from Rio, staring intently at her laptop instead.</p><p>“Please, Rio.”</p><p>Hesitating, and reluctant, Rio turned away from the devastated woman at her desk and moved instead to Billy. She took his hand gently and guided the shell-shocked man from the room, meeting Lilia in the hall looking stern.</p><p>“Tea,” Lilia said quickly, “Tea with honey. You’re in shock.”</p><p>Rio nodded and guided Billy to the kitchen to fetch them all just that.</p><p>The rest of the house was still and silent and Rio knew that Jen and Alice had disappeared into the cold day. Her mind was going a mile a minute as she poured the hot tea out. She’d caught half the story. Half the accusations. But she didn’t understand anything past Agatha trying to sell Jen’s company and the inevitable witch that was always at the centre of everything: Wanda.</p><p>She forced herself to gulp down her still too-hot tea before she eventually went back to Agatha’s office to seek out the devastated woman holed up in there.</p><p>She didn’t knock when she entered, having got used to being allowed in whenever she wanted to see Agatha, talk to her, be near her.</p><p>But this time she wasn’t welcomed in.</p><p>“It’s fine, Rio. I have things to do.”</p><p>“No,” Rio insisted softly, already moving around to Agatha’s side of the desk and turning her chair to look down at her properly.</p><p>“Tell me. What just happened?”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and closed her eyes as she gathered herself. Her posture had been rigid when Rio walked in but now her shoulders slumped and she rubbed at her eyes in frustration.</p><p>“Jen fucked herself when she took that bitch’s money. I don’t know why she did it. The promise of connections, I don’t know. Wanda got into her head and I told her not to I told her-…”</p><p>She trailed off and sighed as she raised her gaze to Rio’s concerned face.</p><p>“She holds a minority stake in the company. But it’s enough to cause Jen a hell of a lot of issues when-…”</p><p>She stopped herself and shook her head slightly, “Wanda is in bed with a lot of bad people. When it comes out… when <em>I</em> make sure it comes out… everyone that’s connected to her will be fucked too. So I’ve found Jen a buyer. Negotiated a good deal. Done everything I needed to ensure that all she needs to do is sign on the dotted line and she can slip away from this all without losing everything. If I’ve played it right, and I know I have, she’ll be able to start again. No ties to Wanda. Everything intact.”</p><p>As Agatha spoke Rio ached for the weight that the woman before her must have been carrying on her shoulders - of the pains she’d gone through to protect not only Rio but Jen and by extension Alice too. And as she ruminated on this she grew impossibly more angry at Jen for having thrown it back in her face, for having slapped Agatha with her accusations earlier, for having been so cruel and demeaning.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said softly, reaching to caress her cheek and watching as Agatha closed her eyes and leant into her touch.</p><p>But how could she possibly tell this woman how incredible she was. How much she loved her. How much she wanted to protect her from everything she was so stubbornly and vehemently taking on herself?</p><p>So she moved closer and Agatha’s eyes flickered open, her hands seeking the backs of Rio’s knees to knock them in and pull her into her lap. Rio followed her and settled on top of her, cradling her face gently in her hands. “I love you. So much. None of what Jen said-…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha murmured softly, her hands squeezing gently at Rio’s hips as she tugged her closer.</p><p>“What you’re doing for me… for your friends…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said again, her gaze now drifting to Rio’s lips even as she continued to look tired, defeated.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio insisted, worried that Agatha wasn’t really listening or that she didn’t believe what she was trying to say.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said again, shaking her head as she leant up to brush her lips over Rio’s, seeking comfort from having her so close.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly but pressed her lips back to Agatha’s with a frown still across her features. “I want you to listen. I want you to know that I love-…”</p><p>Agatha shook her head a little and kissed Rio again, pulling her impossibly closer.</p><p>“Marry me. Be mine. Marry me.”</p><p>Rio pulled back slowly, blinking down at Agatha stupidly, watching as those blue eyes darted about her own face, watching Rio’s reaction closely.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured solemnly, unsure she’d heard correctly or if Agatha were simply teasing her, trying to avoid the reassurance that Rio was trying desperately to give.</p><p>But Agatha only held her firmly, her fingers tight against her hips and her eyes unwavering as they looked into Rio’s.</p><p>“Marry me.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>Agatha shook her head again, her gaze suddenly desperate as she held Rio so tightly she knew she’d have finger marks on her later. “Please. Please. Marry me.”</p><p>Rio’s reaction, her heart suddenly so full, was to laugh. Her cheeks flushing a soft pink as the reality of what was happening slowly sunk in.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha’s frown of concern, her tense features and worried eyes seemed to disappear then, her whole body relaxing and her hold on Rio softening just slightly as she gazed up at her with slight surprise. “Okay?”</p><p>Rio laughed again, a proper, true belly laugh as she began to grin, “Yes. Yes! I’ll marry you.”</p><p>Rio’s laughter took a while to make it to Agatha’s face but when it did she caught it readily, and laughed too, capturing Rio’s own joy against her mouth as she pressed their lips together and kissed her through it.</p><p>By the time they pulled apart all the stress and pain from the morning was forgotten and Agatha was grinning against Rio’s lips, pressing herself as close as physically possible.</p><p>“Fucking Lilia and her fucking cards. I wanted to do it when all this was over. When we could just… be.”</p><p>Rio hummed in amusement and kissed Agatha quickly, as if her mouth had some sort of gravitational pull and she weren’t able to keep from it for long, “So you did plan on proposing soon? You’re not just… doing it because Lilia predicted you would?”</p><p>“I hate being told what to do.”</p><p>“Only sometimes.”</p><p>Agatha huffed quietly and kissed Rio again, her hands darting to her lower back, “I'll get you a ring. The biggest, most expensive one. Whatever you want.”</p><p>“I don’t care about that. I just want you.”</p><p>In their little bubble, the two of them remained for another hour or so, before Agatha’s hands started to roam and Rio was incapable of denying her now fiancée. They fucked slowly, languidly in the chair, against the desk, on the floor, and for the sake of Lilia and a still distraught Billy down the hall, Rio managed to control her own volume and made a point to control Agatha’s too.</p><p>By the time they were out of breath, with a light sheen of sweat against their bodies, on the floor beside Agatha’s large oak desk, Rio couldn’t think of a time when she’d been happier.</p><p>At some point between the first and third location, Agatha had moved Rio’s new ring to her left hand as a symbolic gesture that made Rio’s heart sing and her pulse race even more than it already was.</p><p>But the reality was that Billy was nearby and needed support and Agatha would eventually have to face up to whatever Jen still had left to give her when she eventually returned - if she ever did.</p><p>And so they reluctantly agreed to go their separate ways: Agatha to find Billy and Lilia and Rio to shower and change.</p><p>By the time Rio came back down to the living room her new position as a fiancée had settled in and she toyed with the ring now on her left hand ring finger.</p><p>Billy was the first to greet her with a small smile but a large hug and a whispered, “I’m so happy for you.”</p><p>Lilia was quick to offer her congratulations not long after but something told Rio that she hadn’t needed to be told by Agatha and that she’d already known. <em>Spooky bitch.</em></p><p>And finally, Agatha drew up the rear, pulling Rio into a warm and familiar hug as she whispered, “Billy was crying and this news was the only thing that’s shut him up.”</p><p>Rio’s heart clenched at this confession and she pulled from Agatha to turn back to the boy, offering him her hand, “Jen will come around.”</p><p>“She won’t.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and hardened as she went to sit back on the couch. “She will if she knows what’s good for her.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and went to sit beside Agatha, keeping her gaze on Billy. “Alice will talk her down.”</p><p>But Billy didn’t look reassured and Rio spent the majority of the rest of the day trying to distract him whilst desperately wanting to be alone with Agatha to languish in their shared joy.</p><p>Around 10pm, Rio was sprawled on the floor by the fire, leaning over a 1,000 piece jigsaw with Billy, diligently placing pieces to create the frame for what would eventually be a picture of the colosseum.</p><p>Agatha was working on her laptop on the couch, her glasses perched on her nose and her eyes darting every so often to watch Rio as she concentrated on the task at hand.</p><p>Lilia was engrossed in a book on tarot, unaware of her surroundings as she twirled a grey curl between her fingers.</p><p>But they all looked up at the sound of the front door opening and Rio sat immediately to move to Agatha’s side, watching as a frowning Alice and then a sheepish Jen walked in the room.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said cautiously, her eyes flickering from Alice to Jen and back again.</p><p>Alice smiled tightly but had turned to nudge her wife more into the room and Rio watched as a very stiff and uncomfortable Jen moved a few steps in, her body turned to Agatha but her eyes looking anywhere but.</p><p>“What I said earlier. I’m sorry for it.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows in surprise at this and glanced to her side as Agatha moved to push the laptop from her lap and to the couch beside her.</p><p>“I know you were trying to help. And I know I shouldn’t have gone into business with Wanda in the first place.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent.</p><p>“And…” Jen shifted where she stood and Alice went to take her hand, “And if you can, I’d like you to still facilitate the sale.”</p><p>“Well fuck, Jen, sound more grateful than that.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned softly but turned to see Agatha smirking slightly, her demeanour teasing rather than cruel.</p><p>“I have conditions,” Jen said suddenly, only willing to give so much.</p><p>“Firstly, you have to hire Billy back. He’s obsessed with you and I can’t trust him not to go running to you with whatever you ask him for again.”</p><p>Rio looked over at Billy who looked suddenly pale again and saw that he was toying with a piece of the puzzle nervously.</p><p>“Secondly, when I set up my next company. And I will. You are going to fund it. Minority stakes, obviously. But no more of this ‘I don’t fund personal vanity projects’ shit anymore. You’re funding it.”</p><p>Agatha shifted a little.</p><p>“Thirdly, I want you to destroy her.”</p><p>At this, Agatha released a bark of a laugh and Rio raised her brows in surprise.</p><p>“The third thing is easy. The other two…”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes at this and was about to say something when Alice spoke up. “Wait.”</p><p>She moved closer and narrowed her eyes at the sight of Rio’s left hand on Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“Why is your ring on your…?”</p><p>Everyone in the room turned to look at the ring in question and Rio smirked a little as she caught Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>“You <em>bitch</em>. I told you to wait. That would have killed on the gram.”</p><p>But Jen’s protests were drowned out by the scream that Alice released as she ran at the two horrified women on the couch.</p>

<p>The unassuming envelope lay in wait on the bedside table for the sleeping woman in the plush bed of the large townhouse in Washington D.C.</p><p>It had been placed there by another hand not an hour ago, by the other woman who usually occupied the California king beside her sleeping partner.</p><p>But patient this envelope was not, and as the morning sun began to hit its peak, an uninvited breeze blew through the opened window and knocked the envelope on its back.</p><p>The material was thick and expensive and the subsequent <em>thwack</em> on the oak side table was enough to jostle the sleeping woman from her dreams.</p><p>Rio woke with a groan and rubbed at her eyes, blinking into the morning sun to see that she was once again alone.</p><p>Since the day they’d become engaged Rio had been seeing progressively less and less of her new fiancée, and it wasn’t unusual for her to fall into bed alone and wake up just the same.</p><p>Agatha was now in the thick of campaign planning and rarely spent a night at home anymore. She’d holed herself up in a small office in the depths of the Capitol building, keeping Billy up and working until all hours of the morning to pore over Stark’s commitments, his stances, his speeches.</p><p>And Rio, she’d pined only for the first few days, making the mistake of watching a pot and expecting it to boil. But after a week or so of expecting Agatha to suddenly have a freer schedule, she’d begun to fill her own.</p><p>Rio now had interviews lined up, some job offers thrown her way that she debated on and sifted through, a new team she was slowly building a rapport with, and a packed diary of teaching classes at the local gym and travelling back and forth to New York - something she sometimes managed to tie in with Agatha’s visits so they at least had the length of a car ride to be together (though often with Billy, much to Agatha’s annoyance).</p><p>It wasn’t uncommon for Rio to wake up a few nights a week in the early hours of the morning with Agatha draped over her and snoring softly in her ear. And she’d wake up a few hours later and with the ghost of Agatha’s warm body still lingering but her fiancée gone.</p><p>They’d fallen into the kind of intimacy that only comes when one is never available and the other is often absent. They caught snippets of time together, snapshots of evenings, weekends, days. Agatha was often tired and Rio was often lonely.</p><p>Rio opened the envelope and found an invitation printed on thick red card.</p><p>——</p><p>

</p><p>——</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at the suggestion that anyone donating $50,000 to Stark could be considered a ‘Hero’.</p><p>The one benefit of seeing less of Agatha was that discussions, and fights, about Tony’s run were fewer and far between. Only once since Christmas had they fallen out after a particularly egregious (to Rio) speech from Stark at the Mexican border where he was speaking to reporters when a man seeking refuge on American soil had been detained before the cameras.</p><p>Agatha had been present for the whole thing and after it had been televised had Rio called her to give her what for.</p><p>“I want you to pull out. Quit.”</p><p>“Honey…”</p><p>“Don’t ‘honey’ me, Agatha. I saw what he said to that man as he was being wrestled to the ground: ‘Land of the free, home of the documented, my friend’.” Rio immigrated Stark’s masculine vibrato. “He’s a cunt and you should know better.”</p><p>“We’ve discussed this-…”</p><p>“Yes, as you keep saying but actually all you’ve done is told me you have to do it and I just don’t think that’s true anymore. It’s not good enough for me.”</p><p>Agatha had remained silent for a while and Rio could practically hear her thoughts swirling, “It doesn’t have to be good enough for you. It just is what it is.”</p><p>“You can’t even argue it! You can’t even defend-…!”</p><p>“Rio, Stark is all bluster. He’s an arrogant asshole with an inflated ego who is appealing to the lowest-…”</p><p>“And you’re the one trying to make him King.”</p><p>An article had been published in The Times not a week prior titled: ‘<em>Agatha Harkness: King Maker’</em> detailing Agatha’s career thus far and focusing on her key role in the Stark Campaign that was thundering ahead of every other candidate in the opinion polls.</p><p>Agatha had not been pleased but Rio had been incandescent.</p><p>“His politics aren’t the same as his voters. He’s appealing to-…”</p><p>“I don’t care who he’s appealing to. I care that you’re standing by and supporting him as he spews all this bullshit that actually impacts peoples lives.”</p><p>“I’m back tomorrow night. Can we discuss it then?”</p><p>When they hung up they didn’t speak again until Agatha had arrived through the front door just after midnight looking tired and resigned.</p><p>Rio had gone easier on her than she meant to because of this. But they’d stayed up until 3am debating back and forth, arguing the point that Rio saw so clearly and that Agatha refused to back down on: Agatha had to quit.</p><p>The argument had been long and cyclical, with Rio bringing up the same facts over and over again: they were engaged, they were public, she didn’t care who knew about her past, and they both had enough friends and money that they would be fine, protected.</p><p>But Agatha was insistent that for now, at least, she continue to push Stark towards the White House.</p><p>And so the argument ended like it always did; pausing for a brief reprieve until the next time.</p><p>Rio hadn’t expected to be invited to this particular campaign fundraiser but knew Agatha had been working on it for a while now. Billy had clearly taken it upon himself to invite Rio specifically, thinking she deserved an invitation as more than just Agatha’s plus one, and whilst she was flattered that he’d gone to the effort it hadn’t exactly filled her with joy.</p><p>By the time she was showered and dressed for the day, she was feeling a little more relaxed about it, at least relaxed enough to discuss it with Agatha without getting mad.</p><p>9:03am<br/>
Rio Vidal: I got Billy’s invite. Does he just want someone sane to talk to amongst the republicans or did you sanction my being on the guest list?</p><p>9:07am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I requested it.</p><p>9:11am<br/>
Rio Vidal: That so?</p><p>9:13am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Every donation counts.</p><p>9:15am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Not funny.</p><p>9:27am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Pepper has been dying to meet you and I’d like you there with me.</p><p>9:34am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Could have asked the old fashioned way.</p><p>10:15am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Wasn’t waking up to a mysterious envelope kind of sexy?</p><p>10:18am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Not when it contains the words ‘Stark for President’</p><p>10:34am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Point taken. Will you come?</p><p>10:42am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Don’t I always</p><p>10:43am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I make sure of it. Speaking of: I should be home earlier tonight and I’ve missed you…</p><p>10:57am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Then make sure you are and you can show me exactly how much you’ve missed me.</p><p>Rio smirked to herself as she sent the last text off knowing that Agatha would make sure she was home early and make sure she knew she was missed.</p><p>She called Natasha then, trying still to force something that had never had to be forced before. Natasha had been distant since she’d left for Washington and had barely spoken to her since then. Rio had called every day, had text when Natasha wouldn’t pick up, and had even gone to her empty apartment to see her whenever she was back in the city. But either Natasha was telling the truth and she genuinely was very busy or she simply didn’t want to see Rio.</p><p>The latter option was so untenable to Rio that she didn’t often let herself think on it and instead, rightly or wrongly, continued to contact Natasha whenever she could.</p><p>Agatha’s belief that Natasha was in love with her had settled itself like a virus in Rio’s blood stream, infecting every part of her slowly but insidiously turning her mind to what could be the reality: Agatha was right, Natasha was in love with her.</p><p>But she’d not asked her. Never brought it up. Even when she did manage to get Natasha on the phone she was short, clipped, monosyllabic.</p><p>The day the invitation came through was no different.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“How are you? I’ve been trying to call the past few days.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’ve been busy.”</p><p>“Too busy to text or call me back?”</p><p>“Evidently.”</p><p>“Nat. Talk to me.”</p><p>“Rio, I don’t have a lot of time. What is it?”</p><p>Rio only sighed and rubbed the back of her neck.</p><p>“Fine. If you want to be this way then… I’ll be back in the city the weekend of the 23rd. I’m coming to stay on the Friday. If you don’t show up then fine. I’m not chasing anymore. So if you’re not there I’ll have my answer.”</p><p>There was silence on the end of the line and Rio couldn’t help but draw a parallel to so many calls she’d had recently with Agatha. How both Natasha and her fiancée were similar in so many ways: stubborn, arrogant, infuriating, softer for her.</p><p>“I’ll be home.”</p><p>“Good. I want to talk to you properly.”</p><p>“I look forward to it.”</p><p>“Shut up. I’ll call you tomorrow.”</p><p>“Cuídate, Rio.” <em>Look after yourself, Rio</em></p><p>With that, Rio had her last proper conversation with Natasha until their inevitable chat when she arrived at her apartment.</p><p>The days turned to weeks and Rio saw even less of Agatha, spoke even less to her best friend, and focused instead on her little life in the suburbs of D.C. where she thrived where she could and wallowed when she couldn’t.</p><p>It was mid-afternoon the day before the big fundraiser that Rio and Agatha had time together: time that Agatha had promised to be cell phone free and Billy free, with the poor boy sent up on the Amtrak to give the two women time alone in the back of Agatha’s sleek sedan.</p><p>“Consider it,” Agatha said with a slight frown, watching Rio closely for any sign her request might be the cause of another, actual, argument.</p><p>“It’s just ridiculous. I go back and forth to the gym and the park and that’s about it.”</p><p>“Exactly. A pattern. An easy to pick up-…”</p><p>“Agatha. No one has any interest in me, let alone to kidnap me.”</p><p>“It’ll be one of Alice’s guys. Discreet but there if you need him. Can you just consider it?”</p><p>Knowing she wouldn’t get anywhere with this and reluctant to spend the little amount of time together they had that day arguing again, Rio just nodded and huffed out a breath.</p><p>“Fine. But he better be good chat or I’m firing him myself.”</p><p>“You’d never,” Agatha accused with a devilish grin that belied her relief at Rio agreeing to let her get her security. She squeezed Rio’s foot that lay over her lap and briefly picked at the sock that she recognised as cashmere and as stolen from her own drawer. “You couldn’t fire someone if you tried.”</p><p>“That,” Rio said with a scowl, wriggling her toes in protest, “Is so fucking rude. I fired Billy the other day.”</p><p>“He’s not yours to fire and as much as I’d love it to be, beating you at scrabble isn’t a firable offence.”</p><p>“You fired him because he got you decaf.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and began to massage Rio’s foot, pressing in firmly in all the places she knew Rio liked. “I hired him right back when he corrected his mistake.”</p><p>Rio was sprawled out on the back bench of the car, propped up a little bit with her legs stretched and across Agatha who sat diagonally on the seat opposite her. Agatha had initially protested this and tried to get Rio to sit closer, sit <em>on</em> her, anything with more contact, but Rio had been firm about having a four hour journey and whilst she didn’t mind teasing and anticipation there was no way she could last four hours with Agatha in easy groping range. It wouldn’t be fair to either of them. Or to Jimmy.</p><p>“He worships you. You should cut him some slack.”</p><p>“He needs to learn.”</p><p>“Then you need to teach, not scare him.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but went back to behaving and continued her massage.</p><p>“Will I see you before the event tomorrow?”</p><p>“No, I’m going straight from Nat’s to see the team.”</p><p>Agatha hummed at this and dropped her gaze to Rio’s legs. “And you’re breaking the news to her about-…?”</p><p>“Not ‘breaking’. Telling. I’m telling her about the engagement, yes.”</p><p>“Maybe I should get you that security sooner rather than later.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and shifted where she sat, “Shut up. Besides if anyone came for me now I have a knuckle duster waiting. Not that Natasha ever would.” She raised her ring finger as if to flip Agatha off and grinned widely at her, her tongue sticking out of her teeth, as she showed off exactly what would be doing the damage to anyone who tried anything with her.</p><p>After a lot of debate and indecision on Rio’s part, she’d agreed to allowing Agatha to buy her a diamond ring. A proper one. A ‘I’m engaged and you can see that from space’ type ring. A brilliant, round diamond on a slim gold band. It was simple, and beautiful, and Agatha had spent a small fortune on it, much to Rio’s horror. But she loved it and was slowly getting used to holding the GDP of a small European country on her finger.</p><p>On the other hand, Agatha had said she didn’t care much about what ring she got and that Rio could buy her one, or not, and she’d be just as happy whatever. But Rio had a sneaking suspicion it was because Agatha hadn’t wanted her to spend as much as she had on Rio’s ring. So she spent weeks going from shop to shop in search of the perfect ring for her perfect Agatha. Eventually, after a lot of back and forth and several frantic calls to Alice, she’d found the ring she thought would suit Agatha best. It was a triple cushion-cut diamond ring on a thicker band than her own: classic, elegant, beautiful.</p><p>She’d waited up until 2am to give it to Agatha, straight off a full day of meetings and calls, and had a panic attack when Agatha had cried at the sight of it.</p><p>But once she’d calmed down, once she’d curled up around Rio in their shared bed with their shared rings, she had admitted that she loved it and that Rio’s effort to find her the perfect ring meant the world to her.</p><p>Rio, subconsciously, whenever Agatha was particularly stressed, had taken to holding her hand and toying with Agatha’s ring, reminding them both what they had, of the physical symbol of their love.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes playfully. “Fisticuffs is not the reason I bought you that ring.”</p><p>“No,” Rio agreed with a growing smile, “You bought it because you want everyone to know that you’re soon going to be a Vidal.”</p><p>“Can you blame me?” Agatha asked with all the innocence of a snake, slithering up to its prey as she reached one hand over to Rio’s thigh, tickling her there and smirking over at her.</p><p>Rio laughed, reaching down to take Agatha’s hand. “More gentile than how you usually claim me, I suppose.”</p><p>“Staying with Natasha tonight is really throwing off my plans to ravage you.”</p><p>“Ravage? The last time you ‘ravaged’ me I could barely play and the team accused me of slacking.”</p><p>“I am not even slightly sorry about that,” Agatha grinned at the memory of an all night session after being away from Rio for a week.</p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes. “It’s important I trap her to make her talk to me.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha relented, her grin fading as she watched Rio. “Maybe tell her though if she’s-…”</p><p>But Rio interrupted quickly, because although Agatha had been trying her best to remain neutral about Natasha and her recent behaviour, she still wasn’t her biggest fan.</p><p>“Don’t. I’ll call you if I’m going to come home early.”</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Agatha started again but a little softer this time, “She’s being a bitch and… you deserve better than that.”</p><p>Rio released a slow breath that she didn’t know she’d been holding and leant her head against the backseat, watching Agatha with a small frown, “Maybe one day you’ll get on. Like me and Alice.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed loudly then and turned away, sliding her hand back down Rio’s legs to hold her calf, “Yeah. Over my dead body.”</p><p>“Hey. She’s family. So she’s your family too.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed again and turned to stare at Rio, “Family doesn’t try to get in family’s pants.”</p><p>“Nat has not tried to get into my pants,” Rio corrected, “Your theory is baseless and I’m going to tell her what you think tonight.”</p><p>“I’m sure that’ll go down well.”</p><p>Huffing again Rio raised her brows, “Well it’ll be incredibly embarrassing for me to ask my best friend of almost twenty years if she is in love with me.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t be asking if you didn’t think there were an outside chance that she <em>might</em> be.”</p><p>Blue eyes moved to Rio’s brown ones and Agatha leant back more in her seat, sliding down a little to get more comfortable.</p><p>“And if she says she is?”</p><p>Rio hadn’t expected Agatha to ask that. And she hadn’t expected her body to react in the way it did when she did. The sudden and dangerous urge to vomit came over her and she felt her palms get sweaty, as if she were about to go cliff diving or something. But no, this was scarier than that. Natasha being in love with her would be a cataclysmic event. It would be unthinkable, and so Rio hadn’t allowed herself to think past what might happen if she said yes.</p><p>“She won’t.”</p><p>But Agatha knew her better than that, knew her tells when she lied and knew her body’s reactions to almost everything. Her hand tightened around her calf and she reached her other up to rest across Rio’s thigh, squeezing her gently. “Honey, if she is?”</p><p>“Then,” Rio started slowly, focusing down on Agatha’s hand over her lower leg. “Then I’ll deal with it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and kept her gaze on Rio’s face for a long time, though Rio was now avoiding her gaze, but soon looked away and returned both hands to Rio’s calves, tapping a random pattern there as she did.</p><p>“It wouldn’t change anything, you know,” Rio murmured quietly after a tense silence had descended on the car. “Not with us I mean.”</p><p>Agatha remained quiet and kept her gaze down on her own fingers as they continued to tap a slow pattern over Rio’s leg. “Hey.”</p><p>Reluctantly, Agatha turned back to Rio and watched her closely as Rio shuffled a little closer and raised her hand to Agatha’s cheek, “Are you worried about it?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha lied quickly.</p><p>“I’m marrying you. I <em>want</em> to marry you. You will be my <em>wife</em>. <em>Mi esposa</em>.” She dropped her hand to Agatha’s left and lifted it up to press a kiss over her ring, maintaining eye contact with Agatha the whole time as if this woman were her spiritual leader and Rio were a desperate congregant seeking salvation.</p><p>“I just want you and me on an island somewhere where no one can get to us and no one knows where we are.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression had turned from concerned to desperate and she turned her body more towards Rio, allowing her hand to be taken and kissed again. “<em>Mi amor</em>,” Rio whispered soothingly, letting her lips brush the back of Agatha’s hand “<em>eso no es vida</em>. That isn’t life. I want you here. With me. With everyone we love. Because <em>that</em> is life.”</p><p>Agatha’s frown deepened and her gaze fell from Rio again as Rio brought her hand back down to her lap, “Agatha.”</p><p>Rio shuffled until she was practically curled into Agatha’s lap, side on to her on the bench. “Finish this with Stark. Finish it now and we can disappear for a while. And when we come back we can start a proper life together. One where you’re not away all the time and where you’re not carrying this weight on your shoulders. It’s not healthy. It’s not <em>necessary</em>.”</p><p>Rio watched as this hypothetical reality washed over stoic features. The wave of potential for what could be if she’d just let go pulled at Agatha like a riptide and Rio saw in her eyes and ocean of pain that she had only just started to wade through, Agatha still keeping her at arms length when it came to her deep-rooted struggle.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio tried again, shifting now to bring herself into Agatha’s lap in a move that was so familiar to the both of them that even in her stupor Agatha reached for her to hold her hips, her fingers slipping into the belt loops of Rio’s jeans. Agatha’s gaze fell between them at the place their bodies met, at the sight of the different rings reflecting the same promise and for a second she looked as if she might agree to Rio’s suggestion.</p><p>“I have to do it,” Agatha said quietly, the bravado and bullishness not quite there anymore. “I have to.”</p><p>Rio frowned in confusion, a familiar feeling settling in her chest as the Agatha she had first met, the one who pushed and pulled, became the Agatha between her thighs, wearing her ring. “You don’t have to do anything.”</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t listening anymore and her fingers twisted in Rio’s belt loops, forcing Rio to shift closer as her gaze raised up, “We’ll be on that beach soon. I promise.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t want just a beach. She didn’t want Agatha alone on a tropical island if it came at the expense of her building walls that she was killing herself behind.</p><p>
<em>I don’t want the beach. I want you.</em>
</p><p>But she didn’t say it, didn’t push because she couldn’t spend the rest of the evening arguing with Agatha, making her see sense, making her agree. She had the length of a car journey. So instead she moved her hand to clutch her jaw, forcing it up so she could kiss her. It was firm, full of words unspoken and feelings uninhibited, but it was just a kiss.</p><p>As she pulled away she scanned over Agatha’s features whilst her eyes remained closed and she saw that same tiredness there that had been present for weeks now, months even. It made her feel small, ineffectual, useless.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t let her help her. She wouldn’t let her in. But Rio continued to push for it. Determined to protect Agatha the way Agatha stubbornly protected her.</p><p>As her eyes scanned over her fiancée’s features Rio thought again about the wonder that was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Agatha was tragically beautiful. Her Grecian profile, her bright eyes, her tumbling waves that contrasted so distinctly against the sharp lines of an elegant jaw, and defined cheekbones. She was Athena in a pantsuit.</p><p>A tired goddess carved from deep sorrow and adamantine resolve.</p><p>Rio shifted above Agatha, her hands moving to run down her neck until they found their place clutching at her collar and she leant in to press another soft kiss to the corner of her waiting lips.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful. How did I get so lucky?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched at this and her eyes opened slowly, still with slight caution in her gaze as she moved her hands to trace just below Rio’s t-shirt.</p><p>“I’m the lucky one.”</p><p>Rio smiled against Agatha’s lips and kissed her again, lingering a little longer this time. “We’re both lucky.”</p><p>As Rio pulled back Agatha’s hands began to roam up her stomach, flexing her fingers across her ribs and skimming just below her bra.</p><p>“Jimmy,” Rio whispered quietly in warning, arching a brow down at her fiancée who had gone from cautious and concerned to keen and determined within the space of a second.</p><p>“It’s Agatha, actually,” Agatha teased with a growing smirk as she moved one hand up to press her fingers below the cup of Rio’s right breast.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and reached to hold Agatha’s hand in place there, preventing her from doing much more than squeezing her breast gently.</p><p>“Keep it in your pants, please.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but squeezed again before she slowly slipped her hand back down to a more respectable position against Rio’s waist.</p><p>“It’s egregious that you won’t let me grope you in my own car.”</p><p>“Oh is it?” Rio grinned widely at this, having had this discussion many times in this exact position in the back of Agatha’s sedan.</p><p>“Yes. Especially given I haven’t seen your boobs in five days.”</p><p>“Five?” Rio asked with an even wider grin, her hands moving up to cover her own breasts as if they were on show now and the tally of days had slipped back to zero.</p><p>“That can’t be right.”</p><p>“It is, actually,” Agatha continued as if they were discussing something as mundane as the weather. “It was Monday morning when I got up for work. Your tank had slipped in your sleep and I got a <em>glimpse</em>. Nothing more exciting than that.”</p><p>Agatha’s serious expression melted before Rio’s narrowed eyes and she pouted dramatically, her fingers lightly scraping at Rio’s stomach as if she’d been denied something special, something precious.</p><p>“It won’t work.”</p><p>“You’re being cruel.”</p><p>“I am respecting Jimmy.”</p><p>“And I am asking you to respect me. My needs.”</p><p>In spite of herself Rio found herself smiling at this, once again flummoxed by the hold Agatha had on her, how she could go from fragile and mythical to seductive and playful in the space of mere seconds.</p><p>She sighed as she dipped her hands down to the hem of her shirt and lifted it until she could grab the underside of her bra and flash the still pouting woman between her thighs.</p><p>The pout disappeared immediately.</p><p>Agatha went a little slack jaw and just as her fingers made to grab again Rio threw her shirt down.</p><p>“There you go, maniac.”</p><p>“<em>That</em> was worse than no boobs. Tease.”</p><p>Fighting a laugh Rio slipped to her knee and slid from Agatha’s lap, “Agatha Harkness, high powered political fixer, throwing a tantrum over her girlfriend’s boobs.”</p><p>“Fiancée,” Agatha corrected quickly but with a smirk as she shifted to remain as close to Rio as possible even with her now off of her lap. “We all have to have hobbies.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again but moved her hand to Agatha’s cheek and watched as her head turned to kiss her palm. “After the fundraiser tomorrow I promise you unlimited access to my boobs.”</p><p>“Finally,” Agatha grumbled as she leant in to steal a quick kiss.</p><p>“Mary Long will be there. I found out yesterday. A last minute acceptance. I told Billy not to allow it but… she’s a good ally to have. At least for Stark.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this piece of information, all teasing now gone from her face as she watched Agatha closely, “You know I’ve-…”</p><p>“I know. She’s the one I heard about you from.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and dropped her gaze to take Agatha’s hand, “She won’t say anything. For all intents and purposes she’s a happily married mother of two.”</p><p>“Was it often? Your seeing her?”</p><p>“Maybe half a dozen times. It was only ever for sex.”</p><p>Rio looked back up then and saw the usual glint of jealousy in Agatha’s gaze. A few times now Agatha had asked Rio about her old clients and every time she’d looked reticent, as if against her better wishes she was torturing herself with the knowledge and memory of Rio’s old job. It was self-flagellation. But Rio always shut it down.</p><p>“What did she want?”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and shook her head, “I’m not telling you that. There’s no reason for you to know.”</p><p>Agatha nodded as if she had known that would be the response but clearly decided to drop it and instead leant back fully against the side of the car.</p><p>“Well, knowledge is power.”</p><p>“And how will knowing what she likes to do in bed help you in this case?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged a little and Rio felt safe to continue this line of conversation because Agatha’s lips twitched into a small smile, “I can announce that whatever she did with you I’ve done it better. And more besides.”</p><p>Rio hummed and shuffled back along the bench to reflect Agatha’s position on the other side, “Yeah? What makes you so sure?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze narrowed and she raised her chin a little, “Because I know I’m the best.”</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>“Careful, Vidal. Keep pushing it and I’ll traumatise poor Jimmy right here, right now.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shook her head, “You are the best. Is that what you want to hear?”</p><p>“All day. Every day.”</p><p>“Mmhm. Well maybe I’ll just tattoo it across my stomach so next time you’re down there you can get a constant reminder.”</p><p>Rio thought she saw a flicker of something predatory in Agatha’s eyes but the woman shifted a little and it was gone, but her smirk was undeniable. Her own predatory mind took her back to the last time they’d fucked and she briefly wondered whether the scratches she’d left on Agatha’s back would still be visible.</p><p>“Let’s change the subject before I get any ideas about creating another pretty pattern across your skin.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth went a little dry and she cleared her throat, trying desperately to think of something else to fill the rest of the three and a half hours left with that <em>wasn’t</em> Agatha’s lips all over her body.</p><p>They eventually found solace in discussions of Alice and Jen and their move back to the states after Jen had agreed to sell her company for the sake of protecting her legacy.</p><p>They debated back and forth on the jobs Rio had been offered, and Rio filled Agatha in on everything she’d missed whilst she’d been working: her new teammates and their dramas, the kids she taught at the gym, and the various and myriad ways she’d kept herself occupied without Agatha there.</p><p>By the time they had entered the island of manhattan, they’d moved back together again, as entangled as they could be in the little space they had. Rio had taken to speaking in Spanish, soft whispers of words she knew Agatha would now understand or at least get the basic meaning of. And with each utterance she sealed it with a kiss to Agatha’s lips, to her face, to her hands. It was the most intimate they’d been able to be in a while - beyond sharing the same physical space when sleeping together - and Rio relished in her access to the woman she was soon to call “wife”.</p><p>But the time between arriving in Manhattan and arriving in at Natasha’s apartment building wasn’t enough to satiate either of their desires. Rio wasn’t sure that any amount of time would be. But they had arrived and Rio had to leave.</p><p>Agatha held onto her for long enough that Rio began to worry Jimmy would catch a death of cold, lingering as he was outside on the sidewalk beside the closed car door.</p><p>“Jimmy,” Rio protested as Agatha trailed kisses down her neck and pressed her body closer.</p><p>“Agatha,” Agatha corrected with a gentle nip to Rio’s pulse point that made her squirm with desire.</p><p>“Shut. Up.”</p><p>Agatha laughed against Rio’s skin and she felt the vibration from it settle neatly in her lower abdomen even as Agatha pulled away to look at her. “Promise you’ll call if you need anything?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>With one final, lingering kiss, Rio left the car and accepted her overnight bag from Jimmy, waving a friendly farewell before she let herself into Natasha’s building on the upper east side.</p><p>As Rio walked the path to the little elevator that would fly her to Natasha’s apartment she began to feel nerves settle over the butterflies that Agatha still was able to produce in her from her mere presence.</p><p>But Natasha was her best friend and Natasha had promised to be there so Rio focused on that. What she knew to be true. Not what she hoped wasn’t.</p><p>She let herself into Natasha’s apartment with the key she had on the little bundle from her bag and sucked in a sharp breath as the familiar scent of the little apartment filled her lungs.</p><p>The small space was open plan, a little larger than her own Washington Heights apartment, with one big, long space as a living area, framed one side by inbuilt bookshelves and on the other by a door to a bathroom, an open kitchen, and a large arched entranceway to the bedroom that faced the small area where Natasha now sat in one armchair, facing Rio, looking across the space at her with a soft expression.</p><p>“You lost weight.”</p><p>“No I didn’t.”</p><p>“Your hair’s shorter.”</p><p>“No it’s not.”</p><p>Rio moved across the space, watching for any signs that Natasha would bolt, decide she didn’t want to see Rio again.</p><p>“What’s differ-…?”</p><p>But then shrewd green eyes fell to Rio’s left hand that sat by her hip and they widened briefly, imperceptibly. But Rio knew Natasha. She knew her tells.</p><p>“When did that happen?”</p><p>Rio took steps forward until she was directly in front of Natasha’s chair and bent down to kiss her cheek, ignoring that Natasha’s hands had flown immediately to take Rio’s hand and examine the piece of jewellery she found so offensive.</p><p>“The day after Christmas.”</p><p>“And you’re telling me now?”</p><p>A jolt of guilt shot through Rio then, so palpable that her fingers twitched in Natasha’s hand where she still held it. “I’ve been trying to see you for weeks. You’ve been avoiding me.”</p><p>Natasha dropped Rio’s hand but kept her gaze on her, intense and unabashed. “I told you. I’ve been busy.”</p><p>“You’ve never been too busy for me.”</p><p>Rio took a step back and sat down in the smaller chair opposite Natasha’s, watching her with a mixture of exasperation and shame.</p><p>“You started your new life. I figured you didn’t need me-…”</p><p>“Natasha you are my family. I will always need you. Do you know how much I’ve missed you?”</p><p>Natasha remained silent for a while before she sat back in her chair a little and splayed her fingers out where they sat on the arms.</p><p>“Regretting moving?”</p><p>“No. Regretting that my best friend doesn’t want to support me.”</p><p>The silence that descended on the little apartment then didn’t shock Rio. Natasha used words infrequently and usually didn’t need to at all for Rio to know how she felt, what she thought, what she needed.</p><p>So she sat in it, watching the imperceptible movements of her best friend’s face, watching as she fought against whatever she wanted to say to her.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking a lot about what Agatha’s doing. And I’ve been doing some digging.”</p><p>Whatever Rio thought Natasha was going to say, it wasn’t this.</p><p>“I-… What?”</p><p>Natasha cleared her throat, clearly having this kept entirely to herself this whole time had taken its toll and she seemed suddenly animated, desperate to get it off her chest.</p><p>“I told you what I’d heard about Abigail. I followed that trail. And it led me, it led me to Wanda, to Sokovia. That’s where I was at Christmas.”</p><p>Texts, unanswered calls, and an empty apartment, it all began to make sense in Rio’s mind. Natasha hadn’t been <em>busy</em>, she’d been away.</p><p>“You…” Rio leant forward and rested her forearms on her knees as her eyes widen in realisation. “Natasha. Why didn’t you tell me? Why didn’t you-…?”</p><p>“Has Agatha told you what she’s doing?”</p><p>“That isn’t what we’re discussing.”</p><p>“And yet you’re marrying her and chastising me.”</p><p>“This isn’t about you versus Agatha.”</p><p>“Isn’t it?”</p><p>Rio groaned and ran her hand through her hair, feeling the now familiar heaviness of her new ring brush against her scalp.</p><p>“It doesn’t have to be. I can’t have a life with her and a life with you.”</p><p>“Then you’re dropping me.”</p><p>“No!” Rio’s head snapped up and she looked up to see devastation flicker across Natasha’s features, her fingers now curling in on themselves to get a grip on her own emotions.</p><p>“Natasha.” She leant more forward, her body twitching for her to go to Natasha and envelope her even as her words became harsher, more desperate. “You haven’t even <em>tried</em> with Agatha. And I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner but I <em>did</em> try. I’ve tried every day since I left the city. I invited you for Christmas and even given what you did to Alice, everyone would have welcomed you. I <em>wanted</em> you there. I wanted my best friend, I wanted my <em>family</em> to be with me. And here you sit, telling me you’ve been flying to Europe chasing ghosts and tall tales and accusing <em>me</em> of dropping you!”</p><p>A shaking hand flew to Rio’s cheek and she was surprised to find that it was wet. Halfway through her tirade she’d began to cry, unaware of when or how this had started without her knowledge, she wiped her cheek quickly and threw away her dignity with the tear that flew from her fingers.</p><p>She stood. Fury overtaking her body that was only somewhat directed at Natasha. The rest was directed at the woman who by now would be nestled in her favourite armchair, glasses perched on her nose, laptop in hand.</p><p>“Why everyone decided I was too fragile or too stupid to be let in, I have no idea.”</p><p>She began to pace. An unfortunate habit she’d picked up from living with a very dramatic woman.</p><p>But her mind was running away with itself even as her feet marched up and down the little space between the two chairs in the makeshift living space Natasha had made for herself.</p><p>“Vse slozhno.” <em>It’s complicated.</em></p><p>“Too complicated for little old me?”</p><p>Rio spat back, spinning halfway through her movement away from Natasha to round on her.</p><p>“Sit down, Rio.”</p><p>“No. No. You can’t tell me what to do. Tell me what’s going on. Why are you and Agatha avoiding the truth?”</p><p>Natasha pursed her lips slightly and her gaze fell from Rio’s furious face to the hand that curled into a fist, emphasising the impressive diamond that sat proud on her finger. The sight of it, the promise that it held, caused Natasha to suck in a sharp breath before she spoke again, her voice low, steady:</p><p>“Espionage,” Natasha drawled, drawing out every syllable as if it were a word to be savoured rather than spat out on a whim.</p><p>Rio’s heart stopped as Natasha’s mouth closed around the last syllable, watching as her lips twitched a little, her gaze now steady on Rio’s shocked face.</p><p>“No. That cannot be right.”</p><p>Natasha rolled her shoulders in a half-shrug and dropped her gaze then to her fingers tapping at the arms of her chair. “I told you I’d been busy.”</p><p>“I don’t know the depths of it. I don’t know a lot, actually. But Wanda’s been working with Abigail. Feeding secrets. Selling stories.”</p><p>Rio’s whole body went into shock. Her muscles ground to a halt against her frozen bones and she stared wide eyed at Natasha as the one truth that had caused all of this in the first place suddenly hit her straight in the chest, a lethal, final blow.</p><p>“She was married to her.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio shook her head slightly and watched but didn’t see as Natasha moved from her chair for the first time, and went to stop just before her. Her fingers moved almost shyly, reaching for Rio for the first time since she’d held her hand, finding their place against Rio’s crumpled t-shirt, twisting in the hem of the shirt and holding Rio in front of her in a hold that wouldn’t mean much if Rio even thought of moving away. But she hadn’t.</p><p>“She was married to her.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Natasha.”</p><p>Rio blinked and saw reflected in green eyes the truth that she’d just realised.</p><p>“Agatha wouldn’t.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“I’m serious.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“She <em>wouldn’t</em>.”</p><p>“Don’t you think it’s suspicious that she’s so hellbent on getting Wanda what she wants?”</p><p>“That’s not-…”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“Bullshit.” Rio snapped so viciously she almost gave herself whiplash. But she was sure. Certain. Agatha wouldn’t.</p><p>“You’re just saying this because-…”</p><p>“Because?”</p><p>“Because…” Rio faltered, her eyes darting across the face she knew so well, the face she’d grown up with and had loved for years.</p><p>The words were on the tip of her tongue but they tasted like bile, venomous and irrevocable.</p><p>They tumbled from Rio’s lips like thunder in the night.</p><p>“Because you’re in love with me.”</p>

<em> “Because you’re in love with me.”</em>
</p><p>Natasha stood stockstill in front of her, staring at her with an unreadable expression, her fingers twisting in the fabric of her shirt so much that Rio felt the fibres strain against her back as she pulled it forwards.</p><p>Natasha didn’t blink.</p><p>But then, unexpectedly, she laughed.</p><p>A deep, throaty laugh that lasted not long enough to be true but instead a short sharp burst of ridicule aimed Rio’s way.</p><p>And Rio felt shame run through her like a hot knife.</p><p>“Agatha put you up to this. She got in your head.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but couldn’t look at Natasha and instead turned her face away, gritting her teeth as she tried to calm herself down, not focus on the mortification she was currently feeling.</p><p>“I am jealous. I’ll admit that. But I won’t apologise for it. I’ve been looking out for you almost half your life. I know you better than anyone.”</p><p>“Tasha,” Rio pleaded softly, finally turning to gaze at her best friend with a deep frown and an unconscious pout, pushing her hands away from her.</p><p>Natasha relinquished her hold, but reluctantly.</p><p>“Do you want me to be in love with you? Would it make all this easier?”</p><p>“Of course not.”</p><p>“Does <em>she</em> want me to be in love with you? To have a rival? To have a <em>duel</em> for your honour?”</p><p>Rio sighed in a mix of exasperation and embarrassment, walking away from Natasha to sit back down and returning her head to her hands and her elbows on her knees. Deflated. Depleted.</p><p>They were both silent for a turn, both thinking hard about what being in love with the other might mean for the future of their relationship. In both women even the concept of it all too much to bear.</p><p>“Look,” Natasha started slowly, stepping towards Rio again until she could sit down on the other chair, not once taking her eyes off of the Latina, though the other woman was avoiding her gaze. “Maybe for a year or two I had a crush. I found you… appealing.”</p><p>“Gee, thanks,” Rio deadpanned, her gaze briefly flicking up to meet Natasha’s.</p><p>“I mean,” Natasha started again, clearing her throat quietly and frowning across at the top of Rio’s head where she held it once more in her hands, “I was. I was in love. Or at least I wanted you,” she cleared her throat again and clapped her hands together in front of her, “in <em>that</em> way… but after a while it went away. I started to see you in a different way. And I do love you. More than anyone. The only people that ever came close to you were your parents. Maria and Luis were…” she stopped then and dropped her gaze down to the floor, her voice lowering again, “I’m not in love with you. But I am jealous. It’s always been just us two and now… now I have to share you with a woman I don’t like and I don’t trust.”</p><p>Because it was too much to process, too much to think of the little family they’d had for themselves all those years ago, the space her parents had made for Natasha at their table, in their homes and hearts, she swallowed the tears that threatened to spill and instead said: “Are you telling me you got to know me and then fell out of love with me?”</p><p>Her voice quivered a little but Natasha picked up what she was putting down with ease, unwilling to let Rio suffer any more than she already was.</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>Rio released a throaty laugh and then groaned as she rubbed at her temple. “You’re a bitch. You know if you had just come to visit. If you had answered when I called. If you would just-…”</p><p>“I know,” Natasha said calmly, watching Rio closely as she eventually looked back up again. She took a deep breath and tried once more: “Rio, this is so much bigger than some shady business practices and Agatha’s a fool if she-…”</p><p>“She isn’t a fool.”</p><p>Natasha paused for a second and took a slow breath in, watching the fire slip back into her friend’s eyes. “Maybe not. But she’s foolish if she thinks she can handle this. It’ll put you in more danger.”</p><p>“I need to go home.”</p><p>Natasha moved then and went to stand before Rio, taking her hands in her own.</p><p>“This is your home too, Rio. You can’t just run to her every time something-…”</p><p>But Rio’s emotions hadn’t settled yet. She felt crazy with the swing of them. Her relief that Natasha was who she thought she was. The comfort of being in the presence of her best friend again. The panic over Agatha’s decision to pursue a road that could lead to ruin. The fear that she’d lose her.</p><p>She was a boiling pot that was spilling over.</p><p>“No.” Rio snapped, pushing Natasha’s hands away forcefully and ripping her own from the hold she had on her. “<em>She</em> is my home. And you have chosen to not be a part of my life for the past few weeks and now you’re accusing her-…”</p><p>“I’m not accusing her of anything. I am telling you what I know about Wanda. And saying that-…”</p><p>“Suggesting that Agatha might have something to do with it. Be part of this,” she threw her hands up in exasperation, unable to grasp exactly what “this” was, and settling for a vague Spanish throwaway: “cosa de espías” <em>spy thing</em>.</p><p>Natasha breathed slowly then, stretching her head back and closing her eyes, “If you would just <em>listen</em>.”</p><p>But Rio had already stood, pushing past Natasha, such was the desperation to get to Agatha, to stop her from venturing down this road that could lead to Agatha suffering as well as Wanda. The concept of losing Agatha was too great. The very idea that it would all be because Agatha was trying to protect <em>her</em> and ignoring the danger she was throwing herself infront of made her want to vomit. The small fire of anger that had been smouldering in her chest at Natasha’s refusal to speak to her these past few weeks had become a five-alarm fury, with Agatha’s downfall the kindling that she needed to set it aflame.</p><p>The hand that grabbed at her arm as she reached the door did nothing to quell the flames in her chest and she reeled around to glare at the woman who up until recently had always been by her side, <em>on</em> her side.</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio snapped again, ripping her arm from Natasha’s clutches. “I’m sick of this. You’re treating me like I’m an idiot. Like I’m incapable of-…”</p><p>“This is too big. Too much for anyone to be involved in. Including me. Including Agatha.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and stepped backwards, away from Natasha, until she felt the firm, solid presence of the door behind her.

</p><p> The solid nature of it grounded her. She took in a slow and deep breath and said the thing that was most troubling to her: “She was married to her”, subconsciously hoping that continuing to say the thing that scared her the most would help alleviate some of the fear, the blind panic. “She would just have to say the word and all eyes would turn to Agatha too. It would be so easy for her to turn it around. And she would.” </p><p>“I know,” Natasha said slowly, her voice a lot softer now.</p><p>“If she’s caught… she’ll drag Agatha down with her and-…”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Blinking her eyes slowly open, forcing herself to face her best friend, Rio felt her whole body shake with the realisation that Agatha, for some godforsaken reason, was stubbornly putting herself in the viper’s way.</p><p>“Hey,” Natasha said quickly, moving to hold Rio’s arms at her side, “Hey. Agatha’s a big girl, she can-…”</p><p>“No. She’s stubborn. She’ll go to the ends of the earth to-…”</p><p>“Rio,” her name snapped her back to life and she released a slow breath as Natasha said, “Calm down. It won’t be all that bad. If you’re right in that Agatha’s done nothing wrong then she’ll be fine. It’s <em>you</em> I’m worried about.”</p><p>“Me? I-…”</p><p>“You were an escort, Rio. And your fucking girlfriend is-…”</p><p>“Fiancée,” Rio corrected quietly, the word catching in her throat as she flexed her arms beneath Natasha’s hold. “I’m marrying her.”</p><p>“Fiancée. Whatever. If she pursues this, she’s putting you in more danger. And she’s so fucking-…”</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio said quickly, gaining her voice back, “Natasha. Don’t. Not when you don’t know her. When you’ve not <em>tried</em>.”</p><p>Natasha sighed heavily and she skimmed her hands down Rio’s arms until she could take her hands, holding them tightly as they shook. “There’s someone I know who can sort it. Can get rid of… of the issue.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, the grounding feeling of Natasha’s fingers against her own steadily helping her to relax even as infrequent shivers passed through her body.</p><p>“Natasha. Don’t even joke about-…”</p><p>“I’m not joking.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and twisted her hand in Natasha’s to release it and moved her hand instead to Natasha’s face, watching her with a deep frown as she said: “No. I don’t want you involved. I don’t want you anywhere near any of this. And I will kill <em>you</em> if you even consider-…”</p><p>Natasha sighed and leant her head a little into Rio’s hold, watching her with clear green eyes, “It would be clean. Quick. No one would know.”</p><p>But Rio wouldn’t have it and she shook her head, removing her hand from Natasha’s face, and moving around her to walk back into the room, “I’m not discussing this. It’s insane. You’re insane.”</p><p>“Rio she’s a bad woman. And I’m sorry but the woman you’re marrying isn’t great either, judging by the fact that she married this lunatic she’s even worse than I thought.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> were the one just suggesting putting out a hit, Natasha. You don’t even <em>know</em> Agatha.”</p><p>“I know enough.”</p><p>Rio huffed out an exasperated breath and turned around to see that Natasha had followed her back into the apartment and was watching her closely, not two feet away.</p><p>“This is such a mess. This <em>whole</em> thing. I find this perfect girl and all I get is-…”</p><p>But she didn’t finish her sentence and instead released a scream of frustration, throwing herself down into the chair with her head in her hands.</p><p>She felt her body begin to shake again, the realisation that it may never be simple, it may never be easy with Agatha, almost being too much to bear.</p><p>“La amo, Natasha. Más de lo que puedo explicar y todo lo que sigue pasando... es demasiado.” <em>I love her, Natasha. More than I can even explain and everything that keeps happening... it’s too much.</em></p><p>Rio’s head was down so she didn’t see Natasha’s reaction to this, didn’t hear her response, didn’t know how the words had landed. But she trusted now that Natasha had told her the truth earlier, that she loved Rio but wasn’t in love with her. She <em>had</em> to trust that. Because life without Natasha was untenable. And whatever this was, she was sure they could fix.</p><p>But she didn’t need to look to know that Natasha was now on her knees by her own legs, her hands reaching up to pry her hands from her face, “Rio. Querido.”</p><p>Rio slowly opened her eyes to look down at Natasha and shook her head slowly, “I can’t stay. I need to go and speak to her. This needs to end.”</p><p>“Think about my offer. Seriously. I can make this go away.”</p><p>“You’re insane.”</p><p>Rio squeezed the hands that held hers and smiled sadly down at her best friend who had put so much distance between them lately she thought she’d lost her entirely. But Natasha was there still. Offering support in the form of a hitman and a steadfast opinion that no one was good enough for Rio. And she sighed, she brought Natasha’s hand up to kiss the back of it before she spoke once more: “I want you to promise me that you’ll make an effort. That you’ll get over whatever it is that is making you stay away. I need you in my life. And Agatha too, whether you like it or not.”</p><p>She watched as Natasha’s gaze dropped and she saw the deliberation behind her eyes, her lips pursing before she eventually spoke, “I’ll promise to try. But I don’t-…”</p><p>“Natasha.”</p><p>“Fine. I’ll try.”</p><p>Rio felt her shoulders slump from where they’d been raised, her back tight and tense as she watched her best friend. “Thank you.”</p><p>Natasha groaned and dropped her forehead to Rio’s knee, her hands falling from Rio’s hold. “Couldn’t you have just found some cute girl who works in an office somewhere? An accountant or something?”</p><p>“Apparently not.”</p><p>Natasha pulled back and rolled her eyes but for the first time since Rio had arrived that evening there was a lightness to her gaze and Rio found comfort in it again for the first time in months.</p><p>“Come visit. Stay with us. Whenever you want.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>Rio was the one to roll her eyes this time and she lightly kicked Natasha’s thigh before her, “Behave.”</p><p>Natasha let out a soft laugh that didn’t reach her eyes and rocked back onto her haunches to lean back against the other chair, watching as Rio stood again to fetch her bag. “Call me if you need me. I’m not kidding about sorting this if I have to…” and then, “Tell me how it goes.”</p><p>Rio reached the door and paused to look back around at her friend, feeling somehow better about leaving than she had about arriving.</p><p>“I do love you,” Natasha said softly, her lips twitching into a soft, earnest smile, “Just not in the way Agatha’s afraid of.”</p><p>Sighing softly and tilting her head, Rio watched Natasha for a while, “Don’t love me enough to kill for me.”</p><p>“No promises.”</p><p>Rio shouldered her bag and bit down on her lip, shooting Natasha one last look before she left.</p><p>As Rio went down to the lobby in the elevator she closed her eyes and thought of the woman waiting for her. Of what she’d say when she told her what Natasha had found out. Of what she’d say when Rio insisted she drop whatever plans she had for Wanda. Of what Agatha would say if she gave her an ultimatum.</p><p><em>Would</em> she give her one? <em>Could</em> she?</p><p>However she thought to play it the one thing she couldn’t shake was that Wanda had her claws in them both. Either Rio stood by and let Agatha risk her safety to get Wanda or she told Agatha ‘enough’ and walked away but kept Agatha safe. Neither was a good option. Neither let her keep Agatha.</p><p>The whole way to Agatha’s apartment, she thought of nothing else but the danger Agatha could be putting herself in. Of the stubborn short-sightedness of the woman.</p><p>It took Rio longer than normal to get to Agatha’s because she dawdled on her way. She walked slowly for a few blocks before she flagged a cab and worked hard to suppress the concern for what would happen as soon as she entered Agatha’s apartment.</p><p>But almost without being consciously aware of it, she had slipped her key into the lock and pushed the door open.</p><p>The familiar, welcome scent of home, of Agatha, filled her lungs and she lingered so long in the hall that Agatha appeared before her, confused as to who had entered her apartment and not announced themselves and then suddenly concerned that it was Rio, looking pale and a little frightened.</p><p>But the sight of Agatha, for Rio, calmed her, if only for a second. And she smiled a little, despite of everything she was feeling and everything they had to discuss.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha murmured quickly, moving over to take Rio’s bag and place it down, leaning around her to close the door over her shoulder.</p><p>“Rio, what’s wrong? What happened? Did Natasha…?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and lifted her fingers to Agatha’s concerned face, the ghost of a smile still playing on her features as blue eyes stared back at her. “Can we talk?”</p><p>Something like fear flickered across Agatha’s features but it soon settled into concern again as she stepped aside to take Rio’s hand and pull her through to the living room.</p><p>Rio allowed herself to be led through, secure in the confident hold of Agatha, until she was directed to sit in the chair that had so clearly just been vacated. On the arm of the Agatha’s chair sat a patterned blanket, thrown haphazardly there when she’d heard the door. Agatha’s laptop was on the coffee table opposite, open to her email inbox, and beside a glass of whisky. And as Rio turned to look at Agatha again she noticed her glasses tucked into her soft grey sweater.</p><p>These pieces of Agatha’s evening without her made her yearn for this to be over, so that in every evening to come Rio could be part of this vignette.</p><p>A Shiraz beside the Glenfiddich.</p><p>“Sit down. Let’s-…”</p><p>But Agatha was directing Rio to sit in her chair and she knew if she allowed herself to assimilate now, she’d never get through what she had to say.</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly, reeling around to stare wide-eyed at Agatha. “No,” she managed again, a little softer this time. “Will you sit, please?”</p><p>Agatha looked taken aback but nodded and moved around Rio, noticeably avoiding touching her, to sit down. She held her arms up to her expectantly, her fingers twitching a little. She was expectant, hopeful.</p><p>But Rio had turned away and missed the look of panic that flashed through Agatha’s eyes, her hands moving to bury into her hair as she tried to focus on what she needed to know, and how she could convince Agatha to tell her.</p><p>“I need you to tell me what you’re planning to do with Wanda. I need to know everything.”</p><p>She turned back around and saw that Agatha had moved on the chair, sitting now on the very edge and looking up at Rio with a deep frown, unsure where this was going.</p><p>“Rio, I’ve told you-…”</p><p>“No, no. It’s not good enough anymore. Natasha told me what she’s doing. That she’s selling information to the highest bidder. That she’s working with Abigail. Do you <em>know</em> how dangerous it is to get involved with that?”</p><p>Agatha’s panicked look morphed into confusion, and then anger, “Natasha told you that? She shouldn’t have done.”</p><p>“Well someone had to!” Rio shouted suddenly, “Considering the woman I’m about to marry didn’t feel it necessary to tell me that her ex-wife was committing treason!”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze for a second and slowly stood, her hands turning into fists at her side. “And you think I’ve had something to do with-…”</p><p>“No.” Rio clenched her jaw and stepped in to fist Agatha’s sweater in her hands, jostling the glasses that hung there. “No. But I think she’ll try and drag you down with her anyway if you try to get involved.”</p><p>Blue eyes flickered up to scan over Rio’s face for any sign of a lie but found none and she lifted her chin slightly as she spoke again, “Natasha needs to stay out of it.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> need to stay out of it.”</p><p>Agatha laughed derisively and turned her head away even as Rio stepped closer into her and reached for her cheek, “Agatha. I’m not asking anymore. I’m telling you. You need to step away. I can’t lose you.”</p><p>Something changed then in the room, a spark of something flickered out and Rio felt it in the way Agatha’s body relaxed, in the way her hands released their hold at her sides, in the way she turned her head to match Rio’s gaze.</p><p>“Once I take out Wanda we will be safe to-…”</p><p>“No,” Rio said softly, her voice catching a little in her throat as she swallowed, “I feel safe when I have you with me. If you pursue this you are risking that. You are wilfully making me feel unsafe and scared and it’s because you’re stubborn and angry and I understand that but I am telling you that I will not forgive you if you let her take you away from me.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted and Rio saw her tongue move to wet her bottom lip, watched it disappear again, watched Agatha pull back from her and head to the drinks trolley.</p><p>“You don’t understand. Natasha has no business telling you-…”</p><p>“Natasha is my best friend.”</p><p>“Yeah? Not from where I’m standing. She’s barely spoken to you since you moved in. She’s doing this to-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said more forcefully this time, watching as Agatha knocked back whatever expensive amber liquid she’d just poured herself.</p><p>“Do you not see how dangerous this is? How <em>reckless</em>?”</p><p>“It’ll keep her away from you. Keep you safe.”</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t turned around, was now pouring herself another glass and then grabbed another to fill that up too.</p><p>“I will not stand back whilst you throw yourself to the lions in the name of protecting me. If people find out what I used to do, <em>fine</em>. If people-…”</p><p>“People is the problem,” Agatha said coolly, her voice now purposefully low and steady where Rio’s was getting progressively louder.</p><p>“Wanda knows a lot of people who could have you hurt and I-…”</p><p>Rio shook her head and threw her hands out, “Listen to yourself! If she knows people who would come after me then think about what she’d do to you!”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head again and turned around, holding out one crystal glass to Rio with an exceptionally large pour.</p><p>“Have a drink. It’ll calm you down.”</p><p>But Agatha should have known these were the wrong words to say to Rio. They were like gasoline on a dumpster fire.</p><p>And Rio drank it down with a thirst she didn’t know she had, with an overwhelming desire to explode, and so she did.</p><p>“YOU CANNOT WIN THIS! You cannot just sweep her away! You are putting yourself in so much danger and are risking what we have for some crackpot idea that you can beat Wanda when it actually doesn’t <em>fucking</em> matter anymore! Because <em>we</em> matter. Not her. <em>Us.</em> All I want is you. Why can’t you see that?!”</p><p>If the residents of Jane Street had thought they’d heard yelling a few months ago emanating from Number 9 then they were <em>sure</em> that they heard it this night. The quiet little street in Manhattan was shaken by the desperate yells of a desperate woman and curtains twitched as Rio unleashed at Agatha, unable to temper her desperation any longer.</p><p>Agatha stood in silence, her eyes wide and her lips parted in stunned surprise at the unusually volatile scene before her. Of all the arguments they’d ever had… Rio had never shouted like this. She’d never shouted like this at anyone. And certainly not at Agatha.</p><p>But Rio returned to herself then and even as her voice cracked and her hands shook she watched the words wash over the woman before her, crashing into her like a freight train.</p><p>Agatha swallowed and turned around again, placing the two glasses on the side as she processed Rio’s thunder.</p><p>Rio’s body was shaking, from either adrenaline or fear, she didn’t know. She could no longer compute anything. The only thing she was certain of was that Agatha wasn’t going to give in and she would have to watch as she was dragged down by this scarlet-haired witch.</p><p>The shaking turned into sobbing and unable to stop herself, Rio collapsed into herself, squatting down slowly and burying her face in her hands to preserve what very little dignity she had left.</p><p>But no sooner had she done so than strong hands were against her back and wrists and Agatha was back against her, pulling her up and pressing her into herself. Rio wasn’t in her body anymore but somehow her body knew what to do, allowing itself to be jostled and moved, lifted and held by the familiar touch of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Soft lips brushed over her hair as Agatha had settled Rio into her lap, cradling her against her with a tender ferocity that Rio had grown accustomed to and was so terrified of losing.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was slow to even out but was guided to its normal rhythm by Agatha’s soft touches and the gentle reassurances breathed out against her temple.</p><p>”It’s okay. You’re okay. I have you.”</p><p>Slowly, almost reluctantly, when she felt she could stand it, she pulled away and blinked down at the woman before her, watching as silent tears marred her face too.</p><p>“Please,” she whispered, “Please don’t.”</p><p>And to Rio’s great relief and surprise, Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Frowning in confusion, and pulling back more to shift and raise up on her knees, Rio cupped the face she loved so much and brushed her thumbs over wet cheeks. “Okay?”</p><p>“Just,” Agatha began softly, so softly that Rio’s heart ached for the woman who seemed to have shrunk before her, holding Rio so tightly and gazing up at her like she was about to lose her. “Just don’t leave me, okay? I couldn’t handle it.”</p><p>“Leave you?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly and blue eyes swirled with unspoken fears as she dropped her gaze from Rio’s face and focused on her chest as her hands moved to hold her above her ribs, clutching the fabric there, “I can be good. I can protect you. I can-…”</p><p>Her words dissolved into a soft sob and she closed her eyes tightly as Rio’s whole world crashed down around her.</p><p>It wasn’t about Wanda. It was about proving herself to Rio. Proving herself worthy.</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>In all the ways Rio thought this conversation might go, this was not one of them.</p><p>She’d thought that Agatha might scream, that she might shout and insist what she was doing was right and the only way. She’d thought that they might end the night not speaking or that they’d be up until morning arguing the point.</p><p>But she’d never envisioned Agatha collapsing in on herself before her eyes, vulnerable and small before her.</p><p>A fury unlike the one she’d been in not minutes ago alighted in her chest. This fury was deeper, more guttural. And it was directed at everyone in Agatha’s life who hadn’t loved her the way she deserved. Everyone who had taken advantage. Everyone who had failed her.</p><p>And it was directed at herself.</p><p>For all the missteps she’d made in their relationship that meant that Agatha hadn’t yet found true comfort in her. For the time it had taken her to give up her job even though she knew it hurt Agatha. For her inability to fix everything about her past, and to keep Agatha safe from her demons.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio uttered desperately, continuing to brush away fresh tears that fell silently down her fiancée’s cheeks, “You are everything I’ve ever wanted and everything I thought I could never have.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted in a soft gasp and she dared to look up again then, her brow furrowing as if she didn’t believe Rio, but her hands twisted in the fabric of her shirt and Rio knew she wanted her closer. She leant down and adjusted herself in Agatha’s lap, resting their foreheads together and tasted the rich oaky whisky on Agatha’s breath.</p><p>“My love,” Rio uttered, leaning in to brush their lips together, “The safest I ever feel is in your arms. Don’t take that away from me. Please.”</p><p>Agatha only nodded, her breathing slowing down now as she leant up into Rio properly, in a salty, desperate promise.</p><p>When they both pulled up for air, still barely centimetres apart, Agatha spoke again: “I can’t stand that you’re vulnerable because of me. Because of <em>her</em>. Because of my choices… my <em>weakness</em>.”</p><p>“You’re not weak,” Rio corrected gently, pulling back slightly so she could reach down and stretch her t-shirt to the max to brush the fabric over Agatha’s face, wiping the residue of tears from her cheeks, “You fell in love and she…”</p><p>“It wasn’t love,” Agatha said quickly, shaking her head once Rio was done with her ministrations, “I know that now. It wasn’t <em>this</em>. It was a desire to <em>be</em> loved and I thought she… she convinced me she did.”</p><p>Rio blew out a soft breath and watched as Agatha’s eyes fluttered slowly, her fingers twitched across her ribs, “I need you to know that all I ever want is you. Not you trying to protect me. Not you throwing yourself at getting rid of her, thinking it will keep me safe, just you. Right here. I want to go to sleep with you every night and I want to wake up with you every morning.”</p><p>Agatha bit down on her lower lip and Rio raised her thumb to pull it free from her teeth’s hold, replacing her thumb soon with her own lips. Agatha returned the kiss and then moved to kiss Rio’s cheek, her other cheek, her nose, “Okay,” she said quietly, “Let’s go away. Just you and me.”</p><p>“You’ll quit the campaign? Drop your plans for Wanda?”</p><p>Agatha shifted and moved her hands down to Rio’s hips to pull them closer to her own and Rio sighed, feeling a wave of relief wash over her like no other as Agatha said: “If it’s a choice between that and making you feel less safe, making you… yes. Okay.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched at the sides but her body, her body shook a little from a sudden, residual tension that had settled into her bones. She skimmed her fingers over Agatha’s cheekbone and whispered reverently, “Thank you.”</p><p>The older woman before her just nodded and Rio saw hesitation in her eyes, her lips parting as if she were weighing something up before she spoke again. “And… Natasha? How did… how did that go?”</p><p>Rio sighed softly and replaced her fingers against Agatha’s cheek with a soft kiss before she pulled away to speak again, “She went to Sokovia at Christmas, following on some whispers she’d heard about Abigail and Wanda. And she threatened to hire a hitman to take her out but I-…”</p><p>“Surpringly easy to do,” Agatha muttered, her eyes darting up to catch Rio’s gaze again.</p><p>“You wouldn’t.”</p><p>“I considered it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and placed her head in her hands as she considered what it was about her that made the two women she loved most in the world be the type of women who would consider hiring a hitman.</p><p>“That is so insane I can’t even-…”</p><p>But Agatha was prying her hands away from her face and smiling just a little, “It’s not sexy? Me murdering someone for you?”</p><p>“<em>That</em> is…” but Rio couldn’t deny the way her stomach flipped at the thought of Agatha having such power, such control, that she could and would simply say the word and someone would be gone. For her.</p><p>She cleared her throat, even as Agatha’s soft smile turned into a smirk, a sure sign she’d been caught out and an even bigger sign that Agatha was beginning to relax again.</p><p>“No. No it isn’t.”</p><p>Agatha quirked a brow but chose not to say anything as she dropped her gaze to where she held Rio’s hips again, “And did you ask her if-…?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said with a heavy sigh, raising Agatha’s chin to look her in the eye again. She saw in blue eyes that same hesitation from earlier, that same fear. “She’s not in love with me. But she did admit she was jealous and she’s still suspicious of you.”</p><p>Agatha went to respond but Rio interrupted her quickly, “I told her she needed to get to know you. To make an effort. And she promised she would.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once and dropped her gaze again, even when Rio still held her chin.</p><p>“Will you try too?”</p><p>A beat passed where Rio thought Agatha might deny her request, might change the subject, or worse, but she nodded slowly, looking back up to Rio again, “Okay.”</p><p>Rio leant in to capture the promise on her lips and slipped her hands back to cradle Agatha’s head, tangled herself in the messy bun that Agatha had thrown up the moment she’d arrived home. Agatha hesitated only for a second before she returned the kiss and Rio shivered again when she felt Agatha’s tongue cautiously, almost politely brush against her lower lip.</p><p>Rio allowed the kiss to deepen but whimpered as she felt a tear slip down her cheek and pulled back in horror that her body had betrayed her when she was getting exactly what she’d been wanting all evening: Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed open and she moved her hands to take Rio’s from her hair, kissing each palm softly as her gaze tracked the fall of Rio’s gentle tears.</p><p>“I’m so in love with you, Rio Vidal. I will spend the rest of my life trying to be good enough for-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured softly, her fingers twitching in Agatha’s hold, “You are good enough. <em>Too</em> good for me.”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head and placed Rio’s hands to her own neck, holding them there so that she could release them and hold Rio’s hips again, “I wanted you and then I loved you and now I… I’ll do whatever to keep you.”</p><p>Large brown eyes fluttered closed and Rio pursed her lips together as she fought off the tears that threatened to keep falling, focusing instead on the gentle pressure at her hips, the soft breaths against her cheek as Agatha leant in again, “Come to bed. It’s been a while since I’ve held you.”</p><p>Another shiver went through Rio’s body at this request and she could only nod as she allowed Agatha to help her stand and direct her with a soft but confident pressure on her lower back into the bedroom.</p><p>The night sky outside the large window was already pitch black but Agatha went to close the shutters to envelope the room in the kind of moody light that would usually relax Rio’s nervous system.</p><p>But it was Agatha’s hands against her that helped this time, strong and steady as she removed her shirt and unzipped her jeans. In any other circumstance of Agatha removing her clothes like this, Rio would have been panting and desperate at the subtle dominance Agatha was exhibiting but all she could think about was how lucky she was that Agatha was still here, that she’d listened, and that she would hold her.</p><p>When Rio was stripped down to her underwear, her clothes and bra tossed haphazardly somewhere in the dark room, she crawled into the centre of the bed and waited for Agatha to join her. But Agatha had turned away when Rio had situated herself in the bed and disappeared into the bathroom only to return with a warm damp cloth. In a move that mirrored one of the very first nights they’d spent together, though Rio didn’t know it as she’d been fast asleep at the time, Agatha  wiped gently at Rio’s face, tenderly soothing her hot and puffy skin and removing the evidence of many tears shed. She sealed her work with a soft kiss.</p><p>Rio watched the woman who did this with wide eyes, once again in awe of the tenderness that came so easily to Agatha when it was anything to do with her, for her. She wished that this woman, this iridescent creature before her would understand just how Rio felt about her, how she saw her. Because then she’d never feel less than. Then she’d never think she needed to try, to convince Rio of anything.</p><p>As Agatha pulled away, Rio’s hand snapped up to grab her wrist and she said quickly, “Take off your clothes. Just leave the cloth. Get in. I need you in here now.”</p><p>So Agatha did. She placed the cloth on the bedside table and stripped down quickly to her underwear before she slipped in beside Rio and immediately pulled her close to her, tangling their legs together under the heavy winter duvet.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip as Agatha’s body pressed against her own and she felt the swell of her breasts settle against her own as Agatha pushed her so she could hover over her, pressing gentle kisses over her lips.</p><p>Rio stroked her over the plains of a pale back and traced the faint textured lines of old scratches she’d left there over a week ago and found in them the courage to whisper, “Marry me. Soon. Sooner rather than later. Or I’ll keep asking. I’ll keep asking until you-…”</p><p>But Agatha cut her off by moving her hand up to cover Rio’s mouth and watched as Rio’s eyes went wide and the hot breath of her fiancée tickled her palm.</p><p>“I, Agatha Harkness, take you, Rio Vidal to be my-…”</p><p>Rio made a noise of protest against Agatha’s hand and Agatha simply smiled through it as she continued, “take you, Rio Vidal, to be my lawful wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.”</p><p>Agatha moved her hand slowly from Rio’s mouth, watching as wide eyes stared back at her and Rio’s mouth remained open, watching Agatha in confusion and shock even as she leant in to confirm her vows with a kiss.</p><p>Rio was brought back to life by this, clearing her throat softly as Agatha whispered against her lips, “You have to say in back.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha grin against her and gasped quietly as she pulled away again to look down at her properly with bright blue eyes had filled with the very same love and contentment that Rio felt deep in her chest and she faltered only slightly as she began: “I, Rio Vidal, take you, Agatha Harkness, to be my lawful wedded wife… in, in…” she swallowed thickly and watched as a slow tear emerged just on Agatha’s water line and raised her hand to cup her cheek, “to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do us part.”</p><p>Agatha released a soft gasp from where she’d been holding her breath and leant back in to kiss Rio again, allowing the younger woman to roll them so she was now on top, bearing down over Agatha with a lazy smile. “You’re such a romantic. It’s crazy you think you can hide it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but leant up to kiss Rio again, “I’ll make some calls tomorrow and we can… make it official?”</p><p>The question seemed shy to Rio, as if Rio might say no to this. As if privately repeating centuries old vows to each other in their safety of their bedroom was one thing but signing a legal document was just a step too far.</p><p>So Rio nodded and rested her forearms beside Agatha’s head, careful to avoid tugging on her loose hair, trying to think why Agatha might be suddenly hesitant. “If you need time to sort things out then that’s okay.”</p><p>“What would I need to sort?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and raised her brows, “A prenup?”</p><p>“Prenup?”</p><p>Agatha’s serene expression became suddenly confused, “Do you want one? I can get my lawyer to call and…”</p><p>“No, no,” Rio said with a deep frown, “I don’t have anything I need to protect from you. You wouldn’t want my apartment and I don’t have nearly as much money as you do I just-…”</p><p>“Rio, honey,” Agatha whispered with a matching frown, “I’m not planning on ever leaving you. And if you left me… I don’t care, take what you want.”</p><p>Rio’s frown deepened at this and she moved a hand down to hold Agatha’s face, “I’m afraid you’re stuck with me for life.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said quietly, “Then please don’t bring up divorce on our wedding day again.”</p><p>A slow smile threatened to split Rio’s face in two then as she gazed down at the woman she’d at least symbolically tied herself to for life and symbolically was good enough for her. If the book of symbols that she’d read through twice now from Lilia at Christmas had taught her anything it was that symbols could be a divine source of truth.</p><p>And as far as Rio was concerned, Catholic upbringing be damned, what she and Agatha had <em>was</em> divine.</p><p>Agatha’s hands began to move then, working their way down Rio’s back and causing it to arch as she dipped her fingers to the hollow of her lower back, “Would it be too much to consummate this marriage tonight?”</p><p>A laugh escaped Rio’s lips as looked down at Agatha, “Like you ever have to ask that? When have I denied you?”</p><p>Imperceptibly, Agatha shrugged as she moved her fingers slowly down to grasp Rio’s ass, squeezing her firmly and gasping when Rio rocked her hips down against her.</p><p>“You’ve had a lot to process this evening. I don’t want to push it if-…””</p><p>And not for the first time, Rio was reminded of how different it felt to be with someone as considerate as Agatha. Someone who was conscious of her own limits even if she weren’t always cognisant of them. And so she nodded slowly, the warmth of affection for her wife blossoming in her chest again: “I’m fine. I want you to touch me.”

</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to gasp then as Agatha rolled them over with ease, sliding her hands away from being trapped beneath Rio’s body and kneeling either side of her hips to throw the duvet up and off of her shoulders so that Rio was fully exposed and Agatha could take in the view.</p><p>Agatha bit down on her lower lip and reached her fingertips to just tickle across Rio’s abdomen, watching as goosebumps appeared there and she murmured, “My  beautiful wife.” </p><p>“Wife,” Rio whispered solemnly, letting the word roll off her tongue as if she were savouring it.</p><p>“Esposa,” Agatha agreed softly as she settled back over Rio’s thighs and let her fingers dance cautiously across hot abs that twitched beneath her touch.</p><p>Rio swallowed down the urge to scream it from the rooftops that Agatha was now, for all intents and purposes, her wife, and instead focused on the soft way she looked at her, taking her in as her fingers slipped down to the waistband of her underwear.</p><p>“I’ll get you a ring tomorrow,” Agatha said quietly, slipping her left hand down into Rio’s underwear and shifting her hips up slightly to get more movement.</p><p>“So that everyone knows. So that you can be publicly,” she reached down and pressed her ring finger slowly into Rio’s entrance, watching with parted lips as Rio gasped softly, “mine.”</p><p>Rio whimpered then because Agatha had rocked her own hips and her eyes fell to the visible wet patch on Agatha’s white underwear.</p><p>She went to sit to reach for Agatha but was pushed back down again and groaned in frustration at being denied being able to touch her wife.</p><p>“I want to see you,” Agatha said softly, arching a brow as she pressed her middle finger into Rio and slowly began to fuck her, her gaze sweeping up and down Rio’s body as it responded so deliciously to her every movement.</p><p>Rio didn’t take this with grace and instead scowled, whining as she gripped the sheets beside her warm body and watched where Agatha’s hand disappeared between them with frustration in her eyes, “All evening I’ve been… let me touch you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and paused her movements as she shifted where she sat, her thigh muscles flexing a little as she fought her self-control and gazed down at Rio, “What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t let you come first?”</p><p>When Rio was like this, panting with brown eyes so wide and dark they were almost black, Agatha found that the control she’d built up in every other aspect of her life simply dissipated. With Rio - especially with Rio like this - she could barely contain herself, barely hold herself back. She would keep Rio like this for days if she could, edging her slowly, jealously keeping her entirely focused on what her mouth, tongue, fingers, cock, could do.</p><p>Rio was the only one she’d willingly lose control for. She’d lost it when she first set out to find her, lost it when she’d hired her, when she’d fallen for her and tracked her down, asked her to move in, proposed.</p><p>And as she curled her fingers inwards and began to press in firmer she felt her stomach churn with desire at the pretty pattern of pink that flushed Rio’s already rosey cheeks.</p><p>Rio huffed and was about to protest again but Agatha had pressed a third finger inside of her and she groaned as she began to pump them more rigorously, reaching her palm to press her clit with each thrust.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio gasped, her legs straining to open wider for Agatha but unable to as they pressed desperately against Agatha’s legs.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t let her move, and only placed her free hand on her lower abdomen, pressing down as she continued to fuck her.</p><p>When Rio came she did with a cry of Agatha’s name, her body arching off the bed even as Agatha kept her hips pinned in place. She only slowed her movements down when Rio’s eyes flashed open again and her breathing had evened out but even then she only halted her hand, keeping her long fingers buried within the woman she could now call wife.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful,” Agatha murmured softly, stroking along Rio’s stomach as she eventually pulled her other hand from her.</p><p>Rio’s chest was a little pink and her cheeks were flushed as she gazed up at Agatha, a little starry eyed from her orgasm and hungry for the woman lording it over her.</p><p>She sat slowly, having to push herself up with her hands and instead of leaning up to kiss Agatha as she was expecting, she ducked her head down and pressed open-mouthed kisses across her chest, eventually wrapping her lips around a pert nipple and sucking hard, causing Agatha to gasp and clutch at her hair.</p><p>“God, fuck.”</p><p>Rio released Agatha’s nipple with a <em>pop</em> and moved her right hand down between them to press beneath the fabric of her underwear as she looked up at Agatha with a smile before she dipped her head again, forcing her breast up so she could latch back on to her nipple.</p><p>Agatha whined as Rio pressed into her with three fingers, stretching her out slowly despite the initial resistance and then moving in time to each buck of Agatha’s wanting hips.</p><p>Rio’s lips were swollen and her tongue was hungry to taste the salty skin across Agatha’s chest, the supple nipple that she went back to again and again to tease and suck and elicit such filthy noises from the woman above her.</p><p>Agatha like this, alive and uninhibited in her lap was almost too much for her to process. Her hair was a mess now, having long ago been pulled from the messy bun and now splayed out behind her as long fingers ran through it. Her back was arched into Rio’s waiting mouth and her hips were rocking helplessly above Rio’s desperate fingers and despite the acuteness of the angle, that she could already feel the strain along the tendon at the back of her hand and her wrist ached from the pressure, she fucked Agatha the only way she knew how: desperately, lovingly, the way she deserved.</p><p>Agatha came with a cry and Rio grunted as a final, heavy thrust of her hips pressed her hand painfully but she curled her fingers slowly and only pulled from her entirely when she was able to shift Agatha’s body weight away from her a little and adjust beneath her.</p><p>“You’re a goddamn goddess,” Rio breathed out against Agatha’s breast, unwilling to move far from her even as she moved both hands to hold her hips.</p><p>Agatha grunted softly in acknowledgement but reached to move Rio back, falling with her as her back hit the mattress. “And you are the wife of a goddess.”</p><p>They laughed together at the absurdity of it all, at the idea that not an hour ago, Rio had been physically shaking for fear of losing Agatha, that Agatha had been expecting Rio to leave her, and that they had both been pushed to the brink by someone who, in that moment, didn’t matter at all.</p><p>Agatha settled more fully over Rio, shuffling down to tuck her head into the crook of her neck and reaching for her left hand to raise it up and admire the ring she’d given her. “I should have got you a bigger one.”</p><p>Rio laughed again, deep and low in her chest, and Agatha sat up with a frown, “This ring is huge.”</p><p>“It could be bigger,” Agatha protested and Rio grinned at her, raising her brows, “I <em>knew</em> you were a size queen.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes down at Rio and dropped her hand as she shifted to hover over her again, hands either side of her head, which gave Rio a beautiful view of her wife’s face and chest and she took advantage by brushing her fingers over the trails of red marks she’d left with her teeth and lips.</p><p>“If we didn’t have a big day tomorrow I’d prove to you that it’s <em>you</em> who-…”</p><p>But Agatha’s words were caught short as Rio’s gaze snapped up and she looked suddenly panicked, “Tomorrow? What? You said you would quit. You said-…”</p><p>Agatha rolled off of Rio and manhandled her into her side, Rio only obliging her grabbing hands because her mind was reeling, “You said-…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha whispered softly, “And I am. Tomorrow will be the big finale. If we go it’ll avoid a big drama. We’ll go and I’ll be with you the whole time and then, I’m going to leave with you, and that will be it.”</p><p>Rio frowned deeply and squirmed in Agatha’s hold to be able to look at her properly, scanning for any sign that she was being tricked into this. “You’re serious. We’re going.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said slowly, a slight twitch in her brow told Rio that it wasn’t a demand, more of a request that she couldn’t quite bring herself to make and so Rio sighed heavily and rubbed a hand over her face. “Fine. Fine.”</p><p>“I’ll make it up to you.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“An actual wedding. Whatever kind of wedding you want. Big or small. Ridiculous or not. I’ll even let you throw one as big as Jen and Alice’s. I won’t complain once, I promise.”</p><p>“Didn’t we just agree that it was <em>you</em> who was the si-…?”</p><p>But Agatha had poked Rio in the side and Rio’s laughter overtook her teasing and she batted at Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Fine. But all I want is you and me and our hangers on.”</p><p>Agatha smirked at this and nodded just once, briefly pulling away so she could drag the heavy duvet back over them and then snuggle back into Rio.</p><p>Rio sighed happily, focusing on the blue eyes that gazed into her own and pressing herself so close that their noses touched and she could lean in just slightly to kiss Agatha again.</p><p>“You should sleep,” Rio whispered softly, her hand moving to place her fingers tips against Agatha’s cheek, “You’ve barely slept for weeks.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha protested quietly, but the subtle bags under her eyes and the way her body relaxed at the gentle instruction betrayed her.</p><p>Rio only hummed quietly and closed the distance between them to kiss Agatha firmly, lingering for a while before settling back down.</p><p>“Duerme, mi amor. Te amo.” <em>Sleep, my darling. I love you.</em></p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a soft smile and she squeezed Rio closer and whispered, “I love you.”</p><p>It was Agatha who fell asleep first and Rio lay vigil by her almost all night, until her body couldn’t take it any longer and she slipped reluctantly into a sleep that was the first peaceful sleep she’d had in weeks.</p><p>When she woke the next morning it wasn’t because Agatha had shifted against her or even because Agatha was gently nudging her to wake. It was because of a loud shout from somewhere else in the apartment. A shout from a familiar voice that wasn’t Agatha’s.</p><p>“Bagels! Agatha! I brought the bagels! They didn’t have poppy so I got sesame! I hope that’s okay!”</p><p>Rio groaned loudly and rubbed at her eyes roughly, rolling over to find… she was alone. Again. Agatha wasn’t in the bed.</p><p>She sat bolt upright and her gaze swept across the room but there was no sign. The only indication that Agatha had even been in the bed with her was the small, neat pile of her clothes on the chair by the window.</p><p>Swallowing down a sudden fear that Agatha had gone back on her word she turned to slip from the bed and saw her phone sitting on charge on the bedside table. Agatha.</p><p>She went to grab it and saw that it was just after 9:30am and that she had a handful of texts. The first was from Natasha.</p><p>11:17pm<br/>
Natasha Romanoff: Call me in the morning. Can I see you before you leave?</p><p>The next two were from Agatha.</p><p>8:32am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Good morning, my love. I’ll be back soon, I promise.</p><p>8:34am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I love you.</p><p>Rio flopped back onto her back with a relieved groan and smiled at the ceiling, soon laughing at the relief that washed through her.</p><p>“Oh my god!”</p><p>The yell took her by surprise and she launched up again, yelping at the sight of Billy standing in the now open door with his hand over his eyes. “Billy! Knock much?”</p><p>“God. She’ll kill me. Please don’t tell her.”</p><p>Rio huffed and moved quickly to grab Agatha’s bathrobe and threw it on before she rounded back on him again with a frown, “It’s fine. Just knock next time.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Billy cleared his throat and gingerly peaked through his fingers to squint at Rio. “Agatha asked me to bring your favourite bagels but they didn’t have poppy so I got sesame. Is that okay?”</p><p>“You’ve seen my tits, I’m sure sesame will be fine. Thank you.”</p><p>“If it helps, I’m gay so technically…”</p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes as she went to pull Billy’s hand from his face, “It’s fine. But I am hungry so would appreciate my bagel now please.”</p><p>Billy nodded and took Rio through to the kitchen where he’d apparently bought the whole shop and laid it out for her on the counter.</p><p>“Why so many?”</p><p>Rio picked a random foil wrapped bagel up and turned to frown at the boy now sorting the coffees. “Agatha said you would be hungry but she didn’t tell me how many to get so I just… got as many as I could carry.”</p><p>Rio laughed not unkindly and squeezed Billy’s arm gently before taking the offered coffee to her. “Cream and plenty of sugar.”</p><p>“You’re the best.”</p><p>“Please tell your fiancée that.”</p><p>Rio laughed again, but louder this time as she placed her coffee down and began to rip into the foil of her bagel. “She loves you.”</p><p>“She does <em>not</em>.”</p><p>“I promise you she does.”</p><p>“She only hasn’t fired me properly because you keep telling her not to.”</p><p>“She hasn’t fired you properly because you’re good at your job and she loves you.”</p><p>Billy shook his head but seemed a little more relaxed and settled back against the counter as he delicately picked at his own foil. “I’m glad you’re coming tonight. I’ve been dreading this for weeks.”</p><p>“Me too. A bunch of bigots in one room? No thanks.”</p><p>They fell into a companionable silence then, Rio devouring her bagel, having not had the heart to tell Billy that she didn’t care for sesame.</p><p>By the time she’d had one and a half and she had got down to the dregs of her coffee and started on the black one Billy had bought Agatha (having added her own cream and sugar to it), Agatha had arrived home.</p><p>She found the two of them still in the kitchen, Billy leaning up against the counter and Rio sitting on the opposite one, sitting beside the small mountain of bagels.</p><p>“Baby,” she grinned happily at the sight of Agatha looking cold but at least a little more refreshed than last night. Her nose was pink and as she moved across to press a kiss to Rio’s cheek she felt the chill of her skin from the cold winter’s day.</p><p>“Where have you been?”</p><p>Agatha grinned but simply turned on the spot, remaining stood between Rio’s legs and arching a brow across at Billy who looked less relaxed than he had five minutes ago.</p><p>“She doesn’t like sesame.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha ignored her and stole the coffee cup from her hand, taking a sip from it and grimacing, “You shouldn’t have any teeth left.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and draped her arms around Agatha’s neck, pressing a kiss to her cheek, “Where have you been?”</p><p>Billy cleared his throat and made to leave but Rio glanced up at him, “You can stay.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, unhappy with this instruction but unwilling to start an argument when she had more important things to attend to.</p><p>She turned in Rio’s hold and placed the disgusting excuse for a bodega coffee down as she reached into her deep jacket pocket and produced a small light blue box.</p><p>“I got us rings.”</p><p>And suddenly she wished Billy weren’t there in the room with her because Rio’s mouth fell open but the noise that swept the little room actually came from the young man opposite. “But you already got rings? Why do you need more rings?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pursed and her brow twitched a little but she seemed unwilling to address Billy in favour of focusing up on Rio.</p><p>Smiling a little in amusement and a little in awe, Rio’s hands fell to the side of Agatha’s neck as her gaze darted up to Billy. “Wedding rings. We’re married.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>But Rio’s attention was back on Agatha as she opened the little blue box and revealed two identical gold bands.</p><p><em>Symbols</em>, Rio thought. Symbols of the cycle of the universe. The concept of eternity. A boundary of protection. A whole life together.</p><p>Rio couldn’t find the words as Agatha went about gently removing Rio’s engagement ring, replacing it with the wedding ring, and then slipping the engagement ring back on top. She went to do the same for her own but Rio stopped her and did it herself, pressing one lingering kiss to Agatha’s fingers when she was done and grinning against her hand as she caught her eye.</p><p>“You two got married?” Billy asked incredulously from across the small space, unaware of the moment he was crashing.</p><p>“Technically,” Rio said softly, not looking away from Agatha.</p><p>“But? When? Last night?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent, her free hand moving to curl around Rio’s hip.</p><p>“Like, with witnesses and stuff? Did you wear white? Who did you invite? I can’t believe it.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and finally looked away from Agatha to gaze across at Billy with that same, ear-splitting grin, “we just did it for ourselves last night. But we will get married properly and you will, of course, be invited.”</p><p>Agatha made a huffing sound but remained silent still as Rio turned back to her with raised brows, “And I’m not sure about wearing white but there will be champagne and there will be everyone we love.”</p><p>She glanced at Billy quickly and offered him a softer smile, “Which includes you.”</p><p>Billy moved then so suddenly and so forcefully that he took both women by surprise and in one inelegant movement, he’d wrapped his arms around Agatha from behind and pressed her unhappily into Rio and the counter below her.</p><p>“Billy!”</p><p>But Rio laughed loudly even as Agatha’s face pressed against her sternum and she leant around to wrap her arms around them both, pressing a kiss to Billy’s cheek, “You’re squashing your boss.”</p><p>“Yes, you <em>are</em>,” Agatha huffed but turned her head when she realised that Rio’s robe was opened a little and pressed a kiss to her exposed skin. “Get off, Billy.”</p><p>Billy obliged but with a bright grin and laughed with Rio as he stepped away, “Does Alice know? Can I call her? Wait. Does Lilia know? She must already know. She predicted the engagement. We had to give her <em>hundreds</em> of dollars. It was practically my whole pay check.”</p><p>Agatha was groaning now and reluctantly turned from Rio to motion for Billy to get out. “Go. Now. News celebrated. Please leave us alone so we can celebrate privately.”</p><p>“Are you going to have sex on the counter?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly just as Agatha said, “Yes.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as Agatha shot her a glare but turned back to Billy, “Don’t call anyone. We haven’t told anyone yet and if that crazy Lilia calls at any point today you plead ignorance and tell her you don’t know. Okay?”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and ducked her head to stop herself from laughing at the juxtaposition of the Agatha who had got up early to run out and buy them both rings and the Agatha who was yelling at her assistant to leave them alone.</p><p>“We have work to discuss so don’t leave the apartment. Just, go sit on the couch and put headphones in or something.”</p><p>At the mention of work though Rio’s head snapped back up again and she tugged at Agatha’s jacket, “No, Billy. Wait. Stay. Agatha needs to talk to you about work now.”</p><p>“Billy. Go.”</p><p>“No,” Rio huffed and made to move off the counter but Agatha had turned and was holding her in place. “Billy. Stay.”</p><p>She turned to look down at Agatha with an amused smile. “Discuss it. Now. I’ll still be here later for…” she bent down to press a kiss to Agatha’s lips, “For whatever you want.”</p><p>This did not ease Agatha’s scowl and she rolled her eyes as she turned to Billy and waved a hand at him, aware of Rio slipping down from the counter behind her now.</p><p>“Fine. Couch. Grab my laptop and the blue and red folders from my desk drawer.”</p><p>“The blue one? But? Which is the red one? I…”</p><p>“The <em>blue</em> one, Billy. The red one is in my bottom drawer. The key’s in the bookcase. Open neither. Go. <em>Now.</em>.”</p><p>Billy stumbled from the room with all the grace of a newborn fawn and Agatha turned back to Rio again only to be met with a bright grin and raised brows, “I can’t believe my own wife just cockblocked me.”</p><p>“This way, you can get everything sorted and then we’ll have all day to do whatever we want.”</p><p>“What I want,” Agatha said with a frown, tugging at the belt of Rio’s robe to let it fall open fully, “Is to fuck my wife.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching Agatha with a smirk, “You’d subject the poor boy to sitting in the other room with headphones in whilst we fuck on the counter?”</p><p>“Yes. Didn’t I make that clear?”</p><p>“Sort the Stark stuff out first and then,” Rio gasped quietly as Agatha’s cold hands pushed her robe open more and skimmed over her breasts, “You can have me however you want me.”</p><p>“I want you now.”</p><p>“That’s not an option.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and slid her hands down to Rio’s ass and pulled her hips forwards to be flush against her, pressing her own forwards and watching with dark blue eyes as Rio’s expression went from amused to positively lecherous.</p><p>“You’re packing.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You went to buy us rings whilst-…?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You didn’t think to mention that when I was telling Billy he could stay?”</p><p>“You seemed pretty adamant you didn’t want to do anything.” Agatha’s eyes flashed dangerously as she pressed a little harder against Rio, “Besides I hear it’s ’not an option’ anymore.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha and moved her hands to grasp the fabric of her shirt, looking down between them where their bodies were pressed together. “He’ll be waiting.”</p><p>“And whose fault is that?”</p><p>Rio huffed and clenched her jaw, unable to look at Agatha anymore because she knew she was rapidly losing this fight and the longer she held out the less time they’d have.</p><p>“It’s so offensive that you think you can just waltz in here and expect me to drop to my knees for you.”</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting a blow job but if you’re offering.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and dared to glance back at Agatha as she slid her hand down between them to feel the firm length held securely between Agatha’s thighs, “What if he walks in?”</p><p>“I told him to stay on the couch. He won’t.”</p><p>Rio licked her lips and glanced down to Agatha’s waiting, parted ones, “Seeing as you went to all this trouble…”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a smirk and she moved the hands that had been dancing around Rio’s ribs to cup her cheeks and leant in to nip gently on her lower lip before she whispered, “Turn around.”</p><p>Rio’s brow quirked and she pulled her hand away from Agatha, turning as Agatha stepped back to give her room and placing her hands shoulder length apart on the countertop.</p><p>She heard a heavy thud and glanced behind her to see Agatha had dropped her heavy woolen coat to the ground and was slipping her black slacks from her body to reveal the large packer she’d kept hidden there. Rio bit down on her lip at the sight and pressed her thighs together as Agatha moved back in closer and pressed against her ass, placing soft kisses over her shoulder blade as she began to tug her silk robe down, allowing Rio to adjust so it could fall off completely.</p><p>Rio gasped as the cool air hit her skin and Agatha pressed back in against her, trailing her fingers down her sides and nuzzling in against her neck.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned softly, causing Agatha to hum in acknowledgement but not stop kissing across Rio’s bare shoulder.</p><p>“We don’t have time to…”</p><p>“We have time,” Agatha reassured as she moved her left hand down between Rio’s thighs and forced them open, groaning at the state she found there. “You’re dripping,” she accused with a smirk against the back Rio’s neck.</p><p>“What’s got you so worked up, baby?”</p><p>“Don’t tease,” Rio huffed, arching her back and attempting to press back more against Agatha who laughed throatily and adjusted herself to press two fingers inside of Rio, groaning as she clenched around her.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t listening and was instead scissoring her fingers slowly, kissing down Rio’s spine until she pulled away entirely.</p><p>Rio glared at Agatha over her shoulder and straightened up against the counter only to have her hips grabbed and thrust backwards, slamming into Agatha’s with a groan, “Patience.”</p><p>“You’re doing this on <em>purpose</em>.”</p><p>“Forgive me for taking my time to-…”</p><p>But Agatha was reaching between them and knocking Rio’s ankles out to get her to open her legs more as she ran the tip of the strap against her.</p><p>“-…enjoy my wife.”</p><p>Rio groaned and dropped her head down as Agatha mercifully began to press inside of her, causing her to press back and Agatha to halt her movements, marvelling as Rio took charge and bottomed out on her.</p><p>“What was that I just said about patience?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and moved her hands back to Rio’s hips, her thumbs tracing slow circles as she leant back to properly enjoy the view as she began to rock her hips, barely pulling out and instead thrusting slow and deep, her grip tightening with every movement.</p><p>Rio’s initial confidence that she could control the pace vanished almost immediately and she was soon reliant on the counter and Agatha’s firm grip to hold her up as Agatha fucked her harshly, clearly unconcerned that there were thin walls between the little kitchen and where Billy was in the living room.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio insisted but it was more of a grunt and Agatha ignored it even as Rio strained to look behind her.</p><p>Agatha pulled out then suddenly, wanting the reaction she knew she’d get and grinning devilishly when Rio groaned and almost fell backwards against her as she tried to follow her movement.</p><p>“Fuck you,” she mumbled as Agatha reached around her waist and held her up, pulling her straight up and back against her.</p><p>“I believe I’m the one doing the fucking,” she husked into Rio’s ear as she pressed the strap back to Rio’s entrance and began to thrust slow and deep into her, not giving Rio a second to adjust as she sunk her teeth into her neck and gripped her breast to hold her in place against her.</p><p>Rio was desperately trying to be quiet despite everything Agatha was doing to make her not so.</p><p>And she arched her back and reached behind her to grab at Agatha’s hip as she reached down to massage her own clit, gasping with each thrust of Agatha’s cock.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha groaned against Rio’s neck, her own breathing getting heavier as she replaced Rio’s hand with her own. “My job,” she breathed into Rio’s ear, nipping at her earlobe as she continued to bully her clit.</p><p>Rio’s whole body was beginning to ache and she felt the pressure build as she tightened around Agatha’s strap, groaning at the feeling of Agatha pressing into her as deep as she could get.</p><p>Despite everything she’d tried to hold onto, Rio came with a cry and Agatha moved as she did to press her up against the tall refrigerator, pressing her top half against it so she could get a better angle to continue driving her cock into Rio’s cunt, chasing her own orgasm as she continued to help Rio ride out hers.</p><p>Rio grunted and had to grab Agatha’s hand away, as sensitive as she now was. Agatha took the opportunity to grasp Rio’s hips and guided her with every thrust to rock back against her, eventually coming hard and collapsing against her wife’s naked form.</p><p>Rio groaned softly, reaching back to hold Agatha against her, as if she could physically be any closer.</p><p>Agatha huffed out a breath against Rio’s neck and kissed her there, teasing the tender flesh she’d bruised earlier with her tongue.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio whined, her thighs quaking a little from where Agatha was still buried deep in her.</p><p>Agatha just grunted and rocked her hips one last time just because she could before she slowly pulled out, but pressed herself back close to Rio again to continue kissing along her neck and shoulder lazily.</p><p>Rio reached her arm up and over to scratch at Agatha’s scalp and hummed happily as she leant her head backwards, “Who says sex gets worse after marriage?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and slowly pulled away to allow Rio to turn in her arms so she could press her back against the refrigerator properly and her lips found her neck again, found her jaw, found her lips.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispered gently, nudging their noses together affectionately and squeezing Rio’s waist.</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p>Rio hummed happily, sliding her hands down to loosen the harness for Agatha and help her slide it from her hips.</p><p>”What if I wasn’t done with that yet?”</p><p>Rio laughed as the strap clattered to the floor between them and Agatha unceremoniously kicked it away. “I’m telling you we are.”</p><p>”For now, maybe.”</p><p>Agatha pressed their bodies close again, holding Rio steady against the refrigerator and soothing her racing heart with gentle kisses across her collarbones, up her throat, and settling at her lips.</p><p>Rio allowed this; Rio welcomed this. Her body was alive beneath Agatha’s gentle attentions and her head swirled with the growing comfort that came from being close to Agatha. But as Agatha began to pull away, to brush their lips just one last time, Rio’s mind woke up again and even the sight of soft baby blues couldn’t shake away her nervousness for what they would have to face that evening. Though, at least, they’d face it together.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Billy Kaplan was a good kid by all accounts.</p><p>As a teenager he’d rebelled only by getting his ears pierced and attending protest marches that his parents agreed with the sentiment of, but not the danger Billy could potentially be putting himself in.</p><p>He’d come out at an early age, having known himself at an even <em>earlier</em> age that he liked boys. He’d never felt any shame over it and his parents hadn’t either.</p><p>And for as long as he could remember he’d been obsessed with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>As certain young people often are, Billy was drawn to the beautiful woman precisely because she was beautiful. But also because she was powerful. And when she occasionally appeared in his father’s boring political shows, he was mesmerised. She’d come on for a segment, shut down the room with her commanding presence and just occasionally, let everyone in a little with a well-timed joke or jibe, and once, so dizzying to Billy that he thought he’d imagined it, she’d even winked.</p><p>And so, whilst the Magic Circle was once his career path of choice, by the age of fifteen he’d decided a career in politics was for him. And one day he’d grow up to be Agatha Harkness.</p><p>By the time he was twenty two he’d graduated from college and found himself an internship at some grotty rag that made its money gossiping about politicians and their circles. But at least it took him to DC.</p><p>And whether fate or pure coincidence, on one particularly warm day in mid-July, he’d been tasked with following Agatha Harkness to a local coffee shop that was off the beaten track and according to his boss ‘was for down and outs and those with hygiene issues’. But they’d been given a tip-off that Agatha had been spotted there twice over the last month and as Billy was the lowest on the food chain, Billy was chosen to go.</p><p>Despite the fear that struck through him at even being in the same room as Agatha, he’d gone along, dressed as he usually would, which was <em>unusual</em> for DC.</p><p>The coffee shop was a small one, warm, and inviting. Everything was made from solid wood that was smoothed and varnished down to look like the insides of an old wizard’s home. There were trinkets, seemingly hundreds of plants, and old vintage photo frames with a plethora of strange faces staring back at the clientele as they sipped their matcha or stirred their cappuccinos.</p><p>Billy couldn’t think of any place he’d be <em>less</em> likely to see Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And even if he did see her, he was unclear as to what his boss would like him to do. He, Billy, would like to tell her how much he admired her and ask her whether she’d give him a job, but he wasn’t convinced that the Editor In Chief at <em>The Washington Insider</em> would be thrilled with that.</p><p>And so he sat, for five days straight, nursing his one filter coffee each day for nigh on seven hours. The staff left him alone, sympathetic to his measly pocket change every time he pulled out pennies and dimes to pay for his coffee. On the third, fourth, and fifth days, a friendly barista even brought him over a free pastry at lunch because he looked tired, skinny, and stressed.</p><p>By day six, after having received a bollocking from his boss the night before about having produced nothing from five days of “work”, Billy dragged himself to the coffee shop as early as he physically could manage.</p><p>It was 7am, at least five hours before he’d like to be awake on a Saturday, and as he approached the small shopfront he noticed a familiar figure waiting there.</p><p>“You. Do you work here?”</p><p>Billy actually whimpered, his whole body in total shock as Agatha Harkness whipped around to speak to him.</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and lowered the phone she had in her hands, watching Billy with a mixture of curiosity and disgust.</p><p>Suddenly the ripped grey t-shirt he was wearing didn’t feel so devil-may-care of him.</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“No, I-…”</p><p>But Billy’s dignity was saved by a touch to his arm as the kind barista who always gave him free pastries appeared by his side.</p><p>“Billy. Hi. You’re here early.”</p><p>Billy grimaced out a smile and then glanced back at Agatha who was now looking to the new person in their little tete-a-tete.</p><p>“Doesn’t this place open at 6am?”</p><p>“Only during the week. Not many people are looking for matcha at 7am on a Saturday.”</p><p>“Well it’s 7:05 and I’ve been here at least twenty minutes.”</p><p>The barista raised her brows and Billy thought he caught her blush beneath Agatha’s stern gaze but she hurried around them and produced a large set of keys to let them all in.</p><p>Agatha didn’t acknowledge it as the door was held for her and instead strode over to a little table in the very back of the small space and barked, “Americano. Black. Extra shot.”</p><p>Billy moved through the small space like he was in a trance and just about managed to make polite small talk with the hurried barista without collapsing on the spot.</p><p>By the time his filter coffee was ready and Agatha’s was too, he’d gathered up the courage to request that he deliver Agatha her coffee.</p><p>If only he wasn’t shaking like a leaf this would have been the perfect power move.</p><p>But he managed to slosh half Agatha’s coffee all over his hand and ignored the sharp burning sensation as he placed it down before the woman now staring at him as if she wanted to kill him.</p><p>“So you do work here.”</p><p>“No, I-…”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow and looked from her half-filled coffee mug to the pale boy before her with the now pink hand. “If you worked for me you’d be fired for much less than that.”</p><p>Billy swallowed thickly and hurried out in a stream of words, “I’d like to work for you actually my name is Billy Kaplan and I’ve followed you for years and I think that I could really help you I’ve looked you up and I know you don’t have an assistant but I think that with your schedule and the demand for your services you could use one and I know I’d be good I know I’d help and I’d really really like to try.”</p><p>After a long period of silence where Billy thought he’d either wither beneath Agatha’s gaze or else lose his hand from the red-hot pain of it, Agatha spoke: “I come here because no one bothers me.”</p><p>“Yes I-…”</p><p>“Did you follow me here?”</p><p>“No, I was told that-…”</p><p>“By whom?”</p><p>“My boss said-…”</p><p>“Boss?”</p><p>“I work for <em>The Insider</em>.”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha deadpanned and made to stand but Billy had reached for her and inadvertently grabbed her breast.</p><p>Both were so shocked that neither did anything for a second and Billy could only stare at where his hand was against Agatha, could only think that the one time he’d ever touched a boob <em>would</em> be when he was meeting his hero for the first time.</p><p>The slap to his hand came quickly and violently, and Billy looked up to see that where he had been on a loser before, there was no way to come back from this.</p><p>“I could have you locked up for that.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to. I mean-… I’m gay so I didn’t even enjoy it. I mean-…”</p><p>Agatha sneered and pushed past him, furious that her quiet morning had been ruined by some prick with a crush.</p><p>“You’re paying for my coffee. If I see you here again, I’m calling the police.”</p><p>Billy didn’t have time to reply before Agatha swept from the little cafe.</p><p>His next attempts to get Agatha to hire him were just as unsuccessful. He cornered her three more times in the quaint little coffee shop, this time keeping a safe distance so he wouldn’t inadvertently grope her again, and all three times he hadn’t managed to get a word out of her. She always swept in, picked up her usual order, and swept out again.</p><p>But by the fourth time, his luck had changed.</p><p>Because Agatha wasn’t alone.</p><p>It was a Sunday morning, a day Billy had yet to try in his attempts to capture the attention of his boyish idolisation. And Agatha wasn’t in a power suit, didn’t even have her phone in her hands. Instead she was carrying a string tote bag with a baguette sticking out of it, wearing dark jeans and a plain white t-shirt with a chunky gold chain around her neck. She looked relaxed, almost happy, and Billy couldn’t believe what he was seeing.</p><p>But most surprising to Billy was the woman beside her who rocked a worn leather jacket and battered old docs. She was shorter than Agatha, her hair choppy, and the laughter in her voice unmistakeable as it carried across the small space.</p><p>“-… and I just told her I couldn’t imagine anything <em>worse</em> than a big wedding and she’ll have to wait anyway because there’s no way she’ll propose to me and until she changes her mind about having a red carpet outside whatever palace she picks I’m not getting down on one knee.”</p><p>“Liar,” Agatha uttered, and Billy sat up straighter when he caught the smirk on Agatha’s face, not unfriendly this time, but warm and intimate, aimed at this Asian woman who must be a friend.</p><p>But the woman had ignored this comment and was instead turning her attention to the cafe about her, frowning as she took the small space in and briefly glancing at Billy, one of the only other customers in the space.</p><p>“This isn’t very-…”</p><p>“It’s quiet. The plants relax me.”</p><p>The other woman raised her brows and watched Agatha as closely as Billy currently was.</p><p>He leant forward.</p><p>“You know Lilia was mentioning something about you and plants the other day. Foliage. Green energy. How it would be important in your-…”</p><p>“A black Americano. Extra shot. And a chai.”</p><p>Agatha rounded back on her friend after giving her order and for a heart-stopping second her eyes landed on Billy and narrowed.</p><p>“Listen you little shit,” her voice raised despite there being no need to project in such a small space and Billy scrambled to his feet, knocking what was left of his cold filter in the process to get to Agatha not two feet away.</p><p>“Who might this be?” The other woman said, stepping in front of Agatha and tensing slightly but looking at Billy curiously.</p><p>“Some teen who thinks he’s-…”</p><p>“I’m Agatha’s new assistant.” <em>Desperate times</em>, Billy thought.</p><p>Agatha scoffed and the woman before him raised her brows in surprise. “You are?”</p><p>“No. He’s not. He’s some kid from a rag who wants to get the scoop on me.”</p><p>“No,” Billy insisted suddenly, panicked that this may be his last shot. “No, I’m your biggest fan. I-… I’ve been following your career for years. I think you’re incredible and powerful and I know I could be useful to you. I’m smart and capable and I have a good memory and I’ve learnt everything there is to know about what you do and your work and I really really feel I could help.”</p><p>Agatha had rolled her eyes and was turning away just as the other woman softened a little, “I don’t know, Agatha. Seems harmless. And you <em>do</em> need some help. You’re a busy woman.”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond and was now tapping her fingers impatiently on the counter so Billy turned his attention to the other woman, assuming he might have more luck there.</p><p>“Hi, Billy Kaplan. I really do know everything there is to know about Ag-…”</p><p>“Voting records for Senator McAllan,” Agatha snapped suddenly, turning to eye Billy now as he shook hands with her friend. “Past five yeas and nays. Go.”</p><p>Billy swallowed but nodded and rushed out, “Nay, nay, yea, yea, but that’s it he’s only been sitting long enough for-...”</p><p>“Coffee order? Where is she in her cycle?” The other woman asked with a smile, watching Billy in amusement and ignoring her friend behind her as she huffed.</p><p>“Black Americano. Extra shot. And on Tuesday she ordered a cinnamon roll so maybe-...”</p><p>“I’m Alice,” the other woman said brightly, interrupting before Billy could dig himself a deeper hole, “and I’m hiring you for her.”</p><p>“Alice,” Agatha snapped, as she tossed a ten dollar bill on the counter and accepted her coffees, “We’re leaving.”</p><p>“Here,” Alice said quickly, fishing for her cell and handing it over to Billy who couldn’t quite believe his luck. “Number. Quick. She’ll call you tomorrow.”</p><p>“I will not.”</p><p>“Healthcare and dental provided. Any issues with any of her demands you contact me, okay?”</p><p>Billy’s thumbs were shaking so violently that he almost dropped Alice’s phone but he just about managed to input his number and hand it back as Agatha made it to the door.</p><p>Alice accepted the phone with a grin and ran after Agatha to hold the door for her. The two looked at each other and Agatha looked stern for a second before she looked back to Billy.</p><p>“Tell your boss he can have you back if you so much as put a toe out of line. I have dry cleaning I need picked up on tomorrow. You’ll be a glorified-…”</p><p>But Alice had interrupted her with a laugh and turned back to Billy with a grin, “She’ll soften. See you, Billy Kaplan.”</p><p>With that, she turned to follow her furious friend out of the little cafe and Billy collapsed back into his chair.</p><p>From that moment on, despite even being passed to Jen like a discarded toy one Christmas, Billy’s adoration of and loyalty to Agatha only grew. The scraps of kindness he got from her, the apathetic way she barked orders but never <em>actually</em> fired him spurred him on to be the best assistant he could be. He listened and learned and made notes and sent emails and fetched dry cleaning and food and coffee and ordered everything in advance of Agatha’s needs.</p><p>The only thing she didn’t allow was Billy fetching or doing anything that pertained to Rio. (Other than the occasional bagel order when she was otherwise engaged).</p><p>Billy had once sent Rio flowers with a note from ‘Agatha’ the day after he’d witnessed a particularly large row in the kitchen over a comment Rio had overheard Agatha making about Stark’s upcoming speech about abortion.</p><p>Rio had known immediately they weren’t from Agatha because Agatha always wrote her notes to Rio in Spanish now. But Billy couldn’t have known that. That was just for them.</p><p>And whilst Rio hadn’t dropped him in it, and had instead privately thanked Billy for his thoughtfulness, Agatha had asked where the flowers came from and had spotted the little card hidden in the elaborate arrangement before Rio could stop her.</p><p>Billy had then been subjected to a day straight from the depths of hell because of his mistake.</p><p>Even when Billy had explained that he couldn’t stand the idea of them falling out because of what he and Agatha were doing, that he couldn’t stand being the cause of Rio’s distress and pain because actually he agreed that what they were doing was wrong, she hadn’t backed down.</p><p>She’d started by shouting. Then she’d reverted to the silent treatment, and finally, when they were done for the day, she’d pulled him aside after a particularly long, and very dull, meeting and spoken to him in a way she had never done before. She wasn’t angry anymore, she was upset.</p><p>“My relationship with Rio is mine, okay? I understand that you’re her friend and you love her but I want you to stay out of it. If we have an argument then it’s mine to fix. And I won’t let you try to fix it for me and I won’t allow you…” She sighed and took a slow, deep breath, “Be there for her if she needs you, obviously. But not as my proxy. Not in my stead. If she’s upset send her flowers yourself if you want to cheer her up but don’t do it from me.”</p><p>Billy had understood and hadn’t intervened ever again. But he also noticed that even if things got tense around the house in D.C. that both Agatha and Rio seemed to restrain themselves from shouting at each other in front of him. And Billy wondered whether it was a conscious decision on both their parts or if one of them had stepped in to protect him from any future trauma or distress. His money was on Rio for that one but just once he caught Agatha glancing at him surreptitiously after Rio had made a comment about Stark’s appearance on tele the night before and for a brief moment he wondered if instead it had been Agatha who was looking out for him.</p><p>But it had been as fleeting as the time he’d seen her wink on tv.</p><p>He came to think of them both as his older sisters. One was softer than the other but he knew both loved him in their own ways.</p><p>And he loved them back. Fiercely.</p><p>But all of this, Billy being a loyal and true assistant, his admiration of Agatha, his love for her, and his love for her now wife, meant that he went to fetch the blue folder that he knew to be in Agatha’s top left drawer and he also went to find this mysterious red folder that he hadn’t known existed until two minutes ago, without complaint.</p><p>He hurried in his search for it, determined to have heavy metal blasting in his ears as quickly as possible to avoid listening to whatever was going to happen in the kitchen.</p><p>When he eventually found the little key to the bottom desk drawer he reached in and pulled out a large, heavy, deep maroon folder and noticed the small padlock that hung from its zip.</p><p>Unwilling to hang around any longer, he assumed Agatha would have the key, and he took it under his arm and bolted from the room to get to the far end of the living room and sit with his tunes on and his eyes closed (just in case).</p><p>Because he was so determinedly down by two senses, he didn’t notice Agatha and Rio both appearing in the living room about an hour later, both with wet hair and both a little flushed, until Rio playfully ruffled his hair after removing his headphones for him.</p><p>“Hey, kid. I’m sorry about that.”</p><p>“No, no,” Billy said quickly, avoiding eye contact with Rio who looked a little sheepish. “It’s fine. It’s an exciting time. I understand you want to… celebrate.”</p><p>“No more celebrating for now. I promise.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly and grabbed his hand to drag him back to the sitting area where Agatha was already sitting on the couch, poring over the contents of the blue folder. The red one sat conspicuously on the back corner of the table, untouched.</p><p>Rio disappeared off to make everyone more coffee, having had a quick shower that was made slightly less quick with Agatha insistent that they take their time.</p><p>“You’ll have questions,” Agatha said with a heaviness to her tone that Billy knew meant he had to lock in, that she was fully in work mode already and had no patience for anything else.</p><p>“Plenty of them. But I can’t give you answers and you’ll just have to trust me to-…”</p><p>“I trust you,” Billy interjected quickly, looking at Agatha with that familiar look of wide-eyed loyalty that made Agatha feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p>“Fine,” she said just as quickly, looking away to pull out a document from the blue folder and sliding it along to Billy. “Sharon Hart. Our new candidate.”</p><p>“Hart? But, she’s a Democrat. And not even the favourite for the primaries.”</p><p>“She’s going to be president. We’re going to make her president.”</p><p>There was silence in the room again as Agatha continued to sift through the heavy folder, pulling out relevant sheets and important policy documents.</p><p>“Agatha,” Billy said slowly, reading over the sheet she’d pushed towards him. “What about Stark? We’ve spent months-…”</p><p>“I know. I told you I can’t answer all your questions. And what we’re doing now has to be done quietly. In the shadows. I called Hart on my way out this morning. She’s-…”</p><p>But Rio had returned to the room carrying the coffees on a tray alongside a plate of cookies that she knew to be Billy’s favourites.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her and cleared her throat softly, “I’ve been prepping for her for weeks now. I’ve everything we need to-…”</p><p>“I don’t understand.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said, her tone softening a little maybe because Rio had just placed her coffee before her and kissed her on the top of the head, maybe because she genuinely felt sorry for the one eighty she was pulling on Billy. “But it’s what’s happening. It has to be discreet but it’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>Billy watched as Agatha turned then to Rio and watched as she took her spot in Agatha’s usual place, curling her legs up beneath her.</p><p>“It’s just us and Hart’s inner circle who’ll know.” Agatha started again, her eyes drifting back to Billy. “We’ll feed her everything she needs and she’ll be announced at the DNC as the runner. Then, in November, she’ll be announced as the president.”</p><p>“But if no one knows and we actually pull it off then we won’t get any of the credit.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha agreed with an arched brow as she slipped from the couch and settled cross-legged on the floor by the files, “But it’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>Billy nodded slowly, watching the resolve on his bosses face, seeing if this were some sort of strange prank or joke, but he couldn’t think why Agatha would joke about this and so he cleared his throat and gestured to the red folder.</p><p>“Is this… is this something to do with it?”</p><p>Agatha stiffened a little and glanced at the folder too, “No. That’s something else. Nothing you need to concern yourself with.”</p><p>From Rio’s position in the armchair, she could look down and see the twitch in Agatha’s fingers that rested on her knees and she glanced at the red folder too, her eyes landing immediately on the little padlock still attached to it. She could guess what it contained.</p><p>Agatha’s mind raced behind calm blue eyes as she dragged them away from the folder and looked up at Rio.</p><p>Seeing her looking at the folder too she moved her hand to run through her hair and swallowed thickly, wanting this to be over sooner rather than later.</p><p>“Could you call Natasha?”</p><p>Rio blinked and then frowned at this request, lost for a second as to where her best friend fit into this new scheme of Agatha’s.</p><p>“I want to talk to her about… the other thing.”</p><p>Billy, from his position on the floor by the coffee table looked between the two women as if they were batting a ball back and forth, his head swivelling to and fro, “Natasha? What’s she got to do with Hart? Or Stark?”</p><p>“Billy,” Agatha said with finality, turning her gaze from her confused wife to the boy now staring at her. “I’ll give you twenty minutes and I’ll give you as much information as you need but then I want you to go into my office and stay there. You don’t need to be here when Natasha arrives.”</p><p>“You want her to come?”</p><p>Agatha glanced back at Rio then and nodded, “Yes. Could you get her to?”</p><p>Rio nodded and stood from her seat, glancing at Agatha one last time before she left the room to make the call.</p><p>Agatha turned back to Billy then and sighed as he took the opportunity to say everything that was on his mind. “I’ve proven myself to you. I’ve done everything you’ve ever asked. I’m good at what I do. I never complain. I didn’t even complain when you shipped me to England. I never ask for anything. Why are you shutting me out of this? What’s in the folder?”</p><p>Agatha pulled her knees up and shook her head, turning from Billy to look towards the folder again, “It’s for your own good. It’s not a punishment.”</p><p>Billy stood then, turning away from his boss and the files scattered on the table, looking for anything and everything in the room to calm him down. But he found no solace anywhere.</p><p>It was maybe one minute, maybe two, as he stewed and listened to the noises of Agatha behind him rifling through the pages before her, before he finally turned and unleashed.</p><p>“But how can it be fair that Natasha gets to know and I don’t. And Rio… Rio knows and you’ve been telling me for weeks I have to keep quiet about everything we’re doing with Stark so I don’t upset her and now-…”</p><p>“Billy, it’s complicated and you do not want to be involved in this. I’m not even going to allow Rio to-…”</p><p>But Rio had just walked back in and raised her brows at this comment. “Allow me to what?”</p><p>She settled back in the armchair but this time with her phone in her hand, watching as Agatha looked suddenly caught.</p><p>“Allow you to-…”</p><p>“It’s the ‘allow’ part I’m having trouble with,” Rio said with a slight smile dancing on her lips that let Agatha know that whilst she wasn’t pleased, she also wasn’t in deep trouble. Yet.</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and ran her hands down her thighs as she sighed out all the frustration of keeping things from Rio, still trying to keep her safe. “Look-…”</p><p>But she was interrupted again, this time by Billy.</p><p>He had placed his hands on his hips, his gaze darting between Rio and Agatha. The tennis match had resumed. “We both deserve to know.”</p><p>“Agreed,” Rio smirked a little, reaching for her coffee before curling back in on herself and watching for Agatha’s reaction, which, to her surprise, was more pained than cross.</p><p>“I’m not keeping it from you to punish you. Either of you,” she looked across at Rio with raised brows before turning back to Billy. “I am telling you that it’s-…”</p><p>But Rio interrupted her this time, “It’s fine, Agatha. If it’s what I think it is then… Billy, she’s right. You don’t need or want to know.”</p><p>Agatha made to sit up then, reaching for her own coffee and staring into the black steaming liquid as Billy started up again. She wished she could drown herself in it.</p><p>“Not you too. I’m not a kid, you know. I’m-…”</p><p>“Billy,” Rio said gently, “trust me on this one.”</p><p>Billy looked furious still and his hands had become fists at his sides as he gaped at Rio, unsure where in this little conversation she’d switched sides but knowing that against Agatha, he didn’t stand a chance.</p><p>“I have proven that I am-…”</p><p>“Billy,” Agatha said more firmly this time, leaving no room for argument in the two syllables of his name. “Enough. I need you to go over Hart’s schedule and make notes against any upcoming speeches and appearances in the rust belt. We need to start on the lobbying sooner rather than later. Her team are shit and we need to make them do better. I’ve advised her on some of her stances but she’s reluctant to soften and we need her to.”</p><p>Billy looked ready to argue again but seemed to think better of it and began quickly and aggressively scooping up the sheets of paper that Agatha had been rifling through. Agatha said nothing at the sight of this and Rio chewed her lip.</p><p>By the time Billy was out the room, Agatha looked a little less tense and Rio frowned over at her.</p><p>“It’s the Wanda stuff, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“I’m staying.”</p><p>Agatha sighed deeply and placed her coffee back down as she uncurled herself and stood up, her eyes drifting across to Rio. “You shouldn’t. You don’t need to know a lot of the stuff in that folder and-…”</p><p>“I’m assuming you need some of it translated. Hence Natasha. So if the two most important people in the world to me know what’s in there then I need to too.”</p><p>Agatha had remained still where she stood, the telltale sign of her stress levels rising being the fingers that twitched by her side. She took Rio in. Took her words in. And knew that arguing over this would only prolong an already stressful day and so she nodded and dropped her gaze. “Fine. But only because-…”</p><p>“Because we’re wives now and we are equal partners in everything?”</p><p>As if an invisible shroud had been lifted, Agatha’s whole body relaxed as she was reminded of that one precious thing, that it was now her wife she was denying, her wife who wanted in, wanted to help.</p><p>She moved forwards then, swooping down towards Rio like a ship finding its port in a storm.</p><p>She sank to her knees before her and she reached her hands up to grasp at the soft fabric of old sleep shorts with too jaunty a pattern for such an intense morning.</p><p>Rio frowned deeply and raised her coffee-warmed fingers to brush some still-damp hair from Agatha’s face. “You’ve been doing three jobs. The Stark campaign, trying to nail Wanda, and Hart?”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, conscious that everything she’d been doing in secret was now out there in the open and Rio would be exposed to information that could be dangerous.</p><p>“I wish you’d brought me in. I wish you’d-…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha interrupted her eyes watchful as they took in that same soft expression she was so familiar with now but would never be used to. “Is she coming? Did you ask?”</p><p>“She’s on her way,” Rio said with a curious frown, watching the thoughts swirl in bright blue eyes, “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and looked down at the happy, yellow stars across Rio’s shorts that mocked her so. She released her hold on the fabric, realising how tight it had been and trailed her the pads of her fingers slowly down to warm, toned thighs as Rio spoke again.</p><p>“I’m going to ask this once, okay? Then never again. Is there <em>anything</em> I can do that will help this go away? Make Wanda go away?”</p><p>Rio edged around the actual question: would Wanda leave them alone if she could have her? Just for a night? Was she putting Agatha through this because she knew she’d go to the ends of the earth to not let Wanda touch Rio?</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and grit her teeth so hard she was sure she would crack one - but cracking a tooth was better than cracking Wanda’s neck. At least for now.</p><p>“Please don’t ask me that ever again.”</p><p>Rio nodded silently in response to these stilted words, leaning in to press a reassuring kiss to Agatha’s pursed lips, letting her fingers dance along the hard line of her jaw. “Agatha, I’m yours. No one’s taking me away. I just want to help.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away slowly, her eyes fluttering open to watch as her hands skimmed along the top of Rio’s legs, and until she was far back enough, resting on the backs of her ankles that her fingers rested delicately on Rio’s knees.</p><p>She took a slow, deep breath and kept her gaze on her left hand, watching the light sparkle off of her rings. “I need Natasha to translate something for me. To know what it says. What Wanda has been communicating. And then… tonight will be the end of it. And it can just be the two of us, like it always should have been.”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s face set alarm bells ringing in Rio’s mind. Her jaw was still set, her brow still furrowed, but her eyes were darting now, moving from her rings to Rio’s knees, her stomach, her shorts, everywhere but Rio’s own gaze, and so she knew she was hiding something.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio muttered cautiously, leaning down to curl a finger below her chin and lift her gaze, “What are you not telling me?”</p><p>“You know everything,” Agatha said quietly, but her eyes were focused now on her wife’s full lips rather than her gaze and she moved her hands slowly up tanned thighs to grip Rio’s shorts once more. “Or you will soon. As soon as Natasha gets here.”</p><p>But something had changed in Agatha’s tone and eyes that set Rio on edge a little and she dipped her head to get her attention properly, “Agatha. This ends tonight, okay? Promise me?”</p><p>But Agatha was looking away again, staring down at the dancing stars of Rio’s shorts and for a brief moment she allowed herself to think of how cruel it was that Rio would wear these sinfully small shorts when she had to focus, had to lock in, and not think about how much of her wife’s flesh was on view, tantalisingly accessible to her.</p><p>She looked away again, letting her fingers sneak past the hem of Rio’s shirt to skim the warm skin of her sides, allowing herself this before she spoke again. “Yes. Tonight. I promise.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and reached down to take Agatha’s hands in her own, pulling them from under her shirt, taking her time to press her lips at the soft skin of Agatha’s inner wrist by her watch that bore the promise she’d had engraved there. She turned her head to nudge Agatha’s fingers and pressed her lips then to Agatha’s palm, and heard Agatha’s breath hitch as her tongue darted out to graze the soft skin there.</p><p>Other than her breathing picking up slightly, the telltale sign that Agatha’s telltale heart was impacted by Rio’s attentions was the soft blush that tickled her cheeks and Rio took advantage of Agatha’s stupor and leant in closer to press their lips together, lingering longer than necessary to revel in her captured audience.</p><p>But she had to break the spell, had to say the thing that would bring Agatha back down to earth, and so she said it softly, breathing the poison against Agatha’s lips and hoping she wouldn’t drink it.</p><p>“Whatever Natasha translates today, it won’t change what I want, okay? I just want you. Away from all this. Don’t let it sway you into pursuing this.”</p><p>Agatha barely moved in front of Rio, barely acknowledged her words, barely registered them, so in her own body as she was, fighting to restrain herself from devouring Rio where she sat.</p><p>Her mind was whirling still from all the secrets and lies she held in at once, had been holding in for months, and her body’s reality, her desire for Rio almost eclipsing everything her wired brain was still trying to process.</p><p>She felt desperate for the woman before her. More desperate than usual. More hungry for her than she’d ever been.</p><p>But Rio had moved her left hand up to cup Agatha’s cheek again, seeking the attention that she knew had drifted someplace else and Agatha realised when the  metal of Rio’s rings brushed her skin what had happened.</p><p>Rio had been a hired body, a rented heart, and someone she had to share with others, someone she might lose, and now, now she was her wife and she did, finally, belong to her.</p><p>And it made Agatha more desperate than she’d ever been before.</p><p>It made her want to devour Rio and live inside of her.</p><p>She felt the blush rise up her cheeks as the realisation hit her that she was an actual wife guy and it had made her want Rio more, want to bury her burning face against her neck and claim her like she used to but over and over again until neither of them could take it anymore.</p><p>Because she was close, so close having everything she’d ever wanted, and by midnight, like some sort of twisted fairytale, she could run away with Rio and start their lives together in their own happily ever after.</p><p>All of this she realised silently, the only sign of her inner turbulence being the blush across her cheeks, the constriction of her arms now snaking up and around Rio’s waist, and the slightly vacant look in her eyes as she continued to stare at soft lips. And Rio watched all of this curiously, brushing her finger tips across Agatha’s sharp cheekbone, unaware that she’d inadvertently awakened something in her wife that she hadn’t thought were even possible.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured quietly, leaning closer again to nudge at Agatha’s nose with her own. “Where do you keep going?”</p><p>“I’m here,” Agatha protested with a slight frown, sliding her arms back to instead rest her hands on Rio’s hips, “Just, thinking.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and let Agatha think in peace for a while, allowing her soft breaths against her lips to calm her own mind as she steeled herself for her next question: “Billy? Will you let him in too? I tried to help you earlier but… He deserves to know. He would never betray you.”</p><p>“Billy will hate me for a while but I don’t want him to know anything about this. If anything comes out then at least he’ll have plausible deniability.”</p><p>Rio’s small frown changed to a small smile at this, even if Agatha had barely moved, and looked distracted still. “He loves you, you know. He’d do anything for you.”</p><p>Agatha began to pull her closer, which she did with ease as Rio didn’t resist. “Just because I don’t want him to have to go to court doesn’t mean-…”</p><p>“You love him,” Rio teased with a smile, leaning in to kiss the soft frown forming between Agatha’s brows, “You protect the things you love. If you didn’t love him you’d let him sit in.”</p><p>Agatha huffed but didn’t deny it and looked back up again with a small pout, her gaze softening as she caught Rio’s grin, her mind finally free to think of things other than her wife’s body so close or her tenuous safety with Wanda around, “I find him useful. Sometimes. That’s all.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio agreed with that same grin that Agatha was beginning to wish she could simply kiss away but she couldn’t. She had to remain focused. They had limited time and she knew that when Natasha was here she couldn’t be distracted. Not even by her wife’s soft lips.</p><p>She’d promised Rio she’d drop her attempts to get Wanda, but that didn’t mean her efforts would go to waste. She couldn’t let them.</p><p>But Rio, who knew Agatha so well at this point, apparently still wasn’t a mind reader and said the thing that now Agatha would have to actively <em>not</em> think about the whole time Natasha were here.</p><p>“When you’re done with Natasha, can we get some time alone?”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha promised immediately, her fingers flexing against Rio before she pulled away slowly, letting her fingers trail the familiar soft skin of Rio’s thighs. “And I want you with me at the gala. The whole time.”</p><p>Rio nodded and reached for Agatha’s hands again, stopping them once they reached her knees and interlocking their fingers, “I’ll be glued to you all night. You realise the last time we were at something like this it was Jen and Alice’s wedding?”</p><p>“I was dreading that too.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because of the way I behaved before I left you for those two days.“</p><p>Rio felt a pang in her stomach then at the reminder and traced soothing circles over Agatha’s hands with her thumb, “No kissing during sex really was-…”</p><p>“A mistake,” Agatha cut in quickly, her gaze dropping to Rio’s lips as Rio’s heart sank at the sadness she saw there.</p><p>“In the past,” she reassured softly, “No pienses en eso, mi amor.” <em>Don’t think on it, my love.</em></p><p>But just as Rio leant in to brush her lips against Agatha’s, she was jolted back by the sound of the buzzer signalling Natasha’s arrival and the bursting of their little bubble.</p><p>But Rio closed the gap between them anyway and with everything she had she channelled as much love and reassurance into the kiss as she could. Reluctantly, she eventually pulled away and ghosted her lips over Agatha’s cheek as she pulled away to fetch her friend.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha called out just as Rio got to the living room door. She turned to look at Agatha with a smirk that soon faded when she saw the expression on Agatha’s face: it was pained, suddenly serious.</p><p>“I mean it: Let’s go away. As soon as we can.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped at Agatha’s words, at the gravity of her tone, leaving only fear and a different kind of desperation.</p><p>“Okay,” was all Rio could manage, swallowing down the concern she felt bubbling in her chest, but another buzz from downstairs made her turn from Agatha and she suddenly felt trepidation as she pressed the button to allow her impatient best friend entry.</p><p>Rio placed a cooling had on the wall and took a deep breath in, forcing herself to focus on what she could control: her reaction to whatever Agatha had on Wanda, her response to Agatha, her handle on Natasha’s behaviour.</p><p>By the time she’d relaxed a little there was a loud seven-part knock at the door and Rio went to open it to her friend.</p><p>Natasha pulled Rio into a tight hug and sighed heavily, a deep frown marring her features.</p><p>“Took you long enough. No accountant would be demanding I come over for some mysterious reason,” Natasha grumbled against Rio’s hair, but Rio heard the amusement in her voice and pulled away to see a smirk replacing the frown on her face.</p><p>“It’s your Russian she wants, not you, so behave, please.”</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes even as Rio took her hand and walked her back into the living room where Agatha was now on her feet, pacing up and down by the fireplace, her hair a little wilder than before on account of the amount of times she’d run her hands through it in the time between Rio leaving and appearing again.</p><p>She turned to look up when Rio arrived back in the room and blue eyes dropped to the hand that held her wife’s before darting back up again to look at Natasha, her lips pursed. “You came.”</p><p>“As you see.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and dragged Natasha down to the couch, pulling her down beside her and watching Agatha closely, “How do you want to do this?”</p><p>Agatha ran her fingers through her hair again, deliberating for a second before she focused in on Natasha, ignoring the arm that draped casually across the back of the sofa behind Rio. She was peacocking. <em>Bitch.</em></p><p>“What do you know?”</p><p>“Enough.”</p><p>“‘Enough’ isn’t good enough. I have-…”</p><p>“I know that she’s working with Abigail. That <em>she</em> is the instigator in all of this bullshit. That at least half of her business interests are criminal and she’s feeding information to Sokovian-…”</p><p>“Mafia. Yes,” Agatha said quickly, throwing her hand in the air dismissively, unwilling to give Natasha the space to tell her details she already knew and keen to get to the crux of the issue: the thing that had motivated her to work herself into the ground, the thing that had kept her up at night, kept her from Rio.</p><p>“Have you heard anyone mention Rio?”</p><p>It was like whiplash. An extreme turbulence that had Rio unsure whether up was down or left was right. She’d woken up to a day full of happiness and promise but now she was dragged back down to reality and the murky depths Agatha had been burying herself in.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio started softly even as Natasha moved next to her and leant forwards a little. “Why would anyone-…?”</p><p>“No, I haven’t,” Natasha said in an even tone, frowning up at Agatha, “Why? What have you heard?”</p><p>Ocean blue eyes flashed and moved to settle on Rio then and Rio got so lost in the intensity of Agatha’s gaze that she missed Natasha standing beside her, tense, and staring at Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha? Is Rio a target here? Have you made her one?”</p><p>The atmosphere in the room darkened and Rio moved slowly to stand and step around Natasha to get to Agatha, reaching to hold her wrists that remained down by her sides. They looked at each other, the storm ascending in Agatha’s gaze: a rising tide that would sink all ships.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio murmured softly, squeezing Agatha’s wrists as she spoke, “Tell us. Now’s the time to tell everything.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted but just as she was about to speak Natasha snapped across from her, “Tell me. Now.”</p><p>Natasha had moved forwards, stepping around the coffee table, and Rio moved a little as to block her access to Agatha entirely, hovering between them where she still held Agatha’s wrists.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t moved or shaken by Natasha’s sharp tone, nor the threat of her stepping closer, she was only focused on Rio’s searching eyes before her, the warmth of her fingers around her wrists. She allowed them to ground her and unlike earlier, when she could think of nothing other than her lust for her all-but wife, now she felt the familiar, primal need to protect Rio, promises be damned.</p><p>“She’s used Rio as-…”</p><p>But Agatha barely got the words out before Natasha was stood next to them, her hand on Rio’s wrist where it clutched Agatha’s and her face fierce with accusation. “She’s threatened her,” Natasha filled in, no longer waiting for Agatha’s explanation, no longer satisfied with her gatekeeping.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, her gaze dropping now from Rio’s to look at the hand that held her wife’s wrist, before snapping back up to Natasha’s with that fierce intensity she’d been keeping at bay for the sake of Rio. “She’s been threatening her. It’s why I’ve kept good on my promise to get Stark-…”</p><p>“King maker,” Natasha quoted spitefully, pulling her hand away from Rio then.</p><p>“Empty threats,” Rio said gently, trying to stem the ferocity of the two women either side of her from boiling over. Now free of Natasha’s hold she stepped closer to Agatha and frowned at her set features. “Nothing has happened. I’m safe. I always would be. Wanda wouldn’t-…”</p><p>“Wanda is cutthroat. She’ll do whatever it takes to get what she wants. She wouldn’t think anything of harming you if it meant I’d do her bidding.”</p><p>“But you <em>have been</em> doing her bidding and she’s not come anywhere near me.”</p><p>“It doesn’t mean she won’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s tone was laced with a finality that Rio knew meant she wouldn’t accept an argument on the matter, that Agatha truly believed Wanda would come for her if Agatha couldn’t make good on Stark. Because ‘King Stark’ meant the country would change, that Wanda could thrive, that she’d become more powerful through avenues that any more liberal ruler <em>wouldn’t</em> turn a blind eye to.</p><p>Rio’s hold of Agatha went slack then and she let the pads of her fingers ghost along to the front of Agatha’s shirt where she held her steady and looked down to where her fingers twisted the fabric, “Agatha. You promised.”</p><p>Agatha looked back to Rio for just a moment, a slither of time where she allowed herself to believe that Wanda may be better than she thought, that she wouldn’t speak Rio’s name to the wrong people at the right time, but then the moment passed and she peeled back from Rio, turning away to march towards the fireplace.</p><p>“Wanda’s involved with the Sokovian Mafia. I have proof. Abigail is too. She’s been working with James Barnes to-…”</p><p>“Why do I know that name?”</p><p>Two sets of eyes swivelled to look at Rio then and Natasha shrugged imperceptibly, still coiled and tense, as Agatha sighed, “He was the guy I stepped in for at the dinner. He’s loose-lipped when you get a drink in him and was willing to give up his seat for-…”</p><p>“The dinner where the stalking began,” Natasha clarified, looking back around to Agatha with an arched brow and tilting her head.</p><p>Rio and Agatha spoke at the same time then, with two varying tones of accusation: “Natasha, you said you’d behave.”/“Let’s not even talk about what I have on <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Natasha made a move then almost as quickly as Rio did but it was Rio who managed to grab hold of Natasha before Natasha could grab hold of Agatha.</p><p>“I’ve looked into you too,” Agatha said calmly, her eyes dropping to tanned arms around Natasha’s waist before looking up to meet fiery green eyes, “Tread carefully or-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio snapped firmly even as Natasha made a move like she was going to launch at Agatha. But Rio was ready, Rio was strong, and she held her still. “Stop. The both of you. This isn’t a dick measuring contest.”</p><p>Natasha’s body went from tense to slack in her arms and Rio watched as Agatha’s fists at her sides wound so tightly that her knuckles went white. “Agatha,” she said in a much softer tone than before as she pushed Natasha back down onto the couch and watched her wife turn from them both and silently reach for the small wooden rabbit on the mantelpiece.</p><p>Rio sighed heavily as she took her seat beside Natasha again, slapping her shoulder in an act of frustration, before she turned to watch Agatha lift the head of the rabbit to reveal a secret compartment where she fished out a key.</p><p>Agatha moved then to unlock the folder on the coffee table and pulled back the heavy front to reveal, just like the blue folder before it, this folder was also full of documents.</p><p>But they were different; they were all hand-written.</p><p>Some were neater than others, some were scribbles or bullet points and others were written in the neat, looping script that Rio would recognise anywhere. She’d seen this same handwriting in the notes Agatha sometimes left her before heading to work in the early hours of the morning, in the to-do lists that were often scattered across Agatha’s desk, in the signature that would one day read ‘Agatha Vidal’.</p><p>Her heart stopped at the sight of the contents and she gasped so loudly that Agatha looked up at her, looking pained and concerned. “I had to write everything because I didn’t want to leave a trail… Honey, there’s really no need for you to-…”</p><p>“I’m staying,” she said firmly, moving round to take a seat beside Agatha on the floor and tentatively reaching for the first paper she could.</p><p>But her eyes drifted to the sea of other notes and scribbles and grainy photographs and the pile still in the deep red folder they’d been hidden away in and Rio paused before she began to read and turned to Agatha with a deep frown, “This is everything you’ve been doing all these months?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Agatha, it’s-…”</p><p>“I needed to have a record of everything I saw and heard, everything Jimmy saw and heard so that when it came to it I had a case and I could-…”</p><p>“Your plan was to go to the cops with all this? Are you serious? Scribbles and grainy photos? Killing her would be so much easier.”</p><p>Rio shot Natasha a look and then turned to the note in her hand.</p><p>But with Rio’s gaze down, distracted by what she was reading, she missed Agatha looking up to Natasha.</p><p>For the first time since she’d arrived, they made prolonged eye contact and if Rio had caught the exchanged look, she wouldn’t have liked it one bit. The silent exchange was an agreement between the two women, a non-verbal understanding passed between them, a cautious truce, at least on this one thing.</p><p>Agatha nodded only slightly.</p><p>But Rio was unaware that the thing she would rally most against - putting the two women she loved the most in so much danger - was the one thing that brought them together.</p><p>But ignorance, for now, was bliss, and Rio was too busy reading:</p><p>
<em>’Brian Matthews: 37 Holborn Avenue, Maine, 04227. Wife: Jennifer Casavettes (Nurse). Kids: Hannah, 7; Sophie, 5.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Driver. Go-between. Unclear if has knowledge of content of messages. Clear he knows more than he lets on.</em>
</p><p>
<em>J made contact, now in semi-regular correspondence. J intercepted note. Images taken on 12/05 labelled 14 &amp; 15: B with known Sokovian national: Bulgakov.</em>
</p><p>
<em>B: Two semis kept in car at all times. Lockbox in trunk.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Plate: 624 AP.’</em>
</p><p>Rio placed the page down and swallowed heavily, glancing first at Natasha who had looked away from Agatha to read another document and then at Agatha who was watching her closely. But Rio was sure. Rio would bet her life on it: “Brian’s a good guy. He wouldn’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped and she raised her brows as she moved the sheet away, fishing now for something else in the folder, “Not everyone’s what they seem, Rio.” Natasha from opposite them cleared her throat pointedly but Agatha ignored it. “Jimmy doesn’t just drive me, Y’know. He has his other uses. He knows what he’s doing.”</p><p>She found what she was looking for then and slid across two photos to Rio, watching her again as Rio took in the sight before her.</p><p>Brian, good, affable, family man Brian, Abigail’s kind driver, was seen shaking hands with who Rio could only describe as a villain from a Rush Hour movie. He looked thuggish and brutish and Brian looked so out of place it was laughable. But in the next photo he was handing him an envelope and Rio had to place the photo down.</p><p>Brian had always been kind to Rio. Always talked to her of his kids, and how smitten he still was with his wife. They’d discussed basketball and the latest baseball scores. To think that he would be housing secret messages and passing them to dangerous criminals… that he had guns in the car that he must know how to use, must be <em>willing</em> to use, it shook her to her core.</p><p>She rubbed at her temple, her neat little world she’d once built for herself suddenly feeling a lot more grimy than it ever had before. Sleeping with rich women was one thing, knowing they weren’t all saints another, but seeing this when she thought the worst thing Abigail was was a stuck up cunt, just not a criminal one, made a sick sense of shame settle somewhere in her stomach.</p><p>Agatha must have felt this because her arm went to snake around her back and she pressed a kiss to her shoulder as Natasha opposite them who had read the interaction correctly said, “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”</p><p>Rio only shook her head and leant into Agatha a little more as the other woman reached across to fish out a battered looking envelope and held it to Natasha.</p><p>Agatha’s own stomach was churning with guilt again, not only for having unwittingly dragged Rio into this mess, but now having to lay it bare for her, showing her how messed up it all was because of <em>her</em> weakness, her inability to protect her from all of this.</p><p>“Jimmy got this a few weeks ago. I haven’t been able to find anyone I trusted to translate it. And I didn’t want to risk putting it into the internet.”</p><p>“And it’s taken you this long to ask me?”</p><p>“Up until yesterday you weren’t speaking to Rio. I had no desire to reach out to you unless it was to rip your head off.”</p><p>“And now you’re asking me for my help.”</p><p>Agatha’s lower jaw jutted out as she shifted to her knees and leant across the table to where Natasha lounged on the floor. “If you don’t want to help then you can-…”</p><p>“She’s helping,” Rio interjected, coming back to herself again at the sight of the two women about to spar once more. She shot her best friend a pointed look as she tugged Agatha back closer, keeping a hold on her shirt for a few seconds until Natasha relented.</p><p>She opened the envelope slowly and eyed Rio as she did, watching her concerned frown for a second before she turned her attention back to the letter.</p><p>It was written in Russian cursive, the writing long and thin and unfamiliar to Natasha but from her guess it must be Wanda’s.</p><p>Her eyes scanned over the words until she was done and then she looked back up to Agatha again and spoke in a calm, low voice, the voice that grated on Agatha so much: “You married this woman.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Natasha,” Rio said softly, “please. I have <em>told</em> you-…”</p><p>“And I am telling you that what is in this letter is exactly who Wanda is. And Agatha married her. And now she’s marrying you and I won’t allow-…”</p><p>Rio shook her head and growled in frustration, feeling Agatha’s hand move to her lower back and gently hold her shirt, but it was more a reassuring gesture than one to hold her back from launching at Natasha, as Rio’s hold on Agatha had been designed for not five minutes ago. “No one is <em>allowing</em> me to do anything. I am marrying Agatha. I am wearing her ring. <em>Both</em> of her rings,” she emphasised this with her left hand raised to her best friend, “and you can deal with it or you can find a new best friend.”</p><p>Natasha’s face was set, angry, angrier than Rio had ever seen her but she dropped her gaze and looked back at the letter she was still clutching and, taking a deep breath, she began to read aloud.</p><p>
<em>’The iron man will disrupt the economy. American-made no longer means what it used to. Mention my old name. Stark will weaken them. That is the goal.’</em>
</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s hold on her shirt tighten and turned to see that she’d gone pale and her eyes had glazed over with fury.</p><p>Natasha was still staring down at the letter, reading it over and over again until she could make out what she could see and she placed it down slowly, her finger moving to trace over every line of Wanda’s pen.</p><p>“Rio,” the sound of her name snapped Rio out of her trance as she turned to Natasha and watched her curiously, glancing down to the finger moving slowly along the scrawled note. “Tell me what you see.”</p><p>“Natasha, I don’t… I can’t read it.”</p><p>“You can. I taught you. You can.”</p><p>Her words were insistent, almost desperate, and Agatha released her hold slightly on Rio’s shirt to allow her to move up and lean across as Natasha span the sheet of paper to her and Rio stared down at what initially looked like scribbles that then became words that were familiar to her, though her conjugation was all over the place and some words she missed entirely.</p><p>Wanda’s scrawl was nothing like Agatha’s loopy script. Where Agatha was round circles and warm penmanship, Wanda’s was scratchy and spikey. Rio made a mental note to ask Lilia if she knew anything about graphology because surely this writing screamed: PSYCHOPATH.</p><p>The room was silent as Rio took a lot longer to decipher even the simpler words and she struggled to remember everything Natasha had once taught her about Russian cursive, insistent that it would be a useful life skill, though they’d only ever really used it to write notes to each other in class, thrilled with their own cleverness.</p><p>But it had been a long time since Rio had sent Natasha a note telling her she was hungover and wanted a milkshake.</p><p>“Natasha,” Rio said firmly after five minutes of making out some of the words she’d already heard Natasha read. “I don’t know what-…”</p><p>“There,” she said calmly, calmer than she would have done if anyone but Rio were asking for help, “this word. Tell me.”</p><p>Her finger pointed to one of the harder to read words on the page, a spikey scribble that resembled not much of anything. Rio started at it, gently moving Natasha’s hand away to get a better view. ‘Name’, Natasha had said. It went with the context, it went with what could be the long thin lines of the scrawl, but Natasha was right, it wasn’t ‘name’.</p><p>“Flame,” she said eventually, said quietly, barely above a whisper, her hand freezing where it had been hovering over the scribbles, her whole body tensing as the new context changed the whole reading. “Not ‘imya’. It’s… ‘plamya’. The letters are so tight it’s-…”</p><p>“‘My old flame’. I thought so.”</p><p>Where Rio sat frozen and staring, Natasha had leant back against the couch and had moved her gaze across to Agatha, raising her brows at her. And Agatha knew what it meant almost immediately.</p><p>For one heart-stopping second blue eyes met green and Agatha felt her whole body go cold, her fingers flexing against nothing, but imagining a soft neck beneath them, one she could squeeze the life out of.</p><p>“Fuck. Fuck. FUUUUUUCK!”</p><p>She threw herself to her feet and began to pace furiously up and down the room, resuming her old route by the fireplace. And Rio stood with her, shocked from her own panic by Agatha’s crash out.</p><p>But Agatha was too incandescent to pay any mind to Rio’s hands on her arms and her wide, fearful eyes trying to make eye contact with her.</p><p>“‘Mention my old flame.’ Wanda’s ‘old flame’. Now who might that be?”</p><p>“Fuck off, Natasha,” Rio snapped quickly, her eyes remaining on Agatha even as her wife pulled away from her and continued to pace, throwing her hands in the air and stalking to the window, muttering curses as she went.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio uttered steadily, watching her with a growing fear in her stomach that all of the promises from the night before, all the resolution, was for nothing, as Agatha’s name was entangled so intrinsically with Wanda’s.</p><p>The witch had made it so. Had drip-fed mentions of Agatha into her communications so that even the greenest of agents looking into any criminal activity would be able to join the dots to Agatha, even if she’d done nothing, even if she were innocent.</p><p>“Agatha, please.”</p><p>“There’s a reason she’s put you in there.”</p><p>“<em>Natasha.</em>”</p><p>Despite Rio’s silencing of the red head, the accusation was clear, ringing loud as a bell across the room, and Agatha felt it like a knife through her back.</p><p>But Natasha’s belief that Agatha was somehow at fault here was the least of her worries because all Agatha could focus on was  how her life with Rio would be spent constantly looking over their backs, constantly ready for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>She stopped at the window and gazed out at the cold afternoon on her quiet little street in the middle of Manhattan. Her body felt the outside chill until welcome arms wrapped around her waist from behind and she relaxed back into the woman holding her, feeling her press into her neck and brush soft lips across her skin.</p><p>To a passerby who looked up at the fourth floor of the little apartment block, they may have simply looked like a young couple enjoying the fresh February air, but their hold of one another, Rio’s arms around Agatha’s middle and Agatha’s hands on the arms that held her, was more than comfort, it was salvation.</p><p>They remained like that for a what must have been minutes, Rio providing the warmth and security in her hold that Agatha needed to begin calming down, enabling her wired brain to fire up again, for logic to slowly return, and her racing heart to steady to its usual rhythm.</p><p>Even Natasha had the decency to not interrupt and she went back to flicking through the reams of papers, looking for any more reason she could find to solidify her opinion that Wanda would be better off dead.</p><p>The time holding Agatha gave Rio time to think too, time to think on everything Wanda had done, everything Agatha was trying to do and everything Rio had simply sat back and let happen.</p><p>When, and only when, Rio’s own heart had slowed back down and she was confident that Agatha was as relaxed as she could be, Rio pulled away. Like magnets responding to the other, Agatha turned in her arms and lifted her hands to cup Rio’s cheeks, seeing pain and fear in her gaze, “I’ll keep us both safe. I-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered back, nodding a little in a subconscious attempt to get Agatha to agree, and raising her hands to lightly hold Agatha’s wrists, “Wanda isn’t the one to aim for here. You can’t. It’s too dangerous.”</p><p>“No, I-…”</p><p>“You’ve done so much. But it has to stop. They’re-…”</p><p>“Destabilising,” Natasha said from across the room, back on the couch now and leaning against her knees as she watched the two women still clinging to each other, “they’re destabilising the system. Giving their ‘friends’ the power and themselves the control.”</p><p>Rio turned to see Agatha drop her gaze to the slither of space between their bodies and Natasha continued, holding sheets of evidence Agatha had so diligently compiled, “If I’m being generous,” Rio shot her a look, “<em>if</em>, then I’d guess Wanda’s using Agatha because she’s a power player. Using her name-…”</p><p>“She’s stealing my power.”</p><p>Brown eyes snapped back to Agatha’s blue and saw in them a look that in other circumstances might have made her drop down to her knees for her. But now, now it made her heart constrict with panic, because Agatha suddenly looked determined, and sure, and hungrier than she’d even seen her before.</p><p>She’d pulled away from Rio entirely and marched back to the coffee table, perching on the edge of the chair to rummage through the papers for the piece of evidence she’d secured only a fortnight ago.</p><p>With the time to think in Rio’s hold, and with the translation of the other note, she knew what this evidence meant now, what Wanda was doing. She was using Agatha’s name, her power, as a bargaining tool. She’d used it to get in with Abigail in the first place - that much had been clear at her party in the Cape - and now she was using it to pull strings with the wrong people, people who could destroy everything she held dear. And Agatha had willingly given herself as a pawn to get Stark the presidency because she thought it would keep Rio safe and she was <em>right</em>, she realised now, only for the <em>wrong</em> reasons.</p><p>As Agatha searched desperately for the one piece of evidence, the most crucial one now, Rio hesitatingly moved back over and her eyes darted to Natasha before they settled back on Agatha and knelt by the low table, watching the woman before her rifle through with that same still determined look on her face, the same set expression that meant that Agatha was unreachable now, that even Rio didn’t stand a chance against her one-track mind.</p><p>“Here,” she said suddenly, slamming down a folded paper napkin that had that same scratchy and raw penmanship on it.</p><p>Rio leant across and stared at it for a long time. It took her a second to register that the note was written in English, not Russian, but the words were still that ugly slanting, scratchy style of calligraphy that was unique to Wanda and Rio had to squint to make out some of the letters.</p><p>Natasha, ever the polyglot, sat back slowly when she was done reading and watched Agatha with a smile dancing on her lips, “There you go, Harkness. That’s your silver bullet.”</p><p>The note read:<br/>
<em>’The bitch will make him King. Abi’s empire will crumble. I’ll rebuild. Quiet pressure, no closed fists. Yet.’</em></p><p>Rio turned her gaze slowly to Agatha and raised her brows, “I don’t understand.”</p><p>In a mirror image of Natasha on the couch, Agatha too sat back, her arms outstretched along the arms of the worn-in leather chair, her legs spreading. She looked powerful. So powerful that the chair became a throne beneath her and Agatha its once and future inhabitant. No longer King-maker but King herself.</p><p>“James Barnes loves a drink. Loves to chat. He had this on him the last time we caught up. Wanda had given it to him in the bar the night before. She’s paranoid so wrote her little promise down instead of speaking it for fear of being overheard. Paranoid but stupid. She’s promised him she’ll work Abigail until she’s destroyed and then they can reap the rewards of her ruined empire.”</p><p>“She’s trying to manipulate everyone,” Rio said slowly, piecing everything together. “She isn’t working with Abigail, she’s working against her.”</p><p>“She’s not a team player.”</p><p>“Something you two clearly have in common,” Natasha said with a raised brow as she surveyed Agatha, a smile still threatening to grace her lips.</p><p>But Agatha ignored this, and ran a hand through her hair, “She’s bitten off more than she can chew. Always did.”</p><p>“Stark,” Rio said quietly, still frowning down at the note. “Billy was telling me about his economic plans. His new trade rules. His tariffs. He’s trying to open the floor for new business not old, grandfathered, rich kid business.”</p><p>“It’ll hurt rich kids with bin acumen… but especially if they’re not smart and <em>Abigail</em> is not smart.” Agatha concluded with a self-satisfied smile, watching Rio proudly. “I’ve looked into her financials and they’re all in one place. No diversification of funds. One leak, one weak seam, and the barrel bursts.”</p><p>Rio placed the napkin down slowly, letting her fingers linger on what might be the answer to all of their problems and she stared at it as Agatha turned to her, “You’re right. Wanda’s not the way we end this. Wanda’s trying to play with too many people and it ends tonight. It’s Abigail we need. I’ll end it.”</p><p>“And then that’s it,” Rio clarified firmly, looking at Agatha with a deep frown, “Promise me. You speak to Abigail. Tell her the truth about her ‘friend’, and then we leave it. She can deal with Wanda. She has more than enough money and connections to destroy her. You burn all of this and we get on with our lives.”</p><p>She turned to Agatha properly then, watched her shift her hips slightly in her chair and knew she was thinking the same, the reminder of the last time they’d been together with Abigail nearby, how they’d suffered through not being able to openly touch, not knowing whether they even should want to, and finding stolen moments to be together, to touch, to taste.</p><p>The reminder of their time together at Abigail’s, and the sight of Agatha so powerful across from her now and Rio on her knees before her didn’t help with her growing desire to get Agatha alone again. But that could wait. For a little while longer, at least.</p><p>“Of course,” Natasha said slowly, interrupting the moment between the two of them, “There’s still murder.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly, her gaze shifting to Natasha as her fingers raised to toy with her hair in a nervous stim, trying to shake some of the energy pulsing through her veins. “No.”</p><p>And slowly Rio turned to Agatha again who was now watching her with an unreadable expression somewhere between desire and triumph. She felt in her bones that this was the way forward. Agatha had the means to convince Abigail but she had the know how.</p><p>Because Rio had built a life on being able to read people, knowing what they wanted from her, knowing what they needed. She’d been able to create security for herself like she’d never imagined. She’d used her body, yes, but she’d curated herself time and time again to be exactly who the person paying her wanted her to be. She had made enough money to pay off her parents’ mortgage, pay off Natasha’s, pay off her own. Enough money to always have the means if she needed medical bills sorted, to pay for her parents’ funerals, to keep herself afloat. Enough money to retire when she was no longer desirable and simply wanted to live a comfortable life. Her skill with people was what brought her to Agatha. And it was what she trusted to know that she knew Abigail and could help, could end this whole nightmare by Agatha’s side, taking on some of what she’d been carrying for weeks.</p><p>Agatha hesitated before she smiled just slightly, watching Rio with that intense gaze again, her fingers twitching on the arms of the chair. They had what they needed to bring Wanda down, but it could still blow up in their faces, it could still go horrendously wrong. And Rio was still terrified Agatha would be taken from her. </p><p>Rio released her hold on her hair and stood to move towards Agatha as she spoke: “I’ll speak to Abigail tonight. I’ll get her by herself and-…”</p><p>“Wouldn’t Rio be best for that?”</p><p>Both women turned to stare at Natasha then, one in warning the other in a dare. Rio had stopped just by the armchair and Agatha leant forward a little, intent on pulling Rio to her before Natasha had spoken. But Natasha met both gazes with raised brows and shrugged as she leant back into the couch cushions as if she owned the place, raising her arms to lie along the back of the couch, “She knows Abigail… what she likes, what she doesn’t. Surely it makes sense for her to drop the bomb that she’s being played.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said firmly, “Abigail wanted me to fuck her but now I’m not doing that she has no respect for me and probably doesn’t trust me either after I broke our contract. Agatha, she respects. She wants in with her. It should be Agatha. But,” she turned now to look at the woman beside her who was watching her closely, “I can help. I’ve known her for years. I know how she works.”</p><p>Agatha released a slow breath and reached to for Rio’s hand to kiss the back of it, letting her lips linger for much longer than necessary, before she leant back and said: “We plant the seed and,”</p><p>“Let her water it herself,” Rio concluded with a tentative smile, her fingers twitching in Agatha’s hold as she watched her closely still.</p><p>Natasha was shifting forwards, frustrated with this lack of action, and intent on making that known. “And if she doesn’t believe you?”</p><p>“She will,” Rio promised, watching Agatha for a second longer before she turned to her best friend. “She’ll believe Agatha. She’s got two brain cells and one opinion. It won’t be hard.”</p><p>Agatha released a soft snort of a laugh at this and reached out, tugging Rio from her feet to pull her across her lap. She didn’t have to say anything for Rio to know what she wanted, what she’d been yearning for the whole time they’d been having this discussion. She wanted Rio close and Rio obliged because she wanted that too.</p><p>“I’ll get her alone at the gala tonight.” Agatha pulled Rio closer to her as Rio draped an arm around her shoulders, looping it behind her neck. “I’ll take the note, light the fuse.” She slipped one hand beneath Rio’s t-shirt to brush her thumb across the warm skin of her side. “And that’ll be the last thing I do before we leave, before I drop Stark, and we disappear for a while.”</p><p>“A while?” Natasha frowned up at Rio, a little distracted seeing the way her best friend so naturally and easily had followed Agatha into the armchair. Rio had always been a tactile person, where Natasha usually wasn’t. And she knew where she would only willingly be in Rio’s personal space, Rio had no problems being close to other people. But seeing her with Agatha, seeing her mould into her and the way her shoulders relaxed as Agatha pulled her closer made her pause.</p><p>She’d missed so much. Missed <em>too</em> much. And despite Rio’s outburst the previous night, only now seeing the two of them together convinced Natasha that she truly very nearly had lost her best friend.</p><p>“Just a vacation,” Rio assured, curling her legs around to sit up a little more, “Just to get some time away.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing but kept her gaze down on the table now a mess of papers and her own half-mad scribbles.</p><p>She’d wanted nothing more than to get Rio on her own for months now. To take her away to some unknown destination where they could be themselves and no one would know where they were. But it was more important than ever now to get Rio out whilst the iron was hot.</p><p>The room fell into silence then and even Rio drifted into her own mind, fearful of what might happen if Agatha played this wrong, if she couldn’t help her.</p><p>But it was Agatha who filled the silence eventually and spoke across to Natasha with all her usual authority and seriousness back in place, “How did you find out?”</p><p>“There aren’t many Russian translators anymore. At least, not many who aren’t employed by the government. I offer my services to… anyone who can pay.”</p><p>Agatha nodded stiffly and clenched her teeth, “Anyone like…?”</p><p>Her gaze darted to the mess of the table before them and Natasha raised her brows, “No. Not quite.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once again and Rio squeezed her hand, watching her profile closely as the muscle of her jaw continued to flex and unflex.</p><p>“Plus,” Natasha began to admit slowly, shifting to turn her body more towards the two in the armchair, “I kept an eye on that bitch when she first took her on. ‘No phones’. Bullshit. So it started from there.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow silently but Rio caught the relaxing of her jaw that said she was relenting a bit in her hatred of Natasha, as she realised not for the first time that she wasn’t the only one trying to protect Rio in the room, and Rio smiled to herself as she scratched lightly along Agatha’s arm.</p><p>But Natasha was speaking again, this time her voice lower, more urgent. “If she’s referencing Agatha, you know she won’t leave you alone. If Agatha’s known to people, you’ll always be watching your backs. Even if Abigail drops her, destroys her.”</p><p>The truth of these words settled painfully in Rio’s chest and she kept her gaze on Agatha even as she kept her blue eyes down, looking anywhere but at Rio. Whilst Rio could feel the fear settle against her again, Agatha felt the guilt rise like bile in her throat that she’d dragged Rio into this mess, put her in danger.</p><p>“I’ll make sure it sticks.”</p><p>Her words were firm, clear as a bell.</p><p>Rio reached for Agatha’s face and forced her to look round at her, seeing again something unspoken, frowning deeply at the hatred and guilt she saw there and she brushed her thumb across Agatha’s lower lip to soothe it from its pout, “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond but took Rio’s hand and unfurled her fingers to kiss her palm softly before she turned away, unwilling to let her wife absolve her of her guilt.</p><p>Natasha watched this interaction with genuine curiosity and saw for the first time a little of what Rio had been telling her: that Agatha loved her her truly, and for the first time, she truly believed she did.</p><p>But the silence that descended again upon the little group was soon disturbed by a noise just outside the closed living room door and Agatha’s head snapped up to look across at it, frowning deeply, “Billy? What is it?”</p><p>There was a heavy second of silence before a muffled voice rang through and Billy said: “Stark’s been calling. He wants you there. Now.”</p><p>Agatha just sighed and breathed deeply for a second before she lightly manoeuvred Rio from her lap. She began gathering up the evidence she’d been carefully collating for months and began to pile it all into the red folder. Rio moved to help whilst Natasha sat still, ever-watchful.</p><p>“Fucking Stark. Fucking Campaign.”</p><p>By the time everything was collected, Agatha hurried to place the lock back on the folder and threw it back onto the armchair as Rio spoke, “Just one last night and then you’ll be done.”</p><p>Agatha acknowledged this with a tight smile in Rio’s direction and then softened almost entirely at the hopeful look in Rio’s eyes and sighed, “One more night.”</p><p>“Not to break up this romantic little scene but you are both disgusting.”</p><p>Rio blinked owlishly at her best friend and then burst into laughter for the first time in what felt like days, though realistically it had only been since this morning with Agatha alone.</p><p>“We’ve heard,” Agatha said drily but a smile was tugging at her lips as she turned to look at Natasha for the first time since they’d both acknowledged their mutual desire to end this situation in the most final way possible.</p><p>Natasha caught Agatha’s gaze again and arched a brow, her own lips twitching slightly and Rio saw in her best friend a spark of recognition, a genuine softening in her resolve to hate Agatha, and she couldn’t help it as she reached across to her and offered her hand.</p><p>Green eyes fell to the Rio’s hand and Natasha eyed it suspiciously for a second before relenting and taking Rio’s hand in her own, locking their fingers together as they’d done for years. Agatha, before her own was taken in the same way, eyed this meeting of Natasha’s and her wife’s hand suspiciously but relented in her distaste as Rio squeezed her fingers.</p><p>“When we’re back, I want you to come and visit. Even for a day. I promise you both that you’ll get on if you just relax a little.” Rio said calmly, watching Natasha with a small smile, and raising her brows when Natasha did the same to her.</p><p>“I’m always relaxed.”</p><p>“Bullshit. Just, please?”</p><p>Natasha sighed and shot Agatha a look before focusing back in on Rio. “Fine. So long as that Alice girl isn’t around I-…”</p><p>“Don’t start,” Rio warned softly, shaking Natasha’s hand, “besides, you’ll see her at the wedding.”</p><p>“Judging by your rings I’m already too late for that.”</p><p>“We’re getting married for real. Soon. Legally. I want you to be my maid of honour. If we have an aisle I want you to walk me down it. And I want you to be pleased to do it. Please.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Natasha swallowed and looked away from Rio and she swore in that moment that if her wife were refused then she would rain thunder down on Natasha the likes she’d never seen before. But no thunder was necessary. Natasha had nodded and was looking back to Rio with a schooled, practised expression, “Pleased may be pushing it but I’m sure I can pencil you in.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio said affectionately, squeezing Natasha’s hand and smiling at her. “Just for that you’re wearing a corsage.”</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes but a slow, genuine smile crept up her face as she looked across at her best friend. “Fine. I’ll <em>happily</em> walk you if I have to. No corsage necessary.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio agreed and squeezed Natasha’s hand once more before dropping it and turning to raise her brows at Agatha, “You can be my witness to that. She said <em>’happily’</em>.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and went to pick up the folder from the side. “I’ll just go see what Stark wants and be back soon.”</p><p>Rio watched her go with a soft smile that slowly fell from her face as the door closed behind her. She looked across to Natasha who was watching her closely and began to chew on her lip as Natasha said in a much gentler voice than before, “It’s okay to be scared.”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze and ran her hands through her hair, “Do you think Agatha’s right? She’ll leave her alone?”</p><p>“That depends on Abigail’s reaction.”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked down to her rings, spinning them both round and round to rid herself of some of her anxiety. Natasha watched this for a while before she upped and moved herself around to Rio, taking the position Agatha had just been in beside her but instead resting on her knees and taking both of Rio’s hands in her own, “Are you sure this is what you want? Once you’re married… it’s harder to get away.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and only because Natasha had asked so softly did she allow it. She looked down at their hands and nodded, unable to have this conversation over and over.</p><p>“I love her. I’d tie myself to her for eternity if I could.”</p><p>Natasha only nodded and kissed Rio’s cheek before she moved away to lean back against the armchair, watching Rio closely. “She feels guilty.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“You don’t deserve someone who-…”</p><p>“Natasha I want her. I love her. I’m not discussing this with you anymore.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>Natasha hesitated for just a second before she nodded and pulled her knees up to her chest, wrapping her arms around them. “Okay.”</p><p>As a small smile pulled at Rio’s lips the door opened again and Agatha swept in looking furious, her gaze falling between Natasha and Rio in turn. “I have to go. He’s complaining about his fucking speech and wants it rewritten.”</p><p>Rio stood and went to lift Agatha’s wrist to check the time on her watch and frowned deeply when she saw it was only just past one o’clock. “But it doesn’t start for hours. Can’t you just tell him ‘no’?”</p><p>“Not before tonight.” Agatha huffed out a breath and turned her hand over in Rio’s to hold her hand properly, “It starts at seven but come a little earlier? Come around six? Before everyone gets there?”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio agreed quietly, leaning in to kiss Agatha’s frown away with a sigh, “Call me if you need me.”</p><p>Billy appeared in the doorway then laden down with Agatha’s bag and two suit bags that he held up so they didn’t drag along the floor. He didn’t quite meet Rio’s gaze as she tried to smile at him and instead was frowning over at Natasha who’d moved over to raise her brows at this new addition to the little group.</p><p>“What’s your problem, kid?”</p><p>Rio moved a little to stand more between Billy and Natasha and raised her brows at Billy to attract his attention, “Hey, I’ll see you at the gala. Try not to punch out any republicans before I get there.”</p><p>Billy didn’t say anything and instead turned to head for the door, clearly still insulted that he’d been the only one left out of the secret meeting they’d all just had earlier.</p><p>“He’ll get over it,” Agatha promised quickly and kissed Rio softly before she turned to Natasha and offered her hand to her.</p><p>It hung there between them and Rio willed Natasha to take it. Natasha eyed it for a second before taking it in her own and shaking firmly, “You have my blessing.”</p><p>“Pardon me?”</p><p>Rio turned from where she’d started leaning around the door frame to catch another glimpse of a sulking Billy and gaped at the sight before her. Agatha looked confused and taken aback but Natasha looked tense, her jaw tight as she repeated herself, still clutching Agatha’s hand. “You have my blessing. Maria and Luis can’t give it so I will.”</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly and Rio worried she might snap Natasha’s head off to even suggest that she <em>needed</em> a blessing but to her great surprise Agatha dropped her gaze and looked to their joint hands. Rio took a step closer and just as she was about to step in to intervene she heard a soft, “Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha had accepted Natasha’s words for the peace offering that they were and not only that, looked back up at Natasha again to smile a little, which was returned in kind, as their hands released at the same time.</p><p>Rio felt dizzy with emotions unspoken and she stared openly at her best friend, shocked to see that the beginnings of tears were forming in her green eyes and even more shocked to find that her own had spilled out as she grabbed Natasha and placed a firm, drawn out kiss to her cheek.</p><p>“Gracias,” she whispered softly and Agatha watched this interaction with a lingering sense of calm washing over her, wondering if it were true: that Maria and Luis Vidal would have given her their blessing. But she didn’t have long to think on it as Rio was back to kissing <em>her</em>, holding her face in her hands and grinning against her lips.</p><p>Agatha responded immediately and wrapped her arms around Rio with such fervour that Rio squeaked at the pressure on her ribs. When they pulled apart Agatha’s eyes were the same dark hue they’d been before and Rio had to hold herself back from kissing her again for the sake of Natasha behind her and Billy in the hallway who was now making his impatience known: huffing and tapping his foot as he was.</p><p>“Luego,” Rio whispered softly as she leant to brush their noses together again and pressed a promise to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Knowing what she meant and agreeing silently that she could restrain herself even for a few hours, Agatha returned the kiss quickly and began to pull away before Rio could grab her again and turn her back to her. 
“Billy,” she said quietly, her brow furrowing slightly, “go easy on him today.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing to this but nodded just once and left.</p><p>When the door closed behind them, Rio turned to Natasha and jumped on her back as she wandered back into the living room, forcing her to stumble a few steps before she regained her balance and yelled out in surprise and annoyance at the sudden burden she was now forced to bear what was Rio Vidal.</p><p>“You love her,” Rio sang into Natasha’s ear, causing her friend to laugh as she looped her arms around Rio’s knees and flopped them both back onto the couch.</p><p>Rio landed with a soft “oomph” and pushed at Natasha as she scrambled to her feet again and pointed accusingly round at Rio who looked not unlike a very wide-eyed beetle just thrown onto its back with her limbs hanging in mid-air.</p><p>“I gave her my blessing, not my love. Maniac.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Natasha rolled her eyes as she softened, “I still don’t trust her.”</p><p>“Then <em>why</em> did you invoke my dead parents and-…”</p><p>“Because it was that or letting her take you away and probably… probably not bringing you back. At least to me.”</p><p>Rio lowered her limbs and straightened herself out on the couch, her thrilled expression softening to something quite different. “You know I wouldn’t do that but… Thank you. Thank you for telling her.”</p><p>Natasha lowered her hand that was still pointing at Rio and nodded slowly, her eyes glazing over with tears again as Rio stood and hugged her tightly, “You’re so soft. You should let people know that sometimes.”</p><p>Natasha just huffed against Rio’s shoulder but allowed herself to be hugged and only pulled away when Rio did, such was her desire to hide against her best friend.</p><p>“We need to practice your Russian,” Natasha said with a sniff as she wiped her eyes and allowed Rio to kiss her salty cheek, “It took you thirty minutes to read about ten words.”</p><p>“The words I used to read were no more complicated than ‘I’m bored’, and ‘want to watch a movie’.”</p><p>“Still,” Natasha accused with a smile as she pulled back to take Rio’s hand and admire the rings, brushing her thumb over both in turn, “She’s got good taste, I’ll give her that.”</p><p>“In rings or girls?”</p><p>“Well, her taste in girls has improved <em>significantly</em>.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and flopped back down on the couch, stealing her hand back in the process. “I was going to see the team today but given everything, I actually just need about fifty cigarettes and-…”</p><p>“A nap, yeah yeah.”</p><p>Rio smiled and disappeared off to fetch the stash of Reds she had hidden in her bedside cabinet for no reason other than habit. She reappeared again with a lighter and went to curl up on the wide window ledge to light one, opening the window wide enough so that the smoke could billow out and Natasha could complain about the cold air rushing through.</p><p>Making up for lost time, they stayed like that for the rest of the afternoon, talking about everything they’d missed, dancing back and forth around the topic of what Agatha had been doing all these months, of Natasha’s conviction that a more final solution could be found, and only descending into silence when the inevitable happened: Rio fell asleep on the couch.</p><p>When she woke up she felt worse than before, maybe because she checked her phone and she hadn’t heard anything from Agatha since she’d left earlier, or maybe because there was just an hour before she’d need to leave to go to Stark’s gala, or maybe it was because her subconscious had been scheming even as she’d been sleeping.</p><p>Rio told Natasha her plan and in a surprising turn of events, found Natasha to be on Agatha’s side, if only for a second.</p><p>“She won’t like it.”</p><p>“I know. But she said she’d listen to me and this will help Abigail respect her.”</p><p>Natasha had sighed heavily and watched Rio as she stretched from where she’d been curled in Agatha’s chair, “It keeps you one step away, I suppose. Less embroiled.”</p><p>Rio had sighed and insisted that that wasn’t the point but decided not to argue anymore and instead padded through to reluctantly change out of her comfortable clothes and into something a bit more gala appropriate</p><p>She wanted to impress for Agatha, wanted to show up and be exactly who she needed her to be, and who, in fact, she was: her loving, doting, partner.</p><p>Though beneath it all was the fear that even if Agatha pulled away, stepped back from her mission to destroy Wanda, she’d be in danger. Wanda wouldn’t relent. And if Agatha didn’t succeed in her plans with Abigail then she was screwed.</p><p>She distracted herself by focusing on the evening alone, taking solace in the knowledge that she’d be with Agatha soon enough.</p><p>Natasha helped Rio pick her dress and do her makeup, which meant that Natasha lounged on the bed and gave opinions when asked but otherwise was focused on swiping left and right on Tinder, which in turn meant that Rio could also give opinions when asked.</p><p>By the time she was ready to leave, her nerves had steadied, thanks to a large glass of one of Agatha’s more expensive whisky’s, and she was desperate to be by Agatha’s side again, knowing that a lot was riding on tonight but that it would be the eve of their new life together: one where they could actually spend time together, actually be happy, actually be on the same page.</p><p>Rio left with Natasha wearing a red dress with a cut out below the cup of her right breast that showed off her soft abs and most of her hip that she’d chosen mostly because she knew it would drive Agatha insane, the slit up her thigh was just a bonus.</p><p>With matching red lipstick and her hair loose about her shoulders, she bundled into an oversized blazer to protect from the cold as they stepped into the frigid February evening. As Natasha was showing her the photo of a pretty blonde she was about to meet at a bar a couple blocks away, Rio glanced up to see a familiar face smiling at her and she brightened instantly, “Jimmy!”</p><p>The driver-cum-pick-pocket smiled warmly at Rio though he looked frozen to the spot even in his large overcoat and he tipped an imaginary cap to Natasha who shot him an amused look before kissing Rio’s cheek and sauntering off to her date.</p><p>“Is she in there?” Rio asked hopefully as she made her way over and squinted through blacked out windows.</p><p>“‘Fraid not. She asked me to wait for you, make sure you got there safe.”</p><p>“How long have you been waiting?”</p><p>“About an hour or so.”</p><p>“<em>Jimmy.</em>”</p><p>Jimmy shrugged and smiled as he opened the door for Rio, “She told me you’d be busy and not to bother you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and touched Jimmy’s cold cheek with her cold hand, “Heating on full blast. Demand a raise. I’ll make her give you one.”</p><p>“I’m well remunerated, don’t worry.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she got into the warm interior of the car and settled back against the plush leather bench. As Jimmy pulled away and drove the short distance to the venue Rio thought back on her earlier discussion with Natasha and wondered how the evening would go now she’d made up her mind on the best way for Agatha to win over her former boss.</p><p>But by the time Rio arrived at the swanky venue, she was feeling much more herself. This was where she thrived: being shown off to crowds of people, looking good on someone’s arm, providing support where needed.</p><p>Only, this time, she was doing it all for her wife. Which made her heart swell and fingers twitch as if desperate to find the hand she so badly wanted to hold after being incommunicado with Agatha for nigh on five hours now.</p><p>She made her way up to the top floor of the venue, directed by a friendly receptionist and well-placed signs in the lobby. And when she came out into the correct floor she was greeted by lavish displays, plenty of waiters milling around with empty trays and harangued looks, and a large stage at the back of the open space, with a backdrop of the Manhattan skyline. It was magnificent. It was over the top. It was Agatha.</p><p>Unsure where Agatha would be and after handing in her coat at the coat check, she decided to head towards a recognisable landmark in the room so she could call her, Rio stopped by a large bar and propped her clutch up against it, leaning her elbow on the high top as she pressed to dial Agatha’s number.</p><p>But the dial tone had only just sounded as familiar, warm hands found her hips and she felt the press of an equally familiar body against her back. Rio’s breath caught in her throat as she lowered her phone and heard the words husked against her ear, “God I want to get you pregnant in this dress.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand had slipped over the bare skin at Rio’s side and slid further in below the tight fabric to hold more of her, her free hand slipping just as sinfully into the slit on her opposite side at her thigh and Rio had to fight off the butterflies that were causing her whole body to vibrate as her wife began kissing slowly, her mouth open and hungry, along her neck.</p><p>“And us not even properly married,” Rio gasped out, “what would the church elders say?”</p><p>She reached a hand behind her to hold Agatha’s head against her neck and buried her fingers in dark hair, tugging a little as Agatha held her more firmly against herself and nipped at her earlobe.</p><p>Whilst Agatha was determined to shock and outrage whichever church elders Rio had conjured up, Rio managed to keep some sense of decorum and reached down to stop Agatha’s left hand moving dangerously close to her inner thigh through the slit in her dress. “Hey,” Rio whispered, turning her head as best she could to get a look at Agatha, “Everyone knows you can’t get pregnant if you do it standing up.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes sparkled in the twinkly lights around the bar and Rio saw reflected in them her own dark brown ones as she slowly turned, making Agatha break her hold on her as she did.</p><p>“I’m sure we could try.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t done and pressed Rio back firmly into the bar, pressing their hips together and leaning back to get a good look at Rio, her hands hovering where Rio knew they would as soon as she’d chosen this dress: at the access to her naked side.</p><p>But Rio could barely concentrate on Agatha’s hands because she was too distracted by what Agatha was wearing. It was a deep navy long-sleeved shirt with thin pinstripes and matching pants and a long black leather tie with a gold cap over the knot. Her hair was down and wavy and swept to the side and Rio couldn’t believe that this woman was real. She looked powerful and Rio felt power<em>less</em> as she gazed at her, wondering how she was going to get through the evening with Agatha looking the way she did and looking at her like she wanted to devour her.</p><p>“Come with me,” Agatha breathed out, not a request, a demand. Her gaze barely reaching past Rio’s collarbones as it moved all over her before she pulled away and took Rio’s hand to drag her along behind her.</p><p>Rio released a loud laugh as the oxygen returned to her brain and she was free to think of more than just being railed by Agatha against the bar.</p><p>“Agatha,” she insisted as she was dragged through the area, passing large cutouts of Tony Stark looking presidential and nervous waiters in their penguin suits.</p><p>“Agatha, won’t everyone be arriving soon?”</p><p>“We have time,” Agatha reassured, turning to grin at Rio just as Billy, with his impeccable timing, slammed right into her front.</p><p>The fallout was colossal and the sounds of breaking glass and curses could be heard across the whole floor. Rio had not been able to stop herself from colliding into Agatha’s back and so the three of them crashed together into a nearby table housing ‘Stark for President’ pins and stickers, and Rio, being the last down so the first up, peeled Agatha off of Billy quickly for fear she’d throttle him.</p><p>“You fucking idiot, Kaplan!”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Rio felt the eyes of the waitstaff on them as she rallied around to Agatha’s front and held her cheeks, “My love, it was an accident.”</p><p>Agatha was breathing heavily, her mind torn between ripping Billy’s head off and screaming the place down. Both. Maybe she could do both.</p><p>But Rio was stepping closer, so close that she could feel her breath against her cheek, and the third thing she wanted to do in that moment won against the other two. Her gaze fell from a furious looking Billy to wide brown eyes and she found her grounding in them as she nodded silently and let her hands find Rio’s hips again. She paused. Took a deep breath and allowed Rio’s gentle smile to relax her.</p><p>But blue eyes flashed dangerously again as they darted over to Billy who was busy trying to salvage the fanned out stickers that now more resembled a Rorschach image than an American flag and she huffed out a breath as she moved past Rio to take Billy’s arm. “Leave it.” Lowering her voice she glanced about them before saying, “We’re not exactly worried about the visuals of the stickers tonight, Billy.”</p><p>Billy looked concerned still but relaxed when he turned to see Agatha’s face and eventually nodded, glancing between her and Rio sheepishly, “Sorry.”</p><p>He still looked tense, angry even, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said quickly, unwilling to have to apologise to him to for reacting the way she just had, “watch where you’re going.”</p><p>“And you,” she snapped her fingers at a nearby waiter and pointed to the glass now scattered about the place from the glass of champagne Billy had been holding, “Clean this mess. Now.”</p><p>“You could have maimed us,” Agatha accused as she looked back to Billy, unable to stop herself but feeling Rio’s hand on her lower back, she bit her tongue as Billy began to frown again, his ears tinging pink.</p><p>“Maybe if you weren’t too busy making out with your girlfriend and actually-…”</p><p>But Rio had placed a hand on his chest, moving away from Agatha entirely to focus now on what she knew to be a disaster waiting to happen. “Hey, not here. Okay? Can we go somewhere else to talk?”</p><p>“Now you want to talk?” Billy accused with a scowl, her brow so furrowed his thick eyebrows met in the middle and his whole face went a little pinker. “What about earlier when-…?”</p><p>“Watch your mouth you little-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said firmly, reaching behind her to grab Agatha’s wrist as the woman stepped in to get closer to Billy.</p><p>Rio was, perhaps the only of the three, intimately aware of the young waiter now hurriedly trying to scoop up the glass around them and she knew they couldn’t risk either Billy or Agatha blowing up at the other in such a public place. Not when so much could already go wrong tonight.</p><p>“Let’s go somewhere more-…”</p><p>“No,” Billy said curtly, his gaze dropping to Rio again, and he stepped back out of her reach, “No. I’m not interested in what you have to say.”</p><p>Rio’s brows shot up towards her hairline and she reeled back a little but kept her hold on Agatha, allowing Billy to brush past them both and storm off in the other direction.</p><p>Rio span to Agatha then, watching her face contort in anger for a second before she pulled her away, marching with her god knows where but away from where Billy had gone.</p><p>She pushed open the first door she found and rolled her eyes at her luck when she realised it was a supply closet. But she didn’t have time. She pushed Agatha inside and slammed the door behind them, turning to press a firm finger in the centre of Agatha’s chest, “I told you you should have let him in.”</p><p>“Me?” Agatha gaped, “you’re angry at <em>me</em>?!”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said firmly, though in all honesty ‘angry’ wasn’t the term she’d use. More like: worried, upset, frightened.</p><p>Agatha seemed to sense this because instead of continuing what was sure to be a tirade she pinched the bridge of her nose and took in a deep breath. “He will come around. He has a little tantrum and then he comes around.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes out of frustration this time and turned from Agatha to rest her forearms on the door, taking her own steady breaths to calm herself. “This is already difficult enough.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said, more calmly, and Rio felt her moving in closer behind her, covering the space between them in less than two steps in the cramped, dark room.</p><p>In a mirror image of Rio holding Agatha before, Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio and pressed a kiss to her shoulder, “I’m not sure hiding in a broom closet is helping though.”</p><p>Rio snorted and sighed as she straightened and reached behind her to pull Agatha closer, and she happily obliged, her hands making quick work of groping and squeezing Rio given the privacy and access that she now had.</p><p>“We could stay,” she murmured, “just for a little bit.”</p><p>Rio groaned a little as one hand dipped lover over her abdomen and the other went to palm at her breast above her dress but she had enough sense left to stop Agatha, to place her own hands over Agatha’s wandering ones and to halt their exploration. “We can’t. Not now. We need to focus. <em>Both</em> of us.”</p><p>Agatha released a hot breath of dissatisfaction against Rio’s neck but pulled away, knowing her wife well enough to know when to push and when not to.</p><p>“Fine. But don’t tell me you wore that dress for me just to <em>look</em> all night.”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned in Agatha’s now looser hold to tug at her tie, under the guise of adjusting it, smirking across at her, “Are you demanding satisfaction, sir?”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed dangerously and narrowed as Agatha’s hold changed again and she slipped her hands down to Rio’s ass, “Don’t tease. I want you in ways I-…”</p><p>But she flinched suddenly as the door opened and a wide-eyed member of the staff appeared, having clearly not expected two women feeling each other up in the place he kept his brooms.</p><p>Rio had to bite back a laugh but managed a quick apology to the man as she dragged Agatha out by her tie, only releasing it when Agatha mumbled something about it not being sexy anymore and stole it back from her grip.</p><p>She replaced it with her hand and, knowing her way around better than Rio, walked her to a nearby holding room where there were extra trays for food and extra stickers, as well as a cardboard cutout of Tony grinning at them as they entered.</p><p>“Finger guns? Really? With the state of this country and gun-toting assholes, you’d think-…”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha said huffily, turning to close the door behind them and push Rio further into the room until her back came into contact with one of the tables.</p><p>“Now. Where were we?”</p><p>Rio sighed and draped her arms loosely over Agatha’s shoulders, smiling a little at the switch back to horny that seemed to happen before her eyes, “Well, I need to talk to you about something first.”</p><p>“What? Can’t it wait? Can’t I just-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said a little more firmly, pulling her hands back to bury in long hair at the base of Agatha’s neck. “I know how these things go. Right now you’re still useful to stark which means any minute we could be interrupted and I want to ask you to do something. Something that’ll help.”</p><p>Agatha shifted slightly, straightening her back as she stared into concerned brown eyes, watching as Rio chewed the corner of her lip.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“It’s us,” she said softly, “I think it would be best to make out that you’ve paid for me. Given me an offer I couldn’t refuse.”</p><p>Agatha’s face fell and her hands dropped from Rio, all astonishment and betrayal.</p><p>“No. No. Not in a million fucking years. Like some porny version of The Godfather?”</p><p>Despite Agatha’s outburst, Rio schooled her features and moved a little closer, placing one hand at Agatha’s chest, “Abigail will have more respect for a woman who saw something she liked and <em>took</em> it rather than to find out you fell in love with me and married me because you couldn’t imagine a life without me.”</p><p>Rio parted her lips as if to say something else but the look on Agatha’s face stopped her and she felt a hollowness in her chest as she dropped her hands to find pale fingers that simply hung by Agatha’s sides, not twitching in their usual dance, not reaching for Rio.</p><p>She took a deep breath as she held Agatha’s hands and turned them over to lift her rings to her lips and held them there a while, tasting the cool metal.</p><p>“It only matters that we know the truth. That I love you and that you’re mine and I’m yours, okay?”</p><p>But Agatha had closed her eyes and for one brief, heartbreaking moment, she looked as if tears were going to breach the long lashes that kissed their counterparts but Rio felt her hands being squeezed and Agatha was speaking again in a low murmur, “I said I’d let you help so… if you think this will…”</p><p>“I do,” Rio whispered in a sick sort of facsimile of their vows.</p><p>She leant in slowly, worried she might be denied, and pressed her lips to Agatha’s. The kiss was soft and tentative, the kind of kiss that wasn’t common between them anymore, because even when they were gentle, they were both so sure.</p><p>But Agatha reciprocated, her eyelashes flickering open slowly as Rio rested their foreheads together and soon Agatha’s hands released her own as her arms snaked back around her waist.</p><p>“It’ll help,” Rio confirmed again, though Agatha hadn’t asked, and she pulled her upper half back to watch Agatha properly, placing her against her cheeks, “it’ll remind her that you’re powerful.”</p><p>“Loving isn’t weak,” Agatha said quickly, too quickly, and her eyes betrayed her too as they widened a little at her own slip.</p><p>“No,” Rio smiled and shook her head, her heart hammering in her chest now, as her eyes filled with tears and she stared at her powerful, domineering, arrogant, soft, gentle, loving wife. “Of course it isn’t. It’s the opposite. And us, <em>our</em> love, it’s so powerful, mi amor. A través de esto nos mantendremos a salvo el uno al otro, ¿de acuerdo? por el resto de nuestras vidas.” <em>Through it we will keep each other safe, okay? For the rest of our lives.</em></p><p>Agatha’s body relaxed then as she held Rio and she closed the distance between them with such surety that Rio gasped against her lips, and they stumbled back into the table full of more Stark memorabilia.</p><p>Rio allowed Agatha to take what she needed from her, her hands grasping at her desperately as she kissed her with a force entirely too wild for their current predicament but not wild enough for Agatha to ever be satiated with enough of Rio.</p><p>It was as Agatha began pressing open-mouthed kisses along Rio’s jaw and she bent down to lift her onto the table that they were, as Rio had predicted, interrupted:</p><p>“There you are!”</p><p>Rio jumped a little against Agatha and they both turned to see who was interrupting them.</p><p>Rio’s stomach lurched as the subject of all of her arguments with Agatha waltzed into the room like he owned it and as Agatha pulled reluctantly away from her she remembered why else her stomach might be lurching.</p><p>The last time she’d been anywhere even remotely near this man he’d been on the phone, and Agatha had been fucking her senseless over her desk. She blushed a little and bit down on her lip as Agatha took charge and took Rio’s hand to pull her over to the man of the hour, even as she absently fluffed her hair out and raised her thumb to tidy any errant lipstick stains on her mouth.</p><p>If Agatha remembered this she didn’t show it. She was back to professional Agatha. Agatha Harkness: no bullshit, all brilliance.</p><p>The role reversal wasn’t lost on her this time.</p><p>The week Agatha had hired her, for better or worse, she had been in professional mode as much as she could be whilst dealing with her complicated feelings for Agatha. And now, now, it was Agatha’s turn. The situation was just as complicated, only for different reasons, but Rio had to sit back and allow Agatha to take charge - something she was accustomed to in the bedroom but that she was reticent to give tonight.</p><p>“Stark. This is-…”</p><p>“Rio, yes.”</p><p>Tony shot Rio a wink  and his gaze darted about red lips that were much less neat than they had been not two minutes earlier and turned to Agatha again as Rio hastily wiped around her mouth, “If I weren’t a happily married man, Harkness, I might be fighting you for her. Congrats on the hottie. And sorry for interrupting the canoodling.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened a little and Rio felt herself being pulled closer as Agatha’s back straightened, “And I am a happily married woman, Stark. Watch it.”</p><p>Tony just hummed as if deliberating this for a second but chose to drop it as he looked around the room, “Well, everyone’s beginning to arrive and other than fondling your girl, you’re not much used to me here. I could use your wit and charm to-…”</p><p>But he stopped as a fourth person entered the room in the form of another familiar face. She was very tall and very beautiful, very poised, and very friendly, judging by the smile on her face, and Rio knew she’d like her immediately.</p><p>“Here you all are,” Pepper announced with relief, grinning over at Tony first before rounding on Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“You must be Rio,” she said with that same grin, moving to kiss Agatha’s cheek before doing the same to Rio and holding her at arms length infront of her, “I knew you’d be pretty but my god, Agatha. Well done.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shot Agatha a smile before letting her hand go so Agatha could move away and indulge Stark and Rio turned her attention back to Pepper, “It’s a lot of lipstick and mascara but thank you.”</p><p>“And humble too! I like you already.”</p><p>Pepper gave Rio a light squeeze where she still held her arms and turned back to Tony, “Babe, people are asking for you. Don’t leave them waiting. And Agatha, I can’t find Billy anywhere. Any ideas?”</p><p>Rio looked subtly over at Agatha then as pepper turned fully towards her and saw <em>her</em> Agatha being replaced by the <em>public</em> Agatha. She looked haughty, pissed off, unmoved.</p><p>A whole day of arguing, investigating, conspiring, and none of it showed on her face. She simply rolled her shoulders back in a nonchalant shrug and threw out a laugh that only Rio knew to be fake.</p><p>“Billy won’t be far. Not if he knows what’s good for him.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The little mismatched group of two happy couples soon left the seclusion of the holding room and Rio caught her breath when they stepped into the chaos that had become the Stark For President Fundraiser.</p><p>How long they’d been scurried away she didn’t know. Maybe in the haze of being caught in the janitor’s closet she’d missed the people arriving as they ran past and hurried into the small room but suddenly, unbelievably, the place looked packed.</p><p>The venue was now abuzz with noise, diamonds everywhere you looked, elegant women and middling men, all swanning about and greeting each other with disinterested cheek kisses and disingenuous cries of “oh it’s so lovely to see you!”</p><p>But attentions were soon drawn to the group and Rio watched as Stark grew two inches in stature, nothing to do with the subtle Cuban heels he was sporting. Pepper delicately wrapped her arm around her husband’s and Agatha, not done with her time with Rio just yet, placed a hand on Rio’s side and discreetly guided her to the edge of the swarm of sycophants.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers were firm and warm around Rio’s waist and she was more glad than ever that she’d picked a dress where she could feel Agatha’s against her skin. Tonight wasn’t a night to be far, nor a night to have anything unnecessary standing between them, there would be enough of that already.</p><p>In a strange sort of deja vu, the two of them moved through the growing mass of people and Rio smiled warmly despite the chill in her bones at the exhibition of wealth and pretence of influence as people turned their way to try and capture Agatha’s attention or to ogle at the intimate hold of one of Washington’s most powerful on a pretty girl in a pretty red dress.</p><p>Agatha barely looked anyone’s way, keeping her eyes on their destination: a quiet corner of the bar area where more people were too busy helping themselves to the free alcohol or else schmoozing over their shared bigotry. Or maybe that last part was just in Rio’s bitter, lefty, mind.</p><p>Agatha manoeuvred them to as secluded a spot as she could find without locking them away in the supply closet again and Rio was grateful when Agatha positioned her with her back to the wall and her side against the bar, standing in front of her so as to block her from view.</p><p>Their hands met without either of them thinking as Agatha dropped hers from Rio’s waist and stepped in closer, too close for such a public room, but not close enough to relax either of them properly.</p><p>“I don’t want to lie.”</p><p>Her words were simple, but her tone was flat, strong, whilst her face remained open, her eyes that same ocean of words unspoken. And Rio felt the weight of them, this same issue that had been between them so many months ago now back before them. Though now they were committed, now they were exclusive, now they had a life together ahead of them.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I don’t want to ever not claim you as mine. <em>Actually</em> mine. Not because I bought you or because it will get me points.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>But this time Rio was the one to move in a little closer, so close their bodies were almost touching and she raised her hand to brush along Agatha’s jaw and was silent for a few seconds before she said, “It’s just one night. And once it’s over, we can get on with our lives and forget about all of this, all of these people.”</p><p>The bartender then approached them and Rio moved her gaze from Agatha’s face and dropped her hand. “A Shiraz please. And a double MacAllan. Neat.”</p><p>By the time she’d turned around, Agatha had dropped her hand and was running her fingers through her hair, her body now turned away from Rio and she was looking down the length of the bar to check for any potential interlopers. Any political groupies. But she saw none, and so focused on the movements of the bartender fetching their drinks.</p><p>Rio touched her elbow lightly and whispered, “Magic drinking tonight. No more than three. Can’t get all loose and start telling people how much you love me.”</p><p>She raised her brows and grinned at Agatha’s profile, hoping to catch even a glimmer of amusement in her eyes but Agatha had rolled them instead and turned back to Rio so quickly and pressed her lips to her ear so smoothly that she didn’t have a chance to see how Agatha had taken it, she heard it instead:</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Her hand moved up to rest against Rio’s bare side and she pulled her closer until their bodies were flush together and Rio’s heart rate picked up exponentially.</p><p>“I cannot imagine my life without you.”</p><p>Her other hand moved to snake around Rio’s waist and she held her closer, briefly brushing her lips over the shell of Rio’s ear.</p><p>“I will lie to her but I want you by my side the rest of the evening.”</p><p>Her hand at Rio’s side snaked around to rest now on her lower back and Rio felt a jolt in her stomach as she was enveloped entirely by Agatha.</p><p>“I want people to see us together and my hands on you at all times and then I’m going to take you home and make you scream my name until you can’t do it anymore, and in the morning I’m taking you far away where no one can find us and I’ll have you all to myself.”</p><p>Agatha dipped then to brush her lips against Rio’s ear lobe and Rio saw stars as Agatha’s ringed hand dipped dangerously low against her lower back but she took a slow breath to steady her raging mind as she whispered back, “You drive a hard bargain but… I’m sure I can handle that.”</p><p>Agatha only hummed in response and dipped her head lower to kiss at Rio’s jaw now that Rio had tilted her head back to grant her more access.</p><p>“Stop,” she murmured even as her hands moved to clutch at the front of Agatha’s shirt, and her body was saying anything but. “Agatha,” she gasped quietly as Agatha began to nip and suck at the skin on her neck and prayed for the strength to push this woman away.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t stopped and Rio had no hope in hell of telling her again because a third party had become involved and was watching with something akin to amusement not two feet away.</p><p>“She never touched me like that.”</p><p>Rio’s body went cold and her eyes flashed open immediately to land on the last person she wanted to see: Wanda.</p><p>There she stood, dressed in a deep navy dress, her elbow against the corner of the bar and her gaze sharp as she watched the realisation dawn on Rio’s face. Agatha remained against her still, but had halted her attentions and for a second Rio thought she wouldn’t move away but she did and Rio’s hands smoothed down her shirt before Agatha turned away from her, flashing her a glance to check she was okay before she turned to Wanda.</p><p>“Wanda. I’m not sure you want to go into all the reasons I had very little interest in being anywhere near you.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands had dropped from Rio when she’d turned away but she held her arm behind her back, palm facing up to Rio who had taken it immediately and stood just to the side of Agatha, watching Wanda with contempt.</p><p>“I think you know by now I’d happily rehash our time together, Aggie. You know I miss you.”</p><p>Agatha made a move to step forwards towards Wanda but Rio stepped around her quickly, releasing her hand as she did. “That’s not really appropriate to say in front of someone’s wife now, is it?”</p><p>“Wife?” Wanda laughed softly and blinked, looking between the two women in surprise as Agatha’s arm wrapped around Rio and her gaze settled on the dazzling rings on the fingers now splayed across Rio’s stomach.</p><p>“Well well… a real life Pretty Woman. Paying for the privilege I assume?”</p><p>“I would advise,” Agatha said in a deep and dangerous tone that Rio had only heard from her a handful of times and that set alarm bells ringing in her head even as she placed her hand over Agatha’s. “That you keep your mouth shut before I shut it for you.”</p><p>Wanda practically beamed at this response, delighted that she could still get under Agatha’s skin. “Touch a nerve?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered in warning, now gripping her hand so tightly she was sure she’d be hurting her. But Agatha hadn’t moved from where she stood behind Rio and instead placed her free hand on Rio’s waist, pulling her as flush against her as she could.</p><p>“She’s got you whipped,” Wanda noted with a smirk, “Which is interesting because you are so…” she hummed and took a sip of her drink as Rio turned back slightly to glance at Agatha, noticing the fire in her eyes with a sinking feeling in her stomach. She’d already set Agatha on edge by asking her to deny their true relationship and now Wanda was pushing her buttons and despite the fear settling low in her stomach, a sharp, irrepressible rage settled in her throat and she felt powerless to do anything about it.</p><p>But Wanda was watching all this with interest and said the next word like a slur.</p><p>“… <em>powerful</em>. How’s it feel to be the little bitch of a-…”</p><p>That is when it happened, and both Agatha and Rio were powerless to stop it.</p><p>The rage had overtaken her fear.</p><p>Rio had ripped herself so cleanly from Agatha’s vicelike grip that it had taken the woman behind her a second to realise what had happened.</p><p>Because <em>Agatha</em> had been ready to go for Wanda but she hadn’t expected Rio to.</p><p>But Rio had grown up scrapping on the streets with her friends and she’d made a name for herself on the basketball court for a reason.</p><p>She was fast, and now unafraid.</p><p>Her hand flew to Wanda’s side and she held her so tightly that the fabric bunched, and her left hand, the one that wore Agatha’s rings, flew to her neck and she squeezed, not enough to choke the woman, but enough to silence her. And she watched as light green eyes flashed and a sick smirk tweaked her lips.</p><p>If anyone were looking at them then they’d have seen two women looking friendly, perhaps affectionate, pressed close but both smiling at the other, one still clutching a glass of red.</p><p>Rio was smiling, a strange calm washing over her as she held Wanda firmly, her fingers squeezing her throat for just a second longer before she dropped them and clutched the arm of her dress instead.</p><p>Wanda’s breath fluttered against her face and she saw her gaze fall to her lips as she whispered, “Stay away from her. Stay away from us.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me?”</p><p>“You know I am.”</p><p>Agatha’s arms had at some point wrapped themselves around Rio but she’d barely been aware of her hold, as focused as she was on letting Wanda know she was done with her shit, done with messing around. Only as the sound of someone else approaching entered her conscience did she begin to pull back, finally allowing Agatha to pull her further and turn her so her back was to the bar and Agatha could crowd her from the front.</p><p>Rio’s vision felt off, her calm dissipating all of a sudden and she felt so angry that she could barely speak, but the ghost of Wanda’s breath on her face dissolved as Agatha replaced it with her own lips, brushing them soothingly over Rio’s cheek as a familiar voice rang out.</p><p>“Turns out you <em>can</em> be seduced by big brown eyes and a pretty smile, Harkness. Who knew?”</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze on Rio, her blue eyes full of concern that didn’t help Rio’s growing nausea. She placed her hand back to her exposed side and left her other resting against her cheek for a second longer before she pulled back slightly from Rio, turning only halfway with her left hand resting on Rio’s right hip she reached for her whisky, taking a swig and hovering so close to Rio still as if to barricade her in between her own body and the bar. The two women nearby were now sniggering quietly at their own cleverness and Rio had to fight the urge to throw herself at them both.</p><p>Instead she took a deep breath, her gaze never once leaving Agatha. She wondered how she’d get through the evening. It was still so early and she’d already lost it, already threatened the woman who had been the uninvited third party in their relationship for months now. She was so disorientated that Agatha’s hold felt like the only thing keeping her upright.</p><p>She had known it would be difficult. Knew it would be beyond comprehension to be silent and polite in the presence of <em>that</em> woman, but this was untenable. Inconceivable.</p><p>She wanted to kill Wanda with her bare hands. She wanted to throttle her and stand triumphantly over her body as Agatha watched and then pulled her away with her.</p><p>But it was Agatha who was pulling her away <em>now</em>. Agatha had placed her now empty glass down and had grabbed Rio’s wine before she took her hand and pulled her back into the throng of people, away from the danger zone that was the quiet corner with the two most dangerous people in the room.</p><p>When they were far enough away, and when Agatha wasn’t feeling sick from how close Rio had been to her ex-wife, she turned to Rio and offered her her wine.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have done it.”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed with anger and that same concern from before as they darted about behind Rio’s head to check no one was listening.</p><p>“Do you know how stupid that was?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and held her glass to her chest, feeling the shame wash over her.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Drink your wine.”</p><p>Rio did as she was told and took three big gulps of her wine, her eyes eventually opening to watch as Agatha kept close but looked around them, subtly checking for any sudden interruptions still.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath when half her wine was gone and she licked the residue from her lips before saying: “I saw red. I’m sorry. I was supposed to just-…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha said quickly, almost urgently as she locked back into Rio’s gaze and reached for her hand again, “Just try not to do it again.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her then, a firm, reassuring kiss that absolved Rio of her sins as her arm draped around her waist once more. When she pulled back she smiled a little and pressed a quick kiss to the corner of Rio’s lips, because she could and because she needed to reassure herself that she could.</p><p>Rio kept her eyes closed for a second and was about to say something when Agatha spoke once more, her voice lower this time, “I know what I said a minute ago, but maybe you should go home. Perhaps having you here was selfish of me. I’ll get Jimmy to come back and-…”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly, her free hand moving to loop just below the gold metal knot of Agatha’s tie, “I’m staying. I can control myself, I promise. I want to be with you.”</p><p>Agatha looked pained for a second, clearly deliberating what she’d say but eventually she nodded and pressed another quick kiss to Rio’s cheek, nudging her nose there afterwards and in that one gentle movement Rio felt her tension slowly release.</p><p>“I want to kill her,” she admitted quietly, watching as Agatha pulled away and she released her hold on her tie and instead rested her hand against her chest.</p><p>The woman before her pursed her lips but looked away again, her blue eyes darting about the space around them. She looked pained once more but there was something else in her blue eyes that Rio couldn’t place. And she had to look away, feeling culpable as she finished off the rest of her wine.</p><p>She dropped her gaze to the slow progress of the burgundy droplets moving back down the glass and was briefly distracted, thinking about how someone had once told her about being able to tell the number of tannins in a wine from the speed of the drops. The devil in the details, she thought. Everything you needed to know about an entire bottle of wine contained in one, tiny drop.</p><p>But she was soon shaken from her reverie by Agatha’s warm, reassuring hand at her side again and the sound of an unfamiliar voice greeting her almost-wife.</p><p>Rio forced herself back to the task at hand and looked up with a polite smile plastered on her face. She managed to nod and greet the Congressman now stealing Agatha’s attention.</p><p>She watched the interaction like a school child might at the edges of a lion’s cage at the zoo. Agatha looked regal again, her back ramrod straight and her eyes ablaze with superiority as she allowed the congressman only so much before she would interject, rebuttal, dismiss.</p><p>It was fascinating to watch, and even more fascinating to Rio when Agatha’s free hand moved across her body to take hold of Rio’s free one, now essentially enveloping her in the most appropriate way she could think to do so.</p><p>Rio perched her empty glass on a waiter’s tray as he swept past and pretended to focus back in on the conversation, understanding that the congressman was simpering to Agatha about some vote or other and the sway she might be able to leverage.</p><p>The congressman’s soporific voice was dulling the anger that still bubbled in her chest, but it was just simmering now, rather than boiling over.</p><p>As the conversation continued and Rio was only vaguely aware of Agatha’s fingers twitching gently against her side, she let her gaze wander round the rest of the room.</p><p>Full was an understatement, packed was a diminutive.</p><p>The room was heaving with some of the richest people in the world.</p><p>There were even recognisable faces from the world of television and movies and Rio counted silently to herself how many Oscar winners were there.</p><p>It was clear that Stark was popular, even amongst those she would have assumed would be members of the liberal elite. But republicanism had a way of slipping into every walk of life, into every heart and mind. And money, Rio knew, had a way of turning people.</p><p>Which is why she considered Agatha Harkness to be a bit of a miracle.</p><p>She wasn’t obtuse enough to believe that everything was black and white; that poor people were good and rich people bad.</p><p>But Agatha had grown up with all sorts of economic privilege, even been brought up in a house full of hatred and prejudice, and she was still inherently good.</p><p>Though, Rio could admit, as she felt Agatha drop her hand briefly to motion over a young waiter who looked more nervous than anyone Rio had ever seen before, that she definitely had a ways to go when dealing with staff.</p><p>Which made her think of Billy.</p><p>Amongst the throng of people milling around, schmoozing, not once had she spotted Billy Kaplan.</p><p>Usually recognisable from his shock of dark curls, thick brows, and enough piercings to alarm most more conservative people in the room, he was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Something settled in Rio’s gut that felt nauseating again and neither the warmth from the wine she’d just drunk nor the steady warmth of the hand still comfortably curled around her side could shake it.</p><p>But she couldn’t relay her fears to Agatha who was still impatiently talking to the congressman, who was now trying to impress her with names of his famous golfing buddies. But her slight shift in body weight, her turn away from Agatha had alerted the woman next to her that something was wrong.</p><p>Agatha looked askance at her and Rio took the opportunity to mutter, “Bathroom. Be right back.”</p><p>Before Agatha could react, she’d pulled away and turned into the crowd to search for the missing assistant.</p><p>It was slow work, moving through the room, and she felt eyes on her even as she did. Some were subtle glances up and down from women in gaudy gowns or ill-fitting pantsuits but others were more obvious, lecherous, and came from most of the men she breezed by. But one set of eyes she knew would be on her even as she didn’t look around to check.</p><p>Agatha was now only half listening to the congressman, even less interested in his spiel than before, now that her hand hung empty and wanting by her side and her gaze followed the back of Rio’s head into the busy crowd.</p><p>But Rio had broken her promise to Agatha to always remain close because she’d realised that Billy was now a key player in this: a secret keeper too.</p><p>But, having now done a sweep of at least half the floor space, Rio still hadn’t found him. It was as she turned to try the other side of the room that a gentle hand touched her elbow and she turned to come face to face with Pepper.</p><p>“There you are! I thought Agatha had hidden you away. Where is she? Tony’s been asking for her.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said with a small smile and a blasé wave of her hand, slipping immediately into the woman who could charm anyone without much effort, “Chatting shop with some Congressman she can’t get away from.”</p><p>“They like to crowd her, have you noticed? At Tony’s last rally she had about five policy makers cornering her. Holds her own though, it’s a sight to see.”</p><p>“I have no doubt,” Rio said and couldn’t hide the pride in her voice that made Pepper smile a little wider.</p><p>“She kept quiet about you, you know. Didn’t mention anything like you in fact, until she showed up one day with a skip in her step and a ring on her finger.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio asked with interest, accepting the glass of champagne that Pepper had taken from a waiter with a smile and handed to her.</p><p>Pepper hummed and raised her glass to clink with Rio’s, “Never seen her happier. It was only then that she told me a little about you. Not a lot, though I did try.”</p><p>“She’s private,” Rio said with a soft smile, her gaze sweeping past Pepper briefly to see if she could spot her private love through the crowd.</p><p>“She’s protective,” Pepper said with a knowing glint in her eye, “I can tell that much.”</p><p>She lowered her voice then and stepped in a little, close enough that Rio could almost see herself reflected in the huge diamond ring on Pepper’s left hand that held her glass up.</p><p>“I don’t mean to assume your politics, but I’ve assumed Agatha’s, as much as she remains neutral about these things… and people always assume <em>mine</em> when usually they’re so far off the mark, but I wanted to reassure you that Tony is a good man. I’m sure you’ve had some issues with some of his policies and I’ve been around Agatha enough to know that she’s been struggling through this campaign, despite the brave face she puts on, and I hope that…” she sighed and cleared her throat quietly, briefly glancing to make sure they weren’t being overheard, “I hope that it doesn’t come between you, is all. She’s truly something and if her clear love for you is anything to go by then you must be too.”</p><p>Rio watched Pepper curiously during her little speech, wondering if there were some truth to Tony being a good man. The woman before her appeared sure and smart and kind, surely she couldn’t be duped by an egomaniac with bullshit views? But she neither expressed this nor let on that she was thinking it as she smiled and squeezed Pepper’s arm, “Thank you. I am much more liberal than I would guess anyone in the room would be comfortable with and… it has been a little tricky watching Agatha work on this campaign so I appreciate your saying that.”</p><p>Pepper smiled softly and took a step back again, raising the volume of her voice once more to a normal level, “So, when is the wedding? I can’t imagine it’ll be a long wait? Agatha isn’t exactly the patient type.”</p><p>“No,” Rio admitted with a smirk, taking a sip of her champagne before adding, “Soon, more than likely. But it’s just the legalities of it. We’re…” she paused and shrugged a little, “She’s as good as my wife already.”</p><p>“Ah,” Pepper cooed with a soft laugh, “young love. I think you’ll be very happy together.”</p><p>“I agree,” Rio grinned and clinked their glasses together one more time.</p><p>The tinkle of the crystal acted like a homing signal and as if by magic, Rio felt the warmth of a hand at her side and the press of a familiar body against her as Agatha appeared again, “I thought I asked you to stay close?”</p><p>Pepper smiled at this and shot Rio a wink as she made her excuses and disappeared off to leave the two lovers to themselves.</p><p>Rio turned in Agatha’s hold and smiled at her, already reaching for her free hand, “You were otherwise engaged and I wanted to find Billy.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips at this and squeezed Rio’s fingers, “He’s off sulking, I told you.”</p><p>“If he’s sulking then he might-…”</p><p>But Rio was cut off from her by a familiar, cocky voice.</p><p>“Harkness. You know Senator Long?”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha moved away from her and turned to the interloper but she noted she hadn’t dropped her hand.</p><p>Senator Mary Long, a frequent flier on Air Vidal appeared before them. She was a petite brunette with a turned up nose and a hard heart, a woman who found nothing pleasing in others and everything pleasing about herself.</p><p>Rio didn’t like her very much but she’d always kept her in hotel rooms for the night with comfortable beds and never asked for anything Rio was generally uncomfortable doing so she was an easy lay and an even easier payday.</p><p>“Senator,” Agatha said curtly as Rio took another, centring swig of her champagne and watched the surprise dance across the face of her old client.</p><p>“Harkness,” Long sang out with a grin, though her delighted eyes were on Rio and a grin fell across her face at the sight. “And who might this be?”</p><p>Stark interjected then, happily placing a hand on Rio’s shoulder and presenting her to the Senator with a gentlemanly flourish, “This is Agatha’s… <em>wife</em>, if I’m not mistaken. Harkness, that right? Rio. A thing of beauty and according to <em>my</em> wife, a new favourite and a must-have on our dinner party list.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze had never once left Long and she managed to school her face into a polite smile even as she felt Agatha’s hand tense in her own. She held her hand out.</p><p>“Senator. Pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>“Oh, pleasure’s all mine, I’m sure,” the Senator purred as she held onto Rio’s hand, not shaking it, and it took Agatha moving her free hand to Rio’s extended arm to pull it back for the Senator to drop her hold.</p><p>“Babe,” Agatha said suddenly and Rio blinked at the epithet, instantly recognising that Agatha was attempting to take control again because she never called Rio ‘babe’. ‘Baby’? Definitely. ‘Honey’? Always. ‘My love’? Often. But ‘babe’? Never.</p><p>She dropped Agatha’s hand then, choosing instead to curl her hand around Agatha’s bicep and she pressed close to her side, almost letting Agatha stand a little in front of her.</p><p>“Senator Long’s husband is also a keen gardener. You should chat with him later. I’m sure he’d love to hear what you have to say.”</p><p>It was an unsubtle threat, a warning spoken to Rio but for the sake of the Senator who had finally looked away from Rio and was now staring at Agatha with contempt.</p><p>Rio played her role impeccably, clinging onto Agatha and trying to make up for giving into Wanda’s jibes earlier and simply smiled at the Senator, “Oh? I’d love to meet him.”</p><p>Senator Long schooled her face but looked suddenly caught, her cheeks flushing as Stark watched all of this with amusement in his eye, “Play nice, ladies. A lot of people to influence tonight… as well as a lot of cash to exchange hands. Harkness, why don’t you talk the Senator through some of the options for donation? Excuse me, I must circle again.”</p><p>As Stark left, Rio returned her attention back to Long who looked less than delighted to be left in Agatha’s company but who shook it off ineffectually and uttered, “So. Wives? That seems…” she glanced around and then raised her brows back at Agatha as she said, “unnecessary.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and Rio tightened her hold on her arm then to try and ground her, unwilling for the two of them to fly off the handle so early in the evening.</p><p>“Like your marriage?” Agatha quipped even as Rio squeezed her arm in warning.</p><p>“I’ll ask you to leave John out of this.”</p><p>“Like you usually do when fucking young women?”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>“<em>Careful</em>, Harkness. Not only are you paying for something that oh so many other women have had already, you’re making a fool of yourself by parading her around like-…”</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to step in then, swinging around like a pendulum to stand before Agatha and place her back to the sneering Senator. Because Agatha had made a move as if to go for Long, coiled like a snake about to strike.</p><p>“Bathroom,” she said quietly, firmly, “Now.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look like she would take Rio’s instruction and her mind seemed to be working overtime to figure out how she could possibly pulverise this Senator without causing a scene.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio tried again, her voice a little softer this time, as if she were doing nothing more than offering her wife a spoonful of honey to dip in her tea, “Let’s go.”</p><p>But Agatha was beyond reason and only her hand that now curled around Rio’s side kept her from throwing hands at the smirking Senator but she used her words instead, her tone dark and dangerous as she moved around her wife and spoke directly to the woman whom she’d just caught glancing down at Rio’s ass, “I pity you. All that power and you pilfer it away making bad decisions that make you unpopular and needy. A husband and two kids, and yet you seek satisfaction from a source that you only have access to because you married a rich, ineffectual man who will never satisfy you. Endless nights performing orgasms for your rutting, sweaty husband when all you have left of <em>my</em> wife is the memory that she once touched you in exchange for some cash that was never yours to give in the first place. I suggest you stay away from us for the rest of the evening and in the morning you hand in your resignation to the Governor, or I will spend the rest of your short and oh so pathetic career making it absolute <em>hell</em>. Do you understand me?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered again, now standing a little to the side where Agatha had moved around her, her hand having slipped from her side to resting lightly across her stomach.</p><p>But Senator Long had got the message loud and clear and there would be no more need for Rio to try to hold Agatha back.</p><p>The Senator went pale and nodded as if agreeing to nothing more than another cup of coffee, but she looked sick suddenly and if Rio had turned around to see, she’d have almost felt sorry for her.</p><p>“Right,” she managed out, her hands shaking a little, “I… yes. Yes. I should be getting along.”</p><p>The older Senator turned on her heel and marched away as Agatha relaxed back slightly and moved her hold on Rio to be more solid again, her gaze drifting back to her as Rio placed her hand on her jaw, “Let’s go get some fresh air.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything but allowed Rio to take her hand and direct her from the crowd through to the open balcony and Rio shivered as she directed Agatha away from the small groups that milled around by the barriers and took her to a quiet corner, as far from other people as she could find.</p><p>“I shouldn’t be here,” she finally said as she turned to Agatha and watched her look over the dark Manhattan skyline.</p><p>“You were right. It was a mistake to come.”</p><p>Agatha still said nothing and clutched the barrier firmly, her eyes still intent on the dark buildings in the mid-distance.</p><p>Rio shivered again and stepped in closer, draping an arm around Agatha’s lower back, for warmth as much as comfort.</p><p>“I called a judge friend today, I’ve asked to fast track the marriage licence but we won’t get it for a least a couple days. I’ve pulled some strings but… I want to take you away first thing. So we’ll just make it official when it comes through, wherever we are.”</p><p>Rio nodded at this, having discarded her champagne on a table as they’d walked past so her hand was now free to turn Agatha’s face towards her, “How long do you want to be away?”</p><p>“Forever.”</p><p>A soft smile tugged at Rio’s lips then as she took in the seriousness of Agatha’s face, the pad of her thumb brushing over her cheek soothingly, “I’m not sure that’s possible.”</p><p>“Six months,” Agatha countered quickly.</p><p>“One.”</p><p>“One? That’s barely any time at all.”</p><p>“I don’t have a job, Agatha. I haven’t earned any money in-…”</p><p>“I have money. <em>We</em> have money. You don’t need a job.”</p><p>“I want one.”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and turned away again to look out over the skyline, “Fine. Three months.”</p><p>“One.”</p><p>“Six weeks.”</p><p>Rio was the one to sigh this time and she dipped her head to press a kiss to Agatha’s shoulder, “Should I be worried that you’re trying to take me away for so long.”</p><p>She didn’t get a response, which was a response in itself.</p><p>The night sky before them sparkled it’s majesty into blue eyes that turned to Rio then and Rio frowned at the fear she saw in them, moving to insert herself between Agatha and the low glass barrier that separated them from oblivion.</p><p>“What aren’t you telling me?”</p><p>Agatha’s hands moved to Rio’s waist and she held her loosely, her eyes darting across concerned features before they settled finally on her lips. She spoke firmly, though her voice was barely above a whisper. “I want to go away with you and just be us for as long as we can. Before we have to come back to real life. Is that too much to ask?”</p><p>“No,” Rio shook her head, “No it isn’t.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha relented with a soft sigh, her hand trailing slowly up to brush her fingers below the cup of Rio’s dress, “I’ll find Abigail and we can get out of here.”</p><p>“You find her and I’ll find Billy.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, her gaze where her finger tips were running along Rio’s exposed ribs and her mind clearly elsewhere as she contemplated them.</p><p>“Hey, it’s just one more night. Then we’ll be away. And married. Properly married. And our biggest concern will be how pissed Alice will be that Billy and Natasha knew before her.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed a little but kept her gaze down, her fingers ghosting along the goosebumps at Rio’s side.</p><p>“And Jen,” Rio continued indulgently, watching as the muscles in Agatha’s jaw began to relax a little. “She’ll kill you too, I know that for a fact. Or maybe me. I’m a much easier target.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze raised then and some of the tension from ten seconds ago crept back into her face as her fingers curled around Rio’s sides, “Not with me around.”</p><p>Her words were soft but laced with a fierceness that was unnecessary to the moment that Rio took to mean Agatha wasn’t finding any of this easier as the night went on.</p><p>She leant in and nudged their noses together, feeling Agatha’s warm breath wash over her and kissing her softly before she murmured in a soft song, “Nothing’s gonna harm you, not while I’m around…”</p><p>Agatha responded only by kissing Rio properly, but whether to shut her up or simply because she wanted to, Rio wasn’t sure. She allowed it either way, pressing herself firmly against Agatha and moving her hands to bury in her waterfall of wavy hair.</p><p>When they pulled back she saw that Agatha looked a little less tense again, though her hold on her was vicelike and Rio wondered how she’d cope being far away whilst in the same room as Abigail.</p><p>But she gently pushed at Agatha’s hands, loosening her grip on her and squeezing them tenderly. “I’ll come and find you, okay? I’ll stay with Billy until it’s done.”</p><p>And Agatha watched Rio slip from in front of her, she felt her lips brush her cheek, and let her fingers trail over her abdomen as she stepped away and back into the warmth of the crowded room.</p><p>Turning her face then to the dark night sky, she took several deep breaths before she trusted herself to turn back, following the path Rio had just taken, and entered the swarm of people.</p><p>Every other person she passed vied for her attention but she ignored almost all of them, paying only the slightest bit of polite acknowledgement to only the handful of people she had even an ounce of respect for.</p><p>But Rio had already disappeared and despite looking for a red dress moving through a crowd she saw no hint of her and it made her nervous and more determined than ever to finish this as soon as she could.</p><p>Her fingers began to dance unconsciously at her sides and she was about to turn towards the bar when she heard her name from a voice that wasn’t entirely unwelcome.</p><p>“Agatha,” Pepper called out, grinning from a seat at one of the large tables towards the stage. She looked as if she’d either been laughing or crying and by the sight of the person next to her, Agatha guessed the former.</p><p>Jeremy Jones, larger than life, louder than Agatha liked, and bawdier than she had time for, was slapping his thigh and gesturing her over with a flourish that wouldn’t have looked out of place at a circus show.</p><p>She moved reluctantly across only because she had affection for Pepper and if anyone were to know the whereabouts of anyone at the party it would be Jeremy.</p><p>“Jeremy, pleasure as always.”</p><p>“Oh sit down, Agatha! Jerry was just telling me all about his latest scheme to get better coffee on the Hill. You should hear what he has to say about-…”</p><p>But Jeremy cut Pepper off with a grin and beamed across at Agatha, “But my dear, tell me about this <em>wife</em> of yours! I hear you’ve made some important life decisions since we last met. I can’t say I blame you, of course, sensible to lock down such a knock out. You two make <em>quite</em> the couple. People must die of jealousy when they see you together!”</p><p>Agatha only inclined her head a little at this over the top compliment but otherwise remained standing, her intention to get away as soon as possible surely quite clear.</p><p>“I’m a lucky woman. But as much as I’d love to talk about my wife all night I’m actually looking for Abigail Presley. Have you seen her?”</p><p>Jeremy pouted dramatically at this and looked not unlike an over inflated bullfrog as he threw his hand towards Agatha, “No fun! No fun at all!”</p><p>Pepper just laughed and rolled her eyes as she gestured vaguely in the opposite direction, “She was charming the pants off of some Hollywood types by the bar. But don’t be gone for long! The auction will start soon and this is all your hard work, you shouldn’t miss it.”</p><p>Agatha only smiled tightly in adieu as she turned on her heel and marched off towards the bar. If the auction was due to start soon, and she glanced down at her watch and saw it was close to 8:30pm, she wouldn’t have long to get Abigail alone.</p><p>Thankfully, it didn’t take long to spot her at the opposite end of the bar to where she’d first seen her earlier, and even less long to hear her tittering, girlish giggle that set Agatha’s teeth on edge.</p><p>But it needed to be done. She needed to be calm for as long as she was in Abigail’s presence and then she could take Rio away and she’d never have to lay eyes on this woman ever again.</p><p>“Presley,” she said with every air and grace her mother had burned into her since birth intact as she swept across and forced a placid smile to her face.</p><p>“Harkness!” Abigail gasped in surprise, “And here I was thinking you’d be hidden away all evening with your little purchase. How is darling Rio, by the way? Still as insatiable as ever?”</p><p>This, Agatha knew, was not a good start. She could feel the familiar prickly heat of fury begin to boil in her veins but she had no outlet, no way to get it out, subtly or otherwise.</p><p>The small group of onlookers about them snickered and watched Agatha in some strange mixture of amusement and fear, though she was sure they didn’t really know what Abigail was referring to.</p><p>“She’s getting some air,” Agatha managed to say, returning to Evanora’s daughter, the one who always toed the line and minded her manners. “Could we go somewhere private to talk?”</p><p>“Of course!” Abigail’s eyes widened at the prospect and she practically bounced up straight from where she’d been leaning against the bar, “Did you have something in mind you wanted to discuss? I have plenty of things, you know, plenty of suggestions for you…”</p><p>Agatha had already begun to lead them away, her hands tight at her sides but her face as neutral as she could make it, though Abigail’s tittering, cloying voice was already making her homicidal.</p><p>…You know it’s been very rude of you to not take my calls all this time. <em>Especially</em> when you’ve stolen my girlfriend and made her your ‘wife’.”</p><p>Agatha held open the door to the little holding room she’d been in not long ago with Rio and shook off the memory of the feel of her as she went to pull out two chairs and sat down in one.</p><p>“Yes, well, I’m a busy woman.”</p><p>“Clearly not too busy for some fun.”</p><p>“Rio…” she stopped and found herself unable to finish the lie that was about to fall from her lips but Abigail was looking at her expectantly, draped across her chair like someone was about to draw her portrait.</p><p>“She has her uses,” she finished quietly, digging her nails into the soft skin above her watch strap so as to focus on something other than the bile that had made its way up her oesophagus.</p><p>“Yes, I’m well aware of them. But tell me,” Abigail leant forward and raised her brows conspiratorially, “She cancelled our dates months ago. I’ve been unable to contact her ever since. How did you do it?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and wanted to say: <em>”because she fell in love with me, you spineless sack of shit”</em>, but, instead she said: “I made her an offer she couldn’t refuse.”</p><p>She’d been right the first time, it <em>did</em> sound like a line from a porno version of <em>The Godfather</em>.</p><p>Abigail laughed and it gnawed at Agatha’s brain again. “You bought her out? So selfish, I mean, <em>really</em>. You couldn’t at least have <em>shared</em> her? I was only seeing her once every quarter, barely enough time to inconvenience you.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged a little, her fingers drumming a pattern on the arms of her chair, “I’m a busy woman. It’s useful to have someone always there when I have time.”</p><p>Abigail nodded slowly and sighed, “Well I suppose I respect it. She’s quite insatiable. Rarely keeps her hands to herself. I tell you, the amount of times I had to ask her to stop because we’d already done it twice that day. I hope you have the stamina.”</p><p>Agatha felt like she might faint. She felt like she might just black out from the blind fury that surged through her, calcifying her blood and causing her whole body to shut down.</p><p>She’d never felt anything like it. Not even with Wanda. Not even when Wanda had threatened Rio. Because she could handle that. She <em>was</em> handling that.</p><p>But this obtuse cunt was lying, no <em>bragging</em>, about her wife wanting to fuck her so badly she had to tell her to stop when in reality, Agatha knew exactly how Abigail wanted Rio. And she also knew that Rio had hated every second of it.</p><p>But Abigail was still talking.</p><p>“Wanda tells me you barely had sex anyway. Surely you don’t need her around all the time?”</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha snapped suddenly, but regretted it immediately when Abigail flinched a little and blinked across at her, completely oblivious to the dangerous road she’d been skipping down. “Wanda is why I wanted to talk to you.”</p><p>Abigail frowned immediately, having moronically thought that she was the top dog in this situation, that Agatha wanted to talk to <em>her</em> about <em>her</em> and she shifted in her seat as she said: “Why do you want to talk to me about Wanda?”</p><p>Agatha stretched her back out then, brushing her hair over her shoulder and forcing her face to remain neutral. “She’s been working against you, Abigail. She’s not your friend any more than she is mine.”</p><p>Abigail blinked slowly, watching Agatha like she was speaking in a language she didn’t understand.</p><p>“Wanda <em>is</em> my friend. She’s my partner. We’re working on-…”</p><p>But Agatha could be patient for only so long and she interjected: “She has been working against you this whole time. I promise you she isn’t on your side.”</p><p>“No, that can’t be true. We’ve been working with-…”</p><p>But Abigail clamped her mouth shut suddenly, and Agatha didn’t need her to finish her sentence to know what she had been about to admit. <em>Fucking idiot</em>, she thought.</p><p>Agatha took the opportunity to reach into the pocket of her high-waisted pants and withdrew the napkin she’d hidden away there earlier, but not before she’d made copies of it on the off-chance that Abigail threw a fit and destroyed it before she was able to do anything with it.</p><p>She stood slowly and took the two steps towards Abigail, standing over her as she held out the napkin with a raised brow, “Here. Wanda’s writing. She’s a smart girl but she lives in ‘WandaLand’ and thinks everything should always go her way, that she should always be on top.”</p><p>Abigail hesitated before she took the napkin, having been eyeing Agatha suspiciously as she stood over her but now her eyes were wide and her mouth had fallen open as she read and reread the message.</p><p>“Who gave you this?”</p><p>“I can’t tell you that.”</p><p>Agatha made to move back again but Abigail had reached out and snatched her hand quickly, standing up too close for Agatha’s liking.</p><p>“You need to.”</p><p>Ripping her hand away sharply, Agatha turned from Abigail and went to stand at the table of excess merch, pretending to admire the pins that read ‘Iron Man’ and ‘Power For All’. Her finger lightly grazed one of red and gold as she heard Abigail move up behind her, “Work with me on this. We can take her down together.”</p><p>A surge of something like hatred pierced Agatha’s chest then, and she knew beneath it lay the insatiable desire to take Wanda down still, to be more intimately involved in her destruction, but she knew she couldn’t. She knew she had to take a step back and bide her time.</p><p>“I’m afraid I want nothing to do with Wanda. I’ve offered you this evidence as a professional courtesy, nothing more.”</p><p>She turned then and locked eyes with the frantic-looking Abigail who was so out of her depth that Agatha almost felt sorry for her. But then she remembered the things she’d made her wife do on her knees and all sympathy died with no hopes of returning.</p><p>“I have money. More than you, even. More than Wanda. I can do almost anything but you-…”</p><p>“Let me be clear,” Agatha emphasised slowly, her hand coming up to express just how serious she was about this next point, “I will have nothing to do with Wanda. But I seriously suggest you break ties with her. Cut her off at the source before she takes out your legs from under you. Take her out before she takes you.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>Agatha shot Abigail one last glance and stepped around her, already marching towards the door.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha’s left hand had reached the door handle and she looked down at the rings there as Abigail made one last attempt to get Agatha on side: “Please. I need your help. Wanda has her clutches on everything I have. I’ll give you anything.”</p><p>The words struck her, not like a thunderclap, but instead like the slow dawning of the sun. She already had everything she could ever need.</p><p>She stepped out without looking back and disappeared into the crowd before Abigail could register what had happened.</p><p>The crowds had migrated away from the space closer to the bar and Agatha had to push past and brush by the stragglers as everyone had moved to the front of the space, close to the stage. She looked around with no concern as to who she was barging into or whose toes she was stepping on in her heels, only frantically looking for a pretty girl in a pretty red dress.</p><p>At the edge of the crowd she saw her, a glass of champagne in hand, her other arm flung casually across her middle, looking up at the stage as if in a trance. To the casual observer, Rio Vidal may have looked the picture of serenity and poise, but Agatha saw the way she chewed the inside of her cheek, how she tapped her foot gently on the wooden floor. She looked fearful, and impatient.</p><p>And notably, she was alone.</p><p>Agatha picked up the pace then, her strides more confident, her gait longer as she made a beeline for Rio, ready to take her away as quickly as possible now she’d done as much as she could, and kept true to her promise that she would do no more than tell Abigail what Wanda was up to.</p><p>But a voice carried out over the crowd and all eyes turned to her and she stopped in her tracks to look to the man who’d called her name.</p><p>“Agatha ‘hardass’ Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at the name and raised a brow at this sudden, unexpected call out at the beginning of what Tony had been referring to all week as his ‘swan song’ of a speech.</p><p>“Can we all give a round of applause for Miss Harkness here? Or, actually, <em>Mrs</em> Harkness?”</p><p>As loud whoops and hollers surrounded her, Agatha could only fight off the shiver at being called by her mother’s name. She grimaced out a smile and saw a movement in the corner of her eye that told her Rio had moved over and was currently pushing past two nepo babies in matching suits to get to her.</p><p>“Harkness begged me for a long time to be on this campaign and for a while I denied her. Treat ‘em mean, am I right? But eventually she wore me down and I am so happy to have her by my side.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed and she shot Stark daggers at the blatant and offensive lie even as Rio finally made it to her and she felt her hand slip into her own and Rio’s other hand take hold of her forearm.</p><p>“Oh! And her lady wife! A beautiful addition to the Stark family, I’m sure you’ll all agree! And no, folks, not available at the auction tonight. But I’m sure if you ask nicely, she’ll give you a discounted price.”</p><p>The shot to Agatha’s stomach was instantaneous. Her blood ran cold and Stark’s wink only added to the insult as Rio began to paw at her, clutching her arm, then her shirt, then her opposite arm to pull her away.</p><p>“Agatha,” she murmured urgently, still tugging as Stark moved on to other subjects less close to home.</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio tried quietly, somehow managing to get Agatha to turn to her and shaking her head at the expression on Agatha’s face, quietly telling her it was okay, that this was it, they were done.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>Agatha followed silently, her jaw tense and stiff and her body only following Rio’s because she wasn’t capable of doing anything other than follow her.</p><p>They made it to the edge of the crowd and found Pepper there, having clearly been looking for them, a frantic and fearful look in her eye.</p><p>“He was just teasing. He didn’t mean-…”</p><p>“It’s okay Pepper, really.”</p><p>“It’s not. He only meant-…”</p><p>Agatha scoffed so harshly that the people around them looked over and Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand tightly, “It’s fine, Pepper.”</p><p>“Don’t leave. You’ve worked so hard on this speech. You should hear it.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw was so set and she was so angry that she looked like she might break something or someone and Rio spoke for her to prevent Agatha from tearing down the whole event in one fierce tantrum.</p><p>“We should, but thank you for…” Rio trailed off then, unsure what exactly she was thanking Pepper for and instead simply shot her a final smile before she turned back to Agatha who was staring at someone not five feet away.</p><p>Billy had appeared again.</p><p>He stood looking like a rabbit in the headlights, holding Agatha’s back his brow furrowed and his fingers twisting about themselves in front of his chest.</p><p>Rio gaped at him, not thinking as she dropped Agatha’s hand and surged towards him to pull him into a hug.</p><p>“Where the fuck have you been?” She whispered urgently into his ear.</p><p>Billy hesitated at first but soon returned the hug, though his eyes never left his boss who looked like she was going to murder someone soon, and that person may as well be Billy.</p><p>“I… I needed time to think.”</p><p>Rio sighed and pulled away, holding her hand out behind her for Agatha to take but found it to be empty even as she wriggled it expectantly.</p><p>Agatha had turned away from the both of them and was instead focusing over the crowd of heads at Stark now up on stage, fumbling over his words.</p><p>It was really a sight to see.</p><p>He looked, at least momentarily, panicked, overboard with no life jacket, and he began pawing through his papers with fumbling fingers as he tried desperately to fill in the growing silence that had washed over the room.</p><p>All of his clever witticisms, sharp political satire, relevant facts and statistics, had all been erased.</p><p>People around them had started to mumble as the great orator that was Tony Stark was taken down by the sheets of paper before him that simply read over and over again in boyish, messy handwriting: “We quit, Tony.”</p><p>It was Rio who clocked what had happened first, whether through a childlike pettiness that she shared with Billy or because Agatha was too busy stared wide-eyed at a still fumbling Stark.</p><p>But Billy’s eyes had flicked briefly to Rio’s and in them Rio realised what he’d done. “You little shit,” she said with such affection that Agatha turned to look at her curiously and Billy blushed faintly.</p><p>“He did it on purpose. You fucked the speech.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze was slow to move from Rio’s face, watching as she grinned before looking across at a still blushing Billy and raising her brows, “And here I was thinking you’d-…”</p><p>“When have I ever failed you?” Billy asked smugly, keeping his voice low. But just as Agatha was about to respond Rio nudged her with her elbow and Agatha deflated slightly, and seemed to take a one eighty with her tone as she said, “Not often.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and tugged gently on Billy’s arm to get him to lean in so she could kiss his cheek. “Thank you, Billy.”</p><p>Billy’s ears had gone a little pink from the praise he was so unused to but he smiled all the same and straightened his back, ruining this vision of confidence by shooting Agatha a look of puppy-dog desperation. Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled all the same, “We’re going now. I don’t need you for anything else tonight.”</p><p>“Right. Yes, probably for the best.”</p><p>Rio scoffed softly and took Agatha’s hand back again, marching quickly with her and Billy bringing up the rear just as Stark seemed to realise his previous speech was ruined and he’d have to go it alone.</p><p>As the little trio made their way to the elevator far, far away from the watchful crowd, a lone figure was leaning up against the wall with a sickening smile.</p><p>Wanda Maximoff had returned.</p><p>She’d spent her evening talking to all the right people and shaking hands with new faces, making connections where she could. But she’d always had one eye on Agatha, one eye on Rio.</p><p>And now, now she was coming to lay her claim again.</p><p>“Going so soon? Come now… the auction’s just about to start and I know Tony said we wouldn’t have any,” she looked to Rio then, “<em>special</em> lots but I’m sure we could still have some fun.”</p><p>Rio’s hold on Agatha was as ineffectual then as a lone breath against the swell of the ocean.</p><p>Agatha pulled from her and marched the short distance up to her ex-wife, stopping just short of her but refusing to touch her.</p><p>Wanda blinked in surprise, at not being slammed into the wall more than anything, but she recovered herself and a slow grin made its way across her face as Agatha spoke.</p><p>“You’ll regret ever threatening her, Maximoff. I promise you that.”</p><p>“Oh Aggie,” Wanda cooed as she raised her hands to grip Agatha’s tie and Agatha was quick and unflinching as she threw her hands off of her. “Don’t be like this. You know I just miss you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and turned then, barely able to see for how blinded by rage she was. But Rio was there, she saw her step towards her and felt her take her hand, felt her entwine their fingers and saw her raise her hand to her lips to kiss the back of it. Wanda was still close, too close, but she no longer mattered.</p><p>Only Rio.</p><p>So Agatha stepped away with her, moving towards the elevator and pulling Rio in to envelope her in her arms, making her eyes never left the large brown ones that continued to ground her, transforming hatred and fury into something softer, but no less powerful.</p><p>Billy had run ahead even as Agatha faced off to Wanda and so the elevator was there in no time and Rio pulled back to drag Agatha with her, and though Rio shot Wanda one last look, Agatha kept her eyes on her wife, leaving her ex almost shaking with fury, as she stepped after them but stopped at the metal doors that were soon to close.</p><p>“You can’t escape this, Agatha. You’ve made a promise and I intend for you to keep it.”</p><p>Agatha turned then and locked eyes with Wanda just as the doors began to close on them, “Goodbye, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes flashed in fury but short of sticking her hand in between the two closing doors she couldn’t do anything but let the elevator close on the small group. And so she watched as Agatha turned back again and saw the woman she’d had her claws in for so long kiss the woman who’d helped remove them.</p><p>Rio broke the kiss only when she became aware of Billy awkwardly in the corner of the small space and she grinned against Agatha’s lips, scratching lightly where she’d buried her fingers in her hair.</p><p>“It’s over.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and simply kissed Rio again, nipping gently at her lower lip and squeezing over her ribs.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said gently, letting her hands slip down to splay her finger tips over Agatha’s jaw, “It’s just us now. Just us.”</p><p>Billy cleared his throat and said quietly, “I am here too. Please don’t do anything.”</p><p>Rio snorted as Agatha shot him a look of greatest displeasure and marched out the elevator with Rio trailing behind her, their fingers interwoven again.</p><p>They stopped to let Rio collect her jacket at the coatcheck and then stepped into the cold February air. Rio’s blazer was nothing compared to Agatha’s arm as it settled comfortably around her waist and she calmly made a call to Jimmy, who wouldn’t be far.</p><p>Billy was watching Agatha closely and Rio wasn’t far off his level of attention on Agatha. She watched her as she spoke to Jimmy on the phone, watched her as she hung up, watched her as she turned briefly to check no one was following them from the gala, and finally, she turned to look at Rio again.</p><p>And in her gaze Rio felt calm, because Agatha had done what she said she would, and by tomorrow morning, they’d be far, far away.</p><p>Both women managed to restrain themselves from doing anything else that would make Billy uncomfortable in the time it took Jimmy to arrive but when bundled into the car, Agatha took it upon herself to pull Rio into her lap.</p><p>Rio felt more relaxed than she had in weeks, though her body was still tense, the after effects of such a difficult evening and the fear she’d been feeling all day.</p><p>But Agatha now had her arms around her properly and was gazing up at her like she’d put the stars in the sky, and Rio felt more at home than she had since those early days of moving in together.</p><p>If Agatha had played it right, and she trusted that she had, then Wanda wouldn’t be a thorn in their side any longer.</p><p>Hidden by Rio’s blazer as she sat sideways on  Agatha’s lap, Agatha finally had free roam to make the most of her wife’s choice of dress, and she slipped her hand into the deep slit at her thigh and held her there so firmly Rio thought she’d never let go.</p><p>Billy was doing his best to keep his eyes forward, fearful he’d see something that might scar him, and still scared for his job.</p><p>“Where were you all night?” Rio asked cautiously, careful not to stoke the flames of what was sure to be still a simmering fire between Billy and Agatha.</p><p>“I had to take some time to think.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha asked sharply, watching Billy with a narrowed gaze, “Think about what?”</p><p>“Whether… whether this job was worth it.”</p><p><em>Shit</em>, Rio thought suddenly, feeling Agatha beneath her tense slightly and wondering how large this reaction might be.</p><p>But Billy had continued: “And then… then I called Alice and spoke to her about…”</p><p>“You called Alice?”</p><p>“She listens to me. And usually Rio does too but I couldn’t speak to her because she’s so blinded by-…”</p><p>“Careful, pet,” Agatha warned.</p><p>“Alice just listens and she convinced me you wouldn’t be purposefully keeping me in the dark unless it was necessary.”</p><p>Rio frowned and began chewing on her lip as she looked down at Agatha, seeing a similar concern across her features. If Billy had called Alice and told her that Agatha and Rio had held a private meeting with Natasha, surely Alice would know something was going on.</p><p>And Alice wasn’t one to let things go. Not if she thought either Agatha or Rio were in trouble.</p><p>But Billy was talking again and Rio didn’t have time to worry as she looked back to him.</p><p>“Anyway, after speaking to her I wanted to help. You said we’d be quitting anyway and… well fuck Stark.”</p><p>Billy looked around then, hopeful he’d still done the right thing and Rio smiled tenderly, slipping from Agatha (with a little bit of difficulty, given Agatha’s desire to keep her where she was) and sat beside him on the bench, patting his knee. “You did good, kid.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything but shook her hair back and stole Rio’s hand back into her own lap, looking pissed.</p><p>“Don’t be expecting a raise.”</p><p>The rest of the car journey went smoothly after that and the three fell into a relaxed silence until they bundled back into Agatha’s warm apartment.</p><p>Billy had only been invited back up because he had left his bag there and Rio had insisted he come into the warm for a bit.</p><p>But the silence had given Rio time to relax more into the belief that everything would be better from here on out.</p><p>It let her think about everything that had happened since she’d received the email from Agatha late one night, asking her to meet her on a plane bound for a friend’s wedding.</p><p>It seemed ludicrous that she’d even turned up, let alone fallen in love with ‘2A’. The fact that Agatha’s hand sat so comfortably in her own now, that when she turned to look at her, bright blue eyes were always already on her, that she felt most herself and happy when Agatha were nearby, or in her arms, was so absurd that she sometimes feared she’d wake up from her dream one day.</p><p>But the world was theirs now.</p><p>Surely Wanda had had her fill of tormenting Agatha. And it would be on Abigail’s shoulders to decide how best to take Wanda down.</p><p>And the only thing Rio would have to worry about would be how Natasha and Alice would be when forced together at the wedding. Whether she’d wear a dress or a suit. Whether she’d fight against the tears. Whether she’d be able to cope with any time away from Agatha now she had her all to herself.</p><p>“I have nothing for you tonight, Billy. You can go.”</p><p>Rio tugged at Agatha’s arm and shot her a look that was ignored as Agatha tugged back and tried to pull her towards the bedroom.</p><p>Rio only rolled her eyes and smiled at Billy as she was pulled away from him.</p><p>“I promise you we will be five minutes. Just wait inside.”</p><p>Billy grimaced as he stepped into the living room and shut the door.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, was grinning like a Cheshire Cat, or the cat that got the cream, whichever cat was happiest.</p><p>She allowed Agatha to pull her into the bedroom and fell with her onto the bed, allowing the older brunette to fumble indelicately as she tried to pull up her dress from where she now lay on top of Rio.</p><p>Rio squirmed and laughed and soon began pushing Agatha’s groping hands away from her, “No! No! Patience!”</p><p>Agatha only harrumphed and pressed urgent kisses to Rio’s throat as she continued to wrestle the dress up her thighs and bunch it around her hips.</p><p>“This is expensive!” Rio shouted with a laugh, still being anything but still under Agatha. But it was no use. Agatha was determined, and she only pulled back when she was sure the dress was all bunched around Rio’s hips and she moved back to her knees to look down at the red lace underwear she just knew would be there.</p><p>“Ah!” Rio snatched Agatha’s wrist before she could touch her exactly where she wanted her and she raised her brows, “Whatever happened to the art of seduction?”</p><p>“You have been parading around in that dress all evening. Do you expect me to-…?”</p><p>But Rio had dropped Agatha’s hand in favour of her tie and pulled her down as she sat up and traced her tongue across Agatha’s upper lip. She’d moved so quickly that Agatha had barely time to register until it was too late. Her eyes darkened and she reached down to cup Rio over her underwear, smirking a little at the feel of the damp fabric, even as her breathing picked up and she glanced down at Rio’s parted lips.</p><p>“I believe I told you I wanted to get you pregnant in this dress earlier.”</p><p>Rio hummed and arched a brow as she captured Agatha’s lips properly this time before murmuring, “How about I let you try if you give me just five minutes whilst you go chat to Billy.”</p><p>“Please don’t say his name whilst I’m touching-…”</p><p>Rio smiled sweetly and released her hold on Agatha’s tie to push her hand away, “Be patient and you will be rewarded.”</p><p>“What could possibly be more rewarding than-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio insisted, raising her brows, “Patience. I want to thank you.”</p><p>“I don’t need thanked, I just need-…”</p><p>“You need to get off of me right now and go speak to Billy.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her gaze then but pulled away and went to sit down on the edge of the bed.</p><p>Rio, assuming victory, slid from the bed but made it only so far as her feet hitting the floor before she was pulled into Agatha’s lap with a heavy “oomph”.</p><p>She laughed and Agatha grinned evilly up at her, her hands finding Rio’s thighs to squeeze and her mouth once again latching to the soft skin of Rio’s throat.</p><p>“Why won’t you do as you’re told?”</p><p>“That’s your job, baby.”</p><p>Rio huffed but then gasped as Agatha nipped at her skin unexpectedly and she pulled back as quickly as she could, holding her hands infront of her to stop Agatha getting closer.</p><p>“Hey! Enough. Patience.”</p><p>Rio slid from Agatha’s lap, pushing away her grasping hands in order to do so.</p><p>“I want to thank you.”</p><p>“Honey, come back here right now.”</p><p>If Rio hadn’t been thinking about this for at least half the night, she might have given in. Agatha looked strict and Rio knew that saying ‘no’ wasn’t really an option. So she bit down on her lip and took a cautious few steps back until she was pressed against the door frame of the en suite.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha insisted, holding her hand out now from where she sat on the edge of the bed, her gaze darkening with every inch of distance that grew between them.</p><p>“I won’t be long,” Rio insisted right back with a small smirk threatening to belie her innocence in this situation. But Agatha caught it and she stood to march across, making it to Rio just as Rio’s hand fell to the door handle and Agatha’s landed over it.</p><p>“I have waited all night,” Agatha breathed close to Rio’s ear as her free hand went to ghost over the exposed skin at her side. “I’m not waiting any longer.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha dipped her head to kiss at her neck and her other hand moved down to the slit at her thigh and pushed beneath it until she could grip her bare hip and she pressed in closer.</p><p>But Rio had just a small semblance of self-control left and even as she felt herself submitting to Agatha’s touch she managed to whisper, “No. No. I promise it’ll be worth it and you need to go speak to Billy.”</p><p>She pushed at Agatha’s shoulder and gasped when Agatha moved for her and looked at her with blown pupils.</p><p>“I promise,” she said again, that same smirk coming back to her face. Because if Agatha was driven wild already then she was desperate to see her reaction when she was actually <em>trying</em>.</p><p>“Just-,” but Agatha had taken her wrist and pinned it above her head.</p><p>“Trust me-,” Rio gasped as Agatha pressed her  toned thigh up between Rio’s legs.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly as Agatha moved her other arm up and held her wrists in one hand as her other brushed back down to grope her breast.</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha mumbled against her neck, nipping sharply in warning as Rio rocked her hips to seek more friction.</p><p>“Two minutes,” Rio bargained, “then you’ll have me all night. Exactly how you want me. However you want me.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and Rio felt the vibration of it at the base of her throat but she didn’t think she’d give in until, suddenly, she did. The hold on her wrists went slack and she pulled away entirely, her hands running through her hair as she marched back to the bed.</p><p>“Billy doesn’t deserve this. <em>I</em> should be getting what <em>I</em> want right now,” Agatha snapped in frustration even as Rio slipped away and into the bathroom and Agatha left the room.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the laugh that escaped her lips, and though her cheeks were flushed and her heart pounding, she felt gleeful as she locked the door behind her because she didn’t trust Agatha to not just barge in.</p><p>She moved about the place quickly: she removed her dress, letting it drop to the floor despite the amount she’d paid for it and her protestations to that fact earlier; she stepped from her underwear and applied a little perfume to her naked body; she found the new lingerie she’d stored away in the little toilet bag she kept in the cabinet for emergencies such as this one - emergencies that involved more time than she usually had with Agatha; she fit it about herself; and finally, she reviewed the look in the full length bathroom mirror and made slight adjustments to make sure it was just right.</p><p>The set was a deep green and black and Rio had bought it weeks ago on a whim whilst trying to kill time when Agatha was busy. But she had never had the opportunity to wear it for Agatha because every night they’d spent together had been hurried, with no time for seduction or romance.</p><p>She adjusted the thin garters about her upper thighs and positioned the cups of the bra so they framed her breasts just so and the peekaboo lace fell exactingly to leave almost nothing to the imagination.</p><p>Rio knew, perhaps vainly, that Agatha wanted to jump her even when she was completely covered up, when she wore baggy sweaters and ill-fitting sweatpants so she also knew that this outfit would drive her to the edges of sanity. It was a reward as well as a celebration because now Agatha was free of her one-woman mission against Wanda, Rio could indulge herself in her own one-woman mission to find new and exciting ways to seduce her wife.</p><p>She tousled her hair once more and left the bathroom with a spring in her step, choosing to position herself on the edge of the bed with her legs demurely crossed over the other, leaning back on her elbows.</p><p>She didn’t have to wait long.</p><p>Agatha had practically marched Billy from the apartment, only reluctantly standing in the hall to talk to him about her plans for the next few weeks for less than five minutes.</p><p>She’d confirmed she’d be away with Rio, but not where. She’d told him she would be contactable, but only in emergencies. She’d given him permission to use her credit card to take himself away, wherever he wanted, but as soon as possible. She’d made him promise again not to tell Alice or Jen anything else, and to keep Lilia in the dark too. And lastly, she’d promised she’d let him know if they were actually to get married, and that he wouldn’t be excluded.</p><p>Rio was oblivious to all this, and was simply waiting for her Agatha to return to her, her heart thumping heavily in her chest as the door opened and she finally appeared.</p><p>“Mi amor, ¿por qué tardaste tanto?” <em>My love, what took you so long?</em></p><p>Rio smiled innocently as she watched Agatha react to the sight before her, her dark eyes hungrily taking in every inch of the tanned toned body before her, her fingers twitching at her sides to get to her. Her eyes skimmed hungrily up Rio’s long legs and hovered briefly at the sight of a garter belt that wrapped securely around her thighs. The green lace of her underwear might as well not have been there and the build of her bra made Agatha practically drool.</p><p>Rio let her look only for a few seconds before she slowly uncrossed her legs and opened them to Agatha, raising her brows as she pushed her chest out, “Do you like what you see?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth was hanging open a little and she moved forwards without really thinking, throwing herself to her knees between Rio’s thighs. And Rio, Rio smirked at the sight, allowing Agatha to run her hands along her thighs, letting them travel along her slim hips and ghost over her lace covered breasts.</p><p>“I think that’s a yes,” Rio whispered smugly as she stretched her legs open a little more and pushed up from her reclined position to reach for Agatha’s tie.</p><p>She held it as she leant in towards Agatha who didn’t need an invitation to move up towards her lips just as Rio husked, “Tonight is for you.“</p><p>“No,” Agatha stuttered out, her mouth dry as her hands skimmed back down to Rio’s hips and she pulled her closer on the edge bed, “Tonight is about <em>you</em>.”</p><p>She pushed Rio back down then and Rio released her hold on her tie, gasping as she lay flat on the bed.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hands push at her thighs, spreading her open so much that Rio began to wish she’d stretched before this but her body allowed it and Agatha leant in to kiss her inner left thigh, as her legs stretched almost in the split position.</p><p>Rio gasped as Agatha sank her teeth into the soft flesh there and she whined as Agatha’s tongue traced a road up to her pussy where she licked a thick strip over her thin underwear.</p><p>Agatha breathed out heavily and placed her open mouth against Rio’s core, letting her tongue brush teasingly light licks there as her nose pressed above her clit.</p><p>Rio had to lift up to see what Agatha looked like in this position, her hips desperate to move against her but Agatha was holding her legs in place so she could barely rock up. It felt like torture, having Agatha so close, but not exactly where she needed her, but Agatha clearly wasn’t in a mood to tease for long because with her left hand she pulled aside the thin strip of underwear and buried her face back against her.</p><p>Agatha ate her out like her life depended on it and Rio, her plans to tease and seduce, disappeared from her mind as her first orgasm rocked through her with such an intensity that she forgot her own name.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t stop, she didn’t bring Rio down slowly either. She was like a rabid dog, keen on Rio remaining in a heightened state of ecstasy for as long as she could.</p><p>Her tongue roughly bullied Rio’s swollen clit and without warning she pressed two fingers into her wife, curling them just enough to make Rio scream as she sucked harshly on the tiny bundle of nerves.</p><p>“Agatha, Agatha, baby,” Rio began to beg uselessly, forcing herself to sit up to gaze down at Agatha still on her knees for her.</p><p>She whined as she reached for Agatha’s hair and tried to get her to pull up but Agatha ignored her as she continued to roughly pump her fingers in and out of Rio, stretching her to the point of whining again as she scissored her fingers inside of her.</p><p>“Fuck fuck fuck.”</p><p>Agatha only pulled up again when Rio had flopped onto her back again and she took her time with it as she trailed her hot wet lips over Rio’s stomach, up to her breasts where she latched on to the dark nipple straining against the thin lace. Rio whined once more and was rewarded with a third finger pressed slowly into her but Agatha stilled her fingers inside her, now hovering over her body, her tongue teasing through her bra.</p><p>“Please,” Rio whined breathlessly, bucking her hips in desperation as Agatha kept still, her fingers twitching a little inside of her.</p><p>“Agatha, don’t tease…”</p><p>“We have time, baby. Don’t worry.”</p><p>Rio huffed and released an indignant laugh as she bucked her hips more forcefully this time and looked down to see Agatha now grinning up at her, her chin just above her breast, “You’re enjoying this too much.”</p><p>“Isn’t that the point?”</p><p>“No. No the point was for me to seduce you. Not for you to torture me and to still be in your clothes.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and brushed her thumb teasing over Rio’s clit which made her gasp and buck again, but she slowly pulled away, standing from the bed and smirking down at the mess she’d made of her desperate wife.</p><p>Rio scowled up at Agatha and closed her legs again as if to make a point, but really it was to chase away the emptiness now Agatha had pulled out.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t much interested in Rio’s scowling face as her eyes darted over her body once more and she went to remove the gold cap from her tie, throwing it across the room just as Rio sat up quickly and reached for Agatha’s hips, “Wait.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow and raised Rio’s chin with her index finger, “I think we’ve established I don’t want to wait anymore.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at this and moved her hands up to Agatha’s tie, twisting the leather in her hand to pull Agatha down until their lips were so close Rio could feel Agatha’s breath flutter against her lips, “Then let’s make up for lost time.”</p>

<p>“Honey.”</p><p>Rio was jolted awake, not by the voice of the naked woman she was sprawled on top of, nor the movement of this woman as she leant across to reach for her phone, but by the gnawing, cawing, alarm that was sounding somewhere in her vicinity.</p><p>It was offensively loud, objectionable on every level, and even when Agatha’s fingers just managed to reach it and turn it off, Rio still felt the high-pitched reverberations of it ringing in her ears.</p><p>She couldn’t quite comprehend how her good, kind, loving partner would subject her to such a thing.</p><p>Especially when she promised her sleep. Especially when she’d done everything in her power to ensure that Rio would need the sleep.</p><p>With a dramatic groan she let her feelings known and stretched her neck up in search of Agatha, finding the base of her throat and huffing out a heavy, warm breath against it.</p><p>“Why are you doing this to me?”</p><p>Agatha only laughed and began to shuffle out from under Rio, and Rio took the opportunity to turn away from Agatha, knowing that an early alarm meant only one thing, and so she curled into herself beneath the thick duvet.</p><p>“We have a flight to catch.”</p><p>There it was.</p><p>“No. Not after last night, you maniac.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and moved back over the bed, straddling Rio’s curled form that remained tucked beneath the blankets.</p><p>“And this morning… technically,” Agatha added with a smirk that Rio couldn’t see.</p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>“Seven.”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha pounced then from her squatting position over Rio and lay fully on top of her, bearing down close to her face, and nudging at her cheek with her nose, “You can sleep on the plane. And when we get to the villa.”</p><p>Rio scowled and huffed again as she turned her head to look at Agatha, her eyes still thick with sleep, “You kept me awake until <em>five</em>. I’m aching all over. I’m tired. Change the flight.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and remained still for a second before she began to scramble, tugging the duvet down and attempting to rip it from Rio’s desperate clutches.</p><p>“No! No! I said change it! Change the flight!”</p><p>But Rio was tired and aching and so Agatha won the battle and although Rio didn’t vocalise it she was pretty sure Agatha wouldn’t have won if all things were equal.</p><p>But now she was duvet-less and exposed on the bed, and Agatha took full advantage of that fact, crawling back over Rio’s prone body to kiss along the blossoming bruises that lay a trail from her thighs up to her neck.</p><p>“I can’t move. This is insanity. Book another flight.”</p><p>“No, the sooner we get there the sooner you can relax,” Agatha mumbled, briefly stopping to kiss the swell of Rio’s left breast a little more tenderly, given the attention she’d clearly given it not hours ago. She then continued her way up and Rio huffed as her face was turned away so Agatha could access more of her neck, not satisfied until she could retrace <em>all</em> of her steps.</p><p>“Why did you insist on keeping me up?”</p><p>“You weren’t complaining.”</p><p>“Actually, I did. I seem to remember around two I suggested we stop for the night.”</p><p>“You had a Power Nap,” Agatha offered, now hovering just above Rio to smile down at her.</p><p>“You let me sleep for twenty minutes and then you woke me up with your-…”</p><p>“I can do it again, if you’d like,” Agatha grinned and Rio scoffed and laughed a little until she felt Agatha shift above her and her hand slip between her thighs.</p><p>“No! God,” she reached down and caught Agatha’s forearm, “No. I can’t take any more.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her hand away without a struggle and smiled, and Rio didn’t miss the smugness in it as she gazed down at her.</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes and then closed them again, taking every bit of rest she could get. “Just, please. Let me sleep. We can get another flight.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move for a while above her and Rio didn’t open her eyes again to see what she was doing but soon enough she felt soft lips against her cheek and whispered words: “I’ll pack for you. I’ll wake you up with enough time for a quick shower and then we’re leaving, okay?”</p><p>Rio breathed out heavily through her nose but didn’t say anything and when Agatha slowly clambered off of her, a little achey and tired herself, she curled back up and slipped into a deep sleep.</p><p>It was only half an hour later that Agatha woke Rio again. This time with her hands and a gentle whisper rather than the violent ring of an offensive alarm.</p><p>Rio groaned loudly and rubbed at her eyes, feeling the keen weight of her aching body as she did. But Agatha was less smug this time, more intent on helping, and she quietly sat to the side to help Rio up, offering her help without insisting.</p><p>“I can’t believe this is happening again,” Rio grumbled as she got unsteadily to her feet and made her way to the en suite, stretching and groaning with each movement.</p><p>The tension that had built up even during the small amount of sleep she’d been able to steal had made her body stiff and sore but the flashes of what had led to her poor excuse for an athlete’s body behaving this way made up for it. Almost.</p><p>The woman now sitting cross-legged on the bed, tapping away at her phone, had been intent on keeping her awake all night, having her in every way she could, from every possible angle, and using everything she had to keep her moaning her name.</p><p>Rio had been an enthusiastic and an equally as determined participant until the early hours of the morning when her body had begun to squirm beneath Agatha’s attentions, as oversensitive and ravaged as she was. She’d made Agatha go slower, be more gentle, but it hadn’t made Agatha less determined.</p><p>Eventually - Agatha equally as exhausted, but still rapacious in her hunger for Rio - they’d taken breaks to recover between each hard-won orgasm, collapsing together and laughing at the absurdity of it all, of their mutual obsession with mapping each other’s bodies, of memorising each and every curve and line, and every noise they could encourage.</p><p>But that was then, and this was now.</p><p>Then, Rio had the salvation of Agatha’s naked, wanting body to keep her occupied, keep her from focusing too much on her own tenderness, the dull ache of her muscles. And now, now she was feeling the full impact of Agatha’s attentions, and coupled with the lack of sleep, she felt like the walking dead.</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha called out as Rio made it into the bathroom and leant to turn the water on. “I haven’t showered either.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond but rolled her eyes as she stepped into the warm water, praying the pressure of it over her back would ease some of her muscle tension. But she wasn’t alone for long and Agatha stepped in behind her, pressing soft kisses to her shoulder, and turning her around with much gentler hands than she’d had on her a few hours ago.</p><p>“The sun will help.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? Which sun? Where are we going?”</p><p>“Barbados. I’ve rented a villa in the hills. Totally secluded, totally private. For as long as we want it.”</p><p>“I thought we agreed six weeks?”</p><p>“Well I have it for six months.”</p><p>“Right. Not that we’ll need it for that long…”</p><p>Agatha just shrugged and turned away to grab the shampoo. Rio rolled her eyes at this but was too tired and too sore to think of more than getting showered and dressed quickly so she could soon be asleep again.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, sleep still eluded her.</p><p>She managed a quick nap in the back of the car against Agatha’s shoulder as Jimmy sped them to LaGuardia in record time - much to Rio’s annoyance when Agatha woke her and told her they had arrived.</p><p>They were ushered through by a member of the airport staff to the private terminal and Rio became acutely aware somewhere between lifting Agatha’s bag for her from the security belt and arriving at the gate that she wasn’t the only one suffering.</p><p>Agatha, who up until now, had put on a brave face about the lack of sleep and the intense workout she’d put herself through the night before, was beginning to flag too. Rio caught her rolling her shoulders back a few times, her brow more furrowed, and her comments about the state of fellow holidaymakers wearing crocs with socks much more lacklustre than usual.</p><p>By the time they made it onto the tarmac and were climbing up the short flight of stairs to the private jet Agatha had hired for the occasion, Rio felt ready to collapse.</p><p>They were greeted by a smiling air steward who offered them both a glass of champagne that both took, one with a thank you and a smile, the other with barely an acknowledgement.</p><p>Inside the plane the cabin was spacious and more luxurious than Rio was expecting. Agatha seemed to have been familiar with the space and went to sit in the edge of a makeshift bed that had been made up for them and she placed her glass on the side as she leant to remove her boots.</p><p>“You can leave us. Sit up front until we land. We won’t need anything from you and anything we do need we can get ourselves.”</p><p>When the plane door was closed and sealed behind them, the steward hurried off to the front of the plane, closing the little door to the galley quietly and as quickly as he could manage.</p><p>Rio, in this time, had gone to sit down on one of the plush recliners, fishing around in its depths for her seatbelt as Agatha stared at her incredulously from where she had already sprawled out on the bed.</p><p>“Are you kidding?”</p><p>“Safety first. Come on.”</p><p>Agatha huffed loudly and went across to take the seat beside Rio, looking like she’d rather be anywhere else but strapped into a seat, which in Rio’s mind was ludicrous considering she’d forced her to get out of bed this morning for exactly this.</p><p>As a reward for following correct safety procedures, Rio extended her arm out to offer her hand and smiled in amusement, feeling her tired body sink further into the comfortable hold of the chair.</p><p>Sleep apparently couldn’t wait because soon enough Rio was being jolted gently from her doze by Agatha’s gentle fingers against her stomach, undoing the metal clasp of her seatbelt.</p><p>She huffed but smiled a little at the arms that reached to encircle her back and heave her into a standing position.</p><p>“That desperate to get me back to bed, huh?”</p><p>“Trying to make sure you don’t hurt yourself all squashed in the chair.”</p><p>“Oh now you’re worried about my poor, poor body being sore.”</p><p>“Shut up or I’ll not let you sleep for the rest of the flight. Waste of money hiring a private jet for you to just sleep on it.”</p><p>“Like you have the energy to do anything but, anyway.”</p><p>Agatha chose to ignore this but if her tired eyes were anything to go by, Rio knew she was just as exhausted as she was.</p><p>She laughed drily as she fell onto her ass on the bed and flopped back as she began to wrestle with the zipper on her jeans. Agatha helped and when free of her denim prison she crawled to the top of the bed and hurriedly sunk beneath the duvet. Agatha wasn’t far behind and pressed against Rio from behind, nuzzling into the back of her neck with a satisfied sigh.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio mumbled through a yawn as she grabbed Agatha’s hand and pulled her arm tighter around her.</p><p>But so quick was she to drift off that she barely heard Agatha’s response.</p><p>The steward had clearly relayed to the pilot that Ms. Harkness would not appreciate being disturbed ahead of their descent. So in lieu of anyone having to broach the subject of ‘landing soon’ to the unfriendly passenger, they simply flashed the lights to signal they’d be touching down soon enough.</p><p>Rio woke groggily because of this, stretching as best she could where Agatha remained curled around her and rubbing quickly at her eyes.</p><p>She shuffled and turned as carefully as she could to look upon the sleeping form of the woman who had made it her mission to wreck her the previous night.</p><p>Agatha like this looked peaceful, so free of any worries she kept held tight about her person during the day. And Rio took the time to trace over each feature with her tired eyes, having memorised each inch of Agatha’s face a long time ago now.</p><p>She raised her index finger to trace lightly down the length of Agatha’s nose and leant in when she hit its tip to kiss at her lips, choosing to wake her as gently as possible so as not to disturb whatever dreams she may be having. Because Rio had been kept awake last night and she was physically, gloriously exhausted in a way she had never been before, but Agatha had barely slept in weeks, her exhaustion was due to more than just a night of intense sex. So Rio knew she had to do everything in her power to let Agatha relax whilst she had her all to herself. No Abigail. No Wanda.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched slightly at the feel of Rio’s against them and she made a soft noise of protest at being woken up, one that made Rio feel a little smug. A taste of her own medicine.</p><p>“Hey, we’re about to land.”</p><p>Agatha groaned louder then and rolled on top of Rio suddenly, burying her face in her neck.</p><p>“We’ll be fine in bed.”</p><p>“No,” Rio laughed and rolled Agatha back over onto her back, “No. This is <em>your</em> doing.”</p><p>She began wriggling with the duvet and moved to straddle Agatha’s hips, letting her fingers push her shirt up so she could get a view of her stomach that looked more magnificent than usual with a smattering of small bruises amongst the freckles.</p><p>“Get up.”</p><p>“How can I when you’re on top of me?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and was about to move when Agatha lunged at her and caught her hips as she sat up, “Six months of <em>this</em>. Maybe I’ll just buy the place and-…”</p><p>“Ah,” Rio called as Agatha pulled her hips closer to her own, “We’ve discussed this…”</p><p>Agatha smiled and dipped her head to kiss just above Rio’s breast, “I’ll change your mind.”</p><p>“Yeah yeah,” Rio laughed as she slowly peeled herself away and shimmied into her jeans before she took a seat like the diligent little rule-follower she was.</p><p>Agatha was a little slow on the uptake but mirrored Rio’s movements and closed the clasp of her own seatbelt just as the pressure in the cabin began to change and their descent happened slowly, and then all at once.</p><p>The heat hit them both like a tidal wave as they stepped off the plane.</p><p>It was a balmy, humid heat that made Rio regret wearing jeans.</p><p>As them disembarked, the second officer appeared and informed them that Barbados was currently experiencing a heat wave and even the locals were suffering for it, it being so early in the year.</p><p>Agatha thanked him and made sure to tip him, making an extra show of tipping the steward an inordinate amount given the look Rio had shot her when she’d dismissed the man so brutally when they’d first arrived.</p><p>They moved through arrivals quickly and efficiently, and found the name ‘HARKNESS’ waiting for them on an iPad when they arrived at the exit.</p><p>A handsome, smiling driver greeted them and took their bags with the help of a lackey who ran alongside him looking so eager that Agatha wanted to slap his face and Rio was reminded of Billy. She made a mental note to check on him when they arrived at the villa.</p><p>They were ushered into a waiting Mercedes Sprinter and Rio could have cried for the feel of the air conditioning on her body.</p><p>“This villa better have AC.”</p><p>“And a pool,” Agatha reassured as she touched the back of her neck and stretched out slightly. “All the mod cons, don’t worry. I got someone to stock it with all the essentials, too.”</p><p>“Beer and condoms?”</p><p>“It’s too hot to make jokes.”</p><p>Rio only smiled in response and turned her attention to the landscape as they flew from the airport and towards their villa.</p><p>The quiet drive gave Rio a chance to check in on all the things left unsaid from yesterday. Agatha had made sure that Rio’s mouth was too busy to ask many questions the night before, but from what she’d been able to get out of Agatha between broken moans and whispered promises, Agatha was sure Wanda wouldn’t be bothering them again.</p><p>And Rio was determined to believe it. To focus on actually spending time with Agatha for the first time in weeks without the constant back and forth on Stark or her ex-wife.</p><p>As they began up a steep, winding hill, she realised that this would be the first time they’d have unlimited time together, unlimited access to the other, and no interruptions from uninvited parties.</p><p>The prospect of it felt so alien to Rio that she had to keep reminding herself that it <em>was</em> real life, that it <em>was</em> happening.</p><p>It was just them. Coven two.</p><p>But there wasn’t much time to luxuriate at the thought of having Agatha, finally, blissfully, all to herself as their home for the next few weeks came into view.</p><p>The white villa was large, with clean cut lines and floor to ceiling windows. Nestled in the foothills of the parish of Saint James, the villa loomed large and impressive against the backdrop of verdure that surrounded it.</p><p>Agatha had done well. Exceedingly well.</p><p>After stepping out of the car, she felt a hand on her lower back guiding her towards the entrance and all of her questions were answered without her even having to utter them: “When I called up about it yesterday it was obviously already booked up but I offered a little more than the going rate and… it’s ours.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said in all earnestness, “It’s huge.”</p><p>“I’ve heard that before.”</p><p>“I thought it was too hot for jokes?”</p><p>“Who said I was joking?”</p><p>The two made their way into the villa and Rio felt like she could breathe again as the AC enveloped her hot body once more. The inside was no less impressive, the living room all open plan with large cream couches arranged in a U shape to the left of the entry and a chef’s dream of a kitchen to the right. All of this was framed by the floor to ceiling windows that gave a view of the outdoor seating and the infinity pool that lay beyond, facing out to the sea.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Rio muttered as she walked towards the windows, finding one that’d open so she could step out onto the terrace.</p><p>Agatha hung back and tipped the driver and the man carrying their bags before she joined Rio where she now stood at the edge of the pool, looking out over the magnificent vista before them.</p><p>“Happy?”</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha and looked at her like she were a madwoman.</p><p>How could someone not be happy in a place like this? How could <em>Rio</em> who was standing opposite the love of her life in paradise not be happy?</p><p>But her thoughts died before they had any real chance of taking hold because Agatha was looking at her so openly, so softly, that she melted before her - and this time it had nothing to do with the heat.</p><p>She glanced either way to check if they were overlooked but should have known that of all the aspects of a luxury villa to seek out, privacy would be number one on Agatha’s mind. They were completely alone.</p><p>And so, taking advantage of that fact, she stepped forwards and stopped directly in-front of the still-waiting wife of hers and removed her own shirt.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped a few inches instantly, and then dropped further again as Rio stepped from her jeans. She moved even closer and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s lips as she reached behind herself to undo her bra, and bent a little, letting her lips remain against Agatha’s as she stepped out of her underwear.</p><p>“Get in the pool with me?”</p><p>Agatha blinked and her lips parted as she watched Rio turn and saunter into the shallows of the long pool, taking her time in walking down each step until she was a couple feet out and lowered herself fully into the water so only her head was above it. She turned and raised her brows at Agatha, grinning at the vacant look on her face as she simply stared at Rio.</p><p>“I… I thought you wanted a nap.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said with a faux-serious expression, dropping her voice so it was low and husky, “Don’t make me beg.”</p><p>If it was the reminder of Rio’s begging abilities that was what snapped Agatha out of her stupor, Rio wasn’t sure. But sure enough, Agatha stripped entirely, dropping her clothes to the floor and placing her heavy Rolex above them, and followed Rio into the warm pool, moving with her as Rio moved backwards and deeper, until she turned and went to rest against the infinity edge, raising her arms up and along it. Agatha moved up before her and bit on her lower lip as her hands finally, blissfully came into contact with Rio’s naked torso.</p><p>“Ask me again.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha blinked slowly, tilting her head in confusion as one hand trailed slowly down to Rio’s hip.</p><p>“Ask me again. Am I happy?”</p><p>A small frown appeared across Agatha’s features then and she hesitated for a second before asking: “Are you happy?”</p><p>The response came immediately, Rio’s serious face broke into a beaming grin so infectious so quickly that Agatha mirrored it on her own face. She lifted her legs up and wrapped them snugly around Agatha’s waist, releasing her hold on the wall to be held only by Agatha as she draped her arms around her neck and toyed with the damp hairs there, “I have you. I <em>couldn’t</em> be happier.”</p><p>They kissed, happily, drunk on the promise of just having each other, for the next few weeks, for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Agatha moaned into Rio’s mouth when her tongue brushed hers and she pressed Rio back against the wall, forever wanting her as close as could be. And Rio, Rio’s body was awake again, and her need for Agatha just as visceral and overwhelming as it had been the previous night.</p><p>Rio pulled away only to breathe properly again and looked down to see Agatha looked as desperate as she felt and she stretched a little, testing the response of her body as she pressed her hips a little more against Agatha and brought her hands down to cup her breasts.</p><p>“I don’t know how much of you will ever be enough for me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled again and squeezed Rio’s ass where she held it below to water, leaning in at the same time to nip at Rio’s lip, “You have all of me. All the time. Forever.”</p><p>Rio hummed and soothed her lower lip with her tongue where Agatha had just bitten it. Blue eyes dropped to the movement and Agatha leant in again even as Rio pulled back slightly, “Six weeks of sex and sun… maybe I could be convinced to stay here forever.”</p><p>“Six months,” Agatha corrected with a smirk, “but forever is good too. I’ll buy this place and we can make it home.”</p><p>Rio laughed and raised her brows as she leant in again and rested their foreheads together, “You have too much money.”</p><p>“It’s <em>our</em> money. I gave you access. I wish you’d spend it.”</p><p>Rio sighed and moved her hands back up to the sides of Agatha’s neck, “I told you I-…”</p><p>“Listen,” Agatha said, her tone much more serious now, and her hands moved too, now demurely settled at Rio’s waist, “I have money. A lot of it. That’s just a fact. I have more than most people could even imagine. That’s also a fact. I was born into it. I didn’t earn it. And my mother would roll in her grave if she ever thought that her fortune were being spent by a sexy, smart, kind, <em>liberal</em> Latina, who just so happened to be married to her daughter. I already told you, everything I have is yours and I want you to feel comfortable with that because I mean it, and I-…”</p><p>But Rio had moved her hands back, touching wet fingers to Agatha’s lips to silence her, so much was her heart thumping in her chest at Agatha’s words, at her consideration. “I get it. I do. I’ll try and-…”</p><p>But Agatha had opened her mouth and brushed her tongue along the pads of Rio’s three fingers, grimacing a little at the taste of the chlorine but closing her lips over them all the same.</p><p>“I’ll try,” Rio finished with a small smile, curling her hand around to pull her fingers out and cup Agatha’s jaw instead.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said with an arched brow, “And speaking of which, we need to go shopping tomorrow because we don’t have the right clothes for this heat.”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure the only thing to wear in this heat is <em>nothing</em>.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, “I can get on board with that. But there are some nice restaurants nearby and I’d like to take you to them. As much as I love to show you off, I’d rather you had clothes on for that. Underwear optional, of course.”</p><p>Rio only rolled her eyes at this and grinned so widely she thought her face might split in two.</p><p>“Fine. We can spend your money tomorrow and then we can relax. You need to relax.”</p><p>“<em>Our</em> money,” Agatha corrected, “But yes. All I want is you, a sunbed, and a cocktail.”</p><p>“I’m sure that can be arranged.”</p><p>That first afternoon in the pool led to a slow afternoon spent wrapped together for as long as they could stand on the double sunbed that faced the view that Rio couldn’t quite believe was real.</p><p>They loafed and lounged and luxuriated in their surroundings.</p><p>At one point, escaping the sun for a period to indulge in the cool of the AC in the villa, Rio explored their new home and padded around the three large en-suite bedrooms in turn, taking the initiative to move their bags to what was clearly the main suite, with its large bifold doors onto a balcony with a glass surround overlooking the pool and the ocean beyond it.</p><p>It felt like, smelt like, looked like, paradise.</p><p>And Rio’s heart felt, as she returned to Agatha’s side with two margaritas made fresh from the fully stocked kitchen, that she couldn’t possibly be luckier, or happier.</p><p>The days went slowly after that first one, because every second Rio made a conscious effort to savour. She wanted to remember the way Agatha’s skin smelt when she’d just been for a quick swim and was drying out in the sun. She wanted to remember the way she hissed softly when Rio would dutifully apply After Sun in the evenings to her tender skin after long days by the pool. And she wanted to remember the way Agatha found every excuse to kiss her, to hold her, to fuck her, like it was the most obvious thing in the world that she would be doing any and all of those things at all times, so natural did it feel to be in her company 24/7.</p><p>After the first day, Rio had made a conscious effort to keep in contact with those other people she loved and cherished. And she’d remembered her phone, and contacted Alice who had been blowing up her phone since before even the Stark Gala had started. She called her to let her know she was okay, to give her as many details about the gala as she could, but she was vague about where they were, having promised Agatha she’d not tell anyone, even Alice, for a least a couple of days.</p><p>And so she didn’t.</p><p>Alice seemed to know this would be the case anyway, perhaps because she’d already spoken to Agatha, so she didn’t push. But she did ask about Natasha, which was unusual for her, and Rio knew that what Billy had told Alice had been enough to make the determined friend of hers dig. She knew more than she was letting on.</p><p>She called Natasha too. But Natasha didn’t ask any questions, which was more suspicious than Alice <em>asking</em> questions. But Rio didn’t push it, because Natasha’s only question had echoed Agatha’s from only a few hours before: “Are you happy?”</p><p>She checked in with Billy too, even though Agatha had said she’d checked her credit card and seen that he’d purchased flights for himself to Puglia, Italy, and that he’d rented an apartment.</p><p>Rio called him and asked him why he’d only flown economy when he had the vast Harkness fortune available to him (“she’s mad at me still”), she asked him why Italy when it was surely cold still (“I don’t do sun”, and finally she’d asked him the question she kept being asked: “are you happy?” (“yes, I think so”).</p><p>And so she relaxed into her new little life, if only for a few weeks.</p><p>But it was on the hottest day of their time there, day seven, to be exact, that Rio vocalised something that had been in the back of her mind since the day she’d seen Agatha’s folder of evidence.</p><p>Something that snuck into her otherwise calm mind in between cocktails or when alone for more than five minutes whilst Agatha was sending emails from the couch.</p><p>“If you had gone to jail,” Rio mused, playing it off as gently as she could, this searingly hot morning where Agatha lay out with her face hidden under a large floppy hat, her pale skin freckled more than usual and her fingers dancing gently to the beat of the soft music Rio had put on for atmosphere, “do you think we’d be allowed conjugal visits? Is that something they only do in the movies?”</p><p>Agatha huffed quietly, lifting her hat to turn her head and blink across at her wife who was now more tanned than ever, more beautiful than she’d ever seen her in the bright Bajan sun. “Why are you worrying about that?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio reasoned slowly, toying with the edges of her book that now rested forgotten across her lap, “I was just thinking about it. How I’d have to keep coming to visit or you might run off with one of those crazies who dates people in jail… not literally run of course.”</p><p>Agatha sighed again and groaned as she rolled onto her side, still holding her hat just above her face, “<em>You’re</em> crazy.”</p><p>“And you’re hot. You’d have thousands of love letters being sent your way.”</p><p>“I’m married.”</p><p>“That doesn’t stop people.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but reached across for Rio, lazily pawing at her hip, “Come closer.”</p><p>“It’s too hot,” Rio said with a laugh as she shuffled away, swatting playfully at Agatha’s searching hand.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said a little more firmly, scowling at Rio now from beneath her hat.</p><p>Rio scoffed and shuffled a little closer on the double sunbed before she grabbed Agatha’s hand and leant down to kiss it gently, squeezing Agatha’s fingers, “Too hot.”</p><p>“Rio Vidal get over here right now.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but secretly was only too happy to oblige her demanding soon-to-be-proper-wife, clambering dextrously over to push Agatha back onto her back and settle in beside her.</p><p>Agatha huffed and tugged at Rio until she was more over her and placed her large floppy hat on the back of Rio’s head to give the both of them a little shade even as their hot bodies rested together. “It’s too hot for this,” Rio protested with a frown as she rested mostly on one forearm, reaching to brush a sweaty strand from Agatha’s forehead.</p><p>“Punishment for accusing me of sleeping with prison groupies,” Agatha said with a slight smile playing on her lips, her hand toying idly with the string from Rio’s bathing suit across her back.</p><p>“I might actually die,” Rio protested, shifting a little so that the hat slipped from its precarious position on the back of her head and Agatha had to catch it and adjust it again before it fell, making sure her face was still shaded.</p><p>“Then tell me why you were thinking about me going to prison and I’ll let you move back.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and flopped down dramatically against her wife, causing Agatha to gasp and then laugh, ineffectually trying to squirm away. “No no,” Rio mumbled against Agatha’s neck, “punishment for both of us.”</p><p>“Rio, my nose! My nose!” Agatha yelled through her laughter as she tried to position the hat back above her, narrowly avoiding a squeal as Rio nipped at her neck gently.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t handle it either and soon adjusted herself to plank above Agatha, resting on her forearms by Agatha’s ears and gazing down at her with a grin, believing she’d won. Agatha narrowed her eyes but reached around to return the floppy hat to the back of Rio’s head and shuffled down a little to make sure her face was shaded. Through no fault of her own (all her fault, Rio insisted), she’d managed to burn her nose a little the day before and it had turned slightly pink, and although Rio insisted it was adorable, Agatha was now determined to never have this happen again.</p><p>“Unreal,” she huffed and poked Rio’s side.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio grinned back and ducked down quickly to kiss Agatha’s nose. Agatha softened then and moved her hand to brush Rio’s cheek, watching her with cautious eyes, “Tell me. Tell me before we both combust.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but Agatha caught the downturn in her lips as Rio hovered above her and she frowned more deeply, suddenly the playful concern had morphed into something else, something that didn’t sit well in the heat of the day.</p><p>“I think about it. That’s all.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said slowly, watching as dark brown eyes darted about, avoiding her own gaze. “How often do you think about it?”</p><p>Rio shrugged as best she could from the position she was in and then pushed off to kneel back up and Agatha moved with her, stealing the hat back as she sat beneath her wife. “I am not going to prison. I am not receiving letters from women. I am right here. In this perfect villa with my perfect you.”</p><p>Rio sighed again and flopped down once more against Agatha, breathing in the smell of sweat and sun cream and whatever perfume Agatha had splashed on herself a couple days ago that hadn’t quite yet disappeared from her skin.</p><p>Despite the heat, Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s body and decided in that moment that a burnt nose was an okay price to give her partner some comfort.</p><p>“I’ve missed you,” Rio mumbled against Agatha’s skin, her body on fire against Agatha’s own boiling frame.</p><p>“I’m right here. We’ve been together for days now,” Agatha said with a concerned frown, her hands freezing where they’d been drawing soft patterns over Rio’s back.</p><p>“I mean,” Rio pulled back again and blinked down at Agatha, adjusting herself so her shadow could rest over Agatha’s face and her slightly pink nose, “for months we barely saw each other. And now you’re here. And I knew I missed you but, I didn’t realise <em>how</em> much and I’m just… I’ve missed you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, moving a hand up to brush dark strands of hair behind Rio’s ear, then letting the pads of her fingers brush down from the curve of her forehead, across her cheekbone, and over her lips. Rio parted them slightly and Agatha’s lips twitched upwards as she pressed two fingers into Rio’s mouth, letting the tip of her tongue graze them before she pulled back out and said: “Honey, you never need to worry about missing me again. Because I’m always going to be here, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded and rolled her eyes at herself, hiding her face in her hands, “I know, I just-…”</p><p>But Agatha was pulling her hands away from her face and frowning deeply still, “<em>If</em> anything were to <em>ever</em> happen to me. If I were ever to have to leave you, I would still always be only yours. But I’m never leaving.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again, but at herself still and released a laugh at her own juvenile worry, her own anxious brain.</p><p>“I know. I know.”</p><p>Agatha huffed softly and chewed on the corner of her lips for a second before she squeezed Rio’s hips, “I’m not sure you do.”</p><p>“I do, I-…”</p><p>“No, I’m afraid you don’t. I’ll just have to show you how yours I am.”</p><p>Rio blinked, taken aback by the sudden look of dark promise in Agatha’s eyes and she slowly began to grin, raising her brows, “I am telling you now it is too hot to do <em>anything</em> let alone what that horny little brain of yours has in mind.”</p><p>“God created AC for a reason.”</p><p>Rio hummed and thought for a second before she said, “Now what if <em>I</em> went to prison? Do you think people would write to me?”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said with a narrowed gaze, “Now you’re just playing dirty.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio asked with a slow grin growing up her face even as she felt herself beginning to boil where she was still against Agatha in the hot midday sun, “Are you telling me you <em>wouldn’t</em> be upset?”</p><p>“Enough,” Agatha said fiercely, but Rio could see more challenge in her gaze than actual anger. “Get off. Now.”</p><p>Rio schooled her expression into something far more innocent than she felt and she slipped from the sunbed to stand at the bottom of it, waiting until Agatha stood beside her and gripped her hips harshly with a hot, heavy hold.</p><p>“Bedroom,” she said like a curse, and released Rio’s hips with a push backwards and Rio gasped a little, correcting her stance to then grin as she took Agatha’s hand and pulled her with her to the bedroom.</p><p>The cool air of the inside of the villa was a welcome fan to the flames of their desires, and Agatha’s fire was roaring so much that she pulled Rio around on the stairs and held her in place to stop two steps above her.</p><p>Rio felt her breath catch in her throat and she stared down into the dark eyes of the woman she’d barely been a meter away from all week.</p><p>They’d been pressed together for days now, limbs entangled and hands always hungry for more. Whether Rio was falling asleep on Agatha on the couch, wine drunk and tired from a full day of sun and sex, or Agatha were pressing into her from above, below, behind, they were always together, always close.</p><p>But it didn’t make it any less exciting; Agatha to Rio was never any less magnetic.</p><p>And so she stopped on the stairs and looked down at Agatha with that same heady desire as always, watching as Agatha leant in and pressed a soft kiss to just below the string of her bikini top, resting her chin there and breathing out gently across her chest, her hands moving to slide up the back of her thighs and Rio had to hold her breath to not collapse completely before her.</p><p>“We should cancel dinner plans tonight.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hummed quietly, and Rio felt the vibration across her sternum as Agatha pressed her lips there again, squeezing her thighs firmly before she pulled back and dragged Rio up the stairs.</p><p>Their bedroom was cool, and the frigid air was welcome against Rio’s hot body, as Agatha left her by the large bed, framed by a four poster frame, and turned to the chest of drawers at the other end of the room.</p><p>Rio knew Agatha well enough by now to know what she was searching for and the last few months she’d experienced just how inventive Agatha could be with her fingers and a piece of silicone.</p><p>But she positioned herself in the centre of the bed and chewed on her lip all the same, leaning back up against her elbows to watch Agatha’s process, seeing her hesitate, rummage, and decide.</p><p>Because of course Agatha had brought a strap with her on vacation. And of course she’d dragged Rio to a tiny, inconspicuous sex shop the day they’d gone to look for more clothes appropriate for the untenable heat.</p><p>Agatha had perused the selection like a sommelier investigating the nose of a particular vintage and Rio had watched her in fascination, curious as to what she was looking for. With every inspection she’d asked Rio her opinion, what she thought, what she liked, what she might enjoy.</p><p>It had surprised Rio, though she wasn’t sure why, Agatha had always been considerate, always making sure Rio was okay, even if she were pushing for more, but this was a new side to her, one that told Rio everything that she’d long suspected but not yet confirmed: Agatha got off most on getting Rio off. And Rio didn’t even know if Agatha knew it, or if she was only this way with her, but in the middle of the quaint little sex store, she’d kissed her wife who was holding a bright pink dildo and was looking too serious for someone who was buying sex toys on vacation.</p><p>But from where Rio was reclining on the bed she watched as Agatha finally made her decision and sauntered over to the bed with a toy and harness in her hand.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned quietly, sitting up a little, eyeing the strap that she’d never seen before, “Where did that come from?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and dumped the contents of her hand on the bottom of the bed before she crawled up towards Rio, “Why aren’t you naked?”</p><p>“Did you want me to be?”</p><p>“You’re playing with fire, honey.”</p><p>Rio just smirked and raised her chin as Agatha crawled up her body, “Where did you get <em>that</em>?”</p><p>“Get what?” Agatha asked innocently as she crouched on her knees over Rio’s hips, raising her hands to cup Rio’s cheeks.</p><p>“That strap.”</p><p>“Oh. A store.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio hummed and narrowed her eyes as Agatha’s thumbs moved in to press past her lips and push down on her tongue.</p><p>“Why? Something wrong?”</p><p>But Rio couldn’t speak and instead scowled as Agatha pulled her left hand away and placed her index and middle finger in her own mouth, wetting them completely before replacing her right thumb with her fingers in Rio’s mouth and pushing in so far that Rio gagged a little around them and Agatha’s eyes glinted with desire.</p><p>She pulled back to allow Rio to recover and traced her fingers over Rio’s lower, pouting lip, “I bought it a while ago. But I think that making sure you know I’m only interested in you calls for it, don’t you? Besides,” she smirked as she replaced her fingers with her lips and Rio gasped softly, “It’s been a while since you’ve been able to feel me the next day and I’m in the mood to have you feeling me next week.”</p><p>Rio huffed out a heavy breath against Agatha’s lips and smirked, “Try your best, Harkness. Do your worst.”</p><p>Agatha only scoffed and pulled back to untie the strings of Rio’s bikini by pulling the strings at her hips. She didn’t even bother to pull the fabric away from her and instead pushed the front piece down and replaced it with her hand, pressing two wet fingers firmly into Rio without a second to let her anticipate the intrusion.</p><p>Rio whimpered softly but bit down on her lip to stop her reaction. But the whimper was enough for Agatha, and she kept her fingers still within Rio, simply watching her as she stared up at her with wide eyes, “I need you to be louder, baby. Or I won’t know if you’re enjoying yourself.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes a little but relented only because the vision of Agatha above her, reaching down between her thighs in her deep blue bikini was too much to bear.</p><p>She released her lip and sucked in a heavy breath before she said, “Stop. Teasing.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly and began to move her hand then, fucking Rio slowly and roughly, not yet touching her clit, and making sure she caught every breath leaving Rio’s lips against her own as she leant down against her.</p><p>Rio’s heavy breaths soon became whines and she rocked her hips upwards with each thrust, her legs locked together by Agatha’s knees and the palm that now slapped her clit with every harsh thrust driving her to the very edges of sanity.</p><p>“Agatha,” she breathed out, arching up a little with a whine. But Agatha only smiled against her lips, happy for it to take as long as it took for Rio to come undone against her hand.</p><p>She trailed the tip of her tongue slowly along Rio’s upper lip and Rio whined again as she stiffened and teetered on the edge of her orgasm.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, I’m so close. Fuck.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and adjusted her hand to press her palm more firmly against Rio’s clit, applying more consistent pressure as she continued to push into her.</p><p>Rio came with a cry that was swallowed by Agatha’s mouth and Agatha rewarded her by moving down quickly, her hands scrambling now she’d pulled out to push Rio’s legs open and settle between them, her mouth soon replacing where her fingers had been.</p><p>Rio cried out again as Agatha pressed her tongue inside of her, her nose nudging her clit as she pressed her tongue as deep as she could.</p><p>Rio’s hips rocked desperately against Agatha’s face and Agatha pulled back only when she had reached the end of her patience but not the end of her desire for Rio.</p><p>Rio knew she was making sure she was ready, had stretched her out enough and made her wet enough that she could take what she was about to give.</p><p>And Rio wanted it, god did she want it.</p><p>She shifted her hips against the bed, watching Agatha with hungry eyes as she reached behind herself, settling back on her knees and reaching for the harness, moving quickly to settle it about her hips and adjusting it in place with frantic, fumbling fingers as she kept her gaze down on Rio’s cunt, watching the way her hips moved of their own accord, desperate to be filled again.</p><p>Rio huffed at the sight of Agatha sat there with her cock in her hand, her eyes turned down but not yet making a move to fill her.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said quietly, struggling to lean up on her elbows and widening her eyes as Agatha did move closer, mercifully making contact but instead of putting herself where Rio wanted her, she rested her large, blue strap over her stomach, and Rio swallowed thickly at  the confirmation of its size.</p><p>But Agatha, transfixed by the sight of herself resting from Rio’s pelvis to just her belly button, had reached below the resting strap and pressed her fingers back into Rio, stretching her with three.</p><p>“Agatha,” she tried again, licking her lips and trying to stop rocking her hips desperately.</p><p>“You can take it,” Agatha assured, raising her gaze to Rio’s wide eyes again and smiling crookedly at her, “I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>Rio groaned and felt the stretch of Agatha pushing her fingers apart within her, getting her ready as best she could.</p><p>She almost blacked out when Agatha leant back a little but spat down on her strap, rubbing it slowly to lube it up as she watched Rio’s eyes go from deep to dark brown, her pupils practically swallowing any colour that was left.</p><p>“I have lube,” Agatha whispered softly, watching Rio’s reaction closely as she stilled her fingers inside her again, still slowly rubbing up and down the length of the strap.</p><p>“But I don’t think you’ll need it.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, her breathing picking up again as she stared wide-eyed at Agatha and watched as she pulled out of her again and for good measure swiped her hand over Rio’s soaked pussy, and used the wetness gathered there to rub that across the strap too.</p><p>Rio whimpered at the sight and threw herself backwards, covering her eyes with her forearm as she felt Agatha line up against her. She gasped loudly as Agatha pushed just the tip in and heard her spit again, using her saliva to help herself push in further when she felt a little resistance.</p><p>Agatha moved slowly, tortuously slow, and Rio took equally slow, laboured breaths with every inch that was pressed inside of her.</p><p>By the time she was completely filled and could feel herself clenching involuntarily around Agatha’s length she looked back up to her and saw Agatha staring down at her with a gaze so feral she looked otherworldly.</p><p>“Too much?” She asked with a slight smirk as her left hand moved to caress Rio’s lower abdomen, brushing along the hard length she felt there.</p><p>“Never,” Rio challenged back, more confident than she felt, but unwilling to give in.</p><p>Agatha smiled a little more and bucked her hips experimentally, causing Rio to moan and lose her cool, her hands flying down to grip the sheets.</p><p>“God,” Agatha mumbled softly as she began to move slowly in and out of Rio, pressing into her again only to the strap’s widest point then pulling out to repeat. Rio kept her gaze up on Agatha’s face and found herself transfixed by the way her hair fell about her blushed cheeks, the way her lips remained parted and puffed out soft pants with every movement of her hips.</p><p>The stretch was too much to get used to but not enough to make her not want more, to make Agatha stop.</p><p>And so when Agatha pulled out completely and readjusted them, moving one of Rio’s legs slowly up and over her shoulder, she raised her hips to chase the feeling of fullness she was now missing, Agatha having, in just minutes, created a needy, desperate woman.</p><p>Agatha pressed just the tip into Rio again, wanting to see what Rio would do and almost snapping her hips forward when she saw her hips careen, gyrating in desperation to get her to press deeper again.</p><p>Agatha pressed in deeper than she had in a while, but slowly still, filling her fully and stopping with her hand pressed firmly down on her abdomen.</p><p>“You’re taking me so well, baby.”</p><p>Rio moaned and rocked her hips upwards, gasping slightly at the excess stretch and whined a little, “Agatha, you’re so big. It’s so big.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head and kissed Rio’s ankle softly, brushing her hand down to nudge her swollen clit with her thumb.</p><p>She then pulled out completely again to be able to manoeuvre Rio’s other leg up to her shoulders and Rio bit down on her lip as Agatha pressed in again, but even slower this time, knowing she’d be pressing deeper.</p><p>“Fuck fuck fuck,” Rio muttered as Agatha pressed her body over and pushed Rio’s legs back towards her own head. Rio took hold of the back off her knees and grit her teeth as she looked down between them to see where their hips were now flush together.</p><p>Agatha halted and allowed Rio to get used to the stretch for a second before she cautiously pressed totally into her, dropping her gaze to watch where she’d completely disappeared inside of her and moaning as she began to stir her hips.</p><p>“D’you wish I could fill you completely? Come so deep you’re dripping with me for days?”</p><p>Rio bucked her hips at Agatha’s words and her jaw went slack, unable to think coherently anymore.</p><p>But Agatha remained watchful, forcing herself to focus on every tell of Rio’s body, every twitch of her muscles, every desperate gasp that escaped her lips.</p><p>Rio’s back had arched and she was becoming more and more desperate for some release and Agatha reached between them to build her to one, knowing she couldn’t keep her like this for as long as she wanted to.</p><p>She came with a scream and Agatha’s hips rocking slowly into her but her two practised fingers bullied her clit so harshly she saw stars as she arched fully off the bed and clenched painfully around Agatha’s cock.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered as she remained still now, her fingers twitching gently against the sensitive knot and watched Rio’s sun-kissed body writhe beneath her, the fullness now too much to bear.</p><p>“Agatha, too much…”</p><p>Agatha pulled out slowly and pulled her hand away, leaning away fully so Rio could drop her legs either side of her. Rio whined quietly and covered her eyes again as Agatha moved quickly to remove the harness from her hips, tossing it aside so she could settle between Rio’s quaking thighs and bury her tongue where her cock had just been.</p><p>Rio groaned at the soft pressure and twitched her hips a little, glancing down at Agatha’s head between her legs and wondering if she could take any more. But she could barely think as Agatha cleaned her up, running her tongue hungrily through her until Rio was panting again, the dull ache settling across her lower half as she attempted to pull Agatha back up.</p><p>“C’mere. Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, trailing kisses up Rio’s body until she reached her lips and kissed her slowly, allowing her to taste herself on her tongue.</p><p>Agatha moaned a little, ignoring Rio’s hands in her hair that tried to pull her up, make her climb up her body.</p><p>She pulled away and huffed out a breath, “I’m not done with you.”</p><p>“Yes you are,” Rio countered with a lazy smile, her brown eyes heavy with the intensity of her last orgasm and she reached down between them to see just how much fucking her like that had affected Agatha. A lot, by the feel of her.</p><p>Agatha twitched a little as Rio’s long fingers teased through her folds and found her dripping and desperate. Rio licked her lips and whispered, “Sit on my face. Please.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a second, the feeling of Rio’s fingers against her breaking down her stonewalled desire to hold out until Rio was completely broken beneath her. But she nodded and kissed Rio sweetly before she moved up and positioned her knees either side of Rio’s head.</p><p>Rio wasted no time at all in wrapping her arms around Agatha’s thighs and she held her steady as she lowered herself against her and groaned when Rio’s tongue made contact.</p><p>Rio could eat Agatha out for days like this. Have her use her mouth like it was made for her and only her.</p><p>She kept her eyes up and on Agatha’s body writhing above her, feeling the desire flutter in her abdomen again at the sight of freckled skin and Agatha’s jaw where her head was tilted back, lost in her own mind as Rio ate her out desperately.</p><p>Soon enough Agatha’s movements became more erratic and Rio had to close her eyes as she focused on what she was doing, how Agatha liked to be touched, how she could bring her to ecstasy as best she could.</p><p>Agatha came with a cry and Rio’s arms tightened around her thighs to hold her in place, unwilling to let her pull back and instead adjusting herself to suck at Agatha’s clit, wanting her against her for as long as possible.</p><p>But fingers soon made her way to her hair and Agatha scratched her lightly, babbling above her to let her go.</p><p>Rio did so reluctantly and Agatha clambered down on shaking legs to sprawl herself on top of Rio, kissing softly along her neck as she settled close and Rio wrapped her arms around her.</p><p>“I adore you,” Agatha mumbled almost shyly, which was a feat given what they’d just done together. But Rio didn’t tease her for it and instead squeezed her waist gently and kissed her forehead, whispering against her, “I adore you too.”</p><p>Rio’s body felt warm for different reasons now and she raised one leg to drape over Agatha’s hip, still feeling the need to have her as close as possible as Agatha’s breathing began to even out against her neck, her fingers dancing idly across her side.</p><p>“Are you comfortable?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio reassured, pressing a kiss down to the top of Agatha’s head, “I might need to stay laying down for a while though.”</p><p>Agatha hummed happily and cautiously reached to press her fingers between Rio’s thighs, groaning a little at the feel of just how soaked she was, and circling her ring finger slowly around her entrance.</p><p>“Stop teasing,” Rio warned quietly, her body already beginning to respond despite the ache.</p><p>“I’m just enjoying the fruits of my labour.”</p><p>But Agatha pulled her hand away again, returning it to its position at Rio’s side and rubbing soothing circles there.</p><p>They both fell asleep not long after that, each exhausted in their own way. In the cool of the AC, they could lie together in a way that was impossible outside in the sun.</p><p>And so afternoon naps were commonplace now. Often announced by Rio as “siestas” whenever the mood took her, and often either followed by, or coming in second to, something Agatha had referred to as “cock o’clock” when she’d had one too many cocktails by the pool, and which Rio had asked her to never say again or she wouldn’t be getting any any time soon.</p><p>And so the days continued to pass and Agatha now slept almost as much as Rio, remaining more relaxed that she’d ever been, and the two of them became accustomed to the easy access to one another, the new rituals they had together, the joy of every day domestic life they easily fell into.</p><p>It was about a week later when the prickly heat of the midday sun made it almost impossible for Rio to get comfortable even on the plush towel, even on the soft Sandy beach, even beside her goddess of a wife now laying out in her red bikini, her forearm thrown haphazardly across her eyes and her other hand curled around the edge of Rio’s towel. It was too hot to touch but Agatha always found a way to be close.</p><p>But with Rio shuffling so, she was able to look around at the other beach goers, watching for a while the other couples all laid out together and wondering if they could possibly be as happy together as her and Agatha. She watched the movement of a little kid splashing in the shallows with his dad. She watched the people further out, bobbing about in the ocean current. And then she looked up and behind them to see a solitary figure sitting on a striped towel in a white t-shirt and blue shorts… looking right at her.</p><p>She looked away and then looked again and still he was looking right at her.</p><p>She’d been looked at before, of course she had. But this was different. This wasn’t some pervert on the beach looking at her because she was a woman in a bikini. This man was <em>watching</em>.</p><p>Rio moved slowly, turning back to Agatha and shaking her shoulder, her voice an urgent whisper, “Agatha. There’s a man watching us.”</p><p>“Agatha,” she repeated firmly when Agatha didn’t respond and even then she only got a slight hum.</p><p>“What day is it?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Day,” Agatha said lazily, removing her arm from her eyes and yawning a little as she swotted Rio’s hot hand away, “Thursday?”</p><p>“Yes, I think so. Why?”</p><p>Agatha grumbled as she threw herself onto her stomach and looked up to see this voyeur. She watched him for a while before she raised her voice and shouted across the sand: “You. When did the sun rise?”</p><p>Rio’s head whipped back around to Agatha so quickly she thought it might fall right off her neck. Did Agatha have sun stroke? Was she okay?</p><p>“June 2nd.”</p><p>Rio looked back at the man with a deep frown and wondered if <em>she</em> was experiencing sun stroke until the woman next to her flopped onto her back again and nudged Rio’s arm, “He’s one of Alice’s.”</p><p>Rio gaped down at her, unsure where to even begin with this sudden piece of information.</p><p>“Alice’s? He’s…”</p><p>“Protection,” Agatha clarified, now shielding her eyes with her fingers and squinting up at Rio. “The best. I made sure of it.”</p><p>Rio looked back over at the man and saw him do a sweep of the beach before she was jolted back down and pulled onto Agatha.</p><p>“Hey,” she huffed as she adjusted herself so she could lie on her side next to her and Agatha did the same, propping her head up on her bent elbow so she was above Rio.</p><p>“He’ll stay close whilst we’re here but won’t interrupt us at all, okay?”</p><p>She began to lazily draw lines up and down Rio’s arm and her gaze fell quite significantly far south of Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“‘The sun rise’?” Rio quoted with her brows raised, unwilling to let Agatha get distracted so easily when she still had so many questions.</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha hummed, “You.”</p><p>Rio blinked and stared at Agatha for a full ten seconds before it clicked in her mind. “The day we met. June 2nd.”</p><p>Agatha raised her gaze slowly and met Rio’s a little reluctantly, glad of the heat so she could deny any insinuation that this was making her blush. “Yes.”</p><p>“Hopeless,” Rio whispered affectionately as she leant up to press their lips together. “A hopeless romantic.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched a little bit she fought against this designation, “It was Alice’s idea.”</p><p>“Sure it was,” Rio sang, making her eyes comically wide and grinning up at Agatha. “Just admit it. You love me. You think I’m the sun.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and flopped back onto her back, throwing her arm back over her eyes again, “You’re lucky there are other people here or you’d be-…”</p><p>“I’d be what, Agatha? I’d be delivered a bouquet of roses and a box of chocolates?”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Rio laughed and leant in to kiss Agatha’s shoulder, reaching to lightly drape her arm across her stomach. “Is there a reason you think we need a bodyguard when no one even knows where we are?”</p><p>If Rio hadn’t had her arm across Agatha’s stomach she might not have realised this question would change the mood so much. But Agatha had tensed and her lips had pursed slightly.</p><p>Rio let her sit in the silence for a while, squinting across at her as she waited.</p><p>“I always said I’d get someone for you. This is just-…”</p><p>“Oh, he’s for <em>me</em>?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said softly, clearly too hot under Rio’s hold because she shifted to her side again and dislodged it. “It’s just a precaution.”</p><p>“And have you done anything recently that may mean you need to take this precaution?”</p><p>Rio stared intently at Agatha’s face, watching bright blue eyes that darted away for a second before looking back at her as she said, “No.”</p><p>Rio knew she was lying but either the sun or her previously blissed out state prevented her from asking. So she didn’t.</p><p>Instead she leant in and kissed Agatha so softly that Agatha followed her lips as she pulled away, seeking more.</p><p>“So which bedroom is he taking?” Rio teased with a toothy grin after indulging Agatha.</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha huffed and threw herself back into her back, her arm returning to cover her eyes and her other returning to hold Rio’s towel.</p><p>Rio only laughed and settled back down herself, stretching out fully and stealing Agatha’s floppy had from on top of their beach bag to block out the sun.</p><p>Agatha, after a few minutes of silence from Rio, took the opportunity to turn to look at her, and soon shifted onto her side again to take in the view properly, her fingers itching to touch but not wanting to disturb her.</p><p>She settled instead on resting her hand a little closer, feeling the heat from Rio’s side hit the knuckles of her fingers that simply rested there, wanting.</p><p>“We need to plan.”</p><p>“Mm? Dinner?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quietly, her voice now serious, “The wedding. Make it official.”</p><p>Rio peeked out from beneath the hat and watched Agatha with a small smile, “All I want is for Natasha to be there. Otherwise I don’t mind.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and chewed on her lip for a second glancing down at her fingers which now reached out to graze the skin across Rio’s rib cage.</p><p>“A small ceremony then. Nothing outrageous. Just Natasha, Jen, Alice, Lilia.”</p><p>“And Billy,” Rio reminded with an arched brow.</p><p>“Mm. Do you want anyone else? The team?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said with a slight shake of her head, “Just family.”</p><p>Agatha nodded again and let her fingers walk slowly up Rio’s ribs until she splayed her fingers out above where her heart was. “Will we take everyone away? A destination wedding?”</p><p>“No, just City Hall. No fuss. Then we can go to dinner, maybe go dancing?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>And just like that, on a roasting day on a beach in Barbados, the official plan to become the Vidals was formed.</p><p>When they got home that evening, Agatha sent notice in the group chat she had with her friends (and Billy) and Rio called Natasha to let her know when they were back, her presence would be required at City Hall for the official wedding of the two women who already considered the other their wife.</p><p>Another week went by, and Rio was unsurprised to find that she wasn’t yet bored. She’d plowed through so many books she’d had to do any emergency run to a local bookstore to buy more, she’d had more sex than she’d ever had in her life, and yet she felt well-rested, relaxed, and happier than she ever thought possible.</p><p>Agatha had been happy before, relaxed before, but now their plans to marry were more concrete, and a date in two months time had been booked in for the ceremony, she was even more calm, more at ease with everything.</p><p>She’d taken to referring to Rio as “my wife” whenever possible, and Rio had discovered that referring to Agatha as such in the bedroom was like a cheat code to making her turn things up a notch, turning her dial from hungry to ravenous.</p><p>In the evening of a particularly humid day, they’d taken themselves to a beachfront restaurant that boasted magnificent views and Michelin-worthy food.</p><p>A whole day of languishing by the pool in the sun had made Rio starved for a proper meal - having just grazed on snacks and gin and tonics all day.</p><p>And so they sat against the backdrop of a sunset, their hands together over the table, their cocktails of choice in front of each of them, and the promise of a decadent meal before them.</p><p>“The rabbit,” Rio was saying, a curious glint in her eye. “On the fireplace? Why a rabbit?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and took a sip of her martini before answering, swirling the cocktail stick-skewered olive as she did: “The little wooden one?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“I like rabbits.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>“Don’t you?”</p><p>“I…” Rio frowned a little and released a soft laugh, having never really given rabbits much consideration, “I suppose.”</p><p>“I had horses growing up but I always wanted a pet in the house. A dog, maybe. I wasn’t allowed one but the house had acres of land and when I could get away I’d run out and just sit in the fields, and… there were rabbits.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, watching Agatha with a tender sort of care, her fingers twitching against hers, aware that any discussion of Agatha’s childhood was few and far between with the unspoken thing always between them: that it was miserable, that Agatha hated any reminder of it.</p><p>But Agatha had only shrugged a little, eyes down on her martini glass, “I guess I sort of got used to them and they got used to me and… that was it.”</p><p>“They adopted you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at this and ran a hand through her hair, making it wilder where it was already wavy and majestic in the heat. “I grew to like them, that’s all.”</p><p>Rio grinned and raised her brows as she took a sip of her own cocktail, imagining a young Agatha sitting in a field surrounded by rabbits of all things. It was reassuring to know that she had at least this one comfort when she was younger.</p><p>“We should get one.”</p><p>“Get one what?”</p><p>“A rabbit.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but saw the seriousness in Rio’s face as she looked across at her. “You’re serious?”</p><p>“Well, you like them and they clearly meant something to you when you were younger. I have nothing against them and why not?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and squeezed Rio’s fingers, her amused expression soon cooling down to soft recognition of the charitable act Rio was committing. “Maybe. Let’s focus on the wedding first and you allowing me to take you on honeymoon.”</p><p>“You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“What? A wife isn’t allowed to treat her wife?”</p><p>“We’re practically on honeymoon now. How much more vacation can we have? How much more <em>sex</em> can we have?”</p><p>“Oh, honey, <em>so</em> much more.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and laughed at this, taking another sip of her cocktail as Agatha moved her foot under the table to brush along her exposed calf.</p><p>It was just as Rio was enjoying this extra attention that someone approached their table. Thinking it was the waiter to take the order of their appetiser, Rio turned expectantly and was surprised to see an attractive blonde woman standing there, and if her yellow sundress were anything to go by: she wasn’t staff.</p><p>“Excuse me, my girlfriend and I couldn’t help but notice the both of you from our table just over there.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers stiffened in against Rio’s and Rio glanced up briefly to see her dinner companion’s jaw flex before she swung her gaze back to the pretty woman standing beside their table.</p><p>She was tall, with a short, blunt blonde bob and looked confident, like whatever she was about to say wouldn’t be refused.</p><p>But Rio knew different. And had already guessed where this might be going. Apparently, so had Agatha. But she smiled serenely and leant back as she waited for the inevitable.</p><p>“My girlfriend and I were wondering… are you open? Would you like to join us for a drink?”</p><p>A soft, not unkind chuckle escaped Rio’s lips at the confirmation that she’d gaged it exactly right.</p><p>She didn’t respond and instead raised her brows in amusement to turn to Agatha who looked like she’d never heard anything <em>less</em> funny in her life.</p><p>“No,” she said firmly. “Decidedly not.”</p><p>The woman’s face fell a little but she recovered quickly and Rio had to admit that she was impressed by this and she shot her a gentle smile before glancing back at Agatha.</p><p>“Oh. That’s a shame. But if you change your minds, you know where to find us.”</p><p>Rio glanced back again and inclined her head slightly, “Enjoy your evening.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing as the woman smiled, maybe a little too hopefully for her liking at Rio’s words, and she watched her walk away with a tense expression on her face.</p><p>“Flattering,” Rio hummed quietly as she lifted her cocktail to take a delicate sip, watching Agatha closely over the rim of her glass.</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and lifted her own glass to her lips as Rio smirked and placed her glass down again, toying with the cocktail stick that skewered the cherry on it, “Is it because she’s blonde?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“You’re not into blondes?”</p><p>Rio got the exact reaction she was hoping for from the woman across from her and she had to bite down in the inside of her cheek to prevent herself from ruining it by grinning.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes had flashed and she stared at Rio, unable to fight her annoyance despite knowing that Rio was trying to get this exact reaction from her.</p><p>“You are ridiculous.”</p><p>“Oh? Well she was pretty, surely that’s the only explanation.”</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>Rio’s grin spilled across her face then, only growing as Agatha narrowed her eyes at her and she lifted her drink back up to take a long sip, wondering how far she could push it.</p><p>“Her girlfriend is brunette, maybe we could just do a straight swap.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped then and she looked for a second like she might flip the table between them but she somehow managed to calm herself and her fingers raised to pinch the bridge of her nose and she spoke at the same time Rio did as she stretched a hand across towards Agatha, recognising the line she’d reached.</p><p>“Can we please drop it and go back to our evening.” / “Hey, I’m teasing, Agatha Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers lay dancing in the air as she watched Agatha curiously, seeing the way she’d paused and was now turning her gaze back to her with something other than the rage she’d just been trying to quell.</p><p>“What… what did you just call me?”</p><p>Rio’s brows shot up at this reaction and she tilted her head as she watched Agatha’s eyes change colour before her, darkening to an almost midnight blue with her lips parted as she leant forwards in her chair.</p><p>Rio leant backwards and enjoyed this sight for a second longer before she uttered, “<em>Agatha Vidal.</em>”</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly, her gaze dropping to Rio’s lips before raising again to meet her eye, seeing the amusement there and choosing to ignore it.</p><p>“Finish your drink. I’m getting the check.”</p><p>“What? Agatha, no. I’m starving.”</p><p>But Agatha had turned away, gesturing for the waiter to fetch the check for them already.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio laughed out, bemused by this sudden change of heart, “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“Deathly,” Agatha uttered, her hand still raised as if to hurry the process along, and soon enough the little wallet was placed before her. Agatha slipped her card in and scribbled the tip amount and her signature on the receipt.</p><p>“You can’t tip a thousand dollars on two cocktails,” Rio said distractedly, watching as Agatha closed the wallet and held it up for whichever waiter was closest to take.</p><p>Clearly it had been a slip of the pen, an error caused by an errant mind, now determined to get Rio somewhere away from prying eyes.</p><p>But Agatha either didn’t register Rio’s words or didn’t care, and waited impatiently until the booklet was taken and her card swept away to be processed.</p><p>“They’ll think we’re leaving because of them,” Rio insisted quietly, nudging her head in the direction of the two women who’d propositioned them.</p><p>“I don’t care,” Agatha said with a shrug, staring determinedly at the waiter who seemed to understand the urgency and was soon hurrying back to deliver this generous customer her card.</p><p>When safely tucked away in her bag Agatha stood and went to help Rio step from her chair, chivalrously pulling her chair back for her, but Rio knew it was just a means to get her moving faster.</p><p>She huffed slightly, but allowed Agatha to guide her from the restaurant and take her hand as they turned in a surprising direction: towards the beach.</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>“Somewhere private.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little as they made it to the still-warm sand and Agatha continued to march them along it, heading for a little outcrop of rocks that would hide them from any prying eyes at the restaurant.</p><p>But she remained silent until they reached their destination and Agatha crowded her to press her back against the cool face of the large rock, the only witness to what was about to happen the seabirds that were scattered about the calm ocean before them.</p><p>“Say it again,” Agatha instructed urgently, dropping her purse at their feet and pressing herself against Rio, her thigh settling between Rio’s legs.</p><p>“Say what?” Rio teased, feeling Agatha tense against her and her fingers begin to bunch the thin white sundress she wore, tugging it to above her hips.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned, replacing her thigh with her hand now she had access and gasping softly where Rio wore no underwear. “When were you going to tell me you weren’t wearing any underwear?”</p><p>Rio had to fight back the groan as Agatha pressed more against her, her fingers making a slow trail down to her entrance.</p><p>“I was hoping you’d discover it at some point yourself.”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha mumbled, dipping her head to kiss Rio’s jaw as she pressed her index finger slowly inside of her wife.</p><p>“Calling you by my name really made you this desperate for me?”</p><p>Agatha hummed and nipped at Rio’s neck, “I’d say you’re the desperate one, honey. You’re practically trying to milk my finger here.”</p><p>Rio groaned a little and rocked her hips forward but Agatha didn’t give her any more, and simply pressed hot, open-mouthed kisses to her neck, teasing her as she curled her finger inwards slightly and palmed at her clit.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha…”</p><p>“Say it,” Agatha demanded, applying a little more pressure.</p><p>“Vidal,” Rio groaned quietly, “Agatha Vidal. <em>My</em> Agatha Vidal. My wife. <em>Please</em>, my wife.”</p><p>Rio’s compliance, her indulgence in Agatha’s desires, meant that Agatha gave her exactly what she was begging for. She pushed a second finger inside of her, then a third, and soon had Rio fighting back her moans and rocking into her desperately as the waves crashed before them.</p><p>Rio came with a rough shout of Agatha’s name that was drowned out by the rising tide of the ocean, and muffled by her face buried into hair as wild as the waves.</p><p>Agatha remained inside of Rio, soothing her down from her high with gentle kisses to her bare shoulder, her neck, her cheek.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” she muttered quietly as Rio whimpered when she finally pulled her hand from her, “My wife.”</p>

<p>Rio would be awake soon, that much she knew.</p><p>And their little bubble of paradise would be burst forever.</p><p>Agatha had been awake all night, unable to sleep because she feared that she would never again be allowed in the same bed as Rio Vidal, let alone the same house, perhaps even the same country, once Rio heard the news that would surely turn her against her forever.</p><p>She had explicitly gone behind Rio’s back and done something so unforgivable that no good person would stay. And Rio was good.</p><p>Rio was perfect.</p><p><em>Her</em> Rio.</p><p>From 2am onwards her phone had been infrequently lighting up with messages and calls. Then, when most people were waking around 7am, her phone had remained constantly alight, so blown up with people trying to contact her that it had no respite and by 7:30, it had died.</p><p>On the other bedside table sat Rio’s cell, facedown and plugged in to charge. For that, at least, Agatha was grateful. If Rio’s were similarly full of people trying to contact her, she at least wouldn’t know until she were awake.</p><p>When she felt she could no longer stand it, feeling like she was holding Rio when Rio wouldn’t want her to, she peeled herself away, allowing her lips to graze the tanned skin of the back of Rio’s neck and swallowing down the fear that it might be the last time she were allowed such a gift.</p><p>She knew she didn’t have long to prepare herself for this conversation. Though the decision had been made a couple of weeks ago. She’d had time. She’d simply not used it. She’d instead focused all of her energy on the present, the person she’d had in her arms. But now she had to face the consequences.</p><p>Rio continued to sleep soundly, curled up in the position she left her in at the centre of the bed. She looked peaceful, and for the first time, Agatha considered her to be properly safe.</p><p>She felt it in her bones that she was. And Lilia had been telling her for years to listen to her body.</p><p>But years of believing she wasn’t good, let alone enough, meant that a belief in Rio’s safety also meant a belief in Rio’s utter disgust at what she’d done. Because she couldn’t have both. She couldn’t have Rio safe <em>and</em> in love with her. It was too much goodness for Agatha Harkness to ever be allowed.</p><p>But she’d willingly let Rio go if it meant she were safe. She knew that much.</p><p>She’d worked for months to keep Rio out of harms way, only to change course at the last minute and agree to pass the torch to someone else who had the means to take down Wanda. She’d then taken Rio away, kept her to herself, not even letting on to her friends exactly where they were, except for two of them.</p><p>Two friends knew.</p><p>At Agatha’s request, one friend had sent her best employee to keep an eye on them both, watchful of their movements wherever they went, one hand always on his gun, ready to be locked and loaded at any time on the peaceful, idyllic island, if the need called for it.</p><p>Alice’s instruction had been to look after them both. Agatha’s had been to prioritise Rio.</p><p>But none of it had been enough. Not when she heard rumblings from the second person who knew their whereabouts - the only other person who was complicit in Agatha’s decision.</p><p>She moved silently through to the en suite bathroom and placed her phone down, having grabbed a little power pack from the side to plug it in to see the frantic texts and calls that were flooding through still.</p><p>Tired eyes moved up to the mirror, taking in the sight of a woman who was so powerful she could summon death, but so damaged she couldn’t keep the love of her life by her side.</p><p>The woman staring back at her looked ghostly pale and exhausted, though she’d spent the month sleeping soundly, curled around the only person who’d ever made sleeping for Agatha not something she did just to remain alive.</p><p>She traced her index finger along the dark bag visible below her left eye and traced her fingers further along to brush down her esoteric nose. The nose that Rio kissed when she was curled against her in the bed. The nose that Rio had once mentioned she’d hope their children would inherit. The nose that Agatha had grown up hating but had now come to love because Rio loved it.</p><p>Her gaze then fell to the faint lines at the sides of her mouth that proved she was a person who smiled. That being here with Rio had been the time in her life when she’d smiled the most, when smiles had come easiest: so easy she wondered if smiling would ever feel the same if Rio decided she wouldn’t share hers with her anymore.</p><p>Her hand dropped then as the creeping poison of Rio’s potential to leave her settled comfortably across her chest, purring its promise of a future alone. And having tasted happiness and what being truly loved could feel like, Agatha wasn’t sure she would survive it.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze lifted again to meet her own in the mirror and she felt her blood run cold as the sound of Rio rustling, fighting against the sheets she’d been buried under, sounded her imminent arrival.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw her phone, now charged to just below 10%, was still blowing up silently on the counter. But other people could wait. They could wait several lifetimes for all she cared. Rio was the only person who mattered now.</p><p>As she completed her fourth round of box breathing, her reason for being appeared at the door.</p><p>Through the mirror Agatha’s eyes landed on her. Beautiful, happy, calm Rio. She wore her rings, an old t-shirt of Agatha’s, and her usual sleep shorts that had planets dotted about them and Agatha knew them to be the first shorts she’d ever seen on Rio, all those months ago when she’d wanted her so badly and had been so convinced she couldn’t have her. <em>That</em>, she thought bitterly, clearly hadn’t changed. She’d been a fool to think it could.</p><p>Rio was hers now, but only in promise. And something as big as this, as monumental and world-changing, would surely be enough to break such a promise.</p><p>Agatha wondered if she had been able to secure the marriage licence and get their signatures on it sooner then maybe she could have blocked Rio from trying to leave. Because then they’d be tied together legally. Then it would surely be harder for Rio to run from her.</p><p>But no. She’d give Rio anything. Even if it meant giving her a life without her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said again now closer, more urgently than the initial call of her name as Rio had woken without her.</p><p>Rio’s voice was raspy, thick with sleep and something else Agatha knew to be fear, but she couldn’t bring herself to turn to her, couldn’t even lift her gaze in the mirror to look past her collarbone as she stood still in the doorway. She didn’t want to see the look in Rio’s eyes.</p><p>She was a coward.</p><p>“Was it you?”</p><p>So Rio had seen. She knew.</p><p>And now she asked a simple question with a simple answer.</p><p>But Agatha closed her eyes as she gave it. She nodded her head just once as her grip tightened on the counter before her.</p><p>
<em>Coward.</em>
</p><p>She didn’t get a response.</p><p>Not until she felt soft hands against her sides and the ghost of a breath where her hair wasn’t covering her neck. She felt herself being turned around and allowed it, allowed Rio to turn her towards her fate, towards the moment of judgement. Because Rio was the only person she’d allow to deliver her sentence.</p><p>But nothing came.</p><p>Only the gentle push of hands against her sides pressing her back into the counter and the whispers of her fingers as they trailed down her hips, over her thighs and tickled the inside of her knees.</p><p>She opened her eyes finally to a sight that took her breath away.</p><p>Rio was kneeling before her on the hard tiles of the little bathroom, looking up at her as if she were a pilgrim come to worship at the feet of some forgotten goddess.</p><p>Agatha felt her heart swell and wondered if this were a cruel final act of mocking, one she’d never have expected of someone so kind, but one she thought she deserved.</p><p>But Rio’s left hand moved slowly up the back of her thigh and danced along the waistline of her cotton underwear as she kept her eyes on Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha dared to meet her gaze for the first time then and saw in Rio’s dark eyes something so tender that she felt her heart constrict further. It looked a lot like love.</p><p>Deft fingers moved upwards to hold Agatha’s thin t-shirt up a few inches and she leant in to press a gentle kiss to the skin below Agatha’s belly button, letting her tongue graze a line until she hit fabric again.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks had flushed a deep red at this and she felt her chest constrict more with desire as she held herself back from reaching for Rio, unsure still what this was, whether a final goodbye or a performance of what she would no longer be allowed to receive.</p><p>But Rio kept her eyes on Agatha, wide and steady as she grazed her teeth along the sensitive skin of Agatha’s abdomen and then sunk them into the top of her underwear, using her mouth to begin tugging them down and her free hand to slip under the fabric at her hip to help.</p><p>Agatha made a noise then, the first she’d made since Rio had entered the bathroom. She gasped as the cool air hit her cunt and was replaced almost instantly with the warm breath of the woman on her knees before her.</p><p>So close that it felt like torture. But still too far, always too far.</p><p>It felt like drowning, this slow and steady death at the hands of the only woman she knew she’d ever love.</p><p>Rio was worshipping her in a way she didn’t deserve; in a way she couldn’t comprehend. But Rio hadn’t looked away once, even as Agatha’s eyes began to fill with tears, she only opened her mouth and pressed it over Agatha’s pussy, and Agatha felt the reverberation of Rio’s moan pass through her as if it were her own.</p><p>Her body reacted before her brain could and she bucked her hips into Rio’s hot mouth, gasping again when Rio responded in kind and dragged her tongue through her, moaning again at the taste of her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha gasped, one hand reaching to bury in dark hair as she gazed down at the woman before her, fighting against rocking into every lap of Rio’s tongue as she swiped it back and forth through Agatha, dipping criminally lower each time to tease her entrance as her grip on her thigh tightened.</p><p>But Rio kept her gaze on Agatha as she devoured her, and Agatha was incapable of holding back much longer as Rio pressed harder into her and continued to moan with every slight movement of Agatha’s hips.</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” Agatha moaned again, her fingers now tugging at Rio’s hair, her chest flushed beneath her shirt that was still being held up by Rio over her stomach.</p><p>Rio’s tongue swiped a thick strip from her entrance to her clit as if in response to her name being spoken and she rewarded each buck of Agatha’s hips by tensing her tongue and swirling it firmly around Agatha’s swollen clit.</p><p>It felt like a dream she’d once had. A filthy, unholy dream where Agatha had used Rio’s mouth like it was made only for her. Like she could use it to absolve her sins, seeking absolution against her wanting tongue.</p><p>Only it was actually happening and Agatha couldn’t bring herself to stop it as Rio worshipped her desperately, moaning as she opened her mouth back against her and dipped back to her entrance to press into her, making Agatha see stars even as she stared down into eyes so dark they could have swallowed her whole.</p><p>Agatha felt the knot tighten in her abdomen beneath the warm hold of Rio’s hand and she choked out a sob as she lurched forward and came, bucking into Rio’s demanding mouth.</p><p>Her shirt fell back down again as Rio’s hold on it dropped and her hands went to grip Agatha’s thighs instead, holding her open for her as she continued to run her tongue through her, unwilling to pull back, apparently no longer needing oxygen when she had something far more life-affirming in its place.</p><p>But Agatha was panting heavily above her and her thighs quaked slightly as she began to pull at Rio’s head, indicating she wanted her up.</p><p>The devil in her told her to leave Rio on her knees, to enjoy it whilst she could. It whispered in her ear that this might be the last she got to enjoy of Rio’s attentions, that this was a final farewell, the last she’d get of Rio’s care.</p><p>But Rio was moving now, her tongue swirling one last time over Agatha’s clit before she began to press slow, unhurried kisses over Agatha’s thighs, across each hip, until she was simply brushing swollen wet lips up her abdomen, between the valley of her breasts as she held her t-shirt up again, bundling it below Agatha’s throat.</p><p>When Rio was back on her feet properly, one hand on Agatha’s shirt, the other holding her hip, Agatha caught sight of her dark eyes up close and sucked in a sharp breath, still waiting for that one, final, fatal blow.</p><p>But it didn’t come.</p><p>“Sit on the counter,” Rio rasped, her hands dropping again to Agatha’s thighs to help her do just that and Agatha obliged, even as her mind span with confusion, unsure what was happening.</p><p>She submitted to Rio in a way she never had before, unable to deny her anything, unable to take back the control she usually demanded.</p><p>Perhaps, in some dark recess of her brain, this was a final desperate plea to the woman now holding her legs open and pressing closer to her, a silent suggestion that she could be good for her, despite committing the very crime she’d said she wouldn’t.</p><p>But a stray tear had fallen from her eyes and she wiped at it quickly, narrowly missing brushing away Rio’s lips as they moved in to press over the place where the tear had been just a second ago.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha pleaded quietly, though for what, she didn’t know. Could she beg her to stay with her? Could she beg her to never leave? If she could find her voice she would. She would beg her to stay forever. Promise to be good. Promise to be better. But she couldn’t find the words and instead she watched Rio helplessly as her all-but wife dropped her gaze from her face and pushed her legs further open as she sat on the edge of the counter.</p><p>Agatha’s heart was performing a one track percussion solo in her chest and she didn’t understand why Rio was still close to her, still touching her, why her fingers trailed slowly along her inner thigh until they found her centre again and she swirled them slowly around her clit.</p><p>Another tear fell and Rio was faster this time, she leant in and tasted it on her tongue, pressing her lips to where she’d swallowed it and at the same time pushing down and into Agatha with two fingers, causing both of them to gasp, one from shock at the intrusion and the other from the feel of her wife squeezing her long fingers.</p><p>Rio was slow but firm as she thrust in and out of Agatha, making her feel every inch of her fingers as she pulled out almost to the tip every time and thrust back in desperately, curling them inwards with every sharp intake of breath and using her free hand to hold Agatha’s face, her thumb gently rubbing away the soft tears that were now continuing to fall.</p><p>But Rio’s breath was against Agatha’s lips and her face was pressed so close that Agatha could see that Rio was fighting back her own tears. Her dark eyes were filling with them but she looked determined to not let them fall and Agatha felt her chest constrict with fear again even as Rio stretched her with a third finger and her breath stuttered.</p><p>Rio was moving once more, her lips were now brushing down to her jaw, slipping away to her neck and Agatha tilted her head back, looking up to the ceiling as the tears fell across her cheeks with abandon and she held Rio’s head in place, fearful that if she let go she’d simply disappear.</p><p>Her hands buried possessively in dark hair and she whimpered a little when Rio’s thumb brushed across her sensitive clit and her hips bucked into her of their own accord.</p><p>But Rio kept her rhythm, her face now pressed fully into Agatha’s neck and her mouth just as hungry as it had been before. She was nipping and sucking, lavishing Agatha’s throat with attention. So much so that as Agatha cried silently Rio could taste her tears against her skin, and it made the process sloppier, her face and tongue covered in just <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s body rocked and quaked with each movement, torn between total mental anguish and total physical ecstasy. But Rio was determined, Rio was taking charge, and for the first time, unable to do anything other, Agatha fully let her, compliant and eager beneath her as she held her in place at her neck, her legs greedily spread open as much as possible to get Rio as close, as deep as she could.</p><p>Rio build her orgasm back up quickly, as determined as she was to feel Agatha break beneath her, determined for her to come undone again against her hand.</p><p>And Agatha did.</p><p>She came with a cry that turned into another choked sob and her body shook with the intensity of it as Rio sunk her teeth hard into her neck. So hard she almost broke skin.</p><p>But she released Agatha’s flesh from between her teeth and soothed the area with her tongue as she slowed her movements down against her, her own body beginning to shake as she stilled her hand, still buried deep within Agatha.</p><p>And Agatha held her breath as she fought to take back control of her body, her hands still clutching desperately at Rio to keep her close.</p><p>Because now it was over, now she’d been gifted two orgasms, surely Rio would be done. Surely she would pull away and walk from her life without looking back.</p><p>But nothing happened for a while.</p><p>The bathroom fell into silence as Rio panted harshly against Agatha’s hot, damp neck, and Agatha felt so dizzy from still holding her breath that she thought she might faint any moment.</p><p>But slipping into blackness might be preferable to what she considered to be inevitable now.</p><p>Rio was done with her. Her parting gift was to let Agatha see stars one last time because she was the sun, and she was leaving.</p><p>But it never happened.</p><p>Instead, Rio pulled her hand slowly from Agatha and Agatha whimpered uselessly as she did, ready to be abandoned where she sat perched on the counter of their shared vacation home.</p><p>Rio’s hand moved instead to Agatha’s side and she held her there so firmly Agatha had to open her lips to gasp for air at the shock of it, her lungs filling hungrily again as her vision had been fading to nothing.</p><p>And as she regained some sense of her body she felt it, she heard it.</p><p>It came at first as a faint tremble against her neck, at the hand that held her waist and her hip, at the body pressed against her own. The barely-there hitch of Rio’s breathing. The desperate, clawing movement of Rio trying to press herself closer, trying to hold Agatha harder. And then the unbidden, unembarrassed sobs of Rio Vidal, barely keeping herself together.</p><p>And Agatha, deep in the ninth circle of her own personal hell, was ripped from her own mind suddenly, forced to the surface again and faced with the utter collapse of Rio against her.</p><p>She moved with a strength she didn’t know she had, her arms reaching for Rio even as she struggled to slide from the counter and land on shaking legs.</p><p>But she made it, she had to.</p><p>She held Rio more firmly, enveloping her in her arms as she let her sob against her, let her breakdown in her strong hold.</p><p>“I love you I’m so sorry I love you I’m so sorry,” she repeated over and over again until the whispered words blended into one another and her lips against dark hair simply stopped uttering them, and she breathed Rio in hungrily, constricting her as much as she could, desperate to hold her so close.</p><p>So Agatha stood, with her wife so tight and safe in her arms and though it was Rio clutching desperately at her, still sobbing uncontrollably into her neck, it was Agatha who felt broken.</p><p>She held Rio for so long and so tightly that her arms burned with the ache of it by the time Rio’s breathing had begun to even out, and her hands were no longer clawing, but instead curled tightly into the fabric of Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>The pain was so exquisite that Agatha felt like she couldn’t breathe again although she’d been forcing oxygen into her lungs, for the sake of the woman who needed her standing, needed her holding her, and needed her alive in order to do so.</p><p>Tense and hurting, it took Agatha a second to realise that Rio was pulling back, that she was gently leaning away, gasping as she took deep breaths, now not buried against Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Her face was puffy and red and her eyes were more bloodshot than she’d feared. Far from the tender, loving gaze from before, Rio was now looking at her hopelessly, as if her own worst fears had been realised.</p><p>And Agatha loosened her hold more to pull back and wipe at Rio’s soaked cheeks, not daring to kiss them like she wanted, but still providing as much tender care as she thought she’d be allowed.</p><p>“I can’t,” Rio began slowly, her voice croaky as Agatha stroked back her hair and wiped at the tear tracks along her jaw. “I can’t lose you. Why did you? Agatha why did you do it?”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t speak again, so sure that Rio was going to leave her still, so convinced that she had sacrificed everything to keep her safe and she’d lose her because of it.</p><p>But Rio’s face had crumpled once more and she began to cry silently as she placed her forehead down on Agatha’s chest, clutching at her front this time and trying to bury closer.</p><p>Her body almost reacting before her brain could, Agatha ducked down as best she could and knocked Rio’s knees out from below her, tucking her legs around her waist and lowering them both steadily to the floor, using one hand on the counter to steady herself as she sank them both down.</p><p>It was a risky move, because Agatha’s legs felt like jelly and she still hadn’t received enough oxygen in her lungs, her breathing still shallow, her body almost reluctant to give her the breath it needed to continue.</p><p>But once settled against the cold tiles, she wrapped herself around Rio again and buried her face into dark hair, nuzzling gently into her neck.</p><p>But she didn’t cry this time, wouldn’t allow herself the indulgence of it when Rio was so vulnerable against her. She simply held on silently, giving Rio the time she needed to gather herself, to find her words again.</p><p>And they came, not long after: “They will find out. There will be an investigation. They will find you. I will lose you.”</p><p>Agatha filled her lungs again, forcing a slow deep breath in and an even slower one out as she pulled away from the safety of Rio’s skin and she whispered, “They won’t. I promise you that I wouldn’t have done it if… I just needed you safe. I wanted to keep you safe.”</p><p>Rio had pulled back again and was shaking her head, her hands flexing and unflexing their grip on the front of Agatha’s shirt, “I asked you not to. I <em>told</em> you not to.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said quietly, dropping her gaze from Rio’s heart-broken face to stare down at her shoulder.</p><p>She took another few slow breaths before she voiced the thing that sat between them, that had so twisted itself in Agatha’s mind that it felt like an inevitability, rather than a fear.</p><p>“You can have whatever you want. I’ll give you enough money that you never have to work again and so that you can always have enough, always be safe, and do the things that make you happy. And I won’t hold anything against you. I won’t ever blame you. I did this to keep you safe and I knew that in doing so I would lose you but I’d rather have you safe and not with me than with me and unsafe. So take it. Take everything if you want. Take-…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes had darted everywhere but Rio’s face as she’d spoken her truth. Her horrible, nightmarish belief that Rio would take from her and run rather than stay. But Rio’s eyes hadn’t faltered once. In fact, she hadn’t even blinked.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was still uneven and it hitched every so often as she fought to calm herself, but her eyes, they never once left swirling pools of deepest blue as Agatha looked anywhere but at her.</p><p>“I love you. I’ve told you and <em>told</em> you. I just want you. I just want…”</p><p>But Agatha’s gaze had moved back to Rio’s and Rio paused at the sight of blue eyes filling with tears again and her shaking hands raised to graze her thumbs just below them, barring any more tears from falling down flushed cheeks.</p><p>“You could never do anything that would make me leave you.”</p><p>Rio Vidal, good, kind, easy-going Rio Vidal who liked to follow rules and play basketball in ten-year old sneakers and owned more plants than most people had hot dinners in a year was more than Agatha had ever thought she deserved.</p><p>And yet she was here.</p><p>She was constantly rewriting the synapses in Agatha’s brain to make them calmer, make them more gentle to their owner. She was constantly there, constantly loving, constantly forgiving.</p><p>And Agatha didn’t believe she deserved it. But Rio’s words reignited the fire in her that told her she was hers. That she <em>wanted</em> to be hers.</p><p>And so Agatha nodded slowly, swallowing a heavy gulp and squeezing Rio with her aching arms as she stared up at her, unsure what to do or to say, but knowing there was so much that needed to be said and done.</p><p>So she let Rio take the lead again and remained still as she leant in to kiss her softly, tasting their mingled tears on plump lips.</p><p>Rio pressed herself closer and exhaled slowly into Agatha’s parted lips, but Agatha couldn’t bring herself to close the distance again, she wasn’t sure she deserved to, not yet.</p><p>Agatha’s arms constricted around Rio as she held her as close as she could and Rio gasped a little at the pressure to her ribs.</p><p>“You killed her,” she whispered, “you had her killed.”</p><p>Agatha only nodded, unable to look away from Rio, feeling the warmth of her words against her lips which, despite the heaviness of them, lightened the load of her treacherous mind that had so convinced her Rio would leave. But it was still there, still whispering in her ear that she still might, that the reality of what she’d done would hit soon and Rio would realise that she couldn’t stay.</p><p>“For me?”</p><p>The question was so quiet, so timid, that Agatha felt the lump in her throat again, almost preventing her from being able to respond. But she nodded as she traced the familiar lines and curves of Rio’s face, watching for her reaction with that same fear of abandonment.</p><p>“Everything for you,” she murmured, hoping it would be enough, hoping Rio might understand.</p><p>And Rio nodded too even as she pulled away slightly, her dark eyes closing as she focused on her confusing, conflicting thoughts.</p><p>With Rio’s eyes now shut, Agatha had the opportunity to gaze at her properly, to watch the slight furrow in her brow that told her Rio was trying to process and the way her lips parted which told her she was concentrating hard. She counted each new freckle across her cheeks and nose in the time it took Rio to open her eyes again, and in doing so convinced herself again she would never again get the opportunity to be this close.</p><p>But Rio was looking at her now, her hands moving to hold Agatha’s jaw and her thumbs reaching to brush across her lips as she shifted in place, tightening her legs around Agatha’s hips.</p><p>“I need some time to think.”</p><p>The words were like a bullet to Agatha’s brain.</p><p>The sudden, shock of a freight train charging through a station.</p><p>But she couldn’t do anything about it. She couldn’t say anything. This was what she’d been expecting, <em>better</em> than she’d been expecting, in fact. Rio was considering her options. And at least in her considerations, Agatha was one option.</p><p>But Rio’s words and her body language were two very different things, and Agatha wasn’t in her right mind so couldn’t read the conflict in them.</p><p>Because the reality was that Rio had fallen to her knees for Agatha only minutes before, because the idea that she’d killed for her made her want her inexplicably. It made her body burn for Agatha in a way she hadn’t experienced before. But her logical mind, what little she could grasp onto, as she stared into hopeless blue eyes, was telling her to calm herself, to take a second away from the temptation, the magnetic pull of Agatha.</p><p>But she couldn’t make her body move.</p><p>And so Agatha kept her hold strong around Rio, desperately holding her to her in the vain hope that they might just be able to stay like that forever.</p><p>Half a minute passed, then a minute, and Agatha’s tears began to fall silently again, brushed away by dutiful motions of Rio’s thumbs.</p><p>Then two minutes went by, and though Agatha was still crying, Rio leant in and pressed her face against Agatha’s neck, breathing her in deeply and tangling her fingers in the lopsided, messy bun that now barely contained Agatha’s hair.</p><p>The gentle reminder of Rio’s breathing against her neck began to calm Agatha down slowly but she still held on for dear life, afraid at any moment Rio would have enough and pull away.</p><p>But Rio was loving again, pressing her face closer and pressing a kiss to Agatha’s throat, before she pulled back and she sat gazing down at Agatha with a soft frown, the tear tracks on her own face now dry as she swallowed thickly and then said: “I thought about killing her too. But with my bare hands. So often. Almost every day for weeks. Watching her smug smile fade as I…”</p><p>Rio stopped herself and dropped her gaze, looking down between them and running her hands along the soft fabric of her old T-shirt that Agatha still wore.</p><p>Agatha was holding her breath again, because where Rio had thought about it, she had been the one to actually do it. And those were two very different things.</p><p>“You must be uncomfortable,” Rio said softly, her gaze still down on Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She made to move and Agatha denied her for a second, squeezing her in her hold before she relented and allowed Rio to stand from her lap.</p><p>In a direct reverse of earlier, Agatha now looked up at Rio like she were a desperate believer seeking the blessings of this beatified saint. She didn’t move, didn’t even shift to make herself more comfortable where she sat exposed against the cool, hard tiles.</p><p>She simply looked up at Rio and allowed her to reach out her hand to her, seeing her frown when Agatha didn’t take it, her fingers waiting, wriggling cautiously in front of her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha managed to croak out, her throat almost seizing up as she stared up at her, “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>But Rio’s hand was steady where it was held out to Agatha, her wriggling fingers halting as she turned her hand to her and she offered instead her palm, like an old timey gentleman, offering a hand to help a lady step from a carriage.</p><p>Agatha took the hand cautiously, allowing herself to be pulled to her feet.</p><p>“Are you safe?” Rio asked quietly, her hand still holding Agatha’s, her eyes wide again, and Agatha only nodded, fighting off the desire to pull Rio to her like she would under any other circumstance.</p><p>But she didn’t need to because Rio was pulling her closer instead, reaching with her free hand to pull Agatha’s head down and against her so she could envelope her fully, hold her properly.</p><p>And Agatha gave up on her fears because Rio hadn’t for a second given up on her. And she began to cry silently against the neck she’d spent hours pressed up against when sleeping at night, spent minutes of each day kissing and lavishing attention to, the neck of the woman she’d been so afraid of losing that she’d arranged for another neck to be broken so she could keep her Rio, her wife, safe. She cried not for what she’d done, but for Rio still being there, still loving her.</p><p>And Rio held her through it, just as Agatha had held her.</p><p>When Agatha had just about managed to catch her breath again, the soft strokes of Rio’s fingers through her hair were the first thing she noticed, the second was the hand that had slipped below her shirt that was running up and down her spine, and the third were Rio’s soft whispers to her in Spanish: “Te amo, mi amor. Te tengo.”  <em>I love you. I’ve got you.</em></p><p>The tendrils of shame and fear that had claimed her in childhood steadily relinquished their hold on Agatha’s brain at the feel of the woman holding her being so tender, so soft for her. They would come back, they always would, but Rio was working her magic again and although Agatha didn’t know it yet, one day, in the not so distant future, Agatha would never again second guess whether Rio would stay, because she’d always be sure she would be there.</p><p>Rio, atuned to Agatha after so many months of studying her and now so many weeks with her constantly, began to slowly pull away, dipping her head down to capture soft lips in a tender kiss.</p><p>Agatha returned it for the first time that morning and whimpered a little when Rio pulled away, watching with cautious eyes as she smiled softly and her hands moved to dry damp cheeks.</p><p>“I wish you’d told me.”</p><p>“I thought you’d try and stop me.”</p><p>“I would have.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and released a slow breath, allowing for the first time her hold on Rio to relax a little even as she felt Rio press closer to her, brush their lips together, “I can’t face everyone yet. They’re all…”</p><p>She trailed off and Agatha’s eyes fluttered open to see hesitance for the first time in Rio’s eyes that day as she dropped her gaze and moved her hands down to the bottom of Agatha’s borrowed t-shirt, twisting the fabric in her hands, and dropping her gaze to look down at them.</p><p>“Rio, if you need some time… I can disappear.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly, her eyes snapping back up again, “no, I don’t want you far. Stay right here, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and for the first time that day made the first move, reaching down to take Rio’s hands in her own, and raising them to kiss each knuckle in turn, her eyes closing again as she placed one, lingering kiss to the back of Rio’s left hand.</p><p>“You’re so fucking stupid,” Rio whispered, her eyes filling rapidly with tears again as she smiled incredulously at Agatha and Agatha for a heart-stopping second imagined cruelty in Rio’s words when there was none. But then she saw her smile and she relaxed again.</p><p>She nuzzled her face against Rio’s hand before turning it over to kiss her palm, pressing gentle kisses in a trail from her inner wrist up her arm until she hit the fabric of her t-shirt and then she moved up to kiss at Rio’s jaw, her arms encircling her waist to pull her close again, pressing her face in against Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“I thought you would leave.”</p><p>“And you did it anyway?”</p><p>“I’d rather have you alive than-…”</p><p>“The threat changed?”</p><p>Rio’s words were quieter than before and Agatha breathed out slowly, reluctant to speak the truth like this, half naked in a bathroom.</p><p>So she pulled back and took Rio’s hand to pull her back through to the bedroom, and Rio followed her, her stomach tying in knots at the clear signal that Agatha was more reassured and was confident now in her touches on Rio, her gentle manoeuvring of her body about the space.</p><p>Agatha guided Rio to the bed, her gaze down, her hands gentle but firm, as she directed Rio to sit back against the headboard and she crouched before her, moving Rio’s legs to wrap around her waist so she could crowd her into the headboard, already sliding her hands underneath Rio’s sleep shorts and pressing her face into her damp neck.</p><p>Holding Rio like this, Agatha felt like she could finally breathe again, and that doing so was no longer a chore.</p><p>Rio arched her back a little and slid her hips forwards so she was flush against Agatha, tangling her fingers in wild hair before she simply removed the hair tie keeping half of it up and she held Agatha’s head against her, finding her own peace in Agatha now fully taking control of holding her, finally no longer reticent.</p><p>They held each other like that for a while before Rio finally spoke, her desire for answers overcoming her need to focus in on just Agatha.</p><p>“Was Natasha involved?”</p><p>Agatha had been ready for this question all morning, even before she knew Rio wasn’t going to walk away. But all the same, when it came, she tensed a little and pulled away, wanting to see Rio’s reaction to what she knew she’d already guessed.</p><p>“Yes. But,” she was quick to reassure, “But she’s safe too. I promise.”</p><p>Rio frowned but nodded, feeling no more reassured by this, knowing Agatha could still be found at the centre of it all.</p><p>“Alice?” Rio asked cautiously, her hand moving to brush a stray strand of hair from Agatha’s face.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said softly, leaning into Rio’s touch with a slight frown.</p><p>Rio nodded again and traced her index finger along Agatha’s jaw until it rested lightly in the dimple on her chin and settled there as she spoke her next question, perhaps the most important one: “How do you feel?”</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly, taken aback by this line of questioning, but then she settled, her shoulders hunching a little as she leant towards Rio, her fingers twitching against her hips beneath her cotton shorts.</p><p>“Undeserving,” Agatha breathed put, feeling the tightness in her chest again as Rio moved to cradle her face.</p><p>“You deserve the world.”</p><p>“I don’t want the world. I want you.”</p><p>“You have me.”</p><p>And perhaps to seal her promise, perhaps because she’d seen that Agatha still looked pained, Rio closed the distance between them and pressed a slow kiss to Agatha’s lips and she relinquished herself of the dark secret of her soul: “When I saw what you’d done,” she whispered against Agatha’s parted lips and Agatha’s breath hitched slightly, as she continued: “I wanted you so badly. I wanted you and I continue to want you and I…”</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t comprehend what she was hearing and so she leant in and kissed Rio softly, checking she would kiss back, checking she wouldn’t pull away.</p><p>And she didn’t.</p><p>Rio whimpered into the kiss that Agatha controlled, and she gripped her beneath her shorts, her tongue forcing its way into Rio’s mouth and moaning at the taste of her.</p><p>Lips and teeth and tongue weren’t enough anymore, Agatha felt insane with her desire for Rio, her body finally waking up to her chaotic mind and she began forcing her hand into the middle section of Rio’s shorts. But Rio had pulled back just before Agatha had got to where she wanted to be.</p><p>She pressed at Agatha’s chest and shook her head as her chest heaved with the intensity of the kiss.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured, her eyes still closed and her hips rocking ever so slightly even as Agatha’s hand had stilled, cautious that Rio pulling away from her meant she should stop.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers flexed desperately beneath the cotton of Rio’s shorts, resting in a safe zone at the apex of Rio’s thigh, her fingertips just peaking past her waistband.</p><p>Her mouth opened and closed a couple times before she gave up on words and instead dipped her head to kiss Rio’s jaw, then rested her forehead against her cheek, “Tell me this won’t change anything between us. That we’ll be okay. Please.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t say anything in response, instead reaching for Agatha’s hand below her waistband, turning it so she was palm up and pressing it against her naked core. And Agatha felt how wet she was, she realised how desperate she must be feeling and she moaned as Rio whimpered softly, her hips rocking for some friction.</p><p>“What you’ve done,” Rio said huskily as Agatha began to take charge again, sliding her fingers through Rio’s soaked folds until she found her entrance. “It’s made me… I can’t explain it. I want you, I want you, I want you-ah!”</p><p>Agatha had pressed into her without warning, her own desire taking over her rational mind as she reached her free hand to Rio’s throat, holding her there loosely, and feeling Rio rock against her desperately.</p><p>“You’re soaked,” Agatha choked out, rapidly losing any pretence of cool as she pressed harder into Rio, meeting each rock of her hips with her hand.</p><p>When Rio whined Agatha felt insane with desire and she pressed a third finger into her, meeting almost no resistance with how wet Rio was for her.</p><p>Rio was so needy and frantic above her that Agatha briefly wondered if she could leave her for a second to grab a strap. Her biggest one. The one she used when feeling particularly possessive.</p><p>But Rio was already close, she could tell, and making her come from just a couple of minutes of fucking her with her fingers wasn’t something she wanted to interrupt.</p><p>Her pace was brutal, but Rio’s whines and shouted moans told her it was exactly what Rio needed and she forced an orgasm from her in barley any time at all.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were closed and her breathing fluttered erratically against Agatha’s lips but her hips rocked greedily still against Agatha’s hand, her fingers now still inside her.</p><p>“God,” Rio muttered as Agatha was rendered mute, her eyes wide and staring at Rio’s rosey cheeks, her swollen lips, her tear-stained face.</p><p>“Don’t pull out.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched inside Rio, feeling her clench around them and she moaned softly as Rio’s hips began to pick up the pace, now gyrating rhythmically as Agatha found her voice again.</p><p>“Rio, I…”</p><p>But she swallowed and was unable to speak as her thumb swiped over Rio’s clit, testing her sensitivity. Rio moaned and her eyes opened, hooded and heavy and full of unshed tears.</p><p>“Did you do it for me?</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly, her gaze falling to Rio’s open lips, unable to think straight as she did.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio groaned a little and Agatha looked back up, her free hand now at Rio’s hip to help her as she began to move her fingers inside of her, meeting every rock of Rio’s hips with practised strength.</p><p>“Tell me,” Rio whispered, her breathing picking up again. Those large brown eyes boring into Agatha’s very soul as she clutched at her head, her nails digging into Agatha’s scalp.</p><p>“I did it for you.”</p><p>A solitary tear fell from Rio’s left eye but she didn’t blink, didn’t attempt to wipe it even as deep blue eyes followed its path down to her jaw.</p><p>“Agatha… Agatha what did you do for me?”</p><p>A primitive, possessive monster that lived inside Agatha reared it’s head. It growled and made Agatha push harder, press deeper as she responded: “I killed for you.”</p><p>“F-fuck,” Rio gasped quietly, her mouth opening fully to try to capture the air she couldn’t quite get and her hips bucking erratically with every movement of Agatha’s fingers and the thumb against her clit.</p><p>She moaned and arched as her orgasm crashed over her again, but this time… this time…</p><p>“Holy fuck,” Agatha breathed as her fingers stuttered where they were still buried in Rio and she dropped her gaze from her magnificent, otherworldly wife to look at the wet patch clear as day across the cotton shorts Rio still sported.</p><p>“Did you just…?”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and began to grimace as she became far too sensitive for Agatha’s attentions and she reached quickly to hold her forearm to get her to stop. “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha raised her gaze back up to meet Rio’s eyes and saw that she looked shy, her large brown eyes darting about before daring to meet her gaze again.</p><p>“Have you ever…?”</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly, groaning as Agatha slowly pulled out of her and shifting her hips to chase the feeling before she settled again, her hand still firm over Agatha’s flexed forearm.</p><p>“If all it took to make you squirt was for me to kill someone then baby, I…”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio said quickly, her eyes flashing with something other than the unbidden desire they’d been swallowed by.</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t help the grin that was growing across her lips and the fire of pride that had settled in her chest, overwhelming anything else that was threatening to dampen it.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes a little and huffed a soft breath against Agatha’s lips as she pressed their foreheads together but Agatha couldn’t just leave it there and so she pressed a soft kiss to the corner of Rio’s lips, hovering there until she felt sure she wouldn’t be denied and then turning her head more to kiss Rio more fully, moaning into her mouth as she tangled their tongues together.</p><p>When she pulled away she murmured, “That was so fucking hot.”</p><p>Rio only pressed herself closer, her damp shorts now fully against Agatha’s stomach where she’d moved her hand away to hold Rio’s waist and her long fingers tangled in the hair at the back of Agatha’s head as she mumbled, “You’re an idiot.”</p><p>And for a second, as Agatha laughed and Rio looked like she was trying not to, they were just two fools in love again.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha admitted softly, squeezing Rio’s hips and kissing her again, trying to let her know that she was remorseful, that she was so fucking sorry, that she just wanted them to be okay.</p><p>But Rio didn’t seem to want to know any of that. She seemed okay just being close, unashamedly pressing herself against Agatha, her hands now sinking to her neck as her eyes roamed over her face.</p><p>“I hate that you did it. I hate that you didn’t tell me. I hate that you could be caught. I hate that you’re now a-…” But clearly Rio hated it so much that she couldn’t even bring herself to say it: <em>murderer</em>.</p><p>Agatha hid her face against Rio’s neck, unable to look her in the eye, unable to watch her expression as she emphasised everything Agatha had been so fearful of. Her grip on Rio’s shirt tightened.</p><p>“But I love you for it. Does that make sense?”</p><p>It didn’t. None of it made sense. Nothing had made sense since she met Rio. The only thing she knew, that she was sure of, was that she loved her. Unconditionally. Unequivocally. Undeniably.</p><p>She pulled away slowly, letting the question hang between them. Raising her gaze, she saw Rio’s eyes had filled with tears again and her lip was caught between her teeth.</p><p>She looked vulnerable once more, scared out of her mind again.</p><p>And so Agatha didn’t say anything and only leant in to press a gentle kiss to her cheek.</p><p>“I love you. So much.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as Agatha looked up at her and curled herself in more to rest her forehead on Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha cradled her as she’d cradled her on the bathroom floor earlier, but this time was different. This time Agatha held her head in place and wrapped her arms securely around her lower back, her vocal demons now dormant, silenced by Rio’s steadiness.</p><p>When Rio eventually pulled away she looked a little calmer, a little more like herself. She pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s lips and then began to pull away, slipping from Agatha’s hold, encouraging Agatha to follow her to the shower.</p><p>Agatha moved with Rio, sucked into her orbit without protest or question. She stripped them both silently before and stepping beneath the waterfall shower head.</p><p>Agatha pressed Rio gently against the wall and allowed her to cradle her face, feeling her soft gaze against her like a caress. And her heart stuttered as Rio’s right hand slipped down, brushing along her skin until it curled across her ribs, right above her heart.</p><p>“I want you to tell me everything. Every detail. Every thought that went through your head. Everything that led you to this, okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to agree but she knew she had no choice.</p><p>They washed each other with a tenderness that made Agatha ache for Rio, and she was reluctant to step from under the stream of hot water, knowing the conversation that was to come would be one of the hardest of her life.</p><p>They moved in tandem then like two predators circling the other as they went to dry off and change. Agatha felt the emptiness of her hands like it was unnatural for her not to be touching or holding Rio. But she forced herself to focus on drying herself, on putting on clothes, on continuing to breathe.</p><p>Within twenty minutes she was on the large white couch, and Rio was on the one opposite, and she felt every inch of that distance so keenly that she could barely think of anything else.</p><p>Rio had made them both coffee and had placed her own phone on the table between them, her large, chocolate eyes on Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s hair was damp and scrapped back into a low bun, her makeup free face more beautiful than ever, her fingers fidgeting in her lap.</p><p>“From the beginning.”</p><p>And so Agatha told her.</p><p>She told her how Natasha had text her not two weeks ago to tell her she needed to speak to her, but not to tell Rio. She’d then called when Rio had gone to the bookshop that afternoon and Natasha had told her she’d been continuing to monitor Wanda’s movements and had used her network to find out that Rio’s name had been mentioned in rooms where no one wanted to hear their name.</p><p>She’d had her worst fears realised when Natasha told her that Abigail had dropped Wanda and it was clear she was retaliating; chumming shark-infested waters with the meat of Rio’s name. Wanda had been left out in the cold with nothing but paranoia and delusions of grandeur.</p><p>She told her that she was now reckless, and angry.</p><p>She told her exactly where Rio’s name had been whispered: in a basement on 3rd and 12th, a place where names didn’t surface unless someone wanted them buried.</p><p>She told her that in one conversation with Natasha it had become clear to her that the only way out was for Wanda to be silenced. Totally.</p><p>She told her how she’d called again the next day, and Natasha had confirmed she could get everything arranged with a quick transfer to the right bank account.</p><p>She told her how she continued living with Rio, keeping her secret because in doing so she was keeping Rio alive, keeping her with her, until the day she’d find out, and would inevitably leave.</p><p>She told her that it was a car crash that had taken Wanda from this world into the next. That Natasha had text her at midnight that day to confirm their plan had been a success, and she’d never felt so sure that she had done the right thing, but feared the consequences - Rio leaving her - might be too much to bear.</p><p>The whole time Rio watched her with a steady gaze, her hands tucked demurely in her lap and her lip between her teeth.</p><p>Agatha finished her tale and she kept her gaze across on Rio, watching her every movement, every flicker of emotion that fell across her features. Her heavy-lidded eyes gave nothing away and Agatha felt paralysed beneath her stare, waiting on the final verdict.</p><p>“A car crash?”</p><p>And Agatha knew this might trigger Rio, knowing that was how her parents had died, and she twitched forwards slightly as if to jump across to her but held herself back.</p><p>“Yes. It was the least suspicious way to go.”</p><p>“Was anyone else hurt?”</p><p>“No. She was alone.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, her gaze moving from Agatha’s face to the rings on her hand and then down to the floor as she processed.</p><p>“Have you spoken to anyone yet? Natasha? Jen and Alice?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I should call Natasha.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to speak but Rio had already moved, snatching up her phone as she went. She disappeared to the kitchen and rummaged in a drawer to find her cigarettes and lighter before she stepped out into the heat of the morning and called her best friend.</p><p>Agatha stared ahead of her, going over every detail of the story she’d just told and trying to identify the pieces that might be the most painful or frustrating for Rio to hear.</p><p>But Rio was gone longer than she expected.</p><p>And in the time to herself Agatha reached out to her own friends, seeing that Alice had called her thirty seven times, Jen twenty six, Billy eleven, and Lilia just once.</p><p>She called Alice first, trusting she might be more rational.</p><p>She answered within one ring.</p><p>“Where the fuck have you been? I can’t even get Rio. I can <em>always</em> get Rio. Are you okay? Are you both <em>alive</em>?”</p><p>“We’re fine. Rio’s fine.”</p><p>“What’s going on, Agatha? This secrecy bullshit is driving me insane.”</p><p>“There are no secrets. We’re-….”</p><p>“Bullshit. We’re coming to see you.”</p><p>“We’re fine, Alice.”</p><p>“Wanda is dead and you have been off grid for weeks now.”</p><p>“It’s been a difficult morning.”</p><p>“Yeah, no shit. What the fuck is going on?”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>There was a noise on the other end of the line then and Agatha knew Jen was getting involved. Alice was silent for a while and then:</p><p>“We’ll fly out as soon as possible.”</p><p>“You really don't-…”</p><p>“It’s non-negotiable.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Hey, are you okay? Actually okay?”</p><p>“You know we are.”</p><p>“I don’t actually. When something likes this happens you call your best friends. You can’t be so off grid that-…”</p><p>“We needed some time.”</p><p>Alice sighed and somewhere in the background Agatha heard Jen shout something that sounded a lot like: “Tell that bitch we’re coming to celebrate the death of her fucking ex and she can thank us for it.”</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t really concentrating anymore because Rio had returned, looking a little more relaxed than when she’d left and she walked over, the faint scent of smoke lingering about her. “Is that Alice?”</p><p>Agatha nodded silently and bit her lip before speaking into the phone, “Rio’s here.”</p><p>“Tell her we’re coming. Tell her to slap your face.”</p><p>Agatha pulled the phone away from her mouth a little and spoke up at Rio again. “Alice and Jen are flying out. Alice says she can’t wait to see you.”</p><p>Rio smiled slightly and perched on the edge of the coffee table before Agatha. “Nat’s coming too.”</p><p>“Did you hear that?”</p><p>“I’ll warn Jen.”</p><p>Agatha nodded into the phone, her eyes still on Rio as she twirled a piece of hair around her finger.</p><p>Agatha hung up after a quick goodbye and placed her phone down on the couch.</p><p>“Is it sensible to have Jen and Natasha under the same roof?”</p><p>“Why? Are you worried someone might get murdered?”</p><p>“That’s not funny.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched a little but she didn’t seem to find it that funny either and she held her hand out to Agatha, letting her entwine their fingers.</p><p>“Is Alice okay?”</p><p>“She’s pissed.”</p><p>“I have about thirty missed calls from her. Even Jen’s tried to call me.”</p><p>“Did Lilia call?”</p><p>“Once. At about three am.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and shifted to the edge of the couch, moving her free hand to Rio’s bare knee, “Did Natasha…?”</p><p>“She wouldn't speak openly on the phone.”</p><p>The prospect of having to share Rio again didn’t exactly fill Agatha with joy but it was the least of her concerns given the belief she’d sat with for hours since she had confirmation that the deed had been done, that Rio would leave.</p><p>And Agatha could handle that, because Rio would still be here. And she always would be, now she had made the ultimate move to keep her safe.</p><p>“How are you feeling?”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze then, and Agatha felt the guilt settle in her stomach because Rio had been living a quiet life, an easy life that she enjoyed, and then Agatha had swept in with all her chaos and baggage and she’d thrown Rio to the wolves - willingly or not.</p><p>“I feel…”</p><p>Rio’s eyes moved slowly to Agatha’s hand still on her knee and she moved her free hand to rest over it, before she raised her gaze to look Agatha in the eye as she said: “I feel like I’m in some crazy nightmare. But that I can’t wake up from it because waking up means you’re not there.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she watched Rio’s brow furrow, a look of dawning realisation on her face. “I’d burn in hell if it kept you by my side.”</p><p>“I’d make hell freeze over before I let the flames touch you.”</p><p>Rio smiled just a little, and Agatha watched her nose scrunch cutely, emphasising the light freckles that had appeared there from hours of Bajan sun.</p><p>“I wish I’d met you years ago. I wish-…”</p><p>But Rio had placed her fingers over Agatha’s mouth to silence her and had leant in slightly, “We met when we met. And now we have the rest of our lives to be together.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted beneath Rio’s gentle touch and she saw dark eyes drop to them, soon replacing them with her lips and Agatha dropped to her knees before Rio as she broke the kiss, draping her arms across Rio’s thighs and looking up at her with a bright eyes.</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio cooed softly, her fingers trailing along the lines of Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>Agatha smiled a little, enjoying the soft attentions of her soft Rio.</p><p>The rest of the day was spent in a daze. Both women completely absorbed in their own minds and fears, but both unable to be far from the other. And they spent their time more entangled than ever.</p><p>Having not slept at all the night before, Rio eventually managed to convince Agatha to sleep in the early afternoon. She offered herself as a human pillow, letting Agatha spread out on top of her and bury her sleeping face against her chest.</p><p>During this time, Rio properly went through her phone, reading every article on the death of Wanda Maximoff: CEO of Maximoff Industries.</p><p>
<em>Wanda Maximoff: Dead at 40</em>
</p><p>
<em>Red Dead: Maximoff Dies In Fiery Crash</em>
</p><p>She responded to the texts she had from her friends, and made sure they all knew she was safe and okay, but eventually put her phone down again, focusing instead on the familiar weight of Agatha, who even in her sleep had a firm grip on her collar.</p><p>When Agatha woke, she felt like she’d been hit by a truck, which was ironic, she thought.</p><p>But she felt groggy and almost like she had a hangover. She didn’t move for a while from where she lay on top of Rio and focused on her steady breathing and the hand tucked against the small of her back.</p><p>When she finally did stir properly, she pushed up to gaze down at Rio, nudging their noses together and scanning over her face, making sure she what been okay in the time she’d slept.</p><p>But Rio just smiled, remained reassuring, remained close.</p><p>Natasha arrived in the late evening, looking tired and hot, wearing black in the heat clearly being an oversight on her part. But Rio greeted her enthusiastically, enveloping her in a hug that lasted for longer than Agatha would have liked but for less than she could make a fuss about.</p><p>Agatha and Natasha, under Rio’s careful gaze, greeted each other like shy children might, unsure of how to do so, but settling for a quick hug that barely involved any touching at all.</p><p>Over the past two weeks Agatha had spoken to Natasha more often than ever before, and she’d found her to be quiet and confident in a way that she respected.</p><p>But still, when Natasha was in the room Agatha couldn’t help but feel she was vying for the top spot in Rio’s life, as juvenile as that may be.</p><p>The atmosphere was tense again, having calmed recently as both Rio and Agatha had fallen back into their usual comfort in each other.</p><p>And in Rio Agatha saw the pain and frustration that had been filed away from the morning, but never killed completely. Guilt flooded back to her and she could barely look her in the eye.</p><p>Natasha brought with her a reminder of what had happened and what Rio had been questioning again and again through the day: would they be safe.</p><p>And so the three of them sat scattered across the two large couches in the living area. Rio’s music was playing softly in the background, and Agatha found herself focusing on the soft melody rather than the distance that was currently between herself and Rio, who sat opposite, so she had full view of the two people who had changed her life completely.</p><p>“Tell me how safe this is again. You this time, Tasha. Every detail.”</p><p>Natasha glanced at Agatha before looking to Rio and raised her brows, “It’s not necessary for you to know-…”</p><p>“It is. You two did this behind my back. And now I need to know how locked down this is. So I don’t spend the rest of my life thinking that I’ll lose you both.”</p><p>“You won’t.”</p><p>“Then reassure me.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze from Rio, choosing instead to focus on her knees, as she continued to tap her fingers against the arm of the chair.</p><p>“I used Rick. He got me out of-… I trust him with my life. He owed me one anyway and so he was willing to do it. She had some gas-guzzler of a car and so it just took a couple cuts in the right places, and that was it. She had a late dinner up in the Hamptons and she was so paranoid she’d fired her driver so she took herself. The brakes wore out halfway there and… it was done.”</p><p>“The money? Agatha’s money? That can be traced.”</p><p>“I took the money out. Paid in cash. The only transfer was from Agatha to me.”</p><p>“Agatha’s name?”</p><p>“Not mentioned.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her gaze on Natasha for a while before she turned to Agatha, watching her with a desperate look on her face. “It can’t be that simple.”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“No,” Rio insisted and Agatha noticed her fingers twisting in her lap, her body now tense, “no, there must be some way they can tie it back to you.”</p><p>“There isn’t,” Natasha reassured from across the couch, moving to lean forwards against her knees. “Rio, trust that we’ve made sure no one will-…”</p><p>“You cannot just take a life and expect it to be fine. To get away with it.”</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said quietly, “I promise that this will never be something you have to worry about.”</p><p>“Too late,” Rio snapped, “Because you’ve both taken it upon yourselves to treat me like a-…”</p><p>But she stopped and Agatha shifted forwards where she sat, her heart thumping erratically in her chest as she watched Rio try to calm her own racing heart.</p><p>“Rio, do you think Agatha would willingly have put herself in the position where she might have to leave you? She wouldn’t. She-…”</p><p>But she stopped talking suddenly because Rio had released a sob and Agatha had flown so quickly from her seat that she almost tripped over the coffee table. She swooped in like a bat out of hell and pulled Rio against her, tugging her until she released her hands from her face and curled into her.</p><p>The soft feel of the couch dipping close by told Agatha that Natasha had moved over but her eyes were closed and her head dipped towards Rio so she didn’t see the gentle hand that brushed Rio’s back, and only heard the low voice that breathed out in a language she didn’t understand.</p><p>“Teper' vse koncheno. Koshmar zakonchilsya.” <em>It’s over now. The nightmare is over. </em></p><p>Rio’s breathing began to slow down again soon enough and she pulled back a little, and Agatha opened her eyes to see the reaction to these unknown words on her wife’s face.</p><p>If Natasha hadn’t been trying to reassure Rio, she may have slapped her away, too aware that she was close, but she didn’t, because before Rio had started to cry, Agatha was suspicious that Natasha was trying to defend her.</p><p>Rio wiped at her eyes and breathed out slowly, meeting Agatha’s concerned gaze with a devastated but resolved expression before she turned and strained to look at Natasha, whose hand she reached out for.</p><p>“You are both in so much trouble. Once I’m in my right mind again I’m going to murder you.”</p><p>“Yeah? I’d like to see you try.”</p><p>Agatha just smiled and squeezed Rio’s waist, letting her move cautiously so she could settle between her legs and sit back against her, rather than side on.</p><p>“So dead,” Rio repeated as she squeezed Natasha’s hand and held Agatha’s across her stomach.</p><p>Agatha just hummed against her ear, taking a second to breathe Rio in, inhaling the intoxicating scent of her shampoo and the perfume on her skin, “Okay, Lady Death. Do your worst.”</p><p>Rio harrumphed a little but released a slow, uneven breath as she still tried to regulate, feeling at least more relaxed with Agatha surrounding her and Natasha close.</p><p>The three of them remained like that a little longer, neither Agatha nor apparently Natasha keen on leaving Rio alone when she was still so clearly trying to cope with everything that had happened. The two of them had had days now to process what was to happen and so they gave Rio as much grace as she deserved, having done what they had for no one other than her.</p><p>By the time they disappeared off to their beds, Natasha having chosen one of the smaller bedrooms, knowing a fight with Jen over size of room wasn’t worth the time, Rio hadn’t cried again and they’d all relaxed a little more in the cool of the night.</p><p>In bed that night, Agatha wore Rio’s sleep shorts from earlier; now dry but smelling of sex and distinctly of Rio.</p><p>Rio hadn’t commented but in a similar move she’d stolen the t-shirt Agatha had worn that morning and slipped into bed beside her, choosing to press her body against Agatha’s back.</p><p>She’d kissed over the angry bruise she’d managed to leave at the base of Agatha’s throat that morning and nuzzled against the back of her neck, her whole body exhausted and her mind only on the release of sleep.</p><p>Agatha lay still in Rio’s hold, waiting until her breathing had evened out and she knew she was asleep before she allowed herself to do the same. Her mind had slowed and calmed since its meltdown that morning, and she traced the skin on the back of Rio’s hand as it rested by her chest, allowing the softness there to soothe her further as she eventually fell into a peaceful sleep.</p><p>The next morning, Agatha woke alone.</p><p>The space in the bed beside her was cold, which told her that Rio had vacated her spot a while ago. Which was unusual. And unwelcome.</p><p>As panic began to slowly seep into her bloodstream, she slipped from the bed and grabbed the nearest shirt to cover her top half as she went through to find Rio.</p><p>She found her on the couch with Natasha, cradling a coffee in one hand and Natasha’s cheek in the other.</p><p>The touch looked intimate and Agatha had to swallow down the bitterness that rose in her throat at the sight of it because Rio had noticed her now and was smiling, “You slept late.”</p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>“Almost ten.”</p><p>“Rio was just telling me about the wedding plan,” Natasha said with raised brows as she turned to Agatha and tilted her head, her gaze briefly dropping to shorts she must recognise as not the current wearer’s. “You’re going to be a Vidal?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said slowly, the bitterness in her throat morphing into something sweeter as her gaze moved back to Rio who was beaming at her now, the gap between her teeth somehow more pronounced this morning, perhaps because Agatha hadn’t seen her smile like this in over a day. She wanted to bury herself in it.</p><p>“You don’t seem the type.”</p><p>“To what?”</p><p>“Leave her alone.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, unsure what she was being defended from, and watched as Rio stood to breeze past her, kissing her cheek as she went. “I’ll get you a coffee.”</p><p>“The type to take someone else’s name.”</p><p>“I love her. I want the same name.”</p><p>“Not Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha went to sit down on the couch opposite, placing her feet on the edge of the coffee table, and wondering what had happened between now and yesterday for Natasha to be on one again.</p><p>But then… Rio wasn’t as vulnerable anymore. She was happier, more at ease, and so Natasha had her hackles back up and could afford to be a little harsher. Which boded well for her.</p><p>“Harkness can die the moment we marry. I have no problem with that. In fact, I’d prefer it.”</p><p>Rio returned then and settled without much thought beside Agatha, passing her her coffee. “It’s just a name, Natasha.”</p><p>“It’s surprising.”</p><p>“It’s none of your business,” Agatha said, a little too harshly for someone who’d just woken up.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and nudged Agatha, “We’ll be The Vidals and <em>you</em> will remain invited at Christmas so long as you behave yourself.”</p><p>Natasha laughed, “I was just asking.”</p><p>“You were trying to get a rise.”</p><p>“Forgive a girl for being curious.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio rolled her eyes but was soon distracted by her hand which tugged loosely on the strings of her shorts.</p><p>“Alice text and said they’d be here early afternoon. Apparently Jen’s in a good mood about the whole thing. Something about ‘Agatha having more money than god and good taste in vacation destinations’.”</p><p>Agatha was the one to roll her eyes now but her mind was still elsewhere as Rio continued to toy with the strings and she had to gently push her hand away to gain some semblance of concentration.</p><p>“Glad to hear she’s coming because she’s so concerned about our welfare.”</p><p>Rio smiled and settled back further into the couch, “I’m excited to see Alice. You’ll love her,” she shot across to Natasha.</p><p>Natasha made a noncommittal noise and shrugged, looking out at the clear blue skies before her.</p><p>“Well if they’re arriving soon I’m going to make the most of the quiet and enjoy the sun. Plus I know you two are desperate to jump each other. And I’d rather not be here for that.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio called out after Natasha as she took her coffee out to the pool.</p><p>But she was already turning around to Agatha, returning her hand to her shorts with a knowing smile. “I can’t believe you put these back on.”</p><p>“Why? I wanted to feel close to you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart rate picked up as Rio leant in to kiss her as she clambered into her lap.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio started softly, “there is rarely a time when I’m not close to you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but found little in her that could be annoyed as her hand dipped to rest on Rio’s hip, “Fine. I made you come so hard in these shorts that you squirted. I wanted the reminder of that after a long, hard day.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and Agatha smirked as a faint blush prettied her cheeks. “Don’t be shy, honey. It was so hot.”</p><p>Rio huffed a little and shifted on top of Agatha, looking a little regretful at her decision to sit here when they had a guest close by. She stole the mug of coffee from Agatha’s right hand and leant back to sip it.</p><p>Agatha only smiled and took the opportunity to move her dominant hand to Rio’s other hip, brushing her thumbs below her shirt.</p><p>“We’ll have a full house soon. I want to see if I can-…”</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Rio, honey.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Don’t blue ball me, c’mon. You’re on top of me for a reason.”</p><p>“No. Natasha’s here and-…”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“<em>And</em>, you can keep it in your pants for a few hours.”</p><p>“I’d rather keep it in <em>your</em> pants.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and took another sip of coffee, then, her expression changed and she smirked a little and spread her arms out like Jesus on the cross and Agatha dropped her gaze to the outline of Rio’s breasts against the thin fabric of her borrowed t-shirt.</p><p>“Get one last look and then-…”</p><p>“Rio,” she muttered reverently, her hands moving up to cup her breasts, squeezing firmly and feeling her stomach twinge with desire. “Please just let me fuck you.”</p><p>She leant in and up to Rio, squeezing now with one hand as the other moving to pinch her nipple through the fabric so hard that Rio’s breath hitched, “Please, baby.”</p><p>Rio groaned a little but brought her arms back in, shifting her hips and pushing Agatha’s hands away.</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>Agatha huffed heavily and dropped her hands completely, her gaze dropping to the breasts she’d just had in her hands and her brow furrowing as her body revved with desire. “You’re being unreasonable.”</p><p>“A little restraint never hurt anybody.”</p><p>With that, Rio slipped from Agatha’s lap and sauntered outside, taking the stolen coffee with her.</p><p>Agatha spent the rest of the day in a horrendous mood.</p><p>She went to shower and change after Rio left her high and dry and very nearly let her hand slip between her thighs, aching for some sort of release.</p><p>But she was grown. She could withstand a few hours.</p><p>Unfortunately for Agatha, Rio spent most of the day in a bikini. And most of it laid out beside Agatha. And Rio seemed to take great delight in torturing her by leaning over her to grab a drink or, in one moment that made Agatha almost scream, actually straddling Agatha’s chest to reach across her when Natasha was away in the villa sorting drinks.</p><p>But she’d take this kind of torture over the true torture of yesterday morning. Because twenty four hours ago she’d been convinced her world was ending. And now she knew it was just beginning.</p><p>So she could handle Rio’s teasing. For now.</p><p>It meant Rio was okay. That she was happy. That she was here.</p><p>By the time the three women decided the sun was too hot and they were too hungry to lie out anymore, they settled at the table under the large veranda and laid out lunch.</p><p>Just as Rio was giving Natasha a lecture about not sleeping with anymore of her old teammates (she’d slept with three), they heard the front door open.</p><p>“Ding dong,” came a voice that resounded through the villa, possibly across the whole hillside, “the witch is dead!”</p><p>Jen had arrived.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and braced herself for what was sure to be a treat of a time.</p><p>“This place is ridiculous, Agatha,” Jen announced as she arrived on the terrace, looking regal in a baby blue maxi dress and being trailed closely by Alice who already looked a little sweaty and a little stressed.</p><p>“What? Someone die?” Jen grinned as she looked over the three women sitting at the large table, receiving a variety of responses all on the spectrum of ‘not amused’.</p><p>But Rio was the first to get up, pressing a kiss to Jen’s cheek before she moved to Alice and pulled her into a firm hug. Agatha watched Alice return it and made eye contact with her over Rio’s shoulder, and she knew immediately that Alice had already worked it out. But there wasn’t time for that. Not yet.</p><p>“Honestly, Agatha. This place?” Jen announced, twirling her finger in the air as she looked around. “For the two of you? Really? You been having orgies or something? It’s <em>huge</em>.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and leant her arm back against the seat of the padded bench, “Hey, Jen. Welcome. Thanks so much for coming. Thrilled to have you here.”</p><p>“You better have given us the best room.” Jen’s eyes darted to Natasha briefly, whom she was yet to properly acknowledge but she sat down primly on the bench opposite Agatha. “There a butler or something?”</p><p>“Kind of a help yourself type situation.”</p><p>“Right,” Jen hummed disapprovingly, looking around for Alice who was too busy speaking quietly to the side to have immediately noticed her wife’s distress.</p><p>“Babe. Another round?”</p><p>Alice was holding Rio’s elbows and too intent on what she had to say to catch Jen’s request so Agatha, needing something to distract herself anyway, stood quickly to make good on it.</p><p>She breezed past Alice and Rio and squeezed Alice’s arm as she did so, disappearing off into the kitchen shortly after.</p><p>Padding through to the kitchen Agatha made quick work of gathering her hair in a loose ponytail using one of the hair bands Rio always carried on her wrist and Agatha always stole.</p><p>It was small, a tiny token of the woman, and one that meant not a lot when compared to the rings and watch that she wore as symbols of what they had. But today was a day where she needed to be greedy about Rio - where she could wear whatever talisman she could find, drape herself in her.</p><p>As she stretched up to take more wine glasses from the highest shelf she felt familiar arms around her waist and hands settle in across her expanded rib cage as a pair of lips took advantage of her exposed neck.</p><p>“You’ve thrown Natasha to the wolves?”</p><p>“She can handle herself,” Rio muttered with a smirk that turned into a softer smile when Agatha turned in her hold, wine glasses forgotten on the shelf.</p><p>“I just wanted a second with you.”</p><p>Agatha settled back more against the counter, her hands already making light work of brushing down Rio’s chest and tracing her fingers over the band of her bikini top just below the surface of the thin t-shirt she’d thrown on for lunch. “We can kick them all out. Make them go to a hotel?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but captured Agatha’s lips in a soft kiss, “I think we need them around today, don’t you?”</p><p>“I need <em>you</em>. You’ve been teasing me all day. I’m losing it.”</p><p>Rio responded by kissing Agatha again, properly this time. And Agatha had no choice but to splay her fingers out over Rio’s breasts and grope them hungrily, turning the kiss into something far less appropriate for a mid-afternoon in the kitchen with their friends mere meters away.</p><p>But Alice had already made the mistake of coming to help and stumbled where she stepped, “Oh god. Sorry. I mean. Sorry.”</p><p>Agatha grunted, half because she knew she’d have to stop groping her wife in the open plan kitchen and half because Rio was currently tugging her lower lip between her teeth.</p><p>When it was released, Agatha huffed loudly but was quickly silenced when Rio placed a soft kiss to her now protruding lower lip and spun quickly to Alice.</p><p>“Sorry. It’s been a-…”</p><p>“I know, I know,” Alice said dismissively, but the faint blush on her cheeks gave her away. “I came to help. They’re just staring. Like, literally just staring. Not even at each other. Just… space.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and, unable to help herself, slapped Rio’s ass sharply as she stepped around her, enjoying the soft yelp as she moved back out to get a look at this staring competition.</p><p>Sure enough, Natasha was gazing out to sea, her legs crossed beneath her, swirling the remnants of her white wine casually, as if she were the only one there and she were just taking a moment.</p><p>But Jen, Jen was staring haughtily at the wall, her back to Natasha’s view, looking as though she would rather be anywhere other than here.</p><p>It was quite the comedown from Agatha’s previously heightened state with Rio in her clutches.</p><p>She cleared her throat and focused her attention on Jen, having much more affection for her than Natasha.</p><p>“Couldn’t think of a nice neutral topic?”</p><p>“Fuck off, Agatha. I’m here, aren’t I? I easily couldn’t have shown up knowing she’d be here.”</p><p>Agatha glanced across at Natasha and saw that she was smirking into her glass. Suddenly the quiet confidence she’d respected before wasn’t as appealing anymore.</p><p>She moved to sit back in her place at the end of table and sighed heavily, focusing back in on Jen. “I’m afraid we’re all one little <em>happy</em> family.”</p><p>“Yeah? Well I didn’t consent to that.”</p><p>“Jen-…”</p><p>But her train of thought was interrupted as Rio and Alice appeared with two full bottles, two new glasses, and an ice bucket for good measure, given the heat of the day and Alice’s understanding that Jen wouldn’t accept anything less than ice cold wine.</p><p>Rio poured the drinks and went to sit by Agatha’s side, and as Agatha draped her arm around her waist Rio gestured for Natasha to come closer, being an outlier in their little quartet at the other end of the table.</p><p>Natasha arched a brow but stood slowly and moved along, sitting down just by Rio, and if Agatha bothered to lean across she could have touched her shoulder, which didn’t thrill her.</p><p>Her fingers twitched a little when Rio took Natasha’s hand and squeezed it but she decided to focus on something else, something less aggravating, like Rio’s bare thigh now pressed up against her own, or the light scent of her perfume, or the taste of the dry white wine as it passed her lips.</p><p>“So,” Jen announced as Alice settled more about her, looping her arm across her shoulders.</p><p>“If only this lucky twist of fate had happened years ago, maybe you’d have grown into a more relaxed adult.” Jen said wryly.</p><p>Alice shot Agatha a pointed look over Jen’s shoulder but Agatha looked away for fear they might be caught.</p><p>“Was she a relaxed teenager?” Rio asked in bemusement, clearly too busy thinking of a young Agatha to notice the brief exchange.</p><p>“Not at all, but maybe she’d have lightened up.”</p><p>“I will not take insults about being relaxed from the most uptight woman in the world.”</p><p>“I’m not uptight, I’m exacting.”</p><p>“You’re so uptight when Alice goes down on you she-…”</p><p>But a slap to her thigh stopped her and Agatha glanced surreptitiously at Rio who, despite the slap, was biting down on her lip to hold in her laugh.</p><p>“Whipped,” Jen muttered under her breath even as Alice laughed.</p><p>“They’re so in love.”</p><p>“It’s vomit-worthy.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and squeezed at Rio’s waist as she took another sip of wine, her gaze drifting out to the middle distance as Rio took over the conversation, steering it into calmer waters and opening up the floor to discuss Jen’s business, the general market at the moment, how Alice was adjusting back to life in the states, and how Billy was getting on in Italy.</p><p>The only broach of calmness came when Jen commented on the internet chatter about Wanda. Some people mourned the sudden death of the hot CEO, others wished good riddance to an infamous republican donor, all of which Rio kept silent on.</p><p>Agatha zoned out of almost all of this, her mind back in the little bathroom where yesterday she’d been sure she were going to lose everything. But Rio’s hand was now caressing her thigh, her shoulder tucked in the crook of Agatha’s, her presence reassuring and almost too good to be true.</p><p>As her mind drifted she thought of what she’d be doing if Rio had walked away. She’d probably have tried to hide, to escape her friends again in the same way she had all those years ago. But her gaze drifted to a smiling Alice and a laughing Jen and she realised that even if Rio weren’t there, she’d left her permanent mark on her. Because Agatha wouldn’t have run anymore.</p><p>She’d still be here, sitting opposite her two best friends. A shell of a person, sure. But there, with her family.</p><p>“Hey,” Jen snapped suddenly, and literally, her fingers in the air, attempting to catch Agatha’s attention. “Did you hear me?”</p><p>Agatha saw Rio turn to her from the corner of her eye but didn’t react, she simply raised a brow and watched Jen suspiciously, “What?”</p><p>“I said how long are you planning on staying here? Rio says you have the place for six months.”</p><p>“Undecided.”</p><p>Jen just hummed and swirled her own wine as Agatha felt Rio’s hand move to a more solid hold of her thigh.</p><p>“The wedding’s in six weeks so we’ll come home before then. Quite a bit before then,” Rio said as she sipped her own wine, smiling at Alice’s grin.</p><p>“Do you have an outfit?”</p><p>“She can’t tell you when Agatha’s here.” Jen said incredulously to her wife, but then almost immediately turned to Rio and grinned, “Do you?”</p><p>“Not yet. Nothing crazy, though. Something simple.”</p><p>“How boring,” Jen commented, wincing as Alice slapped her arm. “I’m sure Agatha will be in a shirt that just says ‘I heart Rio’ on it.”</p><p>Even Rio laughed at this and turned to shoot Agatha a wink, “I’d actually love that.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and smiled a little, unable to help herself when she dipped her head to kiss Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“And the bachelorette party?” Alice asked eagerly, “Please? Both of you? A joint one?”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow at this request and watched Alice clearly decide she was a lost cause already and focus in on Rio, practically beaming at her.</p><p>“I hadn’t even thought about it,” Rio admitted honestly but Natasha was already leaning forwards, helping herself to more wine as she spoke: “Not joint. They can be apart for an evening. You can come if you want.”</p><p>Alice’s expression had fallen in the split second she thought she’d be denied an invite to Rio’s party but then picked up immediately again at the final confirmation.</p><p>“Natasha,” Jen shouted, suddenly keen to pick her brains. “How do you feel about these two getting married? Can’t imagine Agatha was the first choice for your girl.”</p><p>Despite the personal slight contained within Jen’s words, Agatha recognised this as an olive branch, or at least a means to get Natasha to join in the conversation.</p><p>There was a beat of silence before Natasha spoke, her voice calm, “Not my first choice, no.”</p><p>Jen raised her brows at her, waiting for her to elaborate and when she didn’t she nodded slowly, “Uh huh. Well at least we’re all miserable together.”</p><p>“Harsh, Jen.” Alice corrected with a raised brow, shooting Rio and Agatha both an apologetic look.</p><p>“Just saying. You’ve tackled Rio. Natasha’s choked you. Agatha’s a pain in the ass and Rio used to take it up the ass from paying customers.”</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha said sharply, unable to hide her annoyance this time.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Jen clarified needlessly, shrugging her shoulders, “the only non-problematic one is me. You’re all very welcome.”</p><p>Rio seemed to find the humour in this even when Agatha didn’t and she turned to kiss her cheek, whispered conspiratorially, “You’re <em>my</em> pain in the ass.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her and turned her attention back to the table, watching Alice whisper something in Jen’s ear that made her roll her eyes but she didn’t say anything else.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon went by without much more drama and Agatha was quiet for a lot of it, her hands or gaze never far from Rio whenever she got the chance.</p><p>The unsettled feeling she’d had in her stomach for the majority of the past two days had dissipated, maybe due to the bottle and a half of wine she’d consumed, maybe because Rio found every spare second they had to kiss her face, applying more exacting care than usual.</p><p>By the time they’d all had their fill of a Baja feast Rio had called in from a nearby restaurant at dinner time, the sun had set and the drinks were still flowing. Agatha sat out on the double sunbed with a different companion than usual.</p><p>Jen sat with her, cradling her wine like a divorcee twice her age might, her palm cupping the bottom of the glass, the stem between her fingers like an inverted cigarette. “She’s quiet. Arrogant.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the subject of Jen’s ire, tearing her gaze away from Rio and Alice who were leaning against the infinity edge of the pool talking about something she was sure she wouldn’t understand: probably basketball.</p><p>“She’s Rio’s best friend. She’s not going anywhere. Better get used to the idea.”</p><p>“She can make new friends.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and looked away from where Natasha was dangling her legs in the water at the far side of the pool, reading a book in peace. She turned to Rio again, watching as she focused in on Alice, her fingers idly toying with the water in front of her.</p><p>Jen watched her watch Rio and lowered her voice a little, “With Wanda gone you can both relax a little, you know. She was a cunt anyway. And your life will be so much more than it ever was.”</p><p>Agatha turned to Jen then, seeing the girl who’d all those years ago been kind to her when she’d come back from visiting her mom and had sat with her silently as she refused to cry, even staying awake with her on nights she couldn’t sleep.</p><p>They’d come a long way since then, but that old Jen was still there, hidden beneath a veneer of glamour and arrogance.</p><p>She reached for her hand and squeezed it gently, “Do you think she’s too good for me?”</p><p>Jen’s mouth opened, a snarky response on the tip of her tongue, so close to being spoken that Agatha almost heard it, but she held back and shook her head slightly, “Does she love you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Do you love her?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then that’s all that matters.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and glanced down at their hands, twitching her ring finger slightly before she pulled hers away and turned back to Rio still deep in conversation with Alice.</p><p>“Your goddamn mother did a number on you. Don’t let her ruin what you have with Rio. I give her a lot of shit but… I’m glad you have her.”</p><p>“Jen! Jennifer!” Alice shouted suddenly from the pool, both her and Rio now grinning up at the two women on the sunbed. “Come in here!”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Jen called back, huffing a little as she held her glass more aloft, “I’m busy.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes and Rio grinned at Agatha, making grabby hands towards her but Agatha only smiled and raised her brows, “I’m fully clothed.”</p><p>“Take ‘em off.”</p><p>“No,” she scoffed, taking a sip of her drink to emphasise that she was absolutely not joining Rio in the pool when it meant she’d have to behave herself.</p><p>“Boring,” Rio shouted out to her before turning back to Alice and continuing their conversation, both exchanging insults about their wives.</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek, feeling Jen’s eyes back on her again but she kept her gaze on Rio as she swam across to Natasha and pulled her into the pool, the latter only just managing to save her book from drowning.</p><p>Rio looked delighted with her success and even as Natasha tore after her in the pool and Agatha’s fingers twitched when Rio was forced under the water by her best friend, she emerged soon after spluttering but beaming.</p><p>Rio truly was the sun. And she was lucky that she’d chosen to shine her light on her.</p><p>“Stop staring,” Jen said suddenly, having been watching Agatha this whole time. “You can’t spend a whole month with the woman and still be this down bad.”</p><p>Agatha tore her gaze away and rolled her eyes, taking a sip of her wine, “Like you aren’t for Alice. She’s the only one who can shut you up.”</p><p>“She’s the only one I respect.”</p><p>“No, she’s the only one you want to see naked, that’s all it is.”</p><p>“Same for you and Fantine over there.”</p><p>“Don’t call her that.”</p><p>“Why? She’s not ashamed of what she did.”</p><p>“And neither am I.”</p><p>Agatha shot Jen such a dirty look then that Jen gave up halfway to opening her mouth and she rolled her eyes instead, choosing to sip her wine and then leaning over for the bottle to top the both of them up.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, settled and in love. Who’d have thought it?”</p><p>“Same can be said of you. Alice is a saint.”</p><p>Jen just laughed as she finished topping up Agatha’s glass and held hers up to her. “To our saintly, hot as hell wives?”</p><p>“God bless them.”</p><p>They clinked their glasses and turned just in time to see the saints in question baptising each other (and Natasha) with pool water.</p><p>“God, they’re idiots,” Jen said with affection, smirking when Alice got the jump on Rio and made her scream.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and kept her gaze on Rio, wondering how someone so naturally carefree could have found someone like her.</p><p>But then Jen and Alice were opposites and they worked and she felt a smugness in the knowledge that her and Rio were still obsessed with each other.</p><p>She had relaxed back into her better self, with her better angels taking the form of Rio’s words, her soft touches, her reassuring smiles.</p><p>She loved her. And she was staying.</p><p>Not long after, when Agatha and Jen had moved onto other topics, Rio pushed herself up from the pool first and laughed as she ran her hands back through her soaked hair, twinkling a smile across at Agatha who had sat up and was now holding a towel up for Rio to take.</p><p>Instead of doing so, Rio sauntered over and flopped down between Agatha’s legs and shouldered the towel, allowing Agatha to pull her in closer and wrap her arms around her waist.</p><p>“You’re soaked.”</p><p>“I’ve heard-…”</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Jen shouted suddenly, offering her own wife her towel and grimacing as Alice, encouraged by Rio’s reception from Agatha, made a move to join Jen in the same way.</p><p>Jen made a noise of disgust initially but relented and although she wasn’t as thrilled as Agatha seemed to be, she did allow Alice to lean in against her.</p><p>Natasha was out of the pool now and Rio pulled from Agatha slightly to offer her a spare towel, motioning for her to come sit. But Natasha only smiled and grabbed it from Rio’s hands, kissing her cheek as she did so. Whether or not she meant to rain down pool water on Agatha’s legs in the process, Agatha couldn’t be sure. “I’m going to shower.”</p><p>Rio only hummed a response and then pressed back into Agatha, unbothered by how wet she was making her thin top with her dripping hair.</p><p>Alice was beaming with her eyes closed, enjoying the still slightly reluctant hold of her wife. “This is nice. This is great.”</p><p>“You two better not have had sex on this bed.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Agatha smirked against Rio’s temple, her hand now flush against Rio’s damp skin beneath her towel, but her mind on a particularly hot afternoon spent on the bed with an ice cube that she’d tortured Rio with, only touching her properly once it had finally melted against her hot skin.</p><p>“Don’t ask if you don’t want to know.”</p><p>“Perverts.”</p><p>Agatha sighed happily and focused on Rio’s slow breathing as she wrapped her arms more fully around her, moving her legs to cross over Rio’s as they stretched over the bottom of the large bed.</p><p>Eventually, Jen relaxed some more around Alice and Agatha caught, from the corner of her eye, Jen press light kisses to the side of Alice’s head, apparently forgetting they had company and giving into her more affectionate side.</p><p>Rio, for all the stress of the day, the sun on her body, and the alcohol in her bloodstream, had fallen asleep on Agatha, turning in her hold to rest more fully against her, her face pressed against her chest.</p><p>Agatha was damp and yet so blissfully aware that she had a bikini-clad angel in her arms that she didn’t even mind. She held Rio close, brushing along her side beneath the towel in a steady rhythm along with her breathing, focusing on nothing but the soft puffs of breath against her clavicle.</p><p>After a few minutes, Jen and Alice made some excuse about leaving to get the smell of chlorine off of them but Agatha didn’t miss the glint in Jen’s eye and the way they practically ran back to the villa.</p><p>But Agatha remained steady with Rio, holding her as the stars began to emit their fire from lightyears away.</p><p>As a cooler breeze began to descend on the little hilltop hideaway, Agatha felt Rio curl up more against her and she squeezed her gently, brushing her lips against dark, damp hair, “Honey, wake up. You’ll get sick.”</p><p>Rio only grumbled as she woke, turning her face to press fully into Agatha and huffing out a hot breath against her.</p><p>“Take me to bed?”</p><p>Agatha just smiled and began to shift them up into a seated position, with Rio groaning as she rubbed at her eyes.</p><p>They made it to the entrance to the villa again, but instead of a quiet, empty, living space, Agatha was surprised to see two sets of eyes staring at them. One green, one brown.</p><p>Alice and Natasha were sitting at opposite ends of opposite couches, one looking a little flushed and the other like she’d been cornered.</p><p>Rio was the first to speak and wrapped her towel more tightly across her body, “Where’s Jen?”</p><p>“I don’t know, man. There’s at least fourteen steps to her skincare routine. I lost count a few years ago.”</p><p>Agatha smiled tiredly, feeling the pull to her bed taking away some of her patience at having Alice still hanging around, even though she loved her, even though she was the easiest of her friends to have around - especially at a time like this.</p><p>But Alice looked intent on staying, having tucked her legs beneath her in the corner of the long couch opposite where Agatha now sat with Rio and Agatha knew her friend well enough to know what was about to happen.</p><p>Rio pressed her back to the arm of the couch and Agatha sat beneath her legs, holding them to her like a safety blanket, her fingers running slowly up and down her thigh.</p><p>She cleared her throat quietly, her gaze intent on Alice’s eyes that darted meaningfully from Agatha to Rio to Natasha then back to Agatha.</p><p>“Ask,” Agatha said calmly, her nails now softly scratching along the expanse of Rio’s outer thigh, “It’s okay. Ask the question.”</p><p>Rio had shifted a little, and Agatha felt her tense beneath her hands but she kept her gaze on Alice who seemed to hesitate before she spoke the thing that had been on her mind all day.</p><p>“Did you do it?”</p><p>Although she’d known it was coming, it still hit her like a tonne of bricks every time it came up and Agatha nodded as she watched one of her oldest friend’s take her in, watching her with those shrewd eyes, expressing no immediate judgement but tucking her legs under herself a little more.</p><p>“I thought you weren’t going to. I thought-…”</p><p>“The game changed,” Agatha said slowly as Rio sat up from her reclined position and leant against the couch cushions besides Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“The threat changed. Became more immediate. I had to act.”</p><p>Alice didn’t react to this but slowly moved her gaze to Natasha, watching her for a second before she focused back in on Agatha, whose hand had now been taken by Rio.</p><p>“How secure are we talking?”</p><p>“Five by five,” Natasha interrupted from across the room, nursing her red wine. “Safe as houses.”</p><p>Alice nodded in acknowledgement and her gaze flickered to Rio briefly before she glanced at the area beyond the kitchen, making sure Jen was still deep into her multi-step routine.</p><p>“I wish you’d called me.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated then, unsure whether she should admit the real reason she hadn’t. Alice would have been a useful contact in this endeavour, someone who at least could ratify the threat level and counsel on the response. But she’d left her in the field for a reason.</p><p>“I wanted Rio to have someone to go to if she decided she didn’t want to speak to me or Natasha.”</p><p>A slight adjustment in Rio’s position made Agatha’s gaze drop as Rio cupped her left cheek and kissed her right, nudging her nose just before her ear affectionately as an acknowledgment of this thoughtfulness.</p><p>But she didn’t say anything.</p><p>Lost to Rio’s touch, Agatha closed her eyes for a second as Alice watched on with a soft, understanding smile.</p><p>“Understandable. Still pissed about the marriage thing, though.”</p><p>“Join the club,” Natasha muttered and Rio leant around Agatha to shoot her best friend a glare which was received with a smirk and a raise of her glass.</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and kept her gaze on Alice as she continued her movements against Rio’s leg again.</p><p>“You’re coming to the real thing,” Rio reassured, raising her brows in challenge at Alice.</p><p>“Yeah but you guys already consider yourselves married. Judging by your rings and,” she waved her hand vaguely, “you know, the way you are.”</p><p>“You’re right, we’re <em>very</em> similar to you and Jen. Never have sex, always-…”</p><p>But Agatha’s sarcastic insult was cut short by a slap to her arm from Rio and Alice just laughed, scratching at the back of her neck lazily, “You have no idea what we get up to in the bedroom. I’ll have you know that we just-… Anyway, just because we’re not all over each other like you two.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and shot Rio a sideways glance before she spoke again, “I don’t want to imagine what you two get up to, thanks.”</p><p>Alice just rolled her eyes, “You’re lucky I like your wife or I would rip you a new one, Harkness.”</p><p>“I think we’ve had enough violence for a while, thank you.” Rio said with a small smile that didn’t quite meet her eyes.</p><p>Agatha sighed and squeezed Rio’s thigh gently, “You can’t tell Jen.”</p><p>“I know. My lips are sealed.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and felt a rush of affection for Alice, the person in her life, until she’d met Rio, who had always been her fiercest defender, even when she wasn’t exactly in the right.</p><p>“Did you see the article in the <em>The Washington Insider</em>? The chatter online?”</p><p>“No? About what?”</p><p>Alice’s gaze flickered across to Rio and she raised her brows at Agatha, clearly surprised by this fact.</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>,” Agatha said more firmly, “What article?”</p><p>“Just… just about you… and Rio.”</p><p>“What about us?”</p><p>Alice sighed and closed her eyes for a second, “I assumed you would have seen it.”</p><p>“We’ve been off grid almost completely. Besides, I don’t keep track of that trash anyway.”</p><p>“It was basically an exposé on your relationship.”</p><p>“On Rio,” Agatha clarified in a monotone, her fingers stilling against the woman in question’s thigh.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Alice reached into the waistband of her pyjama pants and fished out her phone. She tapped for a bit and then moved to pass it to Agatha, who read:</p><p>
<em>Harkness Hires a Hooker</em>
</p><p>
<em>The Insider has learned that Agatha Harkness (41), formerly of this parish but unseen since ditching Tony Stark’s New York City fundraiser last month, has been parading around town with an expensive escort.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio Vidal (37), is everything one might seek in an expensive thrill ride. Tall, slender, beautiful, and according to our sources, she demands $25,000 for a day’s work, not to mention any extracurriculars her clients might require of this hooker hottie.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But Harkness is a catch by anyone’s standards, so why is she resorting to paying for what she could surely be getting for free?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Harkness appears to have been putting her mother’s (Evanora Harkness, RIP) vast fortune to good use. According to one source who spotted them at a restaurant recently: “They really were all over each other. It was practically pornographic, watching as this slip of a thing pawed all over Harkness all evening, I hope she’s at least getting tips for-…</em>
</p><p>But Agatha had to stop reading.</p><p>She flicked through the rest of the article, scanning over the long read and spotting words and phrases like “fake engagement”, “more money than sense”, “questionable morals”.</p><p>She shook her head and handed the phone back, feeling Rio press a little closer. “Whatever. It’s just trash. We know the truth.”</p><p>“I don’t ‘paw’,” Rio said with a slight smile on her face, winking across at Alice.</p><p>Rio pressed her hand just under Agatha’s damp t-shirt at her collarbone and held her there just as Agatha continued to stroke along her thigh again.</p><p>Alice settled back on the couch, looking sheepish and upset as she did. “Anyway, you’ve got a lot of support online. Mostly from women. Mostly gay ones. But I thought maybe that would have influenced your decision.”</p><p>“No. But to know how much Rio charged they must have spoken to-…”</p><p>“Really?” Alice snapped suddenly, blinking rapidly, “Twenty five thousand dollars? A day? That’s true?”</p><p>Rio released a soft laugh at this and bit down on her lower lip, “Obviously I didn’t start at that but eventually… If you charge more people tend to be a little more discerning. Cuts out the time-wasters and idiots.”</p><p>“Jesus. I mean, don’t get me wrong, you’re totally hot and-…”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“I just mean-…”</p><p>“I think we’re getting off track.”</p><p>“Right,” Alice corrected softly, clearing her throat. “Anyway, I thought that maybe it factored into your decision.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and dropped her gaze down to where she was now just holding Rio’s thigh and she felt the familiar frustration bubble in her chest, stemmed from boiling over only by the knowledge that none of this mattered anymore, that the source of this had been cut off.</p><p>But Washington, her life as she knew it, everything she’d built up for herself, she’d have to burn it down.</p><p>“Does Billy…?”</p><p>“No. But I’m sure he suspected something was up. He called you about-…”</p><p>“About your little meeting together, yeah.”</p><p>“He’s still away. I don’t think he’ll come back until I do.”</p><p>Alice sighed and rubbed the back of her neck. “I should go see what step she’s on now.”</p><p>Agatha just nodded and paused her movements against Rio’s leg, her throat full of the things she wanted to say to Alice but wasn’t sure how to communicate.</p><p>So she settled for the easiest of the mix, a gentle: “Thank you.”</p><p>Alice smiled, looked at all three women in turn and then sauntered from the room in search of her wife.</p><p>As silence descended again, Rio stole her legs back from Agatha and tucked them beneath her, her gaze now across on Natasha who was still swirling her wine, looking intently at it.</p><p>“Will you stay a few days?”</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio first before sweeping her gaze around to Natasha, watching her reaction to this curiously. They still had a tentative relationship, a burgeoning friendship, with the solid foundation of their mutual adoration of Rio, and now with the added entanglement of their choice to murder, and Agatha felt, for perhaps the first time, a sort of strange affection for this woman. Maybe it was the wine talking, maybe her lack of sleep or that the warm, damp impression Rio had left across her body from sleeping against her under the night sky had softened her, but she found herself fond of Natasha in that moment.</p><p>The subject of this fondness turned with an arched brow and smiled just a little, “And interrupt this pre-wedding honeymoon more than I already have? You don’t want me around.”</p><p>“Not true,” Rio said with a roll of her eyes, shifting to get more comfortable at Agatha’s side, “Stay another day or two. Please.”</p><p>Natasha agreed.</p><p>Soon enough, blissfully, mercifully, Agatha found herself curled up in bed, waiting on the arrival of her wife, now getting ready in the bathroom.</p><p>When Rio eventually came out, she crawled over to Agatha, clambered across her and shimmied into the duvet and Agatha immediately pulled her against her.</p><p>“You smell like chlorine.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and stretched beneath Agatha, turning in her hold to face away from her, which gave Agatha the opportunity to sweep her hand over Rio’s warm body, only stilling it when she felt satisfied enough with the map she’d made and tucking her fingers below Rio’s side.</p><p>“I’m too tired for you to be touching me like that.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Like you want something that I’m too tired to give you.”</p><p>“I’ve barely touched you all day and after that little show this morning I’ve been <em>desperate</em>. I just wanted a little grope before sleep. Give me something to dream about.”</p><p>Rio laughed and groaned quietly as she began to wriggle and flipped back around again, lying on her back as she turned to look at Agatha.</p><p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to keep our groping to a minimum the next couple of days.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes playfully and pressed a kiss to Rio’s nose even as her hand moved to Rio’s hip and she rolled a little more into her, “Don’t tell me I can’t do something. It just makes me want to do it more.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and hummed for a second as she reached for Agatha’s hand and pushed it below her t-shirt, sliding it all the way to her breast and making her squeeze it.</p><p>Agatha, fearful that Rio was just teasing her again, couldn’t help but play right into it and she shifted to slip her leg between Rio’s, bearing down on her a little more. “Don’t.”</p><p>“Don’t what?”</p><p>“Tease.”</p><p>“I’m just giving you something to dream about, baby.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s breast firmly and pressed her thigh up and into her, now wide awake and desperate again as Rio responded by arching up into her with a grin.</p><p>“Feels like you might be in a dream already, don’t you think?”</p><p>By the time Agatha collapsed onto the bed again, with Rio spread eagled beside her as if she were the Vitruvian Man and Agatha her Michelangelo. She was damp with sweat and panting so heavily she thought she’d never catch her breath.</p><p>Rio was laughing softly, exhausted and aching with her arm thrown haphazardly across her eyes, and her foot gently nudging against Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Agatha fell asleep first, after she’d shifted back towards Rio and curled herself around her, and Rio followed shortly after, their shared exhaustion leading both into blissful, empty dreams.</p><p>The next few days went quickly for Agatha. She was back to her usual self around her friends, not letting Jen get away with her little digs, rolling her eyes at Alice’s comments, and then putting up with Natasha’s quiet arrogance as she watched Rio choose to always sit near her at breakfast, to flit between her and Agatha by the pool, and to drape an arm around her when they cooled off under the veranda.</p><p>But she found moments to be alone with Rio and as time went on, the cloud that had been over them since Wanda’s death disappeared.</p><p>Rio was still soft with her, and Agatha didn’t bristle against it, she’d softened too. They spoke less than usual, with each choosing to use their time together to check in with their bodies instead, Rio’s lips never far from Agatha’s face, and Agatha’s hands never far from any warm skin she could get a hold of.</p><p>By the time the group of visitors left - Natasha three days after arrival, Jen and Alice five - Agatha was pleased to be rid of them.</p><p>Rio was a little less so, having teared up a little when saying goodbye to Natasha and then Alice two days later.</p><p>But they were both happy to be alone again and took advantage of their access to each other, their ability to talk freely and openly, and they remained frantically, unconditionally, passionately in love.</p><p>And Agatha’s demons died with each of Rio’s touches, until, by the grace of Rio Vidal, she was cured of her fears and absolved of her anguish.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio and Agatha had been on vacation for seven weeks.</p><p>Seven weeks of near-bliss.</p><p>Seven weeks of each other.</p><p>And it wasn’t enough.</p><p>In the days after their friends left, in the wake of Wanda’s untimely demise, Rio and Agatha fell into a new normal. They were cautious to celebrate too much at first - Agatha because she was still a little nervous that Rio might change her mind with her okayness with murder and Rio because Catholic guilt can find a person even in a secluded villa in Barbados. </p><p>But soon they gave in to their desires and threw caution and morality to the wind. They toasted to their freedom to just <em>be</em> and luxuriated together now that they were free from threats or beholden to any maniacal redheads with an axe to grind.</p><p>They left a week after Wanda’s funeral, having very quickly and easily decided that they wouldn’t be attending.</p><p>The funeral was small, sparsely attended.</p><p>In the last few weeks of her life Wanda had alienated even those she was closest to, and so she was laid to rest with only the few who remained.</p><p>Agatha’s phone had been blowing up since the news broke.</p><p>But it wasn’t just from friends and old clients. It was now the press; anyone who wanted any kind of information.</p><p>And soon enough Rio was getting the same kind of attention. She was called almost as often as Agatha. And Agatha resented it. She resented that the world had access to Rio now because of her.</p><p>One night they’d had a tense discussion about it. Agatha didn’t understand that Rio couldn’t see how staying away from the city was the best option for them. They could move to Europe! They could stay here! They could go to Puerto Rico!</p><p>But Rio wouldn’t have it.</p><p>She wanted their life back. Sure, it would look a little different now. But it was theirs and they should have it back.</p><p>And so Agatha relented. But she remained nervous about what they’d face when they arrived back in the city.</p><p>They kept in frequent contact now with their friends and Rio was added to a group chat that Jen had set up specifically. This move, Agatha had decreed, was Jen giving her blessing.</p><p>And for that, Rio was thrilled.</p><p>Agatha eventually got her wish of having sex with Rio on a private jet, having been making hints about it in the week running up to their leaving. Rio had ignored or denied or teased until the morning of, when she unsubtly let Agatha know that she could have what she wanted at thirty thousand feet.</p><p>And Agatha took. For close to five hours she took, she gave, she made Rio forget that there were other people on the flight. And so Rio made sure she tipped so well that the screams could be forgotten.</p><p>Jimmy had picked them up from the airport, but Rio had been unable to greet him properly because Agatha had bundled her so quickly into the back of the car that she’d barely been able to smile at him.</p><p>“What are you doing? You can’t possibly want-…?”</p><p>“There was a guy with a camera. They’ll know Jimmy’s plates.”</p><p>Rio craned her neck to look around and through the tinted windows she saw two men make for their car, large cameras primed and ready.</p><p> “I don’t understand,” Rio said with a frown, “How did they know we’d be here?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand found her shirt and she pulled her back down, looking far less relaxed than she had not ten minutes ago.</p><p>“You can look up who’s chartered a jet.” Agatha turned to the front of the car then and in a clear, firm voice said: “Drive.”</p><p>Rio settled back against the bench and held Agatha’s hand firmly in her own, trailing her nails soothingly up and down Agatha’s forearm.</p><p>She’d known that logically there would be some sort of repercussion for what had happened to Wanda - though Agatha continued to reassure her that she wouldn’t be found out when Rio felt ill-at-ease with the situation - but men following them around hadn’t been on her list of concerns.</p><p>Still, as she looked at Agatha’s face, she saw that perhaps Agatha had already been anticipating this scenario and she pressed a little closer into her side. </p><p>“They’ll get bored soon enough. We’re not very exciting.”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head and took her phone out and Rio saw she was contacting Alice to arrange more protection, having left their quiet and unassuming tail back in Barbados.</p><p>“We don’t need-…”</p><p>“There are men following you around. Of course you need someone.”</p><p>“<em>We</em>,” Rio corrected, “Not just <em>me</em>. They’ll be following you if-…”</p><p>“I’m not worried about me.”</p><p>Rio huffed as she watched Agatha, watched her sink into herself, into what she could easily recognise as Agatha’s fight or flight (and sometimes fuck). She stole away Agatha’s phone that she was still tapping away on in a move straight out of her childhood and teenage petulance.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Rio held the phone above her head and slid away from Agatha, holding it away as Agatha began to reach for it, practically climbing across Rio as they merged into the traffic heading for Manhattan.</p><p>“Give it back. Rio!”</p><p>Rio huffed and wriggled as Agatha pinned her to the seat and she held the phone below her beneath the small of her back. “No. This is something we discuss.”</p><p>Agatha growled and made a successful attempt to pull Rio’s arms out but the phone remained trapped below her. “It doesn’t need discussed. It’s just-…”</p><p>“It’s not <em>just</em> anything,” Rio said calmly, even as she twisted her wrists in Agatha’s hold to get her to release them. “Everything you’ve done you’ve done so we’ll be safe. So we can move on. Let’s move on.”</p><p>Agatha was scowling where she sat above Rio, her eyes flickering to where she knew the phone to be just below Rio’s lower back but she didn’t make a move to try and get it again, knowing Rio would be able to fight her off if she wanted to.</p><p>“Fine. Moving on. But moving on with a big guy with a gun nearby.”</p><p>Rio sighed and raised her brows, recognising the tell of Agatha’s loosened hold on her so she could pull her hands away and move them to hold Agatha’s hips, “Fine. For both of us. Not just me.”</p><p>Agatha huffed softly but nodded, moving her own hands down to hold Rio’s in place. “We should talk about where we’re going to live.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha shifted away enough so Rio could sit up properly, frowning as she watched the thoughts swirl in Agatha’s bright blue eyes, “Let’s get in, get clean, order some food and talk about it.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha closed her eyes and rubbed at her temple as Rio leant in and pressed a kiss to her throat, wrapping her arms comfortably around her waist. She felt Agatha relax against her and soon they’d shifted again to be sitting beside each other, fingers entwined as they made their way back to the little apartment on Jane Street.</p><p>Jimmy walked them and their bags all the way to the front door of Apartment 7, and Agatha didn’t relax until the door was closed and locked behind them. The bolt was put firmly in place.</p><p>But they showered and changed, separately for once because Agatha wanted to call Alice.</p><p>By the time they were both clean and refreshed, Rio had placed a food order from a local Thai place and she’d laid it out on the coffee table, settling on the floor before it for easier access to the food.</p><p>Agatha marched in just as Rio was helping herself to some edamame and announced: “Alice will come over tomorrow with some options.”</p><p>“Options?”</p><p>“People. Men. Bodyguards. Protection types.”</p><p>“Types? No women?” Rio popped an edamame in her mouth.</p><p>“Plain clothes, or black suits, subtle, unsubtle, seen or unseen.” Agatha paused for a beat, “I’m not being sexist. Men are bigger. If anyone comes at y-<em>us</em>, then there’s more surface area for them to… whatever they need to do.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and threw her phone into the armchair.</p><p>Rio watched this carefully, seeing the strain that had washed off in the Bajan sea return to Agatha’s body, seeing it in the hold of her shoulders and the curve of her jaw as she kept it flexed. “Okay,” she said slowly. “Unseen, definitely.”</p><p>Agatha settled opposite Rio and stole the bowl of beans away, grabbing the soy whilst she was at it.</p><p>“Hey, don’t steal.”</p><p>Agatha just smiled and picked up her chopsticks, poking them in Rio’s direction, “I’m hungry. I worked up an appetite.”</p><p>“Oh and I didn’t? Just lay there, did I? Share, you monster.”</p><p>Agatha only laughed and popped an edamame in her own mouth before she pushed the bowl back over towards Rio, “I suppose you’ve earned some beans.”</p><p>“Charming.”</p><p>When they’d eaten their fill and Agatha had poured them both generous glasses of wine, they settled down on the couch, their legs crossed over each others, Agatha’s hand lazily holding Rio’s foot as it lay on her stomach. Her free hand swirled her wine as she gazed intently across at Rio who was twirling a piece of hair around her fingers and staring at the little rabbit on the mantelpiece.</p><p>“I know you hate Washington. And I think it’s time we left.”</p><p>Agatha’s soft voice shook her from her daydream and Rio looked up suddenly, raising her brows at Agatha and watching as she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“I don’t hate it. But I wouldn’t be mad at leaving.”</p><p>“Then we’ll leave. We’ll leave it all behind.”</p><p>“Can you? Everything you’ve built up?”</p><p>“You did it for me. I can do it for you.”</p><p>Agatha said those words with such certainty, such finality, that Rio felt sure she’d been thinking about this for a while. Which made her heart skip a beat.</p><p>She nodded slowly, her tongue darting out to wet her lips as she thought it over for a second, “So New York?”</p><p>“We can look for a house. Someplace bigger.”</p><p>“Bigger?” Rio laughed and raised her brows, “And why would we need a bigger place?</p><p>Agatha shrugged a little but smirked, squeezing Rio’s foot. “You have a lot of friends.”</p><p>Rio just hummed and wriggled her toes not vocalising that which she knew Agatha was hinting at, something that had only thus far been discussed after several cocktails in the sun or between breathless moans and possessive touches late at night, “A garden would be nice. Someplace to sit with you at night, somewhere to host parties and entertain.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk softened and she tilted her head as she watched Rio, her fingers tapping lightly on the back of her foot.</p><p>And Rio took this as an opportunity to fantasise, to outline their future from the cosy, comfort of their present. And so she pushed a little, still not quite giving air to the exact thing that hung between them as a promise of <em>more</em>.</p><p>“I want a loud house.”</p><p>Agatha breathed in slowly, her fingers twitching ever so slightly, “We can have a loud house. We can have any kind of house you want.”</p><p>Rio shifted a little, sitting up more and Agatha moved too, like a tide with the moon, pushing Rio’s leg to her side and leaning up to pull her closer. “Where will you work? What will you do?”</p><p>“I’ll find something. There’s no rush.”</p><p>Rio nodded and reached for Agatha’s face, resting her fingertips to her cheek and surveying the familiar curves and lines, “We’ll figure it out together.”</p><p>Agatha smiled just a little, the corners of her mouth twitching up as she dropped her gaze down to Rio’s lips and leant into her touch. “Maybe I’ll just want to be your wife for a little while.”</p><p>“A kept woman?”</p><p>“Available for your every whim.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said quickly, nudging at Agatha’s chin with her finger, “Eyes up here.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and looked back up to meet Rio’s gaze, and she softened her expression as she leant more into the back of the couch. “I still have an election to win. That’ll keep me busy for a while.”</p><p>“You think Hart has a chance?”</p><p>“She has me. She’ll win.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly and leant back into her previous reclining position. Agatha’s lashes fluttered a little as if recalibrating herself with Rio slightly farther, “And if she doesn’t?”</p><p>“Honey, I’m not sure you’ve been listening this whole time. I don’t lose.”</p><p>A soft laugh escaped Rio’s lips and she shrugged gently where Agatha squeezed Rio’s knee by her hip, “Stark’s still popular.”</p><p>“He’s a hack. Besides, I implemented a failsafe a long time ago.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Agatha just shrugged and mirrored Rio’s position back against the arm of the couch. “I maybe dropped in a couple strategy points for later in the campaign that’ll make him incredibly unpopular. And if he goes for them, which he will, then at the very last minute he’ll-…”</p><p>“Lose his credibility.” Rio clicked her tongue and shook her head in disbelief, “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>“I know, baby. Thank you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at this but grinned at her ridiculous wife, her chest fluttering with that familiar, warm feeling of contentment.</p><p>Over the next few days, Agatha arranged for her house in Washington to be prepared for sale and for some viewings to be booked for townhouses in and around the city.</p><p>They went to all five boroughs looking at different locations and types of houses they could buy. Rio had to have a conversation with Agatha at one point about contributing what she could from her own savings to the house but Agatha wouldn’t hear it and they had their first proper argument in weeks because Agatha saw no problem in buying the house without Rio contributing and Rio saw lots of problems with it.</p><p>But it came down to this: Agatha had money and wanted to use it to build a home for them and she didn’t care that Rio wasn’t able to match or contribute as much as would make it 50/50. Rio’s name would be on the deeds all the same.</p><p>So Rio relented and paid the lawyers’ fees instead, feeling better that she was able to contribute something at least.</p><p>In an act of equal parts petulance and chivalry: Rio’s name went down first on the deed.</p><p>The third house they viewed was the one they ended up buying.</p><p>It was on W 12th Street, just one block down from Agatha’s apartment on Jane.</p><p>It was bright and grand, with period features that mattered to Agatha and a garden that mattered to Rio. They fell in love with it because the other loved it, and in doing so, they found their new home.</p><p>But before they could move in they had their wedding to arrange.</p><p>And both Rio and Agatha spent the next couple of weeks ahead of the wedding spending more time apart than they had in weeks now.</p><p>But they both needed outfits, they both had friends to catch up with, and they both had groundwork to lay for whatever they were going to do with their future careers.</p><p>Because Rio was listless not having a purpose and Agatha was unmoored for the first time since college.</p><p>Rio, who had initially thought that teaching was the way to go, had her head turned towards something a little different, more community-focused. There was a disused and abused green space near the gym by her old apartment, just begging to be repurposed and cared for.</p><p>And so, amidst the wedding planning and catch-ups with friends, Rio started to put feelers out to see if the person who could do the caring was an amateur basketball player, an energetic coach, an ex-escort with a green thumb.</p><p>Agatha, now that she’d pulled away (mostly) from Washington, found that people still wanted her. Press, media outlets of all kinds, and even colleges, were calling night and day for an opinion or a sound bite or an appearance by the formidable Agatha Harkness.</p><p>She’d told Rio one lazy Sunday morning spent in a local deli that it was more than usual she was being harassed for these things - tenfold, even because Agatha had been absent for so long and the presidential race was heating up. But Rio knew, could tell by the way Agatha kept checking her phone, seemed to drift occasionally when Rio was talking about her own plans, that Agatha might have left Washington behind but she hadn’t lost the desire for power. These people wanted her. And Agatha, Rio was sure, would give herself to them, in time. When they got just desperate enough and Agatha could demand more. </p><p>Every night they found their way back to each other, regardless of where they’d been that day.</p><p>And so life was good. Life was perfect.</p><p>Even the presence of a tall man with a hidden gun wherever either of them went together or alone couldn’t dampen their joy.</p><p>But before the wedding came the bachelorettes.</p><p>Agatha’s was arranged by Jen. Rio’s was arranged by Natasha.</p><p>The day of the individual parties, Alice had organised a brunch for the four of them, knowing both Rio and Agatha would want to spend time together before going their separate ways.</p><p>Though she’d arranged it not quite understanding that Agatha would have preferred an extra couple of hours alone in bed with Rio and, really, Rio would have liked the same.</p><p>But Alice wanted to spend time with Rio too, because she’d miss half her party in favour of attending Agatha’s celebrations first.</p><p>Secretly, Jen did as well. Rio had grown on her, though she’d never really admit it. But she found her to be weird in a charming way and happy in a non-annoying way. And she knew that the reason she and Alice were invited for dinner at least once a week was not Agatha, but Rio.</p><p>“She did it on purpose,” Jen announced bitterly - halfway through a tirade on the “Machiavellian Russian bitch” that was Natasha Romanoff - spearing a piece of avocado with her fork. “She didn’t really want Alice there.”</p><p>“It’s the weekend before the wedding. It’s Saturday. It’s the best day to have the parties.”</p><p>“Saboteur,” Jen said as she popped the piece of avocado into her mouth.</p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes and felt Alice kick her lightly under the table.</p><p>She glanced up and saw Alice raising her brows conspiratorially at her even as Agatha started up: “I do think she’s arranged it specifically so Alice can’t be there. She doesn’t want any double-agents.”</p><p>“What <em>exactly</em> does everyone think I’ll be doing?”</p><p>“Getting very drunk and making a fool of yourself?” Alice offered helpfully.</p><p>Rio scoffed and nudged Alice’s leg right back, “Well, goes without saying.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and rolled her eyes, draping her arm over the back of Rio’s chair as she focused back on Jen. “And what do <em>I</em> have to look forward to?”</p><p>“Oh,” Jen grinned, “Something a little more sophisticated than whatever Natasha is planning, I know that for sure.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed and Rio reached over to steal a piece of her smoked salmon. “Strippers?”</p><p>Agatha blinked and where she’d been focused on the theft of her food she then looked to Rio with raised brows, “Strippers? No. Why? Will Natasha-…?”</p><p>“No. I mean, no. Probably not.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes a little and Rio only smiled, leaning in to kiss her cheek with a mouth still full of stolen smoked salmon, “It’ll just be the girls and a lot of tequila. Nothing crazy.”</p><p>Agatha hummed as if she didn’t believe her and Jen interjected, “Either way, very unsophisticated, I’m sure. We will be going to a day spa and then for dinner and then at this cute little French bar in the village. Very chic.”</p><p>Rio smiled and settled back in her seat, reaching to touch Agatha’s thigh gently under the table in an act of reassurance and slight apology for stealing her food as she ate more of her eggs.</p><p>The conversation moved then to Jen trying to get details out of Rio about her outfit for the wedding. All she managed to get out of her was that it was a dress and that it would be white. Agatha’s attention had drifted and Rio felt this drift for the rest of the meal.</p><p>By the time they’d finished and Natasha met them outside the little bistro, standing a little diffidently beside a familiar man with a familiar air of watchfulness, Agatha looked less than happy about having to part.</p><p>But the sight of what Natasha had in her hands was enough to distract even Agatha Harkness from her sulk. She held up a t-shirt for Rio as they stepped outside and presented it with a grin brighter than one the other three had yet to be privy to from the redhead.</p><p>It was white with big black lettering that read: ‘I ❤️ Agatha’. This made Rio laugh and roll her eyes and even Agatha seemed to enjoy it. But Rio especially enjoyed it when the shirt was turned over and it read ‘Harkness’s Whore’.</p><p>Agatha liked this part a little less.</p><p>“Oh good. I’m to wear that all night?”</p><p>“It could be worse,” Alice offered with a smirk as she pulled the t-shirt out to admire it properly. “There could be a big ugly photo of your face on it too.”</p><p>“Oh no, all the girls have those,” Natasha admitted with a smile and Rio smacked her arm before turning to grin at Agatha and pull her into a hug.</p><p>“I’ll see you later tonight, okay? Maybe early morning.”</p><p>Agatha hummed against Rio’s hair and Rio felt her breathe her in as she held her close, “Have fun. Be safe. Call me if you need anything.”</p><p>“And you too. I love you. Don’t let Jen steal the limelight.”</p><p>They separated slowly, reluctantly, and Rio had to be pulled away by Natasha as she kissed Agatha goodbye.</p><p>A promise of Alice stopping by wherever they were later was shouted across the busy street as Natasha tugged Rio away and Rio waved her new t-shirt in the air with a grin on her face as she allowed herself to be pulled into the crowd of a busy Saturday morning in New York. Three sets of smiling eyes followed the two women as they disappeared and the familiar man who’d been by Natasha glanced at Agatha before heading off behind Rio.</p><p>“You think she’ll get her strippers?” Agatha asked with a growing frown as Jen looped their arms together and began to pull her in the opposite direction.</p><p>“Oh without a doubt. But that’s fine. She’s obsessed with you. She’ll probably imagine they’re you or something.”</p><p>“Jen. That isn’t the-…”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. You’ll feel better about it when you’re five wines in and having a good time.”</p><p>Alice laughed beside them and took Agatha’s other arm, and they marched off down the street together.</p><p>Rio, now fully in the headspace of celebrating the beginning of her new life with Agatha, waltzed down the street with Natasha on her arm.</p><p>Natasha ran through the agenda for the day:</p><p>First, a game of basketball in the park with her old teammates and some of the new ones she’d picked up in D.C.</p><p>Then, a break in between so they could all shower and change out of their basketball clothes and into what Natasha had dubbed ‘the pussy party wear’.</p><p>Next, they were to go for a boozy early dinner at a local Mexican Rio loved.</p><p>After that, more drinks at a dive bar that was known for its vintage jukebox and cheap vodka mixers.</p><p>And finally, a nightclub on the upper east side where they used to pick up women together and dance until the early hours of the morning.</p><p>All of this flew by without a hitch and by the time they’d made it to their final stop Rio was well on her way to being completely wasted.</p><p>She’d been allowed to win the basketball game; out of practice and taken pity on by her friends. She rallied against this and fell back into shouting at everyone on the court, giving as good as she got, but ultimately everyone still went a little easy on her and she was hoisted up in celebration of her side’s win, and the celebrations continued from there.</p><p>Agatha was never far from Rio’s mind, and Natasha stole her phone because as drunk as she was, Rio kept attempting to contact her, though she was never able to actually reach out. Her screen was strangely blurry, and each little letter suddenly one of a pair.</p><p>But by the time Rio’s new t-shirt was twisted in a knot at the front to form a makeshift crop top, she was wearing little white shorts with a bedazzled ‘BRIDE’ on the ass, she was dancing on a table and screaming the lyrics to some random country song.</p><p>Alice had arrived after contacting Natasha to find out their whereabouts and was a little tipsy herself, having been plied with whisky and wine by Agatha, Jen, and Lilia.</p><p>“She’ll fall!” She shouted into Natasha’s ear when she first saw what Rio was doing, casually draping an arm over the shoulder of the woman she’d once been throttled by but had since fallen into a gentle truce with. The alcohol helped with that too and she accepted a drink that she definitely didn’t need from one of the girls from the Washington team.</p><p>“She’s done it before. Loads and loads!” Natasha shouted back with a laugh and a whoop as Rio threw a shot down her throat and raised her arms in jubilation.</p><p>“God she’s so drunk,” Alice said in amusement, wobbling slightly and tightening her grip on Natasha when the other woman held onto her wrist to keep her steady.</p><p>“How is her highness?”</p><p>“Jen? Jen is also very drunk.”</p><p>“No! Agatha! How is Agatha?”</p><p>“Oh man. So drunk.” She laughed suddenly, perhaps at the memory of how she’d left Agatha or perhaps because Rio was stumbling to pull one of the girls up to dance with her.</p><p>“She’s so drunk she let Lilia read her palm. Didn’t make it easy for her though.”</p><p>Natasha just nodded, no longer interested in Agatha when Rio was making a beeline for the two of them, reaching down towards them with a lopsided, toothy grin. “Vamanos! Vamanos! Alice! Tasha!”</p><p>Alice groaned but Natasha helped pull her up and they all stumbled together, three best friends unable to let go of the other for fear of falling in a pile of limbs onto the sticky bar floor.</p><p>But Natasha was the most sober, or at least the least drunk, and she managed to hold the two other women up even as they threw themselves about the table now that Shania Twain had started up and man, they felt like women.</p><p>Eventually, Rio was convinced that getting off the table would be a good idea; lured down with the promise of more tequila and news of Agatha.</p><p>She draped herself in the corner of a booth and Alice snuck in opposite her, stealing the shot passed Rio’s way before she could take it: “protecting you from yourself,” she’d mumbled.</p><p>Rio just huffed but couldn’t find it in herself to be mad in her drunken state because she was surrounded by her friends and was so blissfully exhausted from all the dancing.</p><p>“Where’s she?”</p><p>Alice laughed as Rio swiped the next shot slid across the table to her and raised her brows as she perched her chin on her upturned hand, leaning on the table with her elbow, “Drunk. Downtown. Jen and Lilia are looking after her.”</p><p>“Miss her,” Rio mumbled as she took her shot, wincing a little but recovering quickly as Natasha arrived and dismissed one of the team trying to drape herself over Rio who had opened her arms to any willing participant now she was done with her cheap tequila.</p><p>Natasha slipped into the booth with her, nudging her legs to move so she could sit properly.</p><p>“You’re not drunk enough to be at the pining stage.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio insisted, slapping Natasha lightly on the shoulder which made her grin and collapse into her in a forced hug that Rio struggled against initially and then relented, mumbling against the top of Natasha’s head: “Can you believe I’m going to be a wife?”</p><p>“No. Feels too grown. You should be out fingering girls in bars.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio laughed with a soft huff and Natasha pulled away with a grin that belied her tipsy mind.</p><p>“Harkness’s Whore,” Alice quoted suddenly and began to laugh at herself and Rio made a poor attempt at slapping her arm to knock her off balance as one of the girls appeared at the end of the table.</p><p>“She’s here. Nat! She’s here.”</p><p>“Who’s here?” Rio slurred, straightening up slightly and craning her neck over to booth, expecting Agatha to have arrived.</p><p>“Your gift!”</p><p>It took a second. Maybe two. Maybe three. And then the reality of the situation made Rio’s eyes go wide and her stomach drop. Natasha’s words could only mean one thing.</p><p>“No. No. Nonononono. I told you. No.”</p><p>Natasha only laughed and Alice snorted, “Oh she’ll be soooo mad.”</p><p>“Nooooo,” Rio began to fight as Natasha began to pull her forcefully from the booth.</p><p>“Lighten up it’s just a little dance.”</p><p>“Natasha!”</p><p>But the girls surrounded her and she was pressed and pulled to a little alcove in the private part of the club they’d taken over where even in her blurred vision she saw a woman standing in sparkly short shorts and a sheer basketball jersey.</p><p>“Oh fuck me. Absolutely not.”</p><p>“C’mon you’re being-…”</p><p>But even as out of it as she was, Rio shouted for the person she thought would protect her from this, given the fact that Natasha had betrayed her so utterly.</p><p>“Alice! Alicecomehererightnow!”</p><p>As Rio was thrown onto the seat in the centre of the little room she grimaced as her ass came into contact with the wooden chair and held her arms out to Alice who was laughing but stuck behind some of the taller girls.</p><p>The woman hired for the evening to provide the opposite experience to the one Rio was currently experiencing paused before she made to move towards Rio.</p><p>She was pretty, tall, brunette, and someone Rio would have had no problem with getting a lapdance from even a year ago.</p><p>But now it felt wrong and the only person she wanted to feel grinding on top of her was the one person who couldn’t be here tonight.</p><p>Rio felt Natasha’s hands on her shoulders, and a quick kiss to her temple, as she was pinned down and stared ahead at the woman who would soon be all over her.</p><p>Rio’s gaze, slow and a little unfocused, moved over the dancer and she first noticed how pretty she was, and then she noticed how close she was, and that her hand had reached out and was brushing back some dark, loose hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Alice,” she mumbled uselessly and the woman now bending down towards her smiled and raised her brows.</p><p>“Call me whatever you want, baby.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and turned her head to find Alice in the crowd as the woman’s hands moved down her neck and she stepped closer.</p><p>She could smell her perfume and feel the warmth of her fingertips across her skin, and it made her stomach churn with something that felt suspiciously like disgust as she sought the person she trusted most to help her in this situation. Because Natasha had now moved away and was looking incredibly pleased with herself.</p><p>Rio moved her hands up towards her friend and just as she felt a soft weight settle on one of her thighs Alice had clearly realised that Rio was serious and so squeezed through the cheering crowd and made it to her.</p><p>“C’mere,” Rio motioned frantically and Alice smiled sympathetically as the stripper turned Rio’s face to look at her.</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and her eyes went wide as she stared into blue eyes that were definitely not the specific kind of blue that made her weak at the knees. But she had to look into her eyes because looking around she’d see her friends laughing and egging her on and looking down she’d see… she couldn’t look down.</p><p>“Doll, if you’d rather I didn’t then-…”</p><p>“Yes. Sorry. Please. You’re so pretty it’s not you I’m just very drunk and I love my wife and I-…”</p><p>The woman smiled, her expression softening slightly and she stood from Rio’s lap, who replaced her immediately with Alice, using her as a protective blanket against anyone else who might suddenly try to give her a lap dance.</p><p>“Going to kill Natasha,” she mumbled as Alice laughed again and spread her arms out as if to fight anyone who might come close, really hamming it up for Rio’s mortified sake.</p><p>But Natasha was already huffing and at Rio’s side again, pushing the two women off the chair, “Waste of money. Get up. I’ll take it.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and shot Natasha a glare as she moved with Alice from the chair, letting Natasha replace them so she could offer her lap to the pretty girl with very little clothing on.</p><p>“Agatha would have been soooo mad,” Alice sang as Rio hurried her back into the crowd to watch the show of Natasha getting a dance.</p><p>“Don’t tell her. Nothing happened. S’not worth it.” Rio swayed a little where she stood, scowling at a very pleased looking Natasha in the chair she’d just vacated.</p><p>Alice just hummed and draped an arm over Rio’s shoulders, squeezing her bicep, “Secret’s safe with me. At least she picked you a girl who looks vaguely like Agatha.”</p><p>“No one looks like Agatha. She’s beautiful. And unique. And beautiful.”</p><p> “You’re cute,” Alice laughed as she pulled Rio’s head down to ruffle her hair affectionately and make Rio laugh.</p><p>Rio’s brief spell of a bad mood dissolved as Alice rubbed it away with her knuckles against her scalp and she fought her off with ease, stumbling away and still laughing as her best friend through the crowd continued to enjoy the result of Rio’s refusal to play the role of a typical bachelorette. </p><p>But elsewhere, Rio’s refusal to get a lap dance was met with the punishment of more drinking, which led to more dancing, and more tables desecrated with Rio’s dance moves - Natasha and Alice often not far away.</p><p>And Rio punished Natasha equally for her lapse in judgement. For every shot Rio had to take, she made Natasha take two.</p><p>At around 2am, Alice was the next person who had a surprise in stall for Rio. She dragged her worse for wear friend outside for a recovery cigarette and propped her up against the wall, placing an already lit cigarette in her lips and a reassuring hand on her shoulder.</p><p>The moment the acrid smoke hit her lungs, warm and welcome, Rio felt hands on her stomach. The touch was warm and familiar and Rio was drunk so she reached to the side to push at Alice, getting her away from her and her phantom lover. The hands travelled to her ribcage and something other than the weight of the cigarette hit her lips.</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, enjoying the phantom Agatha that held her. The warm glow of the little red in her hand was nothing to the press of the ghost of her wife against her front, the long fingers against her ribs now dancing to the band of her bra.</p><p>But the silent enjoyment of this apparition was broken when the ghost spoke:</p><p>“Alice, how much has she had?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open then and two Agatha’s appeared before her, both equally concerned. Both equally real. Both equally magical.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Hi, honey. I’m not staying, I’m just-…”</p><p>“Nono, staystaystay.”</p><p>Rio grinned in bewilderment and swung her cigarette hand away as she pushed off the wall to throw her other arm lazily around Agatha’s neck. “Stay.”</p><p>Agatha laughed quietly and pressed a kiss in the hollow behind Rio’s ear as she opened her jacket and wrapped Rio in its warmth in the cool spring night. “Are you having fun?”</p><p>“Geez, Rio.” Alice piped up suddenly, taking hold of Rio’s swinging wrist to keep her from poking her eye out with the cigarette, “Careful.”</p><p>Rio hummed as she pulled back to look at Alice and grinned lazily, leaning back against the wall with Agatha still pressed close. “I thought you were in my head.” She widened her eyes and wriggled her fingers in front of Agatha’s face, making ‘woo’ noises and beaming like the drunken moron that she was.</p><p>“Tequila?” Agatha asked in amusement, eyeing the cigarette carefully as it flew about the place with Rio’s gesticulating hand.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“No, I meant,” Agatha laughed and pressed a little closer, now forgetting holding her jacket open around Rio in favour of holding her wrist to avoid either of them getting burned and her other hand snaking around Rio’s back, “I meant have you been drinking it?”</p><p>“Maaaaaaaaybe.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, a shadow of a grin on her face as she leant in to taste the reason for Rio’s drunkenness on her lips. “You taste delicious still.”</p><p>“You taste like whisky.”</p><p>Alice, who had been watching this little scene with a lopsided grin, suddenly spoke: “Where’s Jen?”</p><p>“In the car,” Agatha said softly, her own eyes a little unfocused as she tried to keep Rio as close as possible.</p><p>“Come dance,” Rio said suddenly, her vision of Agatha a little hazy still as she tried to make four blue eyes make sense in her own mind. “You need to dance with your wife who is me.”</p><p>“That’s not in the rules of this evening,” Agatha teased with a grin, stealing a quick kiss as Rio pouted. But there was a commotion from behind them and where Agatha turned to see Alice banging on Agatha’s car, clearly attempting to get to her own wife, Rio had seized her opportunity to press her face against Agatha’s neck, breathing her in so deeply she forgot to breathe out and swayed a little on the spot.</p><p>But Agatha kept her hold on her.</p><p>The window of Jimmy’s car rolled down slowly and Jen poked her head out, looking as smashed as Rio felt but stern in her appraisal of Alice. “What are you doing? It’s freezing out there.”</p><p>“Come in. Come dance.”</p><p>“No. Agatha and I-…”</p><p>But Rio was shouting, leaning around Agatha now who’d stolen her cigarette and was stamping it out on the ground. “Jen! Jen come dance!”</p><p>“Oh my god, I knew this was a bad idea. No! Agatha and I are going home now. It’s two in the morning, you animals. I’d rather die than go into this grotty little… whatever. Come back here, Harkness. Now.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and felt as she did a wave of sudden nausea, but then Agatha was pressing back against her and she felt grounded again, warm and comforted as she received soft kisses to her neck. “Drink water,” Agatha whispered, “Drink water and go dance.”</p><p>It felt a lot like a dream. And she forgot that this was real, that she hadn’t just conjured Agatha in her brain to keep her warm and keep her from slipping too far into her inebriated state. She wasn’t entirely sure again if Agatha really were there, or if she’d missed her so much she really had imagined her.</p><p>“No no no,” she whined quietly, feeling the soft breaths of Agatha’s laughter against her throat. “Por favor quédate conmigo, mi amooooooor.” <em>Please stay with me, my love.</em></p><p>Agatha pulled away and Rio leant her head back against the wall as she blinked slowly at Agatha, her blue eyes now down to just two. She smiled drunkenly and reached her hands to Agatha’s face, attempting a caress but being a little more heavy handed than she meant to be.</p><p>Agatha smiled as best she could where Rio had tugged her lips down to reveal her lower teeth and leant closer to murmur, “You’re very hard to say no to.”</p><p>“Then say yes.” Rio hummed happily as Agatha pressed a kiss to the corner of her lips and her fingers twitched against her ribs, squeezing gently.</p><p>“Do you know how sexy you look right now?”</p><p>Rio groaned and tried to press closer, repeating the words on her shirt: “I heart Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and slipped her hand around to Rio’s lower back, her other moving to grope one of her breasts, “And I heart you in this outfit.”</p><p>“Then lemme dance with you.”</p><p>Agatha’s grin made Rio grin but it fell from her face again as Agatha moved her hands back to her waist and Rio realised she might have just lost the battle of the wills.</p><p>Why her brain wouldn’t just make this Agatha stay with her she couldn’t work out.</p><p>“Stay. Please. I’ve no one to kiss at midnight.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again and rolled her eyes as she slid her hands back down to her ass so she could press herself closer. “Do you know what day it is? Why you’re here? What my name is?”</p><p>Rio giggled and shook her head, her hands now slipping to hold Agatha by the collar, “The weekend. Smokes. Baby.”</p><p>“Close enough,” Agatha said softly, squeezing Rio’s ass so firmly that she gasped a little and attempted to lift her legs up around her. The movement was so misjudged that Agatha almost dropped her but managed at the last minute, with the help of the wall, to keep Rio upright.</p><p>There were gaggles of other party goers nearby who saw this movement of the two women and wolf-whistled just as Jen shouted from where she still sat in the warmth of the car with Alice leaning against the door, “Don’t you dare fuck her in the street! Agatha! This is a <em>classy</em> night!”</p><p>But Agatha was groaning against Rio’s shoulder, having dropped her forehead to it when she’d solidified her hold. And Rio was beaming, kissing sloppily at Agatha’s head as she tightened her hold on her and slurred out, “Stay forever. With me. Like this.”</p><p>“I have to go,” Agatha said with a quiet reluctance, pulling back enough to look Rio in the eye and watching as Rio’s face fell slightly, but she was too drunk to truly understand what those words meant, too delirious to know that it meant Agatha would actually be leaving.</p><p>“Okay but dance with me please.”</p><p>“Rio, honey, please drink a lot of water. A lot a lot. Okay?”</p><p>Rio only hummed, her eyes closed again as she focused on the feel of the person that she’d missed all night. And Agatha was then able to gently unwind her legs from her waist and lower her to the ground, keeping her steady against the wall for a few seconds.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were on her stomach again, scratching her there lightly as she kissed her lips one last time and then pulled away.</p><p>There were words exchanged that Rio missed, having slipped into her happy place in her mind, focusing on Agatha’s touch which was once again phantasma.</p><p>If she’d caught them they would have been a quick exchange between Agatha, Alice, and the tall man hired to look after Rio, though protecting her from 40% proof wasn’t exactly in his remit.</p><p>But Alice was back against her side, shaking her gently, “Hey. Hey. Water. Water then dancing. C’mon.”</p><p>Rio followed Alice back into the bar and was greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the girls who had lost their hero for a few minutes. And the feeling of Agatha’s body against her remained there like a comfort blanket.</p><p>Rio grinned and soon found she was being swept up into the crowd and delivered into the arms of Natasha who whispered in her ear that the stripper had been pretty but not a great fuck.</p><p>Rio laughed louder than she’d laughed all night, her little dose of Agatha fuelling her for at least an hour more as she continued to celebrate with her friends.</p><p>She could feel the pulse of the music in her bones now. Her friends all rallying round to get a chance to dance with the girl with the brightest smile and the most willing partner in their dancing.</p><p>Rio danced with the freedom of someone who looked forward to tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that, knowing that what she felt in this night club was nothing to the feeling she’d just had when warm fingers had found their home between her ribs.</p><p>But the heavy drinking and constant, energetic dancing could only lead to one thing: Rio’s hair being held back by a practiced Natasha and a concerned Alice.</p><p>All three were squashed into the very stall Natasha had not long since been alone in with the stripper. And she was having about as much fun now as she had been then.</p><p>Rio groaned miserably when her stomach finally felt empty and the bile she’d been bringing up had stemmed its flow. She sat back between Natasha’s legs and allowed her to brush her hair back from her head as Alice gently wiped her mouth with tissue.</p><p>“God, I haven’t seen a performance like that since college.”</p><p>“Shuddup.”</p><p>“You are so fucked.”</p><p>“You’re fucked. We’re all fucked. Natasha fucked that stripper in the bathroom.”</p><p>Alice laughed and Natasha rolled her eyes, hastening to untie the tight knot at the front of Rio’s shirt to keep her as warm as possible on the cool tiled floor. “Natasha had to take one for the team because you offended our guest in not wanting a dance,” Natasha corrected with a smirk.</p><p>“Did not. Told her she was pretty.”</p><p>“How kind.”</p><p>“Shuddup. You shouldn’t have hired her.”</p><p>“It’s a bachelorette. You needed a stripper.”</p><p>“Patriarchal bullshit.”</p><p>“Two more tequila shots and I think you’d have loved it.”</p><p>“Don’t say that word. Hope you tipped her well.”</p><p>“Oh she got more than the tip.”</p><p>Natasha laughed quietly and sighed, now adjusting Rio’s head where it lolled back against her shoulder, “Let’s get you home.”</p><p>“No. I jus’need a minute.”</p><p>Alice met Natasha’s eyes and she raised her brows knowingly, taking one of Rio’s hands and shaking it from side to side, “I think you’re done for the night, kid. No one can barf that much and come back from it.”</p><p>“Built different,” Rio mumbled, slapping Alice’s hand where it still held her other.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>Natasha hummed and placed her hand gently on Rio’s cheek, trying to coax her from her reverie. “Tell you what. If you can get yourself up and back onto the table to dance all by yourself, we’ll stay out.”</p><p>“Mm’kay.”</p><p>And so, the little trio made their way out of the bathroom. Rio was greeted by cheers that were a little more subdued than before - some people having left, others now almost as drunk as she was - but she stumbled and fumbled her way through her friends’ grabbing hands and made it to the table where she was to dance her final dance.</p><p>But something happened before she could throw down. She somehow ended up tipping backwards and someone’s arms ended up below her armpits, catching her where she’d fallen.</p><p>If she were even remotely in her right mind she’d have been mortified.</p><p>Alice heaved her back to her feet and Natasha caught her arms, “Home, I think?”</p><p>Rio only laughed, her grasp on reality so fuzzy now that she could barely think straight, and she stumbled from the bar with her two friends, allowing them to take complete charge in getting her safely back home.</p><p>At some point the tail appointed to Rio for the night offered to help carry her but Natasha refused the offer and Alice, being his boss and concerned for Rio’s dignity more than Agatha’s wrath in that moment, sent him home. </p><p>By the time Alice had found Rio’s keys and let them all into the apartment, Rio was almost entirely reliant on Natasha to hold her up. They fumbled and staggered, with Rio not exactly helping the situation, and both Alice and Natasha also being less than sober, that they made so much noise that Agatha appeared in the hall.</p><p>It all happened at once then. The sudden appearance of another person made Rio stumble over her own feet and she pulled Natasha into the wall with her, both exclaiming and groaning as they fell onto their asses and Alice laughed above them.</p><p>“Jesus. Rio!”</p><p>Agatha, who’d had her fill of alcohol too, but at least an hour’s sleep, stumbled her way over and attempted to pull Rio up but Rio was having none of it and instead tugged Agatha down and eventually won the scrabble, wrapping every limb around her to trap her.</p><p>Agatha huffed but went limp for a second on top of Rio, letting her wrap herself around her with little complaint.</p><p>They remained like that for a little while, Rio just pleased her mind had brought Agatha back to her, and Agatha relieved that Rio was back and in one piece.</p><p>“I don’t feel great,” Rio admitted softly for the first time that evening, her face buried deep into Agatha’s wild hair as the more sober woman slowly tried to break the hold on her and push up and away.</p><p>She blinked down at Rio when she finally managed it and bit on her lip as Rio’s eyes remained closed, her hands making to grab for Agatha to come back to her.</p><p>“Let’s get you to bed.”</p><p>Three bodies managed to manoeuvre Rio into bed, one of whom placed her gently in the recovery position and propped her up with a pillow to be on the safe side. But Rio was asleep already by the time Agatha properly tucked her in.</p><p>Natasha was leaning with her eyes closed on the door frame and Alice was flat on her back on the end of the bed. In that strange way that sometimes happens when there’s someone in the room who is clearly more drunk than you, both women hadn’t realised the extent of their own drunkenness until Rio had fallen asleep and the spell had been broken.</p><p>Agatha clambered into the other side of the bed and curled gingerly around Rio as she spoke to Alice in a soft tone, unwilling to wake Rio again, “Jen’s gone back home. But stay. I sent Jimmy home and I don’t trust you to get home by yourself.”</p><p>“I’ll take her,” Natasha offered but Agatha raised a brow and shifted as she slipped her arm cautiously under Rio’s pillow.</p><p>“You can stay too. Rio would kill me if-…” but she paused and stopped herself from saying anything that would infer <em>she</em> wouldn’t mind if anything happened to Natasha.</p><p>“Take the couch. Alice, get in.”</p><p>Alice blinked up at the ceiling and lay still for a second before she stumbled from the bed and ran for the bathroom to repeat the performance of Rio from earlier.</p><p>“God,” Natasha mumbled unhappily, grimacing at the noises from the bathroom, “I’m taking the couch.” She raised a lazy hand in farewell and turned on the spot, making her way slowly to the living room amidst the cacophony of Alice’s night coming back to haunt her.</p><p>Agatha remained awake until she knew Alice was alive still and had climbed into the bed. She felt the mattress dip when Alice got in and heard her mutter a soft apology, but she didn’t respond and only curled more around Rio.</p><p>Rio was in the kind of drunken sleep that feels like its not even happening. In her mind she was against a cold brick wall, the smell of smoke filling her lungs, the warm touch of a familiar person against her skin.</p><p>But the dream was gone and she woke with a groan, the usual comfort of the warm body beside her doing nothing to ease the throbbing of her head and the aching of her limbs as she slipped from the embrace of sleep.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I want to die.”</p><p>“I know. But please don’t.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly again and pressed her face into Agatha despite the fact that she felt hot all over. The scent of her perfume eased her aching soul for a few seconds as some memory flashed in her mind. “I dreamt of you.”</p><p>There was silence in the hot bedroom for a few seconds before Agatha spoke again, her voice raspy and slow as she rolled onto her back and hummed slightly, her body searching for some cool air whilst Rio still pressed against her.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio shuffled, chasing Agatha’s hold that had been stolen as she stretched her arms up above her head. She threw her leg over Agatha’s body and startled and released a yelp when she kicked another warm body the other side of the brunette.</p><p>“What-…?”</p><p>“Alice,” Agatha mumbled softly, rubbing her eyes with a closed fist as she flexed her other arm up that had remained beneath Rio’s pillow the whole time she’d slept. “Too drunk to leave.”</p><p>Rio shuffled again and nudged Alice once more, but this time with her hand, pushing against her shoulder tentatively. Alice grumbled but didn’t move from the foetal position she was curled up in. She was alive. Good.</p><p>So Rio settled back down again and released a heavy sigh as she hid her face against the pillow. “Is Natasha here?”</p><p>“Couch.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio began to drift then, lying face down with her arms either side of her body, each limb more sore than the next.</p><p>But Agatha had cooled herself down enough that she could withstand curling back around the little heater that was Rio Vidal. Only Rio was overheating now, and made her discomfort known when Agatha tried to wrap herself around her once more.</p><p>“Baby. Too hot. Don’t. Get off.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and huffed a hot breath across the back of Rio’s neck before she began to aggressively kick the duvet up and off the both of them, dumping it unceremoniously over Alice’s tiny form and then returning to her position around Rio.</p><p>Rio made a noise from deep in the base of her throat but didn’t protest anymore, allowing Agatha to slip an arm beneath her chest and pull her half onto her body. She was still too hot, too clammy, but without the duvet there was a coolness to the air about her, and she could withstand Agatha’s hot limbs around her for now.</p><p>They fell asleep like that for a couple more hours and woke to the sounds of an enormous uproar from the front of the apartment which made Rio groan loudly and Agatha start from her deep, undisturbed sleep.</p><p>“Jen,” she mumbled grumpily as Rio pushed herself up to squint down at Agatha, feeling a little disorientated and still very much like she wanted to die.</p><p>But there was movement on the other side of the bed just as Jennifer Kale burst through the door looking frantic and Rio wondered how on earth someone could look so polished after a whole night of drinking.</p><p>She groaned and flopped back down so gracelessly on top of Agatha that the woman beneath her released an ‘oomph’ before she wrapped her arms lazily around her.</p><p>“Is she here?”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha move beneath her and realised she must have kicked Alice because there was a squeak and movement on the other side of the bed.</p><p>Jen made quick strides to fish Alice out from under the heavy duvet and Rio peaked one eye open to watch as relief washed over her face. “God I thought maybe-…”</p><p>But Jen cleared her throat as Alice struggled to sit slowly. “You weren’t answering your phone.”</p><p>“My fault,” Agatha said dismissively, “she was drunk so I told her to stay.”</p><p>“No shit. It stinks of alcohol in here. Did you rob a Mexican laundry or something?”</p><p>“Racist,” Rio mumbled against Agatha’s collarbone, turning her head to face the other way so she could be ignored enough that she might be able to go back to sleep.</p><p>“I want to die,” Alice said with a groan as Jen sat before her and pulled her into a reassuring hug.</p><p>“Not today. Not for a while yet, actually.”</p><p>“You two can leave,” Agatha huffed, throwing one hand from Rio’s back to usher her two friends away. “We need quiet.”</p><p>“No way,” Jen huffed as she turned her head, resting her cheek on the top of Alice’s head to look at Agatha. “I want details from last night. All of them.”</p><p>Rio groaned in protest, and shuffled to lean up and glare at Jen with bloodshot and bleary eyes, attempting to look fiercer than she felt or looked, “Mañana. Por favor.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and bit down on her lip as Rio rubbed at her eyes and flopped back down against her, pressing her face almost stubbornly against her neck where it was warm and dark.</p><p>“God, what’s wrong with you?” Jen asked with a scowl, clearly still pissed about losing her wife for a few hours, “Feeling guilty about your little lap dance?”</p><p>Even in her mortally hungover and perhaps still slightly drunk state, Rio could feel the tension in Agatha’s body beneath her. The arms that had encircled her body again were suddenly stiff rather than comforting and Rio felt her stomach churn with something other than sickly emptiness.</p><p>“Jen,” Alice said groggily, pulling away with a guilty frown, “You know nothing happened.”</p><p>Rio pulled back from Agatha slowly and dared to look down at her face, blinking rapidly to try and clear the haze of her hungover vision. “It didn’t. I wasn’t interested so she gave one to Natasha instead.”</p><p>Rio reached up to touch Agatha’s jaw that was so tense she could see the muscle twitching in it but her eyes were on the ceiling above, staring, unblinking. Rio shifted to put her face in Agatha’s line of vision instead and murmured, “I said no.”</p><p>Blue eyes eventually met Rio’s soft brown ones, and Agatha nodded only slightly, her hold tightening again where Rio’s forearm shook from holding herself up in her current condition.</p><p>“Te creo, cariño.” <em>I believe you, honey.</em></p><p>And whether it was that she’d spoken a soft whisper in Spanish or the gentle gaze, Rio knew Agatha did believe her. She nodded slowly and pressed a quick kiss to Agatha’s lips before slipping back down to press her face against the side of Agatha’s head, seeking comfort to ease now more than just her aching body and throbbing head.</p><p>“God you guys can’t even be goaded anymore you’re so in love.”</p><p>Rio harrumphed and Agatha scowled as she turned her face more against Rio’s, “Fuck off, Jen. I’m too tired and hungover and I <em>will</em> kill you if you don’t leave.”</p><p>“If you can’t handle the hangover you shouldn’t drink.”</p><p>Agatha growled and Rio groaned, pressing herself closer as if she could block the noise.</p><p>“I’m uninviting you from the wedding.”</p><p>Rio slipped her hand beneath Agatha’s shirt and felt her shift a little beneath her before she rolled them onto their sides and the phantom feeling of eyes on her made Rio blink slowly until she could look up and see Agatha’s face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Come take a bath with me.”</p><p>“No I want to sleep.”</p><p>“I’ll hold you.”</p><p>Rio frowned and rubbed her eyes, watching as Agatha raised her brows and made a motion with her head that she knew meant ‘it’s our only escape’.</p><p>Rolling her eyes and finding that even that hurt, Rio huffed and slowly peeled herself from the bed, feeling three sets of eyes on her as she shuffled to the bathroom.</p><p>She must look a state. But she couldn’t bring herself to care.</p><p>Once inside she perched on the edge of the bath and reached to turn the hot water on, swaying a little where she sat before placing her head in her hands and wondering why tequila was invented and who she could kill for releasing such a horror into the world.</p><p>There were more words exchanged in the bedroom that she couldn’t quite focus in on and then she heard the door shut behind her and the noises of Agatha moving about the small space, adding sudden scents into the air of lavender and honeysuckle.</p><p>And then the return of hands against her skin, squeezing her knees, and the soft weight of Agatha’s head in her lap.</p><p>“Jen’s not coming to the wedding. I mean it. She’s uninvited.”</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh and reached a hand down to run her fingers through Agatha’s tangled mane, “Fine by me. Not sure I’ll make it to next week anyway.”</p><p>“Have to. Have to marry me.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>They both went silent, Rio huffing slowly as she reached her elbow up to lean on the nearby sink, feeling her ability to stay awake disappearing slippery quick.</p><p>“The dancer,” Agatha murmured softly, her face turning a little more against Rio’s bare thigh so her lips could be felt against her skin. “Did she touch you at all?”</p><p>Rio’s fingers went still against Agatha’s scalp and she felt the steady warmth of her breath tickle her inner thigh.</p><p>“Agatha, I…”</p><p>“I know, I know. I trust you I just…”</p><p>Rio reached down and slipped her fingers below Agatha’s chin to lift her head up, forcing herself to think hard about what had happened the night before, “She got as far as sitting on my knee.”</p><p>The tequila-hazed memory made her shiver slightly.</p><p>“She knew I wasn’t into it. I grabbed Alice and she moved away.”</p><p>Blue eyes flickered closed then, and Rio saw the way Agatha’s jaw flexed and then relaxed and she released a slow breath. “Okay, okay.”</p><p>Rio sighed and moved her fingers up and through Agatha’s hair again, watching her for a second before she closed her eyes once more, the memory of the previous night doing nothing to help ease her suffering.</p><p>She didn’t know how long she’d sat like that, miraculously having not fallen backwards into the bath. But soon Agatha was moving before her, encouraging her gently to get up and remove her clothes.</p><p>As Rio shuffled from her little white shorts she turned to see Agatha already in amongst the bubbles, her hand out to her and expectant.</p><p>She took it and stepped cautiously into the bath before her, and once secure enough in Agatha’s hold she settled properly back against her and closed her eyes.</p><p>“Go to sleep.”</p><p>The words were ephemera to Rio who had already begun to drift off, safe in Agatha’s comforting hold.</p><p>Twice Agatha refilled the bath with a dose of hot water and both times Rio slept through it, rousing only slightly to nuzzle against Agatha’s neck or to encourage her to tighten her hold.</p><p>By the time their skin was pruning and Agatha’s back was aching from holding them both above the water line, Rio had come around again, more fully this time.</p><p>She groaned and pulled away slowly, sitting up and bending forwards to hold her head. “I’m never drinking again.”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha said softly, her voice gravely still as she slid closer and pressed up against Rio’s back, her legs wrapping around her waist. “But you were so cute last night.”</p><p>“Crashing into the apartment?”</p><p>“No, trying to smoke a cigarette when you could barely stand.”</p><p>Rio froze and for a second focused on the soft brush of Agatha’s lips over her shoulder blade, trying to make sense of what she’d just heard. “I thought I dreamt that.”</p><p>“No, Alice text Jen where you were and I wanted to see you… she said you’d been talking about me all night.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly and cautiously stretched her back up, groaning at the strain on her tired muscles even as Agatha’s arms wrapped around her again and she pressed her face into the crook of her neck. She felt her smile against her skin. “I missed you. I wish you’d stayed.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, her hands dropping below the lukewarm water to hold Agatha’s arm. She still felt woozy, grey, and like she wanted to die, but Agatha’s steady hold on her prevented her from slipping fully into the worst of her hangover and she leant back more to be held.</p><p>“Why didn’t you?”</p><p>“Natasha would have killed me.”</p><p>“Not something you’d usually worry about.”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a second and then spoke after kissing Rio’s shoulder, “Those girls were your family before I was. You needed a night with just them.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding and squeezed Agatha’s arms where they still rested around her. “They’re letting me back on the team.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Mmhm. On the proviso my hot wife occasionally makes an appearance at games.”</p><p>“Oh? Will I have to wear my Vidal jersey?”</p><p>“Of course. I’ll get you a new one too, the proper colours. Maybe you can go braless underneath. Give me something to look forward to after a long, hard game.”</p><p>“Are you telling me that you’re so hungover you could die and you’re thinking about my tits?”</p><p>“Thinking, fantasising, whatever.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and kissed Rio’s shoulder again, “Okay. Braless at a basketball field.”</p><p>“Court,” Rio corrected, “and maybe I’ll teach you how the game actually works too.”</p><p>“Ball in goal, easy.”</p><p>“Net. You’re doing this on purpose.”</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and turned her head as best she could, feeling at least a little better than she had before. “Do you think they’ve left?”</p><p>“If not, Alice is uninvited too.”</p><p>But by the time the two had peeled themselves from each other and entered into the bedroom again dressed in light pyjama shorts and tops kept in the  corner cupboard of the little bathroom, they were unhappily greeted with two people in the middle of their bed.</p><p>“Oh good,” Agatha deadpanned as Rio smiled just a little at a broken looking Alice and went to collapse in the armchair by the window. “I’ll call Jimmy.”</p><p>“No, a day after bachelorettes is time to gossip. Order food and we can do just that. Now that you’re clean. Maybe open some windows too.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and went to grab a sweater from the drawer to throw over her t-shirt and she handed one to Rio too, notably one of her own rather than one of Rio’s which had been folded next to it.</p><p>“I’ll order food and you can stay for <em>one hour</em> and then you’re leaving. Or so help me god-…”</p><p>“Alright, alright. An hour. But if the gossip isn’t good enough then I’m staying longer.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and went to sit down by Rio’s feet, shifting her left to dangle over her shoulder and reaching to hold her calf.</p><p>Rio could feel another wave of tiredness hit her and she wondered whether she’d even last the hour but she couldn’t think of any gossip that might satiate Jen’s hunger.</p><p>That was until the subject of last night’s juiciest gossip appeared in the doorway looking far from fresh faced.</p><p>The day’s first true, proper smile graced Rio’s face as she looked up at her best friend. She had one juicy piece of gossip. Surely it was good enough to warrant Jen leaving in an hour, as promised. </p><p>Natasha looked back at her curiously as Rio took a deep breath and announced with some gusto: </p><p>“Natasha fucked the stripper in the bathroom.”</p><p>——</p><p>The day of the wedding soon rolled around and Rio had never felt so simultaneously ready and unprepared in her life.</p><p>Once she’d recovered from her hangover with a lot of sleep, a lot of carbs, and barely an inch of distance between herself and Agatha all day, she’d spent the rest of the week spending as much time as possible on the basketball court, colluding with Agatha to hide away from Jen as best they both could.</p><p>Agatha had taken to using Rio’s little apartment - that she’d long since vacated to move into the Washington house - partly because Jen didn’t know where it was and mostly because it was close to where Rio would be playing.</p><p>They often slept over there, Rio exhausted from tearing up the court and getting her mojo back and Agatha exhausted from taking advantage of her willing wife in the bedroom.</p><p>Only their new bodyguards knew where they were. But even then, there’d been no incident with men with cameras following them for a while and so even Agatha was beginning to see that maybe she was being too cautious: a fact that Rio loved to rub in and Agatha did not like being on the receiving end of.</p><p>Agatha dismissed the protection officers three days before the wedding.</p><p>But Jen was determined.</p><p>Where Agatha set up a little home office in Rio’s cosy apartment to continue her secret mission to help a Democrat get into office, Jen blew up her phone and her email.</p><p>She wanted to be involved in the details, wanted to have access to their entire itinerary for the wedding. Both Agatha and Rio knew it was care rather than control that spurred her on but it felt a lot like the latter when they were both tired.</p><p>Agatha gave sparing details to her oldest friend: <em> “Yes the hotel is already booked. Yes for everyone attending. Yes you and Alice have a suite. Yes for three days. No you and Natasha are the witnesses. Because Rio wanted Natasha. Yes she loves Alice. Jen I am not arguing with you about who Rio loves more. No we’re not hiring a glam squad. Yes you can help do makeup. No we won’t have bouquets.” </em></p><p>It went on and on.</p><p>And in the end Agatha and Rio were grateful for their little sequestered time in Rio’s tiny apartment. More than anything, it confirmed for them both something they already knew, that they’d be happy anywhere they were as long as they were together.</p><p>But the day rolled around all the same, as days tend to.</p><p>After an exhausting night of arguments with Agatha about when was the absolute latest they should stop having sex and actually go to sleep (neither won, neither knew which way they nor the other was fighting, they fell asleep at three am), Rio found herself in a decadent suite with Natasha, who looked very out of place in a hotel like this.</p><p>Jen had insisted that her and Agatha remain apart for the day, as they weren’t planning on heading to City Hall until much later; where they’d booked in for a fifteen minute slot at seven o’clock.</p><p>They’d only both agreed because Jen had been on one so much that she was beginning to aggravate even Rio and Agatha had had to step in at one point when Jen had made a comment on Natasha’s wedding outfit days before the event had even arrived.</p><p>Rio had almost snapped at her and had ranted in impassioned Spanish later that evening that Agatha had only just understood. Agatha had cooled her down but she didn’t want to risk Rio exploding on Jen on the day so she agreed they could be separated.</p><p>But Rio’s grumpiness with the separation had died a little when she’d stepped into her assigned suite with Natasha at the Four Seasons and had seen the ridiculous floral arrangement that Agatha had commissioned. It contained all of Rio’s favourite flowers: purple azaleas, because they reminded her of Agatha; white gypsophila, because the intricate little flower reminded her to move softly in the world; and white roses, because they were perfect in their simplicity. There was a small card with them and Agatha had written, in her improving Spanish: “My love, a petal for every thought I’ll have of you in the time we’re apart today. Agatha.”</p><p>Rio had swooned so hard she’d almost collapsed.</p><p>In the other suite, across the floor, Agatha had arrived to a different gift, that was no less meaningful though slightly less ostentatious. Sitting on the coffee table was a little bag with a gift wrapped in delicate tissue. The gift was a photo of the two of them kissing, sun-kissed and radiant on the sunbed of their temporary Barbados home. Rio had taken it on a cheap disposable camera she’d bought in a tourist shop one day by the beach and though the majority of the photos she’d captured had been unusable or blurry, this one had come out perfectly.</p><p>Her own card to Agatha read: ‘Agatha, I can’t wait to kiss you like this again as your official, legal, loving wife. Rio x’</p><p>Agatha had swooned too.</p><p>And so Rio sat in an armchair that she would have preferred to be curled up in with Agatha with a glass of red in her hands and her best friend in her sights.</p><p>“Something’s not right,” she was saying softly, her eyes wide and worried.</p><p>“You wanna get out of here? You still have time to-…”</p><p>“No. Obviously I don’t. It’s not that. Something’s not right. I can feel it.”</p><p>Natasha sighed quietly and leant up from her reclined position, swinging her legs over the edge of the huge couch. “Okay. Have you forgotten something?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Did you leave the stove on?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Natasha looked down at her watch and saw that it was almost five.</p><p>There for silence for a while in the opulent suite and then Natasha turned her gaze back to Rio. She raised a brow, watching her for a while before she said in a much softer tone than before, “It’s just me.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath as Natasha’s words registered and she had to hold it in as she felt the pain strike her heart.</p><p>That was it. Something wasn’t wrong. Something was missing.</p><p>Natasha put her glass down and moved slowly across, crouching before Rio and softly saying: “It’s okay. You’re allowed to feel sad about it.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and breathed out quietly, releasing the heavy breath she’d been holding. In the whirlwind of the last few weeks and days, she’d not allowed herself to think on the two people she’d want there more than anyone.</p><p>Her hand was taken up and raised to Natasha’s cheek where she let it be held for a while before she looked down into her friend’s eyes.</p><p>“They should be here.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I want them to know her.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“It’s not fair.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio nodded and brushed her thumb along Natasha’s cheekbone before she pulled her hand away entirely and dropped her gaze to her lap, feeling the weight of what was missing settle about her like a dark cloud.</p><p>“You know what Maria would say?”</p><p>“What?” Rio asked quietly as she raised her gaze again.</p><p>“She’d say: ¿una gringo? Cariño, yo quería lindos nietos puertorriqueños!” <em>A white woman? Honey, I wanted cute Puerto Rican grandkids!</em></p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes, “She never said ‘gringo’ in her life.”</p><p>“Semantics.”</p><p>“Right.” Rio laughed again and motioned for Natasha to lean up so she could hug her properly, making pains not to spill her wine.</p><p>“You think it’s too late to run over and speak to Agatha?”</p><p>“You want backup?”</p><p>“No. But I want you to tell me it’s not insane to ask if she’d wear mom’s diamond.”</p><p>Rio pulled back then and bit down on her lip, watching as Natasha frowned slightly, clearly the idea of it bouncing about her brain for a while before she could come up with a response.</p><p>“I think she’d do anything you asked.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little but felt the sadness sitting just below the surface as she rested her forehead against Natasha’s and sighed out. “Thank you for being here.”</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>As they separated Rio went to the mirror to check she hadn’t ruined her face and took a second to analyse it. She was makeup free, but had applied as many creams, ointments, and treatments as would mean she wouldn’t look like she’d been up until three the previous morning.</p><p>Her lips were full, if not stained ever so slightly by her choice of pre-wedding tipple. Her skin was still more tanned than usual, thanks to her genes and the hot sun she’d bathed in for almost two months. And the eyes that stared back were her mother’s. She knew, too, that if she had it in her to grin in that moment then she’d see her father. So she carried them with her wherever she went. And now she was going to ask Agatha to carry a symbol for and of them too. </p><p> Shaking off the fresh tears that threatened to spill, she went to find her little bag full of jewellery and rummaged for a while until she found the very thing she was looking for.</p><p>She deposited it in the front pocket of her hoodie and then shot Natasha one last smile before she stepped from the room and walked down the hall to where she knew Agatha to be.</p><p>Rio knocked lightly, only because she had already been warned by Jen that she’d have to stick to her room with Natasha and not interrupt anything that was going on with the three best friends that afternoon. Apparently the only person allowed to play double-agent was Alice, who had been running back and forth between the rooms like a demented, sometimes squealing sometimes crying, chicken.</p><p>Natasha wasn’t very amused by this.</p><p>But the door was answered after a few seconds and Jen poked her head through the few inches she’d opened it.</p><p>“Can I speak to Agatha?”</p><p>“No. It’s bad luck.”</p><p>“Jen-…”</p><p>“No, Rio. You’ll see her soon. Go away.”</p><p>Jen slammed the door in Rio’s face and Rio stood in shock staring at it, so close that she could see the grain of the wood.</p><p>There was a noise then, a sudden yell and what sounded like a scuffle, potentially someone being slammed into something heavy, another yell, and then the door was open again.</p><p>It was Agatha this time.</p><p>She looked a little frazzled in her dressing gown and she was huffing but was pleased to see Rio. “Sorry about… is everything okay?”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and nodded, “Yeah. I just wanted to talk to you, that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha looked worried then, her brow furrowing as she pressed Rio backwards and moved with her to close the door behind them, “Honey what is it?”</p><p>“I wanted to ask,” Rio cleared her throat and looked down at her feet, suddenly more nervous than she’d ever been in Agatha’s presence. The hand that still held her waist for once not providing the comfort it usually did.</p><p>“Agatha, I-…”</p><p>But Rio’s nerves were nothing compared with Agatha’s fear. It hit her slowly, every second Rio was taking to say what she was trying to say causing it to grow and take hold of her heart. It felt constricting, like the coils of a snake winding its way around her fragile hopes.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha managed to whisper, stepping into Rio a little more and moving her free hand to guide her face up so she could see her eyes, “Whatever it is… it’s okay.”</p><p>Rio swallowed again but nodded and began to toy with the opening of Agatha’s robe. “When my mom and dad died they didn’t leave a lot behind. Mostly because they didn’t have a lot but also because they-…” Rio stopped and began chewing on her lip, giving Agatha time to relax her racing, aching heart and gently manoeuvre Rio back against the wall so she could crowd her more fully, moving her thumb to release her lower lip.</p><p>“Honey, you know I love hearing about your parents. I know you miss them. I know you wish they were here, I do too. Do you want to go somewhere alone to talk about it properly? We have time before the ceremony.”</p><p>The reminder of their impending nuptials and the solid presence of the wall behind her, as well as Agatha’s hands now cupping her face were all she needed.</p><p>Because this Agatha certainly wasn’t a figment of her imagination. This Agatha had her, would have her, in this and every reality.</p><p>She breathed out slowly and moved her hands up Agatha’s front, resting her shaking fingers against Agatha’s neck and brushing her thumb lightly in the hollow of Agatha’s throat.</p><p>“They didn’t leave me much of anything,” she continued slowly, feeling the sadness hit again, and keeping her eyes down on her thumb now resting at the base of Agatha’s neck. “But when they… got them out… they were able to salvage her ring. Her engagement ring.”</p><p>Watery brown eyes raised slowly to meet Agatha’s and Rio found in them confusion and hesitance but a patience that let her know she could continue.</p><p>“I took the diamond out. My mom’s fingers were smaller than mine anyway so I put it into a necklace. The diamond isn’t big, my dad didn’t have a lot of money so it’s small. Tiny, really. A fraction of a carat. If that. And for a couple years after they passed I wore it every day until… I just didn’t anymore.”</p><p>Her gaze dropped down to her hand, her fingers now stretched up to graze along Agatha’s jaw, “I thought about maybe taking the diamond and giving it to you for your engagement ring but it didn’t feel… I don’t know it didn’t feel right. But,” she gulped and looked down, reaching into the pouch of her hoodie to produce a delicate gold chain with a small diamond hanging from it. It was barely anything: certainly not as brilliant as the diamond on Rio’s finger or the diamonds on Agatha’s, and nothing compared to the other jewellery Agatha already owned. It was tiny, but it was beautiful.</p><p>Rio let the necklace pool in her open palm and glanced up at Agatha who had stepped even closer, holding Rio tightly at her sides.</p><p>“Anyway, I wondered if, if you would maybe wear it today. I know it’s last minute. But I just… I miss them. I wish they were here and...”</p><p>A movement made Rio glance up suddenly, worried that Agatha might either be uncomfortable with the request or think it were juvenile. But Agatha had only shuffled on the spot, clinging to the fabric of Rio’s hoodie.</p><p>“My dad got it for my mom because he loved her and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her and… they were so happy. Will you wear it?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze had dropped to the gift offered to her and she felt the snake that had wrapped itself around her heart slither away, disappearing with the knowledge that Rio had one precious reminder of her parents and she was giving it to her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed out slowly, leaning in to press her forehead against hers. “I would be <em>proud</em> to wear it. But… Are you sure you don’t want to?”</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly where it was still connected to Agatha’s and she reached up to secure the necklace expertly about Agatha’s neck. “I know mom would have wanted you to have it. She’d have loved you and-…” but as she felt the mechanism click securely in place she noticed a silent tear streaming down Agatha’s cheek and she reached back to wipe it away, frowning as she tilted their heads to kiss her soon-to-be-legal wife.</p><p>“Ah ah!” The sound came the moment their lips brushed for the first time since that morning and Agatha groaned against Rio, turning the delicate kiss into a firmer one, acting out against whoever was trying to steal her away from her girl.</p><p>“Agatha,” the voice insisted, and Agatha was pulled from Rio, a stern face staring back at her instead now as Jen stepped in and Alice appeared at her side, though <em>she</em>, at least, was smiling.</p><p>Rio let out a soft laugh that was more like relief as she took in the sight of her mom’s diamond around Agatha’s neck. Agatha, on the other hand, looked thunderous again and she wiped quickly at her cheek to hide her tears and rounded on Jen and Alice in one go. “Would you both <em>please</em> just-…!”</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>It was Natasha this time and Rio turned to smile at her best friend who looked less than happy about this party in the hallway. She sauntered over and glanced between them all, her eyes landing on the small diamond now just below the base of Agatha’s throat.</p><p>“She took it then?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio breathed happily, resting her head back against the wall and grinning at her wife who raised her brows at Natasha and looked suddenly defensive.</p><p>“You thought I wouldn’t.”</p><p>“Little small for your tastes. I hear-…”</p><p>But Rio had launched herself at Natasha and was battering her to turn her around and usher her back to their room as Alice began howling with laughter behind them and Jen muttered something about ‘nasty work’. Agatha was biting the inside of her cheek but couldn’t deny that the cool metal of her new necklace was calming her down, even slightly. Though she’d be getting Natasha back later.</p><p>As Rio turned to enter her room behind Natasha she shot her an apologetic look and then disappeared inside.</p><p>Once in the safety of her suite, she released Natasha and collapsed back against the closed door, her whole body shaking a little from the release of the nerves that had been building up all morning.</p><p>Natasha was laughing, delighted with the reaction to her little dig and if it hadn’t been for the firm rasp of knuckles against the door behind Rio’s head, Rio would have laughed with her.</p><p>But the knock jolted her from her position on the door and she assumed it would be Jen back to shout at her for breaking ‘the rules’.</p><p>She pulled back and opened the door, ready for the barrage of Jen’s angry words. Only it wasn’t Jen, it was Agatha.</p><p>And she didn’t have the time to process this information because Agatha was on her faster than she could think.</p><p>Strong hands found her face and Rio was pressed back a few steps further into the room as Agatha slammed their lips together, in a searing, intense kiss.</p><p>Rio whimpered into it, gripping at Agatha’s robe to steady herself as the weight of the other woman pressed into her, turning them to press Rio into the wall so she could press harder, kiss more desperately.</p><p>The sounds they made were unholy but Agatha seemed desperate to devour her, sucking her tongue furiously into her own mouth and moaning as Rio grabbed at her, pressing up and into her.</p><p>Natasha, who for a second had short circuited and stared at the horror before her with wide eyes, soon marched off into the en suite, slamming the door behind her with such power that the walls around them shook.</p><p>But Agatha only broke the kiss when she thought she’d faint from the lack of oxygen reaching her brain and even then she kept close, her swollen lips ghosting along Rio’s as she panted against her, “I had to just…”</p><p>But Rio’s eyes were still closed, her fingers tight in the light fabric of Agatha’s robe that now hung open slightly, and she nodded, understanding what Agatha had meant and not wanting to break the spell.</p><p>Agatha kissed her again then, pressing her back against the wall as she did, slipping one hand beneath Rio’s oversized hoodie to clutch at her smooth skin and groaning a little when Rio tugged at her hair.</p><p>But Jen had clearly caught up with her, though Alice had tried to hold her back, and Agatha was ripped from Rio’s clutches once more.</p><p>“Could you <em>please</em>,” Agatha shouted, slapping Jen’s hands away as Alice slipped in to body block her from Rio, “leave us alone!”</p><p>Alice was smirking and Rio sighed as she draped her arms over her shoulders and smiled serenely at Agatha, still on a high seeing the small diamond at her throat and now a little punch drunk from the intensity of their kiss.</p><p>“Technically it is the rules,” she trilled, watching the look of shock and betrayal settle across Agatha’s face as Alice reached to hold her forearms.</p><p>“Traitor.”</p><p>“You will have so much time to make out later. You cannot keep doing it before the ceremony.”</p><p>Jen began pushing at Agatha but Agatha had eyes only for Rio and continued to scowl at her, even as Rio smiled and blew a kiss in her direction.</p><p>“Playing with fire,” Alice muttered, turning her head to shoot Rio a wink before she pulled away and disappeared with the other two out of the room.</p><p>Rio collapsed back against the wall with a grin and laughed at the absurdity of everything that had just happened.</p><p>She clutched at her racing heart, something she’d previously only thought people did in movies, and sank slowly down to the floor as her eyes spilled over with tears; tears for her parents missing this day, for Agatha loving her so much, and for the future they would have together.</p><p>Another hour and a half went by and Rio got herself dressed with not much help from Natasha who lounged on the bed saying not much of anything and only really commenting when Rio was finally draped in her silk gown.</p><p>“She’s going to have a heart attack.”</p><p>“Shut up. How does it look?”</p><p>Rio had chosen to go dress shopping alone, not wanting any fuss from anyone. She’d found a little boutique in the Nolita area of the city and amongst the racks of dresses in all shapes and sizes she’d found exactly what she was looking for.</p><p>And so, little Rio Vidal who used to run around the playground with teeth too big for her mouth and limbs too long for her body, picked the dress that she would wear to marry the woman of her dreams.</p><p>It was pure white silk, with two thin spaghetti straps and just enough cleavage to be suggestive without being too much.</p><p>It hugged her body in all the right places and coupled with a red lip, matching red nails, white strappy heeled sandals, and pearl drop earrings, against her tan fresh from the beaches of Barbados, she looked a million dollars.</p><p>“I’m not kidding,” Natasha said with a smirk, “you look so good even I want to jump you.”</p><p>“You can’t say that on my wedding day.”</p><p>“She’ll die.”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned around to check herself over once more in the mirror, fiddling nervously with the straps. “You don’t think it’s a little…?”</p><p>“A little what?” Natasha asked as she slid from the bed and stood behind Rio in her red dress, making eye contact through the mirror. “You look beautiful.”</p><p>Rio turned and smiled gratefully, pulling Natasha into a tight hug and then kissing her temple as she pulled away.</p><p>“Don’t kill anybody on the way there, okay? Particularly Alice. She’s only little.”</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes and as Rio made to move past her she grabbed her hand and made her turn. Her expression was softer now, as soft as it had been when Rio had been upset before and she took a deep breath before saying: “I love you. I’m proud of you.”</p><p>“Natasha…”</p><p>“Let me, okay? You are the best person in the world and she doesn’t deserve you but I’m glad you have her. She makes you happy and… and that’s all I care about.”</p><p>Rio nodded, knowing that was about as much as Natasha would ever be able to give her on the subject of Agatha.</p><p>“No one else in the world would kill for you.”</p><p>“You did.”</p><p>“Yeah but I always would, wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Rio stepped back in and held her best friend’s face up, smiling as a tear fell from her eyes. She took a second, scanning over the face she knew so well, before whispering. “I love you, thank you for loving me enough to kill for me, for protecting her too. For staying after you did, and for being here today.”</p><p>Natasha only nodded and as her own eyes filled with unshed tears she pulled back and away, clearing her throat softly. “Go see her. I’ll catch you when you’re done.”</p><p>And so Rio wiped her own tears, making quick strides to the designated meeting area that Jen had dubbed as acceptable to allow them to have five minutes together in before they all made their way to City Hall.</p><p>Alice was waiting outside the door when Rio arrived and she gasped when she saw her, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>“You look phenomenal.”</p><p>“So do you.”</p><p>“No, Rio, I’m not kidding. You look… she’s going to lose it.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip and looked to the closed door that barred her from laying eyes on her bride. She began fidgeting with her fingers and Alice reached to hold them, “I think you might lose it too. She’s gone for this…” but she trailed off and smiled knowingly, “You’ll love it, trust me. She looks ridiculously gorgeous.”

</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks heat up and she looked down at Alice’s hand in her own and toyed with her fingers for a second before she asked, “Are you sure I look okay? Maybe I should have gone for something a bit more… bridal. It’s quite simple. A bit boring maybe.”</p><p>“Rio.” Alice’s tone was firmer now, and she stepped a little closer, “There is a woman in there who has gone to the ends of the earth to be with you. You could have rocked up in your basketball shorts and she’d still think you were the most gorgeous woman on the planet. The dress is killer. Now, get in there because we’re eating into your time.” </p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes but smiled and then glanced at the door, “How strict are we on the five minute rule?”</p><p>Alice’s expression faltered and she shifted on the spot, her hands slipping into the pockets of her pants, “Jen did say it would be <em>my</em> head on a line if you took longer than…”</p><p>“Enough said. We’ll be good, I promise.”</p><p>Alice looked relieved then and opened the door for Rio, stepping back as she stepped into the room and closing it softly behind her.</p><p>The room was large, so bright that it took Rio a second to calibrate and find the thing she was looking for. But soon her eyes adjusted and she spotted her standing in front of one of the tall windows.</p><p>She had her back to Rio, her hands either side of her hips and her fingers resting lightly on the window ledge as she looked down onto the street below.</p><p>She took her in for a second, her eyes sweeping upwards from the white stilettos with red soles, along the crisp lines of her tailored pants, up the cut of her blazer, and to the soft waves of her chocolate brown hair.</p><p>Agatha’s back was ramrod straight, her posture exacting, and she still hadn’t turned around.</p><p>Rio hesitated for a split second, wondering if Agatha were simply nervous or if she were so in her own head that she had yet to realise Rio was in the room.</p><p>But that couldn’t be right. Agatha always knew when Rio was in the room. She had a knack of finding her across the room at parties, in the midst of crowds at rush hour, in some random corner of the house where she could be found watering an almost-forgotten plant.</p><p>And so Rio spoke first, unsure why Agatha hadn’t turned.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>The name hung in the air amidst the silence, cutting through it like a curved knife, taking the shape of the soft lines of the letters.</p><p>There was a beat. Then another. And then Agatha turned.</p><p>Rio was unsure who gasped first, or if neither of them did, or just one.</p><p>But Agatha had turned and her eyes had landed on Rio for the first time in an hour, for the first time with them both in the outfits they’d chosen to wear as they started their new lives together.</p><p>Agatha’s blazer was open, showing a soft shirt underneath that had thin white buttons and hung open at her chest, showing enough freckled skin that made Rio feel suddenly hot in her slip of a dress. Much like the woman wearing it, the fabric of her suit was much softer than Rio had thought from a first look. And sitting pride of place around her neck was the speck of a diamond Rio had given her earlier.</p><p>The light from the window behind her framed Agatha in such as way that she looked ethereal, angelic. And Rio felt like she couldn’t breathe as she stared at her.</p><p>She didn’t notice that Agatha’s blue eyes were making the same journey Rio had just made across her body. She didn’t notice that Agatha had stopped breathing. She didn’t notice the slight flush in her cheeks as she took her all in. She didn’t notice that her hands had curled tightly around the window ledge just to keep herself standing.</p><p>But Rio took a breath, and when she thought she could no longer stand the silence, she said: “Are you okay, Mrs Vidal?”</p><p>“Don’t call me that.”</p><p>“Why not?” Rio’s breathing hitched slightly; audibly, so that Agatha’s eyes darted up to look to her surprised face.</p><p>“Because I might lose it before we make it down the aisle.”</p><p>And Rio knew just what she meant. Because she could see her own incredulity that this was the day reflected in Agatha’s gaze. That this was the day the world would know them to belong to each other.</p><p>It was more than sex. More than love. It was everything.</p><p>And Agatha didn’t move. So Rio moved for her.</p><p>She began to walk closer and saw Agatha’s lips falter slightly as if trying to form words, but no noise came. Her blue eyes sparkled with tears that sat just at her waterline. Her arms raised slowly to catch Rio as she got within touching distance and she pulled her to her as if she were afraid she’d be snatched away.</p><p>But all that was behind them. Rio was here. And Rio wasn’t letting go.</p><p>Rio raised her hands to cup Agatha’s cheeks, melting into her slowly, as if they had more time than the meagre five minutes they’d been allotted.</p><p>“You look-…”</p><p>“Beautiful,” Agatha breathed out, finishing Rio’s thought and echoing the sentiment back to her.</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s parted lips twitched slightly, her tongue darting out to wet her lower one, drawing Rio’s gaze to it and her heart to thrum readily in her chest.</p><p>“I can’t believe-…”</p><p>“Believe it,” Rio murmured, her own brain shooting fireworks rather than neurones.</p><p>She leant in then, tasting Agatha’s lipstick, the colour of Rio’s favourite Shiraz on a summer’s day.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on Rio’s waist tightened and she leant fully into the kiss, until she suddenly wasn’t, and she had pulled back again to look Rio over once more.</p><p>Rio blinked as Agatha’s hands ghosted the soft silk and raised to draw up the thin straps, finally reaching to brush the corner of Rio’s mouth, where her lipstick had smudged.</p><p>“I keep thinking,” Rio whispered, turning her head slightly to kiss the thumb against her lip, “if I hadn’t turned up that day. If I hadn’t taken the bait, met you on the plane.”</p><p>“I’d have found you. Somehow. It might have taken longer and it might not have looked the same but…”</p><p>“We’d be together,” Rio concluded quietly, her brow furrowing a little as she surveyed Agatha’s sure blue eyes. Agatha leant in again, sealing the whispered promise with a gentle kiss as her hands settled back at Rio’s waist and ghosted over supple silk to press her closer.</p><p>No sooner had Agatha’s hold become more solid, and Rio’s heart rate had picked up again when their chests pressed firmly together, than the door had opened.</p><p>Jen was standing with Alice on her arm, both looking giddy and both unsurprised to see the two women in the window pressed so close their bodies formed one, single, smooth shape.</p><p>“Time’s up. Time to go!”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and stole another kiss, her eyes still on Agatha, who smiled back at her and squeezed her waist.</p><p>“Ready?”</p><p>A soft chuckle escaped Rio’s lips and she sighed dramatically as she pressed closer to Agatha, stretching her arms out behind Agatha’s head, “I suppose so.”</p><p>“God you’re both gross.”</p><p>The gross two in question laughed and Rio slowly pulled back from Agatha’s hold, briefly letting her hands slip to Agatha’s lapels as her gaze fell a few inches further south from her eyes.</p><p>“Unbelievable,” Jen trilled, marching forwards as Agatha’s strong hold on Rio returned and she had ducked her head to kiss her again, all concerns about keeping her lipstick in place forgotten.</p><p>But Jen was on her in an instant and Agatha was forcibly removed from Rio like a child tugged from the cookie jar.</p><p>“Feral. Honestly.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and managed to kiss Rio’s cheek quickly but she took her hand and stepped back, sweeping her gaze over Rio’s dress once more before she walked her to the door.</p><p>Just outside it was Natasha, smirking a little and raising her brows in question. “Ready?”</p><p>“Like you wouldn’t believe.”</p><p>Rio, despite Agatha’s protestations, had hired a car for the occasion. Two cars, in fact. One for them and one for Natasha, Jen, and Alice.</p><p>She’d insisted that Jimmy were invited to the post-ceremony dinner, given that he had been a constant in Agatha’s life for years now. And given the fact that he’d also been helping her, doing his best to protect her, Rio thought he deserved a place at the table and a night off.</p><p>“I’ll slide,” Agatha offered, stepping into the car and moving only a little ways along the back bench which made Rio smile. She wanted to be close.</p><p>Both Agatha and the driver held their hands out to Rio and wanting to hold one forever and not wanting to offend the other, she took both, and slipped gracefully into the car beside her bride.</p><p>The moment Rio sat beside her Agatha kissed the back of her hand and pulled her so she was flush against her side. She kept her hand and kissed the space where her rings would usually be on her empty ring finger.</p><p>“You look unbelievable.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio grinned and shifted in place to rest her hand in the opening of Agatha’s shirt, letting her thumb brush the warm skin of her exposed chest. “I cannot tell you how <em>good you</em> look.”</p><p>The impact was immediate. Agatha’s eyes dropped to Rio’s lips and as they pulled away into the traffic, she slipped her arm around her lower back and turned more into her.</p><p>“We have time between the ceremony and dinner, right?”</p><p>Rio laughed and raised her brows, grinning at Agatha who was still looking at her lips. “No. We have to go straight there.”</p><p>“We can be late.”</p><p>“Agatha, I’m telling you now that once I get you alone, properly, in that suit, I’m not going to want to go anywhere. So we can’t-…”</p><p>“In that case, let’s just skip dinner altogether and-…”</p><p>“No. Patience. We have to celebrate.”</p><p>“I’d rather celebrate with your horizontal.”</p><p>“I’d be horizontal in a grave if I let you steal me away from the party. Jen would kill me.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed and moved to take Rio’s hand again, kissing her palm sweetly, “It’s my wedding day, I should get want I want.”</p><p>“It’s mine too,” Rio smirked and wriggled her fingers in Agatha’s hold, “And I promise you that when we’re done celebrating with our friends…” she pushed the hand against Agatha’s chest further below her shirt, resting it just across the swell of her breast, “…We can be horizontal all night.”</p><p>This promise was met with a pleased smile and the rest of the way to City Hall, they spent pressed close together, neither pushing past what was strictly decent but neither exactly wanting to be far from the other.</p><p>Once they’d arrived, Agatha slipped out first, moving around to help Rio step from the car and onto the sidewalk. Around them, the lifeblood of the city moved: the businessmen in cookie-cutter suits, the women in their click-clacking heels, the tourists lost on their way to the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>And before them stood the building where they were to make their marriage official. It was grand and oppressive in a way that only beautiful government buildings could be. But it was their gateway to their life together and so Rio thought it was the most beautiful building in the world.</p><p>Soon gathering about them were their chosen families. Natasha looked unimpressed but shot Rio a soft smile when she caught her eye. Jen and Alice were hand in hand and looked impatient, for different reasons. And Lilia, Billy, and Jimmy had arrived too, each giving each bride a warm hug. When Jimmy pulled away from Rio he produced a small fabric white rose from behind her ear and offered it to her. She gladly accepted and slipped it quickly into the button hole of Agatha’s blazer where it happily stayed for the rest of the day.</p><p>The little troop marched up the stone steps to the entrance led by the two women in white. As they went they passed other couples on their way in, and out. Some looked just as happy as they were, some looked stressed. But Rio could help but feel that none of them could possibly be as in love as they were.</p><p>And when Agatha moved to hold her waist as they finally found themselves at the entrance to the little room where they were to make their marriage official, she knew that no love in the world had ever been as strong as this one.</p><p>The ceremony was quiet and quick, with the officiant focusing on the legalities of the institution of marriage and none of the romance.</p><p>They’d opted not to do vows because Agatha had insisted that they’d waited too long anyway and that this was merely a hoop they had to jump through when really they were already married.</p><p>But even as the officiant droned on about the ‘legally binding contract’, Rio was watching Agatha’s face, seeing the unshed tears form and threaten to spill over.</p><p>Agatha had apparently decided that at some point the ceremony had slipped from a legal necessity to a hopeless romantic’s nightmare. And Rio was suspicious that this had happened the moment they’d set foot in the building.</p><p>But it was almost over, they’d almost said their piece. They were almost married.</p><p>Rio stepped a little closer to her almost wife and kissed her hand gently even as the officiant paused her ramblings to watch this interaction with an unamused expression as if Rio had shoved her tongue down her bride’s throat rather than giving her some gentle reassurance with a brush of her lips over her knuckles.</p><p>The idle thought that perhaps couples who opted for a quicker ceremony weren’t usually this affectionate and the officiant was just surprised crossed her mind but she focused quickly back in on Agatha, and soon met her gaze with a reassuring smile. </p><p>The rambling continued and only after the ‘I dos’ had been spoken and the rings had been replaced on their fingers did Agatha relax again. She kissed Rio with such fervour that intentionally or not, she dipped her back in a move straight out of a Disney movie.</p><p>Agatha tasted salty against her tongue as their tears mingled together and Rio felt her stomach flip when Agatha pulled her back to a standing position and buried her face smiling into her neck.</p><p>It was done. They were married.</p><p>Rio hadn’t expected the rush of feelings to hit her the way they did. But suddenly their union was solidified, their names would be registered together so that history would remember them as joined from this day forwards. Something about that, about their love not being forgotten, made her chest ache with the enormity of the love she had for this woman in her arms.</p><p>But other hands were soon on them and Agatha reluctantly pulled away from her new wife to accept the congratulations of a soft Jen, a crying Alice, an effusive Billy, and a teary Lilia.</p><p>Natasha had made it to Rio first and had placed a firm kiss to her cheek and whispered against her ear, “Tu mamá y tu papá estarían muy orgullosos.” <em>Your mom and dad would be so proud.</em></p><p>Rio began to cry properly then, wrapping her arms around Natasha’s neck as she did. She wasn’t even aware that Natasha had gently passed her back to Agatha, the transition so smooth and so unhurried, as if the two women were acknowledging that whilst Natasha would always be there to catch Rio’s tears, Agatha would be there to dry them.</p><p>But Agatha was there now, holding her face in her hands and tenderly wiping away her tears as she shed her own.</p><p>She kissed her and Rio felt her body relax in her hold, easing her breathing until it matched that of the woman still holding her close.</p><p>When Rio’s lips were able to twitch into a small smile Agatha pulled back a little and directed her to the table and chairs where they would sign their names on the dotted line to confirm their union.</p><p>This went by without a hitch and soon enough the two women who’d just <em>got</em> hitched were ushered out as other couples waited for their own happy moment.</p><p>Natasha and Alice worked on recovering Rio’s face where she’d smudged it through tears and Jen touched up Agatha’s - though she’d tried to slap her away in favour of hovering near Rio again.</p><p>By the time lips, eyes, and cheeks, we’re back to their beautified state, Billy was snapping away with his camera, capturing the day for all eternity.</p><p>Rio and Agatha were patient for once. They both acknowledged that as much as this day was monumental for them, it was just as huge for their friends.</p><p>And so they allowed every one of them the time they needed to pose and preen and take all the photos they wanted.</p><p>In between fights over who was next and whether the lighting was good enough (Jen’s biggest concern), Rio and Agatha settled back into one another each and every time.</p><p>Agatha’s hands always settled at Rio’s waist and Rio’s hand found the opening to Agatha’s chest, resting there as they took the precious few seconds they had to stand alone. Their lips were barely apart and their eyes never leaving the other. It was during one of these moments that Billy captured a photo that would remain framed in the Vidal-Harkness house for the rest of their lives.</p><p>By the time they were able to bundle themselves into the waiting car, Rio was crying again and Agatha wasn’t far behind. But they were tears of joy and disbelief rather than anything else.</p><p>Agatha silently pulled Rio to sit across her lap and brought her face down to kiss it gently, rubbing away the remnants of lipstick she’d left by her cheek.</p><p>“Are you happy?”</p><p>Rio’s hand against Agatha’s chest reached for the little diamond floating there and she smiled as she watched it sparkle in the light, “Ridiculously so.”</p><p>“I wish we’d had vows. I should have made sure we had time for vows.”</p><p>“It was perfect. Really. We didn’t need-…”</p><p>“No,” Agatha insisted with a frown, her whole face collapsing as her eyes darted across Rio’s confused features. “I should have said something. Told you how much I-…”</p><p>But Rio had placed her fingers tentatively over Agatha’s mouth and shushed her. Blue eyes flashed in surprise but her face rebuilt itself, became gentler again, and her hand moved slowly to cradle Rio’s elbow, “It’s okay. I know you love me and you know I love you.”</p><p>“I should have told you,” Agatha mumbled against Rio’s patient fingers, nudging them away with her lips.</p><p>“You did,” Rio promised gently, a smile appearing on her face where Agatha still looked a little regretful.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t quite meet her gaze again and so Rio adjusted her hold on her bride and wrapped her arms around her neck, pressing soft kisses to her face until Agatha gave in and smiled up at her.</p><p>“Did you see the officiant’s look of disgust when you dipped me?”</p><p>“I was too busy kissing my wife so no, why?”</p><p>Rio shrugged a little, idly twirling a strand of Agatha’s hair around her finger, “A bit of casual homophobia on our wedding day.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and began to slide her hand along Rio’s thigh, “Imagine she could see us now.”</p><p>“I’d rather be totally unobserved right now, thank you very much.”</p><p>“I don’t know… I enjoyed you parading around with my name on you last week.”</p><p>“That’s as much exhibitionism as I’d allow. I want you all to myself.”</p><p>“I think we’ve established I don’t like to share but… a little territory marking you know I’m okay with.”</p><p>“We’re straying quite far from my original point,” Rio muttered in amusement as Agatha’s fingers reached dangerously high up her thigh.</p><p>“Your original point was that the person who married us disapproved of us being women.”</p><p>“Come to think of it it could actually have been more to do with the cheesy way you kissed me.”</p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh as Rio grinned toothily, thrilled Agatha was now focused on something else, “Oh honey, you loved it.”</p><p>“Not my point,” Rio teased, pressing a quick kiss to Agatha’s nose as she reached down to hold her hand in place where it sat against the apex of her thigh.</p><p>“It’s my wedding day,” Agatha accused as her gaze flickered down to where her fingers wiggled below the soft fabric of the thin dress.</p><p>“We have to sit for a few hours and I can’t have the ghost of your touch against me as I make small talk with Jen about retinol.”</p><p>“Then let me touch you at the table and you won’t have to worry. No ghosts here.”</p><p>“We’re back into exhibitionism.”</p><p>“No, we’re back onto it being my wedding day and me wanting to touch and hold my wife wherever I please.”</p><p>“You’re going to kill me one day.”</p><p>“Mm, I think we’ve established I’d do anything to keep you alive.”</p><p>“And tortured.”</p><p>“Pleasured.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and Agatha grinned, leaning it to kiss her slowly, enjoying the soft huff from Rio that told her she’d given in.</p><p>They remained that way for the rest of the quick journey to the little restaurant; pressed as closely together as possible, enjoying the few moments of alone time they’d have before they had to share each other again.</p><p>Whilst Agatha had sorted all the technicalities of getting the marriage licence and booking the slot at City Hall, and the hotel, Rio had been the one to organise the dinner afterwards.</p><p>She’d paid for it all with her own money, wanting to do something for the person who always foot the bill for everyone else.</p><p>It wasn’t much. At least, it wouldn’t have been much to Agatha at all. But in organising Agatha’s favourite restaurant in the village, in making sure they had her favourite wine in, that they’d have a private room, that it were fully decorated, that everything was sorted so Agatha wouldn’t have to worry about anything, she was showing Agatha she cared.</p><p>It was the least she could do.</p><p>And so when they pulled up to the trattoria on Bleecker, Rio felt that whilst Agatha was concerned she’d made a misstep with the ceremony, at least she could reassure her with the evening’s arrangements.</p><p>Rio pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s hand after stepping out of the car beside her and gave her a reassuring smile as she delivered her into the warm embrace of the little Tuscan restaurant.</p><p>The maître d’ announced that the rest of the party had already arrived in the little room at the back and so Rio led the way, holding Agatha’s fingers loosely with her own.</p><p>The uproar that greeted them when they arrived into the small room was incredibly unnecessary for a group of people who’d spent the day with them but so unbelievably welcome as they were both piled with hugs and kisses and squeezes and a gentle salute to both of them from Jimmy.</p><p>To Rio’s instructions, the room had been decorated impeccably.</p><p>Along the centre of the small space was an oblong table draped in a white table cloth with a midnight blue runner down the centre and gold stars dotted about it. The exposed brick of the walls had been decorated with hanging lights that cast a warm glow about the room’s inhabitants and on the table itself were floral centre pieces and lit candles in ornate candlesticks.</p><p>When Rio was finally released from Alice’s clutches, she walked with Agatha to take their seats at the top of the table, opposite Jen and Alice with Rio beside Natasha.</p><p>Everything felt right in the world as the waiters flooded in to pour champagne for everyone and Agatha took Rio’s hand on top of the table, entwining their fingers and kissing the back of it as their glasses were filled.</p><p>“Consummated it yet?” Jen asked dryly as she watched the two flushed brides cheers together.</p><p>“Why? Is a five minute cab ride all it takes for you to get off, Jen?”</p><p>Jen scoffed and Alice grinned at Agatha, “How does it feel? Do you feel different?”</p><p>“Well Rio’s had a ball and chain attached to her wherever she goes for a while now,” Natasha quipped from beside her friend, inclining her glass to her even as she insulted her new wife. “What? It was a joke.”</p><p>Rio shot her a look and nudged her thigh below the table but turned back to Agatha with an easy smile, “Does it feel different?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said breezily, apparently unperturbed by Natasha’s comments, “I’ve considered us married since that day in-…” but she stopped herself, and Rio knew why. Opening up the discussion to their whispered vows in bed could lead to other topics like what had happened that brought them to doing that, which would inevitably lead to the discussion of Wanda.</p><p>“Well,” Rio said quickly, recognising the danger and trying to course correct, “I’ve considered us married since Agatha secretly replaced five of my plants and thought I wouldn’t notice that she’d been steadily killing them ever since I moved in.”</p><p>There were titters of soft laughter across the table as Agatha coloured slightly and straightened her back, “I didn’t think you’d caught the other four.”</p><p>“I decided a row about one of them would be enough for you never to do it again.”</p><p>Agatha huffed but smiled a little as she sipped her champagne and Rio leant in to kiss her cheek in a conciliatory gesture.</p><p>The conversation began to pick up across the table then. Rio turned to Natasha and discussed what the plan was with her old Washington Heights apartment. Agatha was arguing with Jen and a caught-in-the-middle-Alice about whether it was culturally appropriate for Jen to refer to the newly weds as ‘Puerto Frican’ Married’ in her Instagram stories. And at the other end of the table Lilia was reading Jimmy’s palm as Billy watched on curiously.</p><p>All the while, Rio kept her hold on Agatha, switching between toying with her fingers and placing them on her own thigh so she could idly scratch up and down her arm.</p><p>It felt easy, it felt normal, it felt right.</p><p>By the time the appetisers and main course were finished, Rio had shifted in her seat to be closer to Agatha, leaning almost against her as she had her arm draped over the back of her chair and her free arm around Rio’s waist. They watched calmly as the people they loved the most bantered and barked at one another; the topic so nebulous and the wine so free flowing that neither of them could keep up.</p><p>“I’m going to do it,” Agatha murmured against Rio’s hair, breaking her from her idle dreams as she held Agatha’s forearm across her stomach.</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Tell you.”</p><p>Rio started slightly and blinked as she turned to Agatha. She frowned deeply when the woman in question was pulling away and standing to knock her knife against the crystal glass that held her Sancerre.</p><p>The room went silent instantly and Rio turned in her seat to blink up at Agatha, watching as her soft, gentle wife transformed before her eyes into the confident professional who was intimidating to most and respected by all.</p><p>“We didn’t say vows today and I realise now that I actually do want to mark our day with some words about my beloved wife.”</p><p>The room erupted suddenly and Rio burst out laughing as Natasha shook her shoulders and she beamed at the others beaming at her.</p><p>Her gaze then returned to Agatha and she softened again as the noise died down, reaching up to take her free hand.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>And Rio’s breath caught in her throat because Agatha, <em>her</em> Agatha was looking at her as if she’d put the stars in the sky, rather than just on the tablecloth.</p><p>“Honey.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice had dropped into a much softer, deeper timbre and Rio’s chest ached with something she couldn’t name but felt a lot like yearning.</p><p>“From the first time I saw you I have been yours completely. And I cannot believe my luck that I can call you my wife.”</p><p>Rio’s head spun a little, but not from the wine.</p><p>She felt a gentle pressure against her back and knew it to be Natasha grounding her, having guessed she might be on the verge of floating away.</p><p>“I love you, have loved you, will love you, for as long as there is breath in my lungs. And I will spend every day of my life trying to be good enough for you.”</p><p>Rio shook her head slightly, the tears that had been threatening to spill now falling in heavy droplets into her lap.</p><p>“My world is bright now because you are in it. Mi sol.” <em>My sun.</em></p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered gently, squeezing Agatha’s fingers as she struggled to get a hold on what she could even say to tell Agatha that she felt the same, that she loved her beyond what she ever thought herself capable of, that she couldn’t believe her luck that she’d found her.</p><p>“I love you, Rio Vidal. Thank you for letting me.”</p><p>And Rio gasped quietly as Agatha sat down before her and kissed her.</p><p>The table around them remained silent, all eyes watching the pair as Rio clutched and Agatha held.</p><p>Lilia was the first to break the spell and raised her glass aloft, standing from her seat: “To Rio Vidal; who loves gently and with ease. Who is soft, constant, life-giving. And to her Agatha Vidal; who loves fiercely. Who is consumed by her love and gladly burns for it. May you two continue to balance one another, to alter one another, and to inspire a love that neither could have found alone.”</p><p>Rio whimpered as Agatha cradled her face and kissed her through tears as the people who loved them most toasted to their joy.</p><p>Jen, more than anyone in the room, even Alice, even Rio, had begun to cry, sniffing so obnoxiously that as Rio eventually turned from Agatha, she laughed a little at the sight, even through her own tears. “What is it?”</p><p>“I just… sometimes forget that… you do love each other. So much.”</p><p>Rio smiled widely at this and turned back to Agatha who was still watching her and kissed her again, murmuring against her lips, “I do. I love you. So much. I <em>adore</em> you, my beautiful, magnetic, soft, loving, wife.”</p><p>From then on, the little party got more raucous, more open and loud.</p><p>People had moved from their seats and into each other’s. Alice had spent most of her time hanging off the back of Rio’s chair or wrapped around Jen. Natasha had been taken on as a new intriguing subject of Lilia’s who was now reading her palm. But Agatha and Rio, they remained close, incapable of being apart even when they were holding different conversations with the people around them.</p><p>But soon Agatha’s hands were more brazen, less than pleased with the fabric of Rio’s silk dress blocking her from the soft skin beneath. And Rio had to fight hard to pay attention to Billy telling her about his time in Italy.</p><p>The night wouldn’t be over for a while, though, and Rio would just have to deal with her insatiable wife for a little while longer because, she realised as she pushed Agatha’s hand away from her ass where it had slipped when she was chatting with Jimmy, that this was what her life would be now. If she were near her, Agatha would be touching her, she would be leaning in, they would be as close as possible.</p><p>Soon, the proprietors of the little trattoria in the heart of Manhattan cleared away the table that was now scattered with wine glasses and bits of broken food and they made a makeshift dance floor, per Rio’s instructions when she’d made the booking.</p><p>Rio had spent weeks thinking about what song she wanted their first dance to be. She’d shuffled through various playlists and albums and had played some options during the time they’d spent by the pool on their vacation.</p><p>She’d watched Agatha’s reaction when any particular front runner came on, seeing if her fingers would tap or if her lips would mouth the words.</p><p>And from all of this research, all the observation, she’d chosen Etta James, leaning into Agatha’s penchant for more classic vocals, settling on ‘A Sunday Kind of Love’ because when it played the third time she’d had it in rotation Agatha had rolled over on the bed and held her through the song, tapping the rhythm of the brass against her stomach.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been opposed to the idea of a first dance, and she’d been happy enough when Rio had run the James number past her.</p><p>So Rio offered her hand to Agatha, “M’lady?”</p><p>Receiving just an eye roll in response but a warm hand in her own, Rio stepped into the middle of the room and under the watchful eyes of their loved ones, she danced with her wife.</p><p>Agatha, didn’t allow Rio to lead the way for long and she pulled Rio flush against her, unable to stop herself from kissing her as Rio grinned against her lips, her arms draped around her neck.</p><p>“You know what?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I always forget I’m taller than you. You cheated with those heels.”</p><p>“Barely.”</p><p>“Still.”</p><p>“Is it important right now?”</p><p>“No. Just like to mention it every so often.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“We should go dancing more often.”</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Please stop talking.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio remained silent for the rest of the dance, allowing Agatha to twirl them at will as others soon joined.</p><p>Jen and Alice. Billy and Lilia. Jimmy and Natasha. The first couple was obvious. The second presumed. The third circumstantial.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t let anyone cut in for another three dances, even when Alice pawed at Rio’s hand, even when Billy tried for Agatha’s, even when Lilia attempted them both. But Rio allowed Natasha to take her away after the former placated Agatha with a kiss and sent her towards Jen and Alice.</p><p>“Can you be nicer?” Rio muttered softly, squeezing Natasha’s hand where they assumed the waltzing position.</p><p>“I’m nice enough.”</p><p>“No, you’re barely tolerating her.”</p><p>“Jen says things and-…”</p><p>“Jen’s her best friend.”</p><p>“And I’m yours.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and glanced over at Agatha, seeing her laughing at something Alice had whispered in her ear and softening a little at the sight.</p><p>“Please? My gift on my wedding day. Be nicer. Dance with her.”</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>Rio frowned and moving her hand to poke just beneath Natasha’s ribs, causing her to huff and shift in her hold, “I gave her my blessing. I don’t have to dance with her.”</p><p>“Actually, you do.”</p><p>Natasha went silent and they continued to dance, eventually Rio pulling back to spin her friend and then pull her back in, and under this pretence she pressed closer and whispered more softly than before, “It’s important to me you get on beyond both caring about me. Please do this.”</p><p>“She’ll say no.”</p><p>“She won’t.”</p><p>Natasha pursed her lips and eyed Rio for a while but was stopped from having to say anything else because the song had ended and Billy Joel had kicked up.</p><p>“Perfect,” Rio announced, dropping her hold on Natasha and keeping her hand held tightly as she reached to tug at Agatha, who looked thrilled to be back close and then a little perturbed that Natasha were there.</p><p>“Dance with her,” Rio begged quietly, placing a kiss by Agatha’s ear and tugging a reluctant Natasha closer.</p><p>She stepped away then and dropped Natasha’s hold to watch the strange experiment. They both raised their arms at the same time, both clearly expecting to lead.</p><p>“I’m taller,” Agatha challenged.</p><p>“So’s Rio. I led her.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and took Natasha’s hand to bring it up to Agatha’s shoulder. “Dancing is supposed to be fun.”</p><p>“Depends on the partner,” Agatha said quietly, though obviously Natasha heard it. But Rio just shook her head and pushed her friend a little closer to her wife until they were properly in hold.</p><p>“You’ll make me very happy if you can last the length of the song.”</p><p>Neither said anything then and they began to sway a little but Rio couldn’t help but think they looked awkward still, which was a feat given how good she considered them both to be at dancing.</p><p>She was tugged backwards by Alice though who pulled her into her own arms for a dance, neither caring much who led or followed in their little two step.</p><p>“Dangerous waters, Vidal.”</p><p>“They’ll get over it.”</p><p>Sure enough, as the final bars of ‘She’s Got A Way’ rang out, Agatha and Natasha seemed to have relaxed a little and once out of hold Natasha said quietly, “Nice speech.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha paused and glanced at Rio, before turning back to Natasha, she shook her hair back slightly as if shaking off the mortification of the moment. “How did… the palm reading go?”</p><p>“Oh, you know, the usual: a fiery death at the hands of an ex and a translator. Nothing too revealing.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a hint of a smile and they met each other’s gaze properly for the first time all night, finally a little less guarded.</p><p>But Rio had moved back along and was mouthing a subtle ‘thank you’ to Natasha before she pulled Agatha to her and kissed her as a means of thanking her.</p><p>“Determined to make you friends.”</p><p>“Never going to happen.”</p><p>“Best friends.”</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>Rio just laughed and kissed Agatha again, grinning as they swayed on the spot.</p><p>The dancing didn’t last much longer than that given the reluctance of most to switch partners and the lack of actual bodies in the room.</p><p>And by just before midnight, Rio had been bundled into the back of the car ordered to take them back to the hotel.</p><p>Agatha had arranged the penthouse of the Four Seasons for their wedding night, because of course she had. Their bags had been moved there after they left for the wedding and so there was nothing left to do except to accept the key at reception and be taken to the private elevator to the top.</p><p>“It really is a bit much,” Rio said as they stepped into the elevator, Agatha having assured the concierge that they could handle a one way journey to the one stop on their floor alone, thank you very much.</p><p>“It’s just enough,” came Agatha’s retort, turning to grin at Rio. “If Jen and the others can get suites then we can get the penthouse.”</p><p>Rio just hummed teasingly and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek, smiling more as she turned her head into her, “You have too much money.”</p><p>“<em>We</em> have too much money. So let me spend it spoiling you.”</p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes and laughed a little when Agatha attempted to kiss her again, but she’d moved back so as not to be distracted. “So three nights in this ridiculous penthouse? Is that right?”</p><p>“A week.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“How much is that?”</p><p>“Enough for you to feel treated, not enough for you to worry about it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again but was saved from having to argue any more about it when the elevator came to a soft halt and Agatha took her hand to lead her into their new home for the next week.</p><p>The penthouse was everything a penthouse should be. It was bigger than Rio’s old apartment and the views were the kind of views that took tourists’ breaths away year after year.</p><p>Agatha barely looked around as they moved through the space and Rio wondered if she’d been here before, or if she was just so used to this kind of luxury that it no longer left much of an impression on her.</p><p>They walked through to the front balcony and Agatha moved to encircle her arms around Rio, guarding her in her thin dress from the cool chill of the breeze that funnelled through the skyscrapers around them.</p><p>She felt Agatha kiss her neck, brushing her nose up in a soft trail to the hollow behind her ear, as she took in the sight of a dark Central Park, lit by the surrounding buildings and the crescent moon up above.</p><p>“Still think it’s too much?”</p><p>“It’s… incredible.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed as she nipped lightly at Rio’s ear, her hold tightening around her waist, “You’re incredible.”</p><p>Rio smiled and turned slowly in Agatha’s hold, reaching to place her arms loosely around her neck and nuzzling into her. “And you are too charming for your own good.”</p><p>“Well I <em>am</em> trying to seduce you.”</p><p>“Don’t you know by now you don’t need to try?”</p><p>“A little seduction on our wedding night could never hurt, surely?”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, watching how Agatha’s head dipped a little so she could press a kiss to the corner of her jaw, “Mm, depends I suppose. You might spoil me so much I expect this treatment all the time.”</p><p>“You can have it,” Agatha mumbled, distracted by Rio’s hands that had slipped into her hair, “all the time.”</p><p>Rio’s smile fell then as Agatha looked back up at her and they both went silent, any pretence at seduction techniques or playing it coy lost to the wind as it cycled around them.</p><p>It was Rio who closed the distance, and Agatha who responded with a soft moan as she felt Rio tug her closer.</p><p>But a balcony on the 52nd floor wasn’t a safe place to do what they’d both been desperate to do since seeing each other for the first time earlier.</p><p>And so Agatha pulled away just before she lost all rational thought and she tugged Rio back into the sitting room, managing to slam the door before she pulled Rio onto the couch with her.</p><p>Rio’s knees were either side of Agatha’s hips and her hands against her neck as she panted above her, staring wide eyed at the goddess between her thighs. Agatha swallowed thickly, her hands sliding the silk further up Rio’s legs until it pooled at her hips and she could see the white lace underwear Rio had chosen for the occasion.</p><p>“I was going to change into something a little more-…”</p><p>“No,” Agatha was quick to say, a warning more than a request, her voice low and raspy as she slipped her fingers into the band of Rio’s underwear at her hips. “Stay right here.”</p><p>Rio huffed softly and there was no real annoyance in it as Agatha flexed her fingers out and the intention was clear as she squeezed Rio’s hips: she wanted her closer.</p><p>Rio shifted her hips forwards and gasped when Agatha licked a thick strip from the neck of her dress up her throat. Rio’s fingers clutched the soft hair at the back of Agatha’s head and she rocked her hips gently, feeling Agatha smile against her neck, “I want to fuck you in this dress.“</p><p>“Please,” Rio offered as Agatha sucked harshly at her skin, her hips rocking again, seeking some friction.</p><p>But Agatha still hadn’t touched her. Not properly. Her fingers were digging so tightly into the skin of her hips that she knew she would wake tomorrow with the evidence of Agatha’s desire all over her body, but the thought only made her more desperate and she groaned when Agatha pulled her face away from her.</p><p>“Don’t tease.”</p><p>“Me? Never.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, watching as Agatha’s dark gaze fell to her lips. She leant in slightly, intent on taking back some control, and traced her tongue slowly along Agatha’s already swollen upper lip. Agatha’s breathing hitched and her hold tightened on Rio but she didn’t move yet, didn’t give Rio what she was after.</p><p>As Rio leant in to kiss her again properly, she slid her left hand around to cup Rio through her underwear, moaning against her mouth when Rio responded immediately by rocking her hips.</p><p>It was quick, quicker than it had ever been, because Rio was so desperate and Agatha equally so. With practiced fingers and a filthy moan, Agatha pressed one finger inside her wife, then pushed her with two, and finally, making Rio arch her back and tilt her head back by tugging at her hair, she stretched her with a third.</p><p>The intrusion was delicious, achingly welcome, and Rio groaned when Agatha leant up and released a warm breath against her elongated neck.</p><p>Rio was allowed to adjust for all of five seconds before Agatha set a brutal pace, fucking her without mercy, her eyes on Rio’s tortured expression as she spread her legs further, wanting her as deep as she could take.</p><p>“You’re so wet, baby. You’re so desperate for me.”</p><p>Rio could only moan Agatha’s name, fighting to control her breathing as Agatha placed wet kisses across her chest and moved her hand down from her scalp to her upper back to hold her as she pressed against her, needing to feel every twitch of her body as she carried her to orgasm in no time at all.</p><p>The release in Rio’s abdomen was sudden and crashed over her without much warning, her whole body stiffening and quivering beneath Agatha’s secure hold.</p><p>The woman below her grinned against her chest, placing a placating kiss just at the hollow of Rio’s throat as she eased her down, continuing to brush slow circles over her clit as Rio twitched above her.</p><p>“God,” Rio breathed out, her mind blank even as she brought her head down to stare into triumphant blue eyes, “Could you-…”</p><p>But Agatha was already pulling Rio down to kiss her languidly, her movements grinding to a halt against her before she slowly pulled away and replaced her mouth on Rio’s with her fingers, watching with wide eyes as Rio sucked herself off of Agatha’s fingers readily.</p><p>She moaned around them, knowing it would drive Agatha wild to hear it, to watch as she opened her mouth more and gagged around her three digits, tears forming in her eyes as she did so.</p><p>“What’re you doing to me?” Agatha asked quietly, her gaze a little unfocused as she stared at where Rio was taking her in her mouth.</p><p>She pulled her hand away slowly, feeling the tip of Rio’s tongue swipe along her knuckles as she did so and groaned when a thick line of saliva linked her fingers to Rio’s pouting lower lip as she pulled away completely.</p><p>“I need to be inside you. All night. Forever. Now.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and grinned but the wind was knocked out of her as she was thrown onto her back on the couch, Agatha adjusting their position to be sat between her thighs, kneeling over her with a devilish grin as her wet hand traced soft infinity symbols along her chest, “Wait here.”</p><p>Rio whined and grabbed Agatha’s hand as she made to leave, “Why are you allowed to leave and I’m not?”</p><p>Agatha only smirked, leaning back over Rio properly, holding her weight on two hands by her head which gave Rio a delicious view of her breasts beneath her shirt, held in an intricate lace white bra.</p><p>Her cheeks flushed as if it were the first time she’d been privileged with the sight and just like the first time, she felt desperate to taste, to press her mouth all over Agatha’s body.</p><p>“My eyes are up here,” Agatha said teasingly, causing Rio’s gaze to flash back up suddenly and her blush to  deepen as she sunk her fingers into the soft fabric of Agatha’s light shirt.</p><p>“You have to stay because I will only be two minutes and I can’t wait any longer.”</p><p>“You don’t want to see me in my slutty bridal lingerie?”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha laughed softly and leant in to nudge their noses together, making Rio stretch up to try and capture her lips, “I do. But I want to fuck you properly in your wedding dress first.”</p><p>Rio groaned as Agatha pulled away properly this time, denying her a kiss. Her whole body felt on fire and she lay prone for a few seconds, staring at the ceiling as she tried to temper her beating heart.</p><p>She sat slowly, already feeling the ache for Agatha settle deep within her bones, causing her to flex the muscles of her thighs as she forced herself to be patient, to remain where she said she would.</p><p>But rule following was only okay when she wasn’t absolutely obsessed with the woman who had told her to stay.</p><p>And so she left her spot on the couch, and went to try and find Agatha in the as of yet unexplored penthouse that was to be theirs for the week.</p><p>She moved through in the direction she thought Agatha had gone and found herself in another sitting room with a grand piano sitting in the window.</p><p>But no Agatha.</p><p>She stopped to press lightly on one of the keys of the Steinway and as the light note of a high C rang through the room she felt a hand on her hip and the cool rush of silk moving up her body.</p><p>Agatha had found her again.</p><p>She swallowed thickly as she felt her fingers loop into her underwear and tug it down to rest at her ankles.</p><p>“I thought I told you to wait.”</p><p>Agatha pressed closer and Rio felt the thing Agatha had left her to fetch.</p><p>She bit on her lip as Agatha brushed her hair to one side and pressed a kiss to the crook of her neck.</p><p>“I got bored.”</p><p>“Bored? We must change that.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, her whole body heating up as Agatha ran her hand over her, teasing her by pressing the length of the strap between her legs but not giving her what she wanted just yet.</p><p>Rio tried to press back, to rock down, but Agatha only pulled away when she did, turning Rio instead with a smug grin, “Patience. Isn’t that always what you say to me?”</p><p>Rio would have rolled her eyes if she’d had more wherewithal but instead she pouted a little and took Agatha’s hand and pressed it against her cunt as she reached for the strap sitting proud between Agatha’s legs, “It’s different when it’s me.”</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow as she swiped her fingers between Rio’s lips, smirking a little as her hips rolled with her.</p><p>“It’s white?”</p><p>“It’s our wedding night,” Agatha shrugged a little, a glint of pride in her voice and eyes as Rio laughed softly, her hips now chasing more from Agatha’s delicate strokes.</p><p>“How very traditional of you.”</p><p>“Let’s not get into the politics of me fucking you with a strap on our wedding night, please.”</p><p>“Why? Husbands can do what they want with their wives.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers stopped their tortuous explorations and she released a laugh so low and breathy that Rio knew she’d said exactly the right thing. The atmosphere changed.</p><p>Agatha held her palm up in front of Rio’s face and maintained eye contact as she spit into it.</p><p>Rio watched with wide eyes as Agatha reached down between them and lubed up the strap slowly, watching Rio carefully as she lined herself up to her entrance, her left hand now at Rio’s hip to hold her steady against the piano.</p><p>Rio bit down so hard on her lip that Agatha leant in to get her to ease off, to open her mouth again, expectantly waiting for Agatha’s tongue to brush her own but instead she’d replaced Rio’s teeth with hers and bit down as she pressed the tip of the strap inside of her.</p><p>The reaction was instant, Rio’s thighs tensed and she moaned loudly as she gripped the front of Agatha’s shirt, her eyes almost rolling back into her head as Agatha’s pressed deeper.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t held back in her choice for the evening. She’d chosen a strap that was thicker than usual, and just as long as one of her favourites. It made Rio ache and groan as she pressed into her and she almost saw stars reflected back at her as she met Agatha’s midnight blue gaze.</p><p>When buried to the hilt Agatha released her lip and soothed it down with a slow swipe of her tongue, looking half wild, half cautious as she pulled away to look at where their hips met and Rio’s dress pooled beautifully at her abdomen, held by tense fingers.</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze too and had to fight hard not to moan at the sight, feeling her body betray her as it clenched around the strap and sent a jolt of painful delight through her.</p><p>But she couldn’t be a silent participant for long.</p><p>“This shirt,” Rio said suddenly, fighting the urge to rock her hips as Agatha remained still inside of her. “Has been driving me insane all day.”</p><p>She slipped one button from its holder then gave in and ripped the rest open, causing Agatha to retaliate by rocking her hips up and pressing deeper into Rio.</p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p>“That was expensive.”</p><p>“You’ve ripped several of my clothes,” Rio groaned out, following it up with a stubborn: “Payback.”</p><p>Agatha took this as a challenge and began to slowly thrust in and out of Rio, barely pulling back each time and with each rock of her hips pressing as hard as she could.</p><p>And Rio lost all ability to speak, her train of thought dwindling. Soon it became clear with Rio’s moans and Agatha’s desperation to be pressed as close to her wife as possible that Rio’s standing position was no longer tenable.</p><p>Agatha lifted her, still buried inside her, and moved her to the front of the piano, slamming the lid of the keys down as Rio gasped and clutched at her upper back.</p><p>Agatha pulled away then, stepping back completely, and falling onto her ass on the little stool when Rio rested on the closed keyboard, her legs spread open and her chest heaving.</p><p>The sight before her was enough to make her come on the spot.</p><p>Agatha sat, the large white strap attached at her hips on a matching white harness, contrasting so beautifully against the delicate lace of her bra and the softness of her open white shirt that hung loosely about her torso.</p><p>Her hair was wild and her eyes were dark, her lips parted as she panted softly and stared at Rio’s cunt, at the mess she’d made about her thighs, at the needy hole that waited impatiently for her to fill it again.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed, almost begged, afraid to sit up in case she fell.</p><p>But Agatha ignored her, and moved forwards with the stool so she could settle closer, bring Rio’s thighs up over her shoulders, bury her face between her legs.</p><p>Rio almost screamed as Agatha attached her lips to her clit and sucked desperately against it, her fingers already buried two knuckles deep within her. She ate her out greedily, messily, not stopping until Rio came against her mouth twice and she was crying from the oversensitivity, pushing Agatha’s face away to get her to stop.</p><p>“Agatha, Agatha,” Rio moaned loudly, her body aching and her back sore from the hard press of the piano behind her.</p><p>But Agatha only pressed soothing kisses to her thighs before she pulled her cautiously across and into her lap, staring up at her like she was seeing the face of god.</p><p>“One more. Just one more. I want to be inside of you again.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly but her body was already responding to Agatha and she pressed close, feeling the warmth of Agatha’s skin through the thin material stopping her from being totally flush against her.</p><p>She captured Agatha’s lips in a desperate kiss, moaning at the taste of herself on her tongue and the feel of long fingers as they held her hips, trapping the toy between their bodies.</p><p>Breathless and panting again, Rio let Agatha encourage her to sit up on her knees, allowing her to press slowly into her and letting her guide her hips down until she was flush against her in her lap once more.</p><p>The stretch felt different this time. She ached and felt hopeless as she rocked her hips pitifully, Agatha pressing soothing kisses along her jaw as she did.</p><p>“Let me help,” she murmured against flushed skin, slipping her hands below Rio to help her ride her, controlling the pace as Rio babbled soft moans above her.</p><p>When confident she could still help Rio ride her slowly with just one hand, Agatha slipped her other between them, applying pressure to Rio’s clit with her thumb and splaying her fingers to Rio’s lower abdomen.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of her mind, where Rio was still able to think, she recognised this as Agatha feeling herself with in her. It was why she usually went for larger, thicker straps, a way to possess Rio’s body as only she now could. It made her moans grow louder, her body burn for more, knowing that Agatha wanted her so savagely.</p><p>Agatha’s lips were on her throat now, her hand still curled beneath her hip to help her move above her, her voice thick with want and barely-contained possession: “You take me so well, honey. So good for me. So perfect.”</p><p>Rio’s orgasm was slow to build, despite her body aching for everything Agatha could give her. Tears formed at the corners of her eyes as Agatha began to hold her flush against her hips, burying herself as deep as she could get, and rocking up into her to press even deeper.</p><p> “Fuck, you feel so good around me. So tight still.”</p><p> Rio’s thighs began to quake and Agatha released her hold on her, allowing her to move again as she bullied her clit more furiously, letting Rio’s body crash down above her as she kept a hold of her own desperation as she pushed Rio to the edge with a manic wildness.</p><p>When Rio finally came, Agatha cradled her close, her touches changing, holding her head against the crook of her neck and rocking her hips slowly, because she wanted Rio to feel her, wanted Rio to ache for her, with her, because of her.</p><p>But knowing Rio’s body better than even Rio did, she stopped just as Rio was on the brink of tears again, lifting her cautiously and pulling out of her.</p><p>Rio gasped as if she’d been underwater for minutes, coming down from her high reluctantly as she pressed into Agatha, her limbs heavy but still clutching.</p><p>”You did so well,” Agatha whispered quietly into dark hair, her fingers dancing along Rio’s back and pressing into her skin to hold her like the great masters carving angels from the marble.</p><p> Rio made a soft noise of acknowledgement and experimentally flexed her muscles to see if her body had returned it’s allegiance to her again. She was sore and aching but in a way that felt only bad when Agatha wasn’t inside of her, in a way that only healed with Agatha could salve.</p><p>After a few seconds, Rio gathered herself enough to pull bsck and press her face close to Agatha’s, her legs wrapping tightly around her waist as best they could.</p><p>“Good enough for my new bride?”</p><p>Rio laughed against Agatha’s cheek and hummed before kissing her there, still a little out of it as she tried to focus in her post-orgasm haze, “I’ve come four times and you are yet to come at all. That isn’t how I want to start our married life.”</p><p>“Also,” she said, pulling back a little to see Agatha’s flushed face, “I can’t think of anything hotter than eating you out whilst I’m in my wedding dress.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze became impossibly hungrier then and without anymore discussion about it, they fumbled their way through to the bedroom.</p><p>Rio found herself much more wobbly than usual and stumbled with Agatha as she was pressed against walls, doors, and windows, until they eventually fell Agatha-first onto the bed.</p><p>Rio fell to her knees between her legs and began to loosen the harness to pull it down her thighs.</p><p>“Don’t. Don’t throw it on the floor,” Agatha warned breathlessly, watching as Rio paused in her efforts. “Put it in the sink.”</p><p>Rio sat up slightly, glancing down at the strap archly before she looked back up to meet Agatha’s gaze but not before she took in the sight before her. Agatha’s stomach remained lightly tanned from weeks of sun, the smattering of freckles across her abdomen stretching up her chest until they disappeared over her throat and along her jaw. She wanted to bite every one.</p><p>“You want to use it again?”</p><p>“Is four orgasms enough for my perfect bride?”</p><p>Rio laughed as she went back to the task at hand but felt desire pool between her legs again and she surreptitiously squeezed her thighs closed. She eventually freed Agatha from the harness, disappearing off to do exactly as Agatha had asked and place it in the sink.</p><p>When she returned Agatha was leaning back against the headboard, her legs splayed out before her, her shirt still open, and her smile lazy as she held her hand out to Rio.</p><p>But Rio didn’t take it.</p><p>She instead moved to the end of the large bed and crawled up slowly, keeping her eyes on Agatha the entire time.</p><p>Her reaction was worth the theatrics.</p><p>Agatha looked helpless where she lay, her legs opening to allow Rio to crawl between them and her breathing already laboured when Rio pressed a soft kiss to her inner thigh, soon replacing her lips with her teeth and releasing her flesh only when she felt Agatha’s moan turn to a whine.</p><p>But she didn’t tease for long.</p><p>Rio had no desire to leave Agatha waiting; knowing as she did how long she’d been holding back.</p><p>Agatha was practically dripping onto the sheets by the time Rio pressed her mouth against her. She groaned in tandem with Agatha as she ate her out deliriously, her thoughts fading to black as she focused on nothing but letting Agatha use her lips and tongue until she was screaming above her.</p><p>Rio let Agatha grind against her tongue after her second orgasm before she pulled away and wiped the evidence of her desire from her face. Agatha’s chest was flushed red and she was groaning as she reached to pull Rio towards her but Rio shook her head and instead moved beside her.</p><p>“What’re you doing?”</p><p>Pulling her dress up to her hips again, Rio spread her legs and Agatha immediately thought she knew what she wanted, reaching across with her left hand to press against her.</p><p>“No,” Rio laughed quietly, twitching her hips slightly as she held onto Agatha’s hand, “sit between my thighs.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow and moved to kneel down between Rio’s legs, dropping her gaze to where Rio was parting them more for her and reaching to hold her thighs open.</p><p>“No, mi amor. Turn around.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said with a slow grin working its way up her face, “Please?” She shifted her hips up slightly, pressing her legs open so far that she could feel the stretch along her inner thigh, “Turn around and then I’ll let you do whatever you want with me for the rest of the night. Don’t you want that?”</p><p>”I’d have that already,” Agatha accused with an arched brow, raising her gaze only briefly before it dropped again and her hands slid dangerously close to where Rio couldn’t have them for fear she’d submit.</p><p>”Agatha,” Rio tried again, her voice a little lower this time as she reached to hold Agatha’s wrists, “turn around.”

</p><p>Agatha frowned deeply, her fingers constricting against Rio’s tense thighs, her gaze still down where she wanted to be buried deep.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio husked, making Agatha finally look up at her, clear frustration on her face, “Please.”</p><p>And so Agatha reluctantly turned around, settling back into Rio’s hold and releasing a slow breath as Rio settled her hands across Agatha’s abdomen.</p><p>“You are my wife,” Rio whispered soothingly as she tickled teasingly across Agatha’s lower abdomen, feeling the soft twitches of her muscles and the gentle breaths of the woman in her arms, “and I want to hold you while you come,” answering a question that hadn’t been uttered but Rio knew Agatha was thinking.</p><p>Agatha turned her head slightly then, shifting a little to see Rio better, her eyes questioning still but softer than before and Rio brushed their lips together as her hands diverged across Agatha’s body, one going up, the other going down.</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise as Rio’s hand squeezed beneath the tight constraints of her bra to palm her breast and her other slipped between her thighs to begin pressing slow circles over her clit, twisting her hand to reach down and press inside of Agatha with two fingers.</p><p>She reached her arm up and over to hold the back of Rio’s head and stretched her neck to give her more leeway to kiss her throat.</p><p>Rio could feel every twitch of every muscle in Agatha’s body in this position. She could feel every breath she took, every buck of her hips and swallow of her throat.</p><p>And Agatha let her, she let her work her up slowly, let her squeeze and grasp her breast possessively, let her use her lips and tongue and teeth to mark her soft neck.</p><p>And when she came against her hand she did so with a desperate gasp, a stutter of her name, an equal stuttering of her hips and a painful clutch of her nails against Rio’s scalp.</p><p>Rio’s long limbs had been firm in their hold of Agatha and now they relaxed slightly; her legs moved to drape over Agatha’s, crossing at the ankles, and she slipped her hand out from under her bra to hold her over her ribs, feeling the patter of her racing heart.</p><p>Rio kept her face pressed against the crook of Agatha’s neck, letting her breathing even out slowly until Agatha released the hold on her head and she lifted her own face to kiss Agatha’s cheek and smiled against it as Agatha just let her hold her for a while.</p><p>The intense, almost frantic tension in the air before had been transfigured now into something softer, something almost fragile. And Rio could have been happy to be taken from this world and into the next if she knew she could bottle up this feeling and take it with her.</p><p>“Aren’t you glad you did as I asked?”</p><p>“Smugness is very unattractive.”</p><p>“That’s a very rude thing to say about someone who just made you come so hard you stuttered.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but there was no real malice to it. And she didn’t move for a few seconds until Rio’s hand started to dip lower again. Her breath hitched and she began to pull away, forcing Rio to break her hold on her.</p><p>“I wasn’t finished.”</p><p>But Rio was ignored.</p><p>Agatha had drawn herself back up to her full height, kneeling between Rio’s thighs, her fingers toying idly at the hem of Rio’s dress, a determined smile on her face.</p><p>“Take it off.”</p><p>After two more hours of Agatha switching back the air in the room and stealing it again and again from Rio’s lungs; making pains to ensure Rio wouldn’t be forgetting this night in a hurry - or ever - they collapsed into each other on the bed, both hot, both exhausted, both so blissfully satiated that they couldn’t form the words to announce it.</p><p>Rio hummed quietly where Agatha pressed her face against the back of her neck and she luxuriated in it for a few seconds before she slowly turned her body back over. She gazed up at Agatha who had similarly shifted up to look curiously at her; her eyes now heavy with their desire to sleep and her lips curled into a ghost of a smile.</p><p>Rio took all of this in. Her wife, hovering just inches from her, watching her with something unnameable but sacrosanct. It felt a lot like floating, like flying.</p><p>She shuffled just slightly again to raise her hand and press it to Agatha’s cheek, watching with soft eyes as Agatha leant into her touch.</p><p>Maybe it was the early morning haze, maybe it was the heavenly exhaustion, but Agatha looked different in this light.
