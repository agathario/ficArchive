<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio hated change. When she was six and her parents had moved them from Puerto Rico to New Jersey, she refused to speak to them for the first month out of defiance. When she was thirteen and her parents had been killed in a car crash on their way to pick her up from basketball training, all she wanted was to scream at them one last time. When she was twenty-five and moved to New York, she spent the first six months going from work to home, not interacting with anyone except Alice, her best friend, coworker, and roommate all in one.</p><p>Alice had gotten it in her head that this was somehow “unhealthy” and that she should try to at least be around other humans for a night, which is how she ended up here, at <em>The Road</em>, on what should’ve been a nice, quiet evening with just her, her plants and reruns of Battlestar Galactica. </p><p>“Rio, stop it. I can feel your disinterest from here. No one’s gonna bite unless you ask them.” Rio felt her cheeks flush at the comment, and she stared daggers into Alice’s back as she dragged them through the crowd to an empty booth.</p><p>Not two seconds into sitting down did Alice’s phone ring. “Shit, Rio, I gotta take this, would you mind going and getting us a drink?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to argue, but Alice had already answered the phone call. Shaking her head, she got up and awkwardly made her way through the people milling about the room. How on earth was it this busy? She knew it was a Saturday, but seriously, didn’t these people have families? Lives that revolved around anything other than alcohol?  </p><p>Making it safely to the bar, Rio looked at all the beers on tap. She knew what Alice usually drank, but she couldn’t see it anywhere around. Shit. Maybe she should just go back and ask Alice what she wanted, because she didn’t want to get the wrong drink, and then Alice either had to drink it, or they had to go back and get a new drink, and that was just a hassle and-</p><p>“Hey, hot stuff, what’s a place like this doing in a girl like you?”</p><p>Rio snapped her head to the siren song and her eyes landed on the most gorgeous woman she had ever seen. Piercing blue eyes that seemed to look right through Rio, a mane of brunette hair that cascaded down her back with one sinful grey streak that framed her face. And if that wasn’t enough to send Rio insane, the woman had tattoos covering almost every inch of available skin. And, <em>oh, </em>Rio’s brain was going to malfunction. Just below the Three of Swords tattoo on her sternum were two bars sticking out through the woman’s shirt. <em>Nipple piercings. </em>God, Rio was going to melt into the floor. </p><p>“My eyes are up here, sweetheart.” Rio’s eyes snapped up, and her cheeks instantly flushed, embarrassed to have been caught. The brunette smirked at Rio, watching amusedly as Rio tried to formulate a sentence. The stranger let Rio suffer for a moment longer before trying again. “What’s your poison, honey?”</p><p>Rio had never really placed any stock in the idea of love at first sight. It seemed illogical. Sure, you could be attracted at first sight, but love? That seemed too far-fetched. Rio was a scientist; she believed in facts and evidence.  But here, with this woman, she knew without a doubt she was wrong.</p><p>“Oh, um, can I get two beers, please?” Rio squeaked out.</p><p>The love of Rio’s life narrowed her eyes amusedly and let out a small chuckle, “You don’t do this a lot, do you?”  </p><p>Rio felt her cheeks, which had never returned to their original colour, redden further. “Order drinks or talk to attractive women?”</p><p>The stranger blinked, taken aback by Rio’s forwardness, “Both, I suppose. But let’s work on the first problem for now. You’re aware that basically all we serve here are beers, right? You’re going to have to be a bit more specific than that.”</p><p>Rio studied the woman, trying to figure out what to say. She figured her best bet would be to try and copy what they did in the movies. She awkwardly leaned against the bar in a way she hoped seemed natural, “Well, what would you suggest?”</p><p>The woman smirked before eyeing Rio up and down, as if she could tell what sort of drink Rio would like just by looking at her. It seemed to work, and the woman moved away to grab two pint glasses and pour some local ale.</p><p>“That’ll be $13, handsome.” Rio fished the money out of her pocket and stood awkwardly while the woman cashed it away.</p><p>Rio knew she wasn’t bad looking. Some may even say she was attractive, but she was awkward and had never really known how to use her ‘charms’. Now more than ever did she wish she had been one of those people who could swoop in and effortlessly flirt her way into someone’s bed.</p><p>“So, uh, could I maybe get your name?” Rio asked awkwardly.</p><p>The stranger just chuckled, “That’ll cost you extra honey.” Finally, she looked up from the till, and Rio was granted another look into those stormy eyes, “How about this, if you actually like the drink, I’ll see about giving you my name.”</p><p> </p><p>“Al, I think I just met the love of my life,” Rio said as she threw herself back into the booth they were sitting at.</p><p>Alice looked up from her phone, eyebrows knitted together, “You what? Where? Who? What???”</p><p>Rio nodded her head behind her, “At the bar, see her, the brunette?”</p><p>Rio could see the moment Alice clocked the woman and could see the cogs turning in Alice’s head. They had been friends since high school, when Rio was in her angsty teenager phase, angry about everything, Alice had stuck it out with her. Since then, they had been inseparable, even taking Rio into her home for a while after her parents had died. Without Alice and her mom, Rio would have bounced around the system until she aged out. She would never have found her foster mom, Lilia, she wouldn’t have the life she has now; she wouldn’t have anything.</p><p>So, Alice, who was, for all intents and purposes, her sister, knew that Rio had never really had a serious girlfriend. Not for a lack of trying, Rio had just never really been interested in anyone, and certainly not anyone who had been interested in her back. There had been that one memorable time she had been head over heels in that 15-year-old way everyone was, for the prettiest girl in school, but Rio didn’t really count that. Otherwise, Rio was content with her life as it was. She had Alice, she had Lilia, she had her cats and plants. She had a good job and a nice apartment.</p><p>That wasn’t to say that Rio didn’t want someone. That person who knew you better than you knew yourself. The one who, after a long day of being around people, instead of wanting to be alone, wanted to be with <em>them</em> instead. But Rio also knew that it would take a special person for her to truly have that. She’d rather be alone than with the wrong person.</p><p>Alice’s voice dragged Rio out of her thoughts, “Rio, you still with me?”</p><p>“Sorry, what were you saying, Al?”</p><p>Alice studied her, considering her words carefully before continuing. “I was saying she’s very pretty. I see why you’re into her. Did you get her number, or her name for that matter?”</p><p>“No, she said if we liked the drinks she’d give it to me,” Rio answered.</p><p>Alice raised her eyebrows. “So, what, you don’t even know this woman’s name, and you’re in love with her? I thought you didn’t believe in any of that love at first sight bullshit. You refused to even watch my favourite movie because of it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, “Sorry that I think falling in love with someone else at your wedding is a bad plot for a movie.” Rio was quick to continue, cutting off whatever protest Alice had on the tip of her tongue, “But anyway, maybe I was wrong. There’s just something about her, Al. I can’t explain it. It feels almost cosmic.”</p><p>“Am I hearing this right? Is the great scientist Rio Vidal, the believer in only facts and numbers, saying she believes in fate?”</p><p>Rio scoffed, “No. I’m sure if I actually studied it, it would be some chemical reaction in your brain that causes it. Probably a mix of the classic attraction love at first sight, which is the cocktail of dopamine, oxytocin and adrenaline. Then you mix that in with-”</p><p>“Rio. I don’t care.” Rio snapped her jaw shut as Alice continued. “Look, the point is, if you’re serious, if you think you might actually like her, even if it’s just plain old attraction, you should chop that fucking beer and go and go and tell her it was the best thing you’ve ever tasted, until you get a taste of her that is, and then ask for her name and number.”</p><p>Rio choked on her drink at the words, “Al- Jesus Christ! I am not saying that to a woman I just met.”</p><p>“Why not? I thought she was the love of your life?”</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Rio ignored Alice, looking back towards the woman. She was currently shaking a cocktail shaker while talking to a coworker, and Rio racked her brain, but she had definitely never seen anything more attractive in her life. Rio supposed Alice was right, though she wouldn’t quite say it how Alice had, but she had to know who this woman was.</p><p>“Okay, yeah, I will.” At the opening of Alice’s mouth, Rio continued, “Not like <em>that</em>, but I’ll go talk to her.” Rio knocked the drink back, some of it spilling out around the edges of her mouth, but she didn’t care. She dully registered that the drink did, in fact, taste rather nice. And if she hadn’t been more occupied with inspecting what ring size the bartender had, she might’ve even tried to enjoy the taste. Oh well, there would be other pints. Hopefully.</p><p>Getting up from the table, Rio grabbed her empty glass and walked back to the bar, watching as the woman finished up with another customer. The woman saw her immediately and slowly made her way over. “So, thoughts?”</p><p>“I think you’re very beautiful and I would like to know your name and number. Also, the drink was nice. I think. I drank it fairly quickly,” Rio rushed out.</p><p>The woman raised her eyebrows amusedly at Rio. “I see, well, given that you only half followed the rules, I’ll do the same.”</p><p>The woman leaned forward over the bar, placing her arms around the chest in a way that had Rio fighting not to lower her eyes.</p><p>“The names Agatha. What’s yours, pretty boy?”</p><p>“Rio, my name’s Rio.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha purred, and Rio swore she almost came from that alone. She never thought hearing someone say her name would drive her crazy, but here she was. “Well, Rio. You didn’t follow the rules, so I can’t give you my number; it just wouldn’t be fair. But I have a break in fifteen minutes. Go upstairs, third door on the left.” Agatha’s eyes flicked down the bar where patrons had started to line up, her only other coworker becoming swamped. “I won’t wait long.”</p><p>With that, she walked away, and Rio was left standing with no drink and no number, but she had a name.</p><p>Agatha. Agatha. Agatha. Agatha. Rio rolled the name over in her head, felt it rattling around her body, seeping into every crevice of her being until every beat of her heart whispered the name back to her. It was an old name, not one you heard often, but it suited the woman in front of her perfectly. A woman this unique deserved a name in kind.</p><p> </p><p>The next fifteen minutes were absolute torture for Rio. She had sat back down with Alice and let Alice go on a rant about her latest failed date and the woes of dating. Or maybe she was talking about work now, Rio wasn’t totally sure. In all honesty, Rio’s eyes had been glued to the watch on Alice’s wrist. Reading it upside down as the seconds ticked down.</p><p>The second it hit fifteen minutes, Rio shot up out of her chair, muttering an apology to Alice, who was sporting a shit-eating grin, and headed up the stairs to find Agatha. Rio knocked gently on the bathroom door, entering after a soft ‘come in’ echoed from inside.</p><p>“Exactly fifteen minutes on the dot. I like someone punctual.” Agatha cooed, moving across the bathroom towards Rio. Rio felt her breath hitch as Agatha reached around her to lock the door behind her. Agatha moved her face to Rio’s neck, and Rio could feel her breath hot against her pulse point. “Now tell me, Rio, how long do you think it’ll take before I have you a quivering mess against this bathroom door?” Rio bit back a moan as Agatha moved her legs to push her thigh between Rio’s legs. “Because by the looks of it, I doubt I’ll need more than ten.”</p><p>Rio never did this. She wasn’t the type to hook up in a bathroom. She usually got too in her head. The smell, the germs, all of it was just too gross to be conducive to a good hook-up location. But right now? She was fighting to hump against Agatha’s thigh like an animal in heat.</p><p>“A-Agatha, p-please,” she whined out, barely forming the words.</p><p>“Poor thing, you’re so desperate for me, aren’t you?” Rio nodded vigorously at the words, the movement against Agatha’s leg had the seam of her jeans pressed right against her clit and if she could just-</p><p>Rio felt the pressure leave her as Agatha withdrew her leg, placing her hands on Rio’s hips to pin her to the door. Rio looked up at Agatha through hooded eyes, and she could feel the desperation that must’ve been written across her face, “Wh- why did you stop?” She stuttered out.</p><p>“The first time I make you come won’t be against my leg like a bitch in heat.” She purred as she dropped to her knees on the bathroom floor. Agatha reached for Rio’s belt, undoing it quickly, followed by the zipper of her jeans. “It’ll be on my tongue.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes returned to her prize, and she let out a snort at the sight of Rio’s dinosaur boxers. Rio felt her flush deepen, “I wasn’t exactly expecting this when I was putting them on,” she muttered.</p><p>Agatha raked her fingernails up Rio’s thighs, “Don’t worry, I think it’s cute.” She cooed as she placed a kiss on Rio’s hipbone before she finally, <em>finally</em>, peeled down Rio’s boxers.</p><p>Rio felt herself erupt in goosebumps as the cool air hit her. She could feel herself dripping down her thighs and tensed her thighs against Agatha’s hold in desperation.</p><p>Agatha, clearly one to never give in easily, started slowly, tortuously kissing up Rio’s left thigh. After what had to have genuinely been an eternity, she reached the apex of Rio’s thighs, and she arched into the touch, only for Agatha to move off and start again at the base of Rio’s right thigh. “<em>Agatha</em>, god,” she panted out. When she received no response, she tried again, “<em>Please</em>.” That seemed to do the trick, and she peered down to find Agatha already looking at her.</p><p>“Hold my hair back, handsome.”</p><p>Rio whimpered, threading her hands through the enticing locks, gripping them into a makeshift ponytail at the back of Agatha’s head.</p><p>As soon as she had, Agatha licked a long stripe through her folds, from her entrance to clit. Rio was usually quiet in bed and always thought it sounded fake and pornographic when people moaned ridiculously, but for the first time, she found she couldn’t bite back the obscene moan leaving her lips. Agatha had a kind of magic touch and ate her out like an animal starved.</p><p>Rio was sure she had never been fucked like this. Agatha knew exactly what she was doing. She moved from toying with Rio’s clit, to fucking her tongue as far as it could reach inside of her, caressing her walls. Rio could feel her orgasm building embarrassingly fast and felt her eyes roll into the back of her head as she fought to stave off her orgasm. The dinosaur boxers she could get away with, but coming within a few minutes? That was steering dangerously close to loser, virgin nerd territory.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha move again, shifting her head up to wrap her lips back around her clit. Sucking gently, Rio felt herself teetering on the edge of her orgasm. She fought against it, biting her lip so hard she felt the metallic taste of blood fill her mouth.</p><p>It was all for nothing in the end, because as soon as Agatha moved her hand up and fucked two fingers into Rio, curling them while she raked her teeth lightly over her clit, Rio was gone. Her mouth opened in a silent scream, and Rio felt her head smack back against the door, but couldn’t register the pain with the pleasure currently coursing through her body.  </p><p>Agatha continued fucking her through it gently, tonguing against her clit languidly and gently moving her fingers inside Rio. Finally, Rio felt herself return to her body, and she slumped against the door.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha move off her knees and come back up into Rio’s eye line. Agatha opened her mouth, presumably to make a snide comment, so Rio pulled her in by the waist and shut her up with a filthy kiss. Agatha immediately kissed her back, snaking her hands around Rio’s neck and, without any hesitation, pressed her tongue down onto the cut Rio had left on her own lip, making her hiss out in pain. Stealing the opportunity, Agatha licked into Rio’s mouth filthily. It wasn’t a romantic kiss, it wasn’t even a particularly good kiss, it was all tongue and teeth and far too sloppy, but it was the greatest kiss of Rio’s life.</p><p>Far too quickly, Agatha pulled back. “Well, would you look at that, I even had two minutes to spare.” Rio looked up at Agatha, confusion across her face. She couldn’t process the words in her hazy state. “You know what that means, big boy? It means we still have twelve minutes left. Plenty of time for you to return the favour.” Agatha finally seemed to take in Rio’s state, “That is, if I didn’t fuck the fine motor skills out of you.”</p><p>Rio, snapping back to reality, dug her fingernails into Agatha’s waist, hard enough to leave crescent moons that she hoped would be a reminder of her tomorrow. Agatha moaned at the sting, something Rio filed away for later, and with Agatha distracted, she flipped them around, “Not a chance.”</p><p>From this position, Rio had a clear view of the exposed skin of Agatha’s neck, one of the few places of un-inked skin, practically begging to be marked by Rio. Feeling emboldened by the orgasm, Rio latched on, sinking her teeth into Agatha’s pulse point. Her observation from earlier was proven correct, as she felt Agatha’s hands push her head further into her neck, begging for more.</p><p>Never one to deny a pretty girl anything, Rio continued marking down Agatha’s neck, sucking and nipping at every piece of exposed skin she could. Moving her way down, she kissed the three of swords tattoo on Agatha’s sternum, tracing the longest swords through the middle of the heart.</p><p>If you were to ask Rio, she could spend all day like this. Learning every inch of Agatha’s skin. Every tattoo, freckle, scar. But, if the increasingly tight grip on her hair and the shortening of Agatha’s breath were any indication, she was quickly running out of patience.</p><p>Rio pulled back, skimming her hands along the base of Agatha’s skimpy tank top. “Can I take this off?” She husked.</p><p>Agatha merely nodded, too turned on to speak, and Rio instantly grabbed the spaghetti straps, pulling them down her shoulders and revealing the gold bars Rio had been thinking of all night. She felt her mouth go dry at the sight, and had never in her twenty-six years of life needed to wrap her lips around a pair of nipples more.</p><p>Sucking one into her mouth, she heard Agatha gasp and felt her arch into the contact. She had heard that when pierced, nipples became more sensitive to touch. Testing the theory, Rio flicked the bar with her tongue, causing Agatha to let out an all too loud moan for the public setting they were in.</p><p>Reaching up, Rio clamped a hand over Agatha’s mouth, “You need to be quiet. Can you do that for me, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha stared back at her, her once bright blue eyes dark with lust, and she nodded against her hand. Pleased with the answer, Rio returned to lathe the other nipple with attention. Once she was satisfied, she continued her downward path. She ran her fingers along the <em>witch</em> tattoo that lay across Agatha’s stomach, tracing each letter.</p><p>“You want me to put a spell on you, baby?” Agatha purred, running her long nails across Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“I think you already have.”</p><p>Rio peered up at Agatha, slowly unbuttoning her pants, “You sure?”</p><p>In a moment of vulnerability, one she’s sure Agatha would deny later, she watched Agatha close her eyes, her face screwed up in anticipation, and she whined out desperately, “<em>Please</em>.”</p><p>As soon as the word was uttered, Rio pushed down Agatha’s pants and had to bite back a pathetic whine of her own when she saw the lace that left nothing to the imagination. The sad excuse for underwear did nothing on its best day, let alone almost soaked through. “All this for me?” Rio spoke the words into Agatha’s mound, running her nose along the mercifully untamed bush.  </p><p>“Shut up and put that smart mouth to use,” Agatha demanded.</p><p>Pushing the lace to the side, Rio immediately buried her face in Agatha’s cunt. Her face was instantly wet from nose to chin, and Rio was sure she had died and gone to heaven. If you had told her this morning that she would be on her knees eating out the hottest woman she had ever seen in a public toilet, she would’ve started by telling you how disgusting and unhygienic that was and then had you checked for a head injury.</p><p>But here she was, running her tongue around Agatha’s folds, lapping up all the wetness she’d already leaked out. Agatha tasted divine, and Rio was already hooked. She knew she would never taste anybody near as good as Agatha again. Knew she had to have her again, knew she couldn’t drink this holy water just one.</p><p>Aware of the time crunch they were under, Rio brought her focus back to Agatha’s clit, circling it with deadly precision, following Agatha’s bodily clues to see what she responded to the most. Needing to be deeper in Agatha, she brought her hand up to her entrance, ready to slip two fingers inside, when Agatha pulled her back.</p><p>“Wait, don’t- don’t go inside, just outside,” she panted out.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio murmured, already latching back onto her clit, slowly stroking her fingers over the top of Agatha’s entrance, never once dipping inside.</p><p>The extra stimulation seemed to be all Agatha needed, and before long, her thighs were clenching around Rio’s head, choking her. Rio fucked her through it, determined to steal another orgasm out of her.</p><p>Before Agatha could even come down from her first, Rio was propelling her into a second, smaller orgasm, that left her body twitching slightly.</p><p>Rio rose from her knees, cringing at the thought of what lived on that floor, and returned her hips to their new home address of Agatha’s hips.</p><p>She peered at Agatha, staring at her closed eyes, waiting for a glimpse of the ocean eyes.  </p><p>“Jesus Christ, Rio. Where did that come from?”</p><p>Rio just grinned, “So, does this mean I can have your number now? I’d really like to take you out properly.”</p><p>Agatha straightened at the words, subtly pushing Rio off her to redress herself. Rio watched as Agatha fiddled with her pants, seeming to take a long time to pull her zipper back up.</p><p>“Look, Rio, this was fun, but I don’t really do the whole <em>dating </em>thing. I just prefer to keep things casual. So, if that’s not something you’re interes-”</p><p>“No. I am. Whatever you want, that’s fine. I just wanna see you again.” Rio rushed out. The idea of never seeing Agatha again. Never getting to have her like this again. Well, Rio wasn’t one for dramatics, but the thought of that might’ve actually killed her. “Casual’s fine for me. I’m pretty busy with work anyway, so it actually works out better for me anyway.”</p><p>Rio watched a flash of something she couldn’t decipher cross Agatha’s face, but before she could even start to process it, it was gone. “Good. Yes, that’s good. Okay, well, I suppose you can have my number.”</p><p>Rio handed Agatha her phone, watching as she typed in her number. Upon getting her phone back, Rio looked down at the name Agatha had entered for herself</p><p>Agatha 🥵👅🔥</p><p>Rio smiled to herself and quickly sent a text to her so Agatha would have her number as well.</p><p>Agatha’s phone pinged with the message, and Rio watched Agatha’s eyes widen as she checked her phone, “Shit, my break ended five minutes ago, I’ve got to go.” She leaned in for a quick peck against Rio’s lips. “Send me a text and we’ll set something up, okay? Bye, Rio.”</p><p>With that, she was gone, with Rio shouting out a goodbye as she ran down the stairs. Rio stepped back into the bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror and running a hand through her hair. She took in her appearance. Lipstick that wasn’t hers smudged across her lips, hickeys blooming along her neck and collar bones, pupils still blown wide with lust. She looked like someone who had just had the fucking of their life. A fair enough look, she supposed.</p><p>Glancing back down at her phone, she saw that Alice had messaged saying she was heading home and hoped she didn’t see Rio until the next day. Rolling her eyes at the message, she clicked on her message with Agatha. Nothing there except the ‘Hi’ she had sent herself. She looked back at the name Agatha had left and, before she could doubt herself, changed it.</p><p>Agatha 🫶</p><p>Rio looked at it for a moment. It’s not like it meant anything, and Agatha would never see it. Putting her phone away, she unlocked the bathroom stall and headed back down the stairs. She considered sitting back down in a booth somewhere with a view of the bar, just so she could sit and watch Agatha for a while longer, but thought better of it. She looked thoroughly fucked, and she didn’t need any awkward looks.</p><p>Heading towards the door, she searched for Agatha at the bar, hoping for one last look, but she was nowhere to be found. Shrugging it off, Rio called an uber to take her home, ready to tell Alice as few details as she could get away with of the night.</p><p> </p><p>Rio supposed she should’ve had more self-respect, more game, and waited more than a night to text Agatha, but the minute she had escaped Alice’s questions and gotten into the quiet of her own room, she had texted Agatha asking if she was free anytime soon.</p><p>The response hadn’t come until 2 AM, but it made her smile nevertheless:</p><p>sure am ;) im working until 10 on wednesday but if you come pick me up im all yours for the rest of the evening</p><p>Rio had sent back a thumbs-up in reply, as soon as she woke up and wondered how difficult it would be to invent a time machine to skip the next few days.  </p><p> </p><p align="center">-----------------------------------------</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Eventually, Wednesday came around, and Rio found herself watching the clock like a hawk for the second time in four days. The second the clock hit five, she was out of her seat, her bag already packed, her lab coat off, hanging around the back of her chair. Rio’s lab partner eyed her suspiciously. Usually, Rio was the first in and last out. She never had anywhere better to be, and loved being in the lab, working with the plants was her happy place. But today she had a better offer.</p><p>Racing out the door, ignoring everyone, she headed for the subway. Rio assumed Agatha would want to come back to her place tonight, and it was a mess, to say the least. Rio wasn’t an untidy person, but Alice had a habit of putting something down and picking it up three weeks later. Usually, Rio kept on top of the cleaning; she found it calming and knew that Alice wouldn’t do it right, but she’d been a little distracted by a certain brunette for the past few days.  </p><p>As soon as she was home, Rio sped run cleaning the house and her room, replacing the sheets and putting away any of her ‘childish’ decorations that Alice always made fun of.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, you cannot bring a girl over here with dinosaur and Star Wars figurines sitting out,” Alice had berated her earlier that morning when Rio had detailed her plans with Agatha.</p><p>“Why not? God forbid I have a personality. Besides, it’s not like it’s a date. Agatha’s not exactly here to analyse the contents of my room.”</p><p>Alice ignored Rio, grabbing her coffee cup as she moved towards the apartment door. “Whatever, dude, leave it if you want, but if it was me, I wouldn’t want to be having intense eye contact with Han Solo while I was riding someone.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had ceded to that and moved everything away, so her room looked like that of a somewhat functioning adult. Rio checked her watch, 7 pm. She still had two hours to kill until she would have to leave to go and see Agatha. That left the perfect amount of time for the final part of Rio’s plan. See, she knew Agatha didn’t want a relationship, didn’t want to go on dates. And that was perfectly fine with Rio. Really, she didn’t mind. Not one bit. She was great at casual. And maybe Alice had laughed in her face when she’d said it was going to be a casual thing with Agatha, but that was neither here nor there. But, Rio was only human; she still had to eat, and if she just so happened to have leftovers from her own dinner that Agatha might want after a long shift, then that was a happy coincidence.</p><p>So, Rio moved to the kitchen to make her and Agatha dinner. She wasn’t the greatest cook in the world, but her time living with Lilia had given her a grasp on a few Sicilian staples as well as her mom’s Puerto Rican food, so she got to work.</p><p>Rio loved the rhythm of cooking. When she had first moved in with Lilia, she had never stepped foot in a kitchen, but her first night there, Lilia had her in the kitchen helping with the meal. Over the years, Rio’s skill in the kitchen had improved slightly, though she was nowhere near Lilia’s level. Lilia had always been patient with Rio, letting her make the mistakes and waiting for her to come to her for help. She had let Rio grow into herself, figure things out for herself and was always there to pick up the pieces when things inevitably went wrong. She was always patient with Rio, knowing that Rio needed a routine, that she hated change. So, she had made it her mission to learn as many Puerto Rican meals as she could, so Rio at least had something from her old life.</p><p>Rio thought about her parents often, wondered if they would be proud of her, the woman she had become. She wondered if they would like Agatha. They hadn’t spoken much the past few days apart from the occasional ‘how was your day’ text and the cat reels Agatha sent Rio, but she found her thoughts drifting to the other woman more often than not. God, she felt insane for even thinking about it; she barely even knew the woman, and she was already imagining whether or not her dead parents would like her.</p><p>The sound of keys jangling in the lock and Alice’s voice drew Rio out of her daydream. “God, Rio, it smells amazing in here. What are you cooking?”</p><p>“Hey Al, I’m making arroz con gandules, and before you ask, yes, you can have some, but only if you promise to be out of here in the next hour.”</p><p>Alice waltzed into the kitchen, leaning over the pot and stealing a bit of the still-cooking food. Alice sidestepped Rio as she went to swat Alice’s hand away and chuckled, “Yes, yes, I’m just grabbing some stuff, and I’ll go over to Nat and Yelena’s, calm down, you and your girlfriend will have the whole place to yourself for your romantic dinner.”</p><p>Rio tensed, muttering, “Not my girlfriend, and not a romantic dinner.”</p><p>Alice emerged from the living room, having grabbed the last few things she needed, “Yeah, but you wish it was, don’t you.” she teased.</p><p>Rio ignored her, because yes, she did wish that, but Agatha had been clear, she didn’t do relationships. And Rio would take any piece of Agatha she could get. “What I want is for you to please leave so I can put this away and go and see Agatha.”</p><p>Alice ignored the barb and took a healthy amount of the food before she headed back out the door. As soon as the door was closed, Rio felt the nerves starting to kick in. She wasn’t sure how to do this; she didn’t know the etiquette of picking someone up for a hookup. Should she bring flowers? No, flowers were date material. Flowers were feelings. The food was probably already pushing her luck anyway. She glanced at the clock and knew she had to leave soon if she wanted to have enough time to psych herself up before going inside to get Agatha. Rio packed everything away, and made sure the kitchen was spotless before grabbing her keys. On her way out the door Rio looked at herself in the mirror. <em>You can do this, it’s just a hookup, you know what you’re doing. </em>With that thought, Rio pulled on her coat to fight against the cold autumn air and went to pick up her future wife.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>It had been the shift from absolute hell. Every single person had wanted some nightmarish cocktail and refused to wait their turn. Seriously, they were barely one step above a dive bar here, what happened to ordering the cheapest beer you could find? People had no respect for money anymore. </span></p><p><span>Handing the latest customer, who had somehow missed the massive scissors tattoo on her arm, his drink and a not-so-pleasant smile, she turned away from the crowd. Her blessed phone told her she only had ten minutes left of her shift. </span></p><p><em><span>Close enough,</span></em><span> she thought as she saluted a goodbye to Jen, who was already shaking her head, unsurprised by Agatha’s antics. Ignoring her, Agatha searched the bar for Rio and found her instantly. She was huddled up in a corner booth, playing on her– oh god, this nerd had brought her literal Nintendo Switch to the bar. </span></p><p><span>Jesus Christ, what a loser. </span></p><p><span>Agatha was going to fuck the everloving shit out of her tonight. </span></p><p><span>“I have to say, I’m a little insulted that you find your little gameboy more interesting than me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio, who hadn’t heard Agatha approaching, shot up in her seat, promptly dropping the switch on the counter. “A-Agatha, hey. Shit, sorry, I didn’t see you come over.” She paused, standing up and appearing to consider whether it was appropriate to hug Agatha in greeting. Thankfully, her hesitation gave Agatha enough time to shift her arms across her chest. </span></p><p><span>Decision made for her, Rio continued on her tirade. “And I was watching. Like a lot.” Agatha raised her eyebrows amusedly, a coy smile playing on her face. “Shit, no, not like, in a creepy way. I just like watching you. Not like that, shit that sounds bad.” Rio wiped her hands over her face in frustration or embarrassment, Agatha couldn’t quite tell. Maybe a little of both. “I just, you’re incredible while you work. You’re sort of entrancing, the way you move behind the bar. I could probably watch you forever.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked. Struck once again by Rio’s blunt honesty. Ignoring the warm and fuzzy feeling that spread over her at the words, instead attributing them to the shot she had done for confidence before leaving the bar, she shook out her hair and carried on. “Yes, well, what can I say, I’m easy on the eyes.” Slipping into the best bedroom eyes she could, Agatha peered up at Rio, “What do you say you take me home?” </span></p><p><span>Rio nodded vigorously, picking up her bag and Switch from the table before following Agatha out the door.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Rio’s place is exactly what Agatha expected. It’s covered in equal parts plants and lego, and freakishly tidy. Agatha, never one for manners, starts poking around. Instantly, she finds a picture of Rio and another woman.</span></p><p><span>“Who’s this?” </span></p><p><span>Rio, who had weirdly been busying herself with something in the kitchen instead of trying to get into Agatha’s pants, replied with an unsatisfactory, “What?”</span></p><p><span>Taking the easy exit, this was a casual hookup after all, Agatha walked back to Rio.</span></p><p><span>“Sorry, I couldn’t hear you over the microwave. What did you ask?”</span></p><p><span>“Nothing, don’t worry about it.” Agatha scrunched her nose at the food, not in disgust but confusion, “What’s this?”</span></p><p><span>Rio had the decency to flush, “I um, I figured you maybe would be hungry after your shift, and well, I had these already left over from the other day so,” she shrugged, as if food that was definitely not left overs was a totally normal thing to have with a casual hookup on only the first proper night of said casual hooking up.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt the butterflies she thought she had squashed that first night in the bar come back. Rio, whom she had known for all of four days, had cooked her dinner because she was worried about her eating habits. Cute. But also not conducive to Agatha’s dead butterfly habit. </span></p><p><span>Just this once was okay, she supposed. The food was already reheated, and it would be a shame to waste it, especially if it tasted as good as it looked. </span></p><p><span>“Is this your way of saying I’m gonna need my strength?” Agatha purred. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s face flushed impossibly deeper, “No! God no, well, I mean yes. But not like that, I genuinely wanted to make sure you had eaten. But also yes, I mean, energy is probably not a bad thing to have and-”</span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t stop the grin spreading over her face at Rio’s scrambling. “Rio, I’m fucking with you.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth snapped shut and she visibly relaxed. “Yes, right, I knew that.” Rio passed her a plate and sat down next to her at the bench.</span></p><p><span>Sitting here with Rio, eating the dinner she had made for them both, suddenly felt far too domestic, and Agatha knew she had to retreat to the safety of relentlessly teasing her. “So, what do you do for work that you have enough time to make dinner for your casual hook-ups on a whim?” </span></p><p><span>Rio, who seemed to always be a shade of red around Agatha, reddened further. “Oh, um, well, I’m actually a botanist. I’ve always loved plants and science, so I figured why not mix the two, you know?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha cocked her head in curiosity, “What exactly does a botanist do? I sort of always figured it was just like a fancy gardener or florist.”</span></p><p><span>Rio opened her mouth before seemingly cutting herself off mid-thought. Agatha watched as the gears spun in Rio’s head; surely she wasn’t that taken aback by Agatha’s all-around brilliance that she couldn’t even explain her own job. </span></p><p><span>“It’s um, pretty boring and very sciency actually. Don’t get me wrong, I love what I do, it’s just,” she paused, eyes flitting from her plate up to Agatha, “I’ve been told before I tend to overdo it with all the science stuff, I’m not the best with social cues and can’t tell when I should really just stop talking.”</span></p><p><span>Rio tried to pass it off as a joke, but adorably failed. Agatha could see how uncomfortable it made Rio to think she was unintentionally making someone else uncomfortable or bored. </span></p><p><span>Agatha put down her fork, reaching her out to rest her hand against Rio’s arm, ignoring the heat that flared up from where their bodies connected.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not everyone, I want to know. Tell me what you do, you can be as sciency as you like.” Agatha wasn’t quite sure where that had come from. She normally couldn’t care less about science or somebody who she barely knew, but distressingly enough, she found herself genuinely wanting to hear about Rio and her job. </span></p><p><span>Rio hesitated, but told her nonetheless. Agatha would be lying if she said she understood more than four words of Rio’s spiel, but she took in every last word, watching how Rio’s face lit up at certain parts, how the more she told and realised Agatha was genuinely listening, she started to get more animated, waving her hands around to ensure Agatha got the whole picture. </span></p><p><span>“It’s just sort of the only place I can be myself, you know? After my parents died, I was just angry at everyone, and it wasn’t until I was with Lilia, my foster mom, that I channelled that emotion into something productive and started gardening.”</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t know you were a foster kid.” Agatha blurted out.</span></p><p><span>“Hmm? Oh, yeah. My parents died when I was ten. They were coming to pick me up from basketball training and were hit by a drunk driver. The pain’s never really gone away, I suppose, but I have Alice and her mom and Lilia, and they help.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at Rio, this woman who seemed like any other nerd she would chew through and spit out without a second thought, but was so much more. Rio, who cared so deeply and had been through so much, and was somehow still a beacon of sunshine. </span></p><p><span>Agatha knew she could be an abrasive person, prided herself on it, actually. She had had a less than stellar childhood and had frankly earned the right to be a bitch to people who deserved it. But here was Rio, who had suffered a similarly shitting childhood and turned out just fine. Agatha swallowed the lump she could feel forming in her throat, and almost choked on it at the question Rio asked her to fill the silence her self-depricating thinking had led to. </span></p><p><span>“What about you? What are your parents like?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes flicked up to Agatha’s, so wide and full of innocence, unaware of the can of worms she was attempting to pry open. </span></p><p><span>Agatha suddenly became very interested in the singular grain of rice left on her plate and weighed her two options. One, she could grab Rio’s and drag her to the bedroom, shutting down any line of questioning that might clue Rio into how fucked up Agatha truly was. Two, she could be honest with the woman she had known for far too little time and say ‘Oh, yeah my mom has hated me since I was born.’</span></p><p><span>Looking back up to Rio, this woman who had managed to invade her every thought in the little time she’d known her, Agatha knew she only had one true choice. </span></p><p><span>Before either of them could blink, Agatha’s mouth latched onto Rio’s, taking advantage of Rio’s gasp of shock and slipping her tongue inside. </span></p><p><span>Agatha liked Rio, enough that she wanted tonight, their only night together, to be perfect. One that didn’t involve any mention of Evanora Harkness. </span></p><p><span>Blessedly, Rio’s brain finally seemed to catch up, and she threaded her hands around Agatha’s waist, any questioning from earlier forgotten. </span></p><p><span>Rio started moving, presumably leading them to her bedroom, but they kept getting distracted by each other's mouths. Having had enough of their lack of progress to the bedroom, Rio growled into Agatha’s mouth, lifting her off the ground and carrying her towards her bedroom. </span></p><p><span>If Agatha had been in her right state of mind, she would have berated Rio, telling her to put her the fuck down, but she was so turned on by the fact that the hot nerd was also a <em>ripped </em>hot nerd to detach their mouths to berate her.</span></p><p><span>Finally, after pressing Agatha against every wall on the way there, Rio opened the door to her bedroom, all the while never removing her mouth from Agatha’s. Rio threw her down on the bed, and before Agatha could even get her breath back, was on top of her, working her top off and latching onto her left nipple. Agatha arched up into the touch, gripping Rio’s hair at the roots and pushing her head further down. </span></p><p><span>Rio, unimpressed, lifted her head, “Behave.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha let out an honest to god whimper at that, loosening her grip in Rio’s hair to simply be holding, encouraging, not demanding. </span></p><p><span>Agatha had seen signs of it in the bar bathroom, but there was no denying it now. Quiet, awkward Rio, who brought her Nintendo to a bar, was an absolute freak in the bedroom. It was like a flip switched in her the moment the lights went off. She took control, throwing Agatha around and having her way with her. Agatha usually found herself being the dominant one in the bedroom; she hated giving up control to a total stranger, but with Rio that wasn’t an option. Rio took without asking, and Agatha found herself enjoying it more than she should. </span></p><p><span>Rio, who had been occupied leaving no ounce of Agatha’s chest unmarked, started moving her way down Agatha’s stomach. “God, Agatha, you’re so beautiful. Every inch of you,” she muttered against her skin, punctuating every word with a kiss. </span></p><p><span>Agatha wasn’t used to this, being worshipped. Usually, sex was perfunctory; she knew what she wanted and she got it. But Rio never did anything in half measures, it seemed. </span></p><p><span>Rio continued her descent, grazing her fingers over Agatha’s sodden thong. Agatha gasped at the contact; she hadn’t even realised Rio had taken off her jeans. She really needed to focus if she wanted to keep even a shred of her dignity.</span></p><p><span>As if she could read her mind and sense the fight returning to Agatha, Rio simply moved the scrap of fabric out of the way and buried her face in Agatha’s cunt. </span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped at the contact, feeling Rio’s nose bumping tortuously against her clit as she lapped up the wetness already leaking out of her. Clearly, Rio was a very determined pussy eater, and Agatha was trying to be more selfless, so she supposed her dignity could wait and she could let Rio continue on her merry way. </span></p><p><span>Thankfully, Rio was more than happy to oblige. Once she had licked every inch of Agatha from inner thigh to dripping centre, she finally, </span><em><span>finally, </span></em><span>paid some much needed attention to Agatha’s neglected clit. </span></p><p><span>Rio circled it slowly, teasing Agatha within an inch of her life. </span></p><p><span>“Cmon, baby…I need more. </span><em><span>Riooo,</span></em><span>” Agatha whined out. </span></p><p><span>Rio shifted back, blowing cool air over her clit and smirked at the jump of Agatha’s hips. “Beg for it, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried to let out a scoff because she never begged anyone for anything, but it came out as a mangled half-scoff, half-moan as Rio latched onto her clit. </span></p><p><span>“Shit, yes, baby, just like that, you’re such a good girl for me,” Agatha panted out. </span></p><p><span>Agatha could feel her orgasm building; she was so close, she just needed a little more. She knew what she needed to push her over the edge, but having Rio inside her like that was too intimate. Instead, she gripped Rio’s hair, pulling it back into a makeshift ponytail to resist pushing her head down again and moved her other hand to her own nipple, pinching the bar pierced through it.</span></p><p><span>Right as she felt the crest of her orgasm threaten to fall, Rio abruptly pulled away. </span></p><p><span>“Wha- Rio, what the fuck? I, fuck, baby, I was so close.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked, bringing her fingers up to slowly circle her clit, “I know, but I told you, you have to beg.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha internally (and maybe a little externally) groaned; it was time to pull out all the stops. Agatha put on her best bedroom voice and looked down at Rio with sinfully hooded eyes. “Come on handsome, don’t you wanna make me come, don’t you wanna see me fall apart for you? I’ll look so pretty coming all over your tongue.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stared into Agatha’s eyes, boring so deeply into her as if she were trying to read her thoughts. Agatha could see Rio deciding whether to give in or not, and figured she needed one last push. “Cmon Rio, make me yours baby, let me come.” </span></p><p><span>Rio closed her eyes, steeling herself against Agatha’s onslaught, and lowered her head back to Agatha’s clit. Agatha could feel her breath, centimetres away from where she needed her most. But Rio didn’t move; she stayed there, fingers swiping through her folds and digging into her thigh. Without looking up, she heard Rio whisper, the words literally hitting her straight in the clit. “I said beg, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Fuck her fucking chungus life. </span></p><p><span>That last shred of dignity Agatha had been clinging to was about to go out the window, but in fairness, so was Agatha if she didn’t come in the next sixty seconds. </span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed her pride and the snarky comment on her tongue, “Rio, baby…please, <em>please</em> let me come.”</span></p><p><span>As soon as Agatha whispered the first please, Rio’s tongue was back on her clit, working her back to the edge embarrassingly quickly, only this time she didn’t stop, and Agatha felt her orgasm wash over her. </span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t let up as Agatha came down, continuing the movement over her clit, and reaching up to tweak one of Agatha’s nipples, sending her into a smaller but no less intense second orgasm. </span></p><p><span>This was arguably worse for Agatha’s pride than the begging had been. Coming twice in the span of about ninety seconds was an all-time low. </span></p><p><span>Agatha waited for Rio to slowly work her way back up her body, let her suck on the marks she had already left, let her trace the tattoos, before finally capturing Agatha’s lips. She let Rio force her tongue into her mouth, tasting herself on Rio’s tongue. She waited until she felt Rio relax on top of her, confident in her control, before she flipped them over, straddling Rio. </span></p><p><span>“You know, I think you’re wearing far too much clothing. Why don’t you be a good boy for me and strip,” Agatha cooed. </span></p><p><span>Rio, who had been all bite tonight, went surprisingly docile at the pet name, moving to take off her top without complaint. As she moved to take off her pants, Agatha watched her eyes un-subtly dart to the bedside table. </span></p><p><span>Swinging off Rio, Agatha pulled open the drawer, eyes going wide at what was inside. Turning around to make a snide comment, her mouth went dry at the sight of Rio lying naked on the bed.</span></p><p><span>For the first time, Agatha got a proper look at the other woman. Underneath the lame science pun t-shirts and glasses, Rio was hiding a toned six-pack like some kind of knock-off Superman. </span></p><p><span>Agatha watched as Rio’s eyes wandered from her naked form to the drawer, watched as the flush spread from her cheeks down to her neck and chest. </span></p><p><span>Moving back to Rio like a predator stalking its prey, Agatha held the harness up, “Oh, I see, is this what you want baby? You want me to take you for a ride?”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded vigorously, her jaw slack in awe. Agatha quickly slipped into the harness, tightening the straps so the base would rub perfectly against her clit. </span></p><p><span>Agatha moved between Rio’s legs, pulling her weeping core flush against the strap. She ran the head of it teasingly through Rio’s folds, taking her sweet time and making sure it brushed Rio’s clit on every pass. </span></p><p><span>Agatha could feel Rio already growing impatient, squirming against her, but Agatha wasn’t letting Rio get it that easily, not after the torture she had put Agatha through. She was going to wait until Rio was truly desperate, until she was on her last shred of patience, until she was finally begging-</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, please…please I need you so badly.”</span></p><p><span>Well, that was easy. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah, you want it? Get on all fours then for me, baby.”</span></p><p><span>Rio moved instantly, unashamedly scrambling to her hands and knees and presenting herself to Agatha. From this angle, Agatha had a perfect view and could see the slick trickling down Rio’s thigh. “I was gonna get lube, but I don’t think you’re gonna need it, you’re so wet, baby. Is this all for me?” </span></p><p><span>Rio bucked back against the strap as Agatha notched just the head inside her entrance, “Yeah, god, it’s all for you, Agatha. Please, I’ll be your good boy, just please.”</span></p><p><span>And well, Agatha </span><em><span>had</span></em><span> decided to be more selfless, so she took pity on Rio, sinking the entire length of the strap into her in one long stroke. </span></p><p><span>Agatha wasn’t sure which one of them let out the moan as she sank in, for her sake, she hoped it was Rio, but at this angle, the friction pad hit her clit just right, and she could tell her third orgasm would hit her embarrassingly quickly. </span></p><p><span>Agatha wasted no time in setting a brutal pace, determined to get Rio there before she herself tipped over the edge. Snaking her hand around, Agatha found Rio’s clit, hovering her hand over it teasingly. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span>,” Rio moaned, her body fighting between thrusting back onto the strap and down onto Agatha’s hovering hand. </span></p><p><span>“You that desperate for me, baby? Rutting against my hand? You’re so fucking needy. You’d let me do whatever I wanted to you, wouldn’t you?” Agatha spat into her ear, driving her hips harder into Rio. </span></p><p><span>“Ye-yeah, whatever you wanted…only you,” Rio whimpered out. </span></p><p><span>Good enough, Agatha decided, bringing her hand up to Rio’s clit. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck, Agatha, I’m gonna come,” Rio gasped out. </span></p><p><span>“Come for me, baby.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha knew she couldn’t actually feel it, but she swore she could feel Rio pulsing around the strap, squeezing it for all its worth, and it was that feeling that sent Agatha over the edge herself, sloppily thrusting into Rio, trying to prolong both of their orgasms. </span></p><p><span>As the orgasms washed over them both, Rio collapsed onto the bed, her arms finally giving out, sending Agatha down with her, keeping the strap lodged firmly inside Rio. Agatha wasn’t sure how long they lay like that, still entangled together, Rio’s aftershocks twitching around the strap.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, after they had both come back to their bodies and Agatha had thrown the strap somewhere across the room, Agatha gently tried to slip out of Rio’s arms, already eyeing where her clothes were strewn across the room. Agatha was never one to stay the night; she had seen </span><em><span>Misery </span></em><span>one too many times. God forbid someone tried to tie her to the bed (not that Agatha would be against that with Rio), or even worse, try to cuddle. </span></p><p><span>Before she could get far, she felt those strong arms tighten, trapping her to the bed. </span></p><p><span>Fucking </span><em><span>Misery</span></em><span>. </span></p><p><span>“Stay,” Rio sighed into her hair, and for once, Agatha couldn’t find it in her to fight. </span></p><p><span>She decided she would wait until Rio was asleep and would quietly sneak out, no harm, no foul. This had been fun, but Agatha didn’t do second nights, or technically thirds in this case, but the bar hardly counted. She relaxed into Rio’s grip, closing her eyes and pushing her head into her neck, ignoring how perfectly they fit together.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha thought her plan had been foolproof. </span></p><p><span>Step One: Lie in the arms of the strong, hot nerd until said nerd falls asleep and then leave. </span></p><p><span>That was sort of all the steps, really, pretty fucking easy to follow.</span></p><p><span>So when </span><em><span>she </span></em><span>was the one who woke up in an empty bed the next morning, safe to say she was fairly irritated.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t remember falling asleep, only a vague conversation in which Rio had mentioned something about her Nintendo Switch not being a Game Boy (which, duh), and then nothing. She couldn’t even recall any of her dreams for the first time in a long time. Small mercies, she supposed. </span></p><p><span>Now, of course, she was going to pay the price. She could hear Rio in the kitchen, clearly trying to be quiet and not wake Agatha up, while simultaneously banging things together so loudly that people four blocks away would probably have woken up as well. </span></p><p><span>At the muttering of a “quiet” ‘shit!’, Agatha decided she may as well get up and face the music. </span></p><p><span>Rio was, as Agatha had expected, in the kitchen. She had headphones on and was dancing around as she made them breakfast. </span></p><p><span>Watching Rio, Agatha felt herself questioning her decision for the first time this morning. Okay, maybe the third or seventh time, but semantics. Maybe she could just stay for breakfast, let Rio ask her out on a proper date, see what happened. But, as with the other eight times this morning, as soon as she let herself pretend, she was reminded of Rio’s face last night when she asked about her parents. So unaware of all the pain Agatha would bring into her life. It was better this way, a nice, clean break now, before Rio got hurt. </span></p><p><span>“Jesus Christ, Agatha! Warn a girl.” Rio, who had turned around during Agatha’s internal war, was standing unironically grabbing at her chest in shock. </span></p><p><span>“Sorry, sweetheart, in all honesty, I wasn’t expecting to see you this morning at all.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s brow furrowed in confusion at the words. “Not see me? It is my place, Agatha, why would you- oh. Right. I’m sorry if you feel like I forced you to stay. I hadn’t meant to make you uncomfortable or anything,” Rio rushed out, busying her hands with scrambling some eggs. </span></p><p><span>And there it was. Already, Agatha was managing to cause Rio pain, letting Rio think it was her who had done the wrong thing, not Agatha. Rio couldn’t even believe that maybe Agatha was going to sneak off in the dead of night;  no, she thought she had forced Agatha to stay. </span></p><p><span>“No, that’s not what I-,” Agatha sighed. There wasn’t any point in explaining, and in all honesty, the truth that she had planned to ditch Rio in the middle of the night would probably hurt the other woman more. “I actually have to run, I promised I’d meet a friend for brunch so…”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, yeah, of course, no worries.” Agatha ignored the stab of hurt that briefly graced Rio’s face. </span></p><p><span>Rio led her to the door, her hand pausing on the handle. Agatha could see Rio’s brain working and begged every god she could think of for Rio to not ask the question Agatha knew was on the tip of her tongue. But no god had ever answered her prayers, so why would they start now.</span></p><p><span>“I um, I was just wondering if maybe I could take you out properly sometime? Or just see you again maybe?” Rio asked with such hope in her voice that it made Agatha feel physically sick. </span></p><p><span>“Look, Rio, this was fun, and I had a great time, truly. I just don’t really do the whole dating thing.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, well, that’s…that’s that, I suppose then?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, slipping into her usual mask of nonchalance. This was casual. It was a one (two) time thing, and that was it. Rio was fun, she was a good fuck, and she would be a good story to tell Jen in a few weeks. </span></p><p><span>Why then did Agatha feel her heart sink at Rio’s quiet acceptance? Well, that was a problem for her to discuss in the therapy she would probably be forced into by Jen sometime in the next decade. </span></p><p><span>Until then, it simply wasn’t Agatha’s problem. So she let Rio open the door for her, let her give her one last kiss on the cheek, and walked away without looking back. </span></p><p><span>If you were to ask Agatha later, if that had been her sitting outside Rio’s apartment block, staring at what should be Rio’s living room window until Jen called asking why she was late for her shift, well she would simply roll her eyes and walk away. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p align="center"><span>-----------------------------------------</span></p><p align="center"> </p><p><span>“Remind me why I agreed to this again?” </span></p><p><span>“Because occasionally, despite pretending you don’t have a heart, you actually do care and can sometimes be a decent friend.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha scoffed, “Excuse you, I am always an amazing friend, but also that doesn’t sound like me at all.” </span></p><p><span>Jen hummed as they moved towards the Italian restaurant, “Yes, well, I suppose the free dinner, despite you earning four times what I do and the covered shift probably sweetened the deal.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha grinned, “It’s not my fault Vision’s bullshit meter is broken, they should try and fix that at his next parts upgrade.” </span></p><p><span>Ignoring her, Jen led them inside the restaurant, which in Agatha’s opinion was too nice for a shitty double date. Agatha wondered when she had become lame enough that her best option for a Saturday night out was a double date with her best friend’s new flame and her loser best friend, who was apparently hung up on some other chick. </span></p><p><span>Hilariously, it probably wouldn’t even end up being the worst date Agatha had ever been on, at least she wouldn’t have to pay. And maybe she’d be lucky, and the friend would be hot and down for a quickie. </span></p><p><span>“Hi, yes, booking under Kale?” </span></p><p><span>“Right this way, ma’am, the other two members of your party are already here.” They followed the hostess to the back of the restaurant, and as they got closer Agatha saw Alice,who Jen had excitedly shown her pictures of just yesterday, but her eyes were drawn to the back of her friend.</span><span><br/>
</span></p><p><span>“Uh, Jen,” she hissed out, “What did you say Alice’s friend’s name was again?”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, uh, Rita, I think? Wait no, that’s not right, maybe Rosie? Or-”</span></p><p><span>“Rio.” Agatha breathed out, locking eyes with the woman she hadn’t been able to get out of her head for the past month. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah! That’s it! Wait, you two know each other already?” Jen asked. </span></p><p><span>Rio, thankfully, looked as stunned as Agatha was. “We met at the bar once a while back,” Rio answered for them both. </span></p><p><span>The awkward silence that followed wasn’t worth a thousand free dinners and she watched as Alice put the pieces together in her head. As the uncomfortable revelation settled over Alice, she took a sick sense of pride in the knowledge that </span><em><span>she </span></em><span>was the woman that Rio had been hung up on for the past month. She also felt a tiny bit plain sick over the knowledge, but that was irrelevant. </span></p><p><span>“Well, that makes this a bit easier then!” Jen joked, clearly still blithely unaware of the elephant in the room. As long as Jen didn’t bring up Rio’s dating life, they would be okay. </span></p><p><span>“So, Rio, Alice told me you’ve been hung up on this girl?”</span></p><p><span>Or she could just walk smack bang into the fucking elephant, that worked too. </span></p><p><span>Agatha locked eyes with Rio, who quickly averted hers, colour taking over her face. “Yeah, um, I met someone really special, and I thought maybe, well, it doesn’t matter what I thought, she wasn’t interested.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her heart drop at the words. She hated that she had made Rio feel like this, like she wasn’t worthy of love, of Agatha’s love. She was, she was worth </span><em><span>more</span></em><span>, which is why Agatha had left. </span></p><p><span>This truly was just great, even when Agatha tried to do the right thing, tried to be good, she managed to fail most spectacularly. God, if only her mother could see her now, she’d get a right kick out of all this. </span></p><p><span>Jen, as always, knew exactly what not to say. “Well fuck her, you’re hot and from what Alice tells me, a real catch. This girl sounds like a right idiot for passing up on you.” </span></p><p><span>“Did you just call my best friend hot?” Alice asked, trying and failing to ease the tension. These two bozos were perfect for each other. </span></p><p><span>“Or, maybe,” Agatha began, trying to save what little face she had left after Jen had stomped all over it, “Maybe she did have a great time, and maybe she did care, she just didn’t think she was what this person deserved and that they could do better.”</span></p><p align="left"><span>Jen looked at her condescendingly, “Uh, yeah, that’s basically what I just said?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha ignored her, looking only at Rio, watching every emotion under the sun flicker over her face. Rio reached up, fiddling with her glasses, clearly uncomfortable with all the attention on her, “I, uh- I’m just gonna go to the bathroom.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha watched her leave, truly taking in her form as she left, savouring the moment as any lesbian should before turning back to Jen. “You’re so fucking thick, you know that?” she hissed out before following Rio.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha pushed open the door, bracing herself for whatever was on the other side. A quickie, if she was lucky. </span></p><p><span>“Did you mean it?” Rio asked without looking up from the sink. </span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. There was no beating around the bush with this one, was there? “Yeah, I did. I had a great time Rio, I’m just not built for relationships or casual relationships or whatever. I’m better off on my own.”</span></p><p><span>That seemed to do the trick, and Agatha was granted a glimpse of Rio’s deep brown eyes again. “You don’t really believe that, do you? That you’re better off alone?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha shrugged. This was teetering on getting too personal already. “I mean no, not like </span><em><span>that</span></em><span>, but I don’t think my personality is that conducive to a real relationship.” Agatha watched as Rio opened her mouth to say something, probably something stupid like </span><em><span>‘that’s not true, I like you’</span></em><span> blah blah blah, so Agatha picked the lesser of two evils. “But, you know, I do believe in fate, and I’m willing to admit when I’m wrong,” Agatha lied, closing in on Rio like prey, trapping her against the sink. “What are the odds we end up here, with both of our best friends asking us on a double date? I think it would be silly to waste this opportunity. I think you’re hot, you clearly think I’m hot if you’ve been pining over me for the past month.” </span></p><p><span>“Pining is a strong word,” Rio muttered, flushing deeply once again. </span></p><p><span>Ignoring her, Agatha continued, “What do you say we enter an arrangement, you and me, no strings.” </span></p><p><span>They were close enough now that Agatha could feel Rio’s breath on her face as she pondered Agatha’s offer. “You mean like friends with benefits?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha dipped her head, brushing her lips over Rio’s. “Friends with benefits, fuck buddies, gal pals, whatever you wanna call it.” Agatha moved her lips to Rio’s neck, placing light, open-mouthed kisses along it.  </span></p><p><span>“I-I don’t know Agatha, I don’t think I’m really gonna be good at that,” she stuttered out, breath hitching over every second word. It was cute, really, how nervous Rio got with just the slightest touch. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t worry, I’ll show you how,” Agatha purred, slipping her hand into the waistband of Rio’s pants. “It’s real easy, I make you fall apart right here, right now, and then we go back out to our friends like nothing happened, and then I come home with you. Does that sound good, baby?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched Rio’s eyes roll into the back of her head, at the pet name or her hand now stroking through her folds, she couldn’t be sure. </span></p><p><span>“Y-yeah, that sounds good,” Rio gasped as Agatha moved to slip two fingers inside her, curling them in just the right spot that had Rio’s thighs quivering embarrassingly quickly. </span></p><p><span>“We don’t have long until Jen and Alice get suspicious,” Agatha cooed, nipping harder down Rio’s neck. “Are you gonna be a good boy for me and come quickly?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha felt Rio clench around her fingers at the words. “Yes, fuck, Agatha, I’ll be so good for you. Please, I’m so close,” Rio gasped out. </span></p><p><span>Taking pity on the woman, Agatha swiped her thumb once, twice, over Rio’s clit and watched Rio fall over the edge even quicker than she had that first night in the bar. “That’s it, baby, you did so good, such a good boy for me,” Agatha cooed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled her hands out of Rio’s pants, bringing the soaked fingers to her mouth and moaning at the taste of her. Rio watched with hooded eyes, her pupils consuming the deep brown of her eyes. </span></p><p><span>“So, your place?” Agatha asked with a cheshire grin. </span></p><p><span>“You’re seriously gonna make us sit through dinner after all that?” Rio whined as she pawed at Agatha’s top, eager to return the favour. </span></p><p><span>“Yes, I am. You’re cute, but I have a free dinner <em>and </em>a covered shift riding on staying through this dinner, so you’re going to sit there all pretty while we eat and watch Alice and Jen fall in love or whatever and then I’ll let you fuck me through the mattress later.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Alice had seemingly informed Jen that Agatha was, in fact, the one Rio had been pining over, and as neither of them were idiots, they chose not to comment on the fifteen minutes Agatha and Rio had spent in the bathroom, instead ignoring their re-arrival and carrying on with their conversation. </span></p><p><span>It was here that Agatha conceded she maybe hadn’t thought this through. Because now, she had to sit across from Rio for the next hour and a half at least. This wouldn’t normally be a huge issue. Agatha was a big girl; she could handle sitting with someone attractive without losing her mind, she wasn’t a fourteen year old boy thank you very much. However, things got slightly complicated when said attractive person seems to have suddenly regained her confidence and has decided to trail her leg teasingly, and torturously slowly up Agatha’s leg. </span></p><p><span>At first, Agatha thought it was an accident, a barely there touch that went away so quickly, Agatha hadn’t even had time to shoot Rio a glare before it was gone. But then, again, a few minutes later. Firmer this time, more sure of her actions, Rio’s foot was back, inching dangerously higher. </span></p><p><span>Agatha gripped her fork tighter, resuming her death glare at Rio, who didn’t even show Agatha the courtesy of looking her way. Instead, she remained thoroughly engaged in a conversation with Jen about something. Agatha wishes she knew what Rio was talking about. Truly, when Rio starts talking about something she’s passionate about it’s amazing to watch. Her whole body seems to light up, her hands waving around dramatically as she tries to convey her love for something and convince someone else it’s something worth loving. </span></p><p><span>But Agatha has no fucking idea what Rio’s on about because she is instead focusing on not letting out an embarrassing whimper as Rio’s boots press on her inner thigh, centimetres away from where she needs her most. </span></p><p><span>“How are we finding everything, ladies, can I interest you guys in dessert?” </span></p><p><span>Jen smiled at the waitress, “Yes, actually, can I-” </span></p><p><span>“Nope, no sorry, we’re not interested, we’re gonna go.” Agatha cut Jen off, jumping out of her chair like it had shocked her. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, what is the matter with you?” Jen sighed exasperatedly, “You’ve been jumpy all evening. Is it really that hard for you to sit through one dinner with friends?” </span></p><p><span>Yes, Jen, it actually </span><em><span>was </span></em><span>that hard when you were being tortured sexually and edged for a fucking hour. “Sorry, I’ve used up my social battery for the night Jenny, I’ll see you at work. Alice, lovely to meet you. Rio.” She nodded curtly, hoping Rio understood she didn’t apply to her so-called social battery. </span></p><p><span>And then, music to her ears, “I’m actually feeling pretty beat too, I think I’ll call it a night.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t wait for Rio to say her goodbyes; instead bolting out the front of the restaurant to try and regain some composure. </span></p><p><span>Before long, Agatha heard the door open behind her and a presence slide up next to her. Agatha, done fighting for the night, let Rio lace their fingers together and start walking her back to her place.</span></p><p><span>It was fine, this was fine. </span></p><p><span>She would see Rio for as long as it took to get it out of her system and be done with it. </span></p><p><span>A month, two tops. </span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>So, it had technically been almost three months, and Agatha was relying heavily on that technically. Because <em>technically</em>, Rio had been gone on a work trip for two weeks, around a month and a half into their casual hook-ups, which meant that actually, they had only been doing whatever it was they were doing for around sixty days. Which was good, really good actually, because it meant Agatha still had a week of fucking Rio almost every night before it could officially be considered a habit. </p><p>Said not-habit had quickly taken up most of Agatha’s once precious free time. Nights once spent leaving the bar alone were now filled with dodging Jen’s obnoxious <em>I know more than you do</em> face as Rio waited for her outside. Instead of her regular take-outs, she had become familiar with a mix of Puerto Rican and Italian food that was always waiting for her when they went home. </p><p>Worst of all, she had become achingly familiar with every part of Rio, and even more horrifically, she <em>wanted </em>to be.</p><p>She wanted to know everything. The stupid stuff like Rio’s favourite food, favourite colour, favourite tv show (it’s Battlestar Galactica, and that was a rabbit hole she had not intended to open but couldn’t quite regret; frak had become her new favourite curse word, especially around children).</p><p>But she also wanted to know the deep stuff. What was Rio’s life like after her parents died? What did she want from life? Did she want to get married? Did she want children? Did she think having satan for a mom meant that person shouldn’t have children of their own and thus would make a terrible life partner for someone who did, in fact, want children? You know, normal casual hookup stuff. </p><p>But they weren’t <em>dating</em>. Just because they spent almost every night together did not mean they were dating. They weren’t girlfriends, they didn’t love each other, they were just friends who fucked, that’s it, no matter what some people (Jen) might say. </p><p>So yes, it was a Friday night, and yes, Agatha was spending her night off at Rio’s, waiting for her to get back from some nerd convention. She had taken the liberty of letting herself into Rio’s flat, and like the good fuck buddy she is, was attempting to make them dinner. She had been given a key from Rio to look after her plants when she and Alice went on their work trip, and despite her best efforts, had never been able to get Rio to take it back.</p><p>That week of looking after Rio's plants had actually been a colossal pain in her ass, because, despite telling Rio it was no problem, they lived close to each other, Agatha had actually spent the entire week hauling her ass halfway across New York fucking City to water those plants, but again, Rio didn’t know that. Rio actually had no way of knowing that Agatha’s place was nowhere near hers because she still hadn’t let Rio come over. </p><p>Rio had asked once, but when Agatha had simply shoved her tongue into her cunt to avoid answering the question, Rio blessedly got short-term memory loss and never brought it up again. Agatha didn’t really know why she didn’t want Rio to come over. Sure, she didn’t really like strangers staying over normally, but this was <em>Rio</em>; there was no reason to not want her to come over, but something about the thought of Rio getting to see Agatha's home, the only place she could ever really be herself, made her stomach twist. </p><p>So instead, they were always at Rio’s and Agatha had built up a steady collection of things there. As Alice slowly seemed to move in with Jen, so too did Agatha with Rio, something Jen took upon herself to constantly remind Agatha of. </p><p> </p><p>“So Alice came by my place again last night.” </p><p>“Congratulations, I’m so happy you got laid.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, “You know that’s not why I’m bringing it up.” Agatha ignored her; she was a dutiful employee and would never be caught partaking in idle gossip on the job. “I brought it up because she came over all in a huff because <em>someone </em>was at her apartment once again taking over the living room. You wouldn’t happen to know who that was?”</p><p>“Well, I’m no detective, but I’m fairly certain Alice has a roommate, so it was probably her.” </p><p>Jen snatched the cloth Agatha had been wiping the already spotless bench with right out of her hand. “Cut the shit, Agatha. Why won’t you just admit you’re dating Rio? She likes you a lot, you know?” </p><p>Agatha scoffed, “There’s no shit to cut Jenny. We’re not dating. We are friends who occasionally have consensual, casual, no-attachment sex. And she makes a mean pasta, so sometimes I come over for dinner and a movie, so what?”</p><p>“I don't know what's worse: the fact that you think you can tell me, your best friend, that bold-faced of a lie, or that you might actually believe that," Jen gave Agatha a sad, pitiful look. "You’re an idiot, Agatha. You’re in love with her, and she’s in love with you, and if you keep her at arm's length like this, one day she’s gonna stop trying to fight you.”</p><p> </p><p>So yeah, Agatha wasn’t exactly happy with Jen at the moment because, seriously, what did she even know? Just because she wanted a white-picket fence suburban dream didn’t mean everyone did. Fucking narcissist, she only ever– </p><p>“Al? What on earth are you doing cooking? You’re gonna burn–Agatha?”</p><p>Jumping slightly, Agatha lifted her head from the stove. She was so lost in her impeccable psycho-analysis of Jen that she hadn’t even heard the door open. “Don’t sound so happy to see me,” she muttered, plating up the food. </p><p>“No, no, I am happy to see you, of course I am. It’s actually the best part of my day, usually, I just didn’t expect you tonight. What, um, what are you doing here?" Rio paused, finally taking Agatha in, "Wait, is that my shirt?”</p><p>Agatha sniffed, paying no mind to the word vomit; she was used to it by now. “I didn’t have a cheese grater, and you know how I loathe pasta without cheese,” Agatha replied as she opened the pre-grated packet of cheese. </p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked between Agatha’s face and her hands as she placed the cheese onto the top plates, “Right. And the shirt?” Rio asked far too hopefully. </p><p>They had been doing this dance for far too long. Rio would try to get Agatha to admit these empty gestures had meaning, and get this sad puppy dog look when Agatha said nothing. </p><p>“I spilled pasta sauce on mine.” </p><p>Cue puppy dog eyes. </p><p>Because yes, she probably did get pasta sauce somewhere on her shirt; those things always splattered everywhere, she didn’t change because she liked wearing Rio’s clothes or anything, that would be weird. This stupid <em>AUTISM</em> shirt was a little big on Agatha and smelled like the fragrance-free washing detergent Rio used. She really should tell Rio to leave a complaint, that detergent was certainly not fragrance-free, it always had a hint of pine and maybe sandalwood? Agatha wasn’t sure, but it was comforting; it felt like being wrapped up in Rio. </p><p>“Oh, yeah, well, no stress, I’ll wash it and give it back to you. I think I have a few other shirts of yours as well,” Rio replied, accepting Agatha’s answer as always, kicked puppy look firmly on her face. </p><p>“Sure, I’ll get it whenever, but for now sit your ass down on the couch.” At Rio’s puzzled look, Agatha continued. “I figured we could watch a movie tonight, it’s getting colder, which means it’s perfect <em>Imagine Me and You</em> season, and you need an education.” </p><p>Agatha was a sucker for rom-coms, though she’d deny that if anyone asked, and <em>Imagine Me and You </em>was simply the best one. She had mentioned offhandedly to Rio that it was one of her favourite movies, and was flabbergasted at Rio’s admission to never having seen it. </p><p>Rio slipped onto the couch next to Agatha, leaving only a fraction of space between them. “Sure, I wanna see exactly what kind of movie makes the stone-faced Agatha Harkness swoon,” Rio joked. </p><p>“<em>I’m</em> the swooner?” Agatha joked, thinking back to their reunion at the restaurant. She glanced at Rio with a playful grin on her face when she didn’t reply, only to see her staring down at her plate quietly. </p><p>Swallowing the lump in her throat, Agatha turned back to the TV and put on the movie. </p><p>Agatha spent most of the movie watching Rio. She wanted to see how she reacted to it. Did she swoon when Agatha did, did she cry when Agatha did, and most importantly, who was she thinking of while she watched? Absolutely nothing had to do with Agatha trying to figure out if Rio was watching this and thinking ‘<em>gee, that’s like Agatha</em> and me’ because Agatha was worried. Because, despite her determination to always ignore anything Jen said, it was starting to eat at her. Surely Rio didn’t <em>actually</em> love her. That would be insane. But just in case, she had to do her own investigation.</p><p>She knew what this was, and yes, she knew that Rio had sort of liked her at the start, but she had spent months with Agatha now, long enough to know her true personality and have come to her senses. But the longer this went on, the more Agatha noticed Rio looking at her like <em>that, </em>the more the touches lingered outside of sex, the more Rio tightened her grip around her in bed, silently begging her to stay the night. </p><p>But tonight, nothing. Rio’s face stayed emotionless the whole time. She watched the movie intently, refusing to look at Agatha, which was also weird because usually when she swindled Agatha into watching Battlestar Galactica (with the promise of many orgasms, thank you very much), she usually spent the whole time talking. </p><p>Deciding not to worry for once, Agatha shifted on the couch to get more comfortable, but with how close Rio had sat next to Agatha, she ended up shifting onto her arm. Rio hesitated for a second, but still opened her arm, pulling Agatha in to lie against her chest, and Agatha felt them both sink into each other. </p><p>It seemed that was all Rio needed to relax and become her usual chatterbox self, “You know that’s like not possible, right?” </p><p>“Hmm?” Agatha questioned. She had closed her eyes, turning her head into Rio’s chest and had missed what was happening on the screen. </p><p>“No one can make their voice that loud, like even if you pretended there was no traffic noise, which there obviously is, then it still wouldn’t be loud enough, and Luce still wouldn’t hear her,” Rio rattled off. </p><p>Agatha just shook her head affectionately, “Yeah, but babe, that’s not the point. The point is it’s a cute rom-com and the lesbians actually get a happy ending for once.” </p><p>“I suppose, but surely they could’ve thought of a more realis–mmh”</p><p>Agatha cut Rio off with her mouth, ending the rant before it could truly begin. Agatha loved to hear Rio talk, but tearing apart her favourite movie wasn’t on the list of things she wanted to hear coming out of Rio’s mouth tonight. That list included things such as ‘GOD AGATHA, YES, RIGHT THERE’, those kinda things. </p><p>“What were you saying, big boy?” </p><p>Rio blinked dazedly. Even after all this time, Agatha was very smug that she still had the power to make Rio lose executive function. </p><p>“N-nothing,” Rio shook her head gently, trying to rattle her brain back into place. “This is actually a really good movie, now I feel bad I always told Alice I didn’t want to watch it.”</p><p>That makes Agatha lift her head up off Rio’s chest. “You never wanted to watch the movie before?” </p><p>Rio flushed adorably, “Well, I–no, not really. I just thought the premise was kind of dumb,” she mumbled. “But I was glad to watch it with you. I think you’ve suffered through enough Battlestar Galactica, I figured I owed you,” she grinned.</p><p>“I’m glad you liked it, but you know you don’t, right?” At Rio’s confused look, she continued, “Owe me. You don’t owe me anything.” </p><p>“Oh, right…well, I mean…I want to. I like doing things that make you happy,” she confessed. </p><p>Fuck. Shit fuck.</p><p>Jenny Kale might have a slight point. Agatha groaned internally. This was just her luck. Of course, the one person in the world who deserved better than Agatha would manage to spend time with her and become <em>more </em>attached. </p><p>Deciding not to delve into all that tonight, and how it made her feel warm and fuzzy knowing the more time Rio spent with Agatha, the more she stayed, Agatha chose the easy way out and sank to her knees. </p><p>“You like making me happy, baby? Well, you know what would make me real happy?” She purred against Rio’s clothed thigh. “Making you come on my tongue for dessert.” </p><p>"Oh fuck, o-ok," Rio whimpered, lifting her hips off the couch to help Agatha slide the slacks down her legs and tossing them somewhere behind her. </p><p>Agatha pushed Rio’s legs apart, pushing her face between Rio’s legs. She rubbed her face up against Rio’s covered pussy, her nose catching on the damp spot already forming.</p><p>“You’re soaking through your boxers, baby. All this for me?” she cooed, looking up at Rio with big doe eyes. </p><p>“Ye-yeah baby, all for you, always for you,” Rio stuttered out. </p><p>Agatha hummed against Rio, running her tongue along her. The sensation was muted through the boxers, but Rio still jerked her hips up, desperate for more. Agatha held her thighs down, digging her nails in, leaving crescent-shaped moons in her wake before moving up and sucking Rio’s clit into her mouth. </p><p>“Fuck, shit, Agatha…please, I need–<em>fuck.</em>”</p><p>Satisfied that Rio was an incoherent mess, Agatha pulled down Rio’s boxers, slick now from a mix of her saliva and Rio, and tossed them behind her as well.</p><p>Agatha sat back, taking in Rio, still with her top on, looking positively wrecked. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes hooded, but Agatha could see her pupils were blown wide. She looked so perfect, and Agatha was struck by the desire to kiss her. Not their normal rushed, messy, teeth-clashing kisses, but a soft one, one that promised far too much. So instead of doing that, Agatha burrowed her head back in Rio’s pussy. </p><p>Normally, she would tease Rio, dragging her pleasure out as long as she could, until Rio was a shaking mess, tears pricking in her eyes, begging Agatha to let her come. But tonight, Agatha wanted to force the orgasms out of Rio. She wanted Rio to come hard and fast, and non-stop. The more she came, the less she would be thinking. </p><p>She licked a broad stripe through her folds and instantly found her clit, sucking on the nub harshly. </p><p>“God, Agatha, right there,” Rio moaned, threading her hands into Agatha’s hair and pulling at the roots. </p><p>Agatha doubled her efforts, bringing her hand up to stroke Rio’s soaked entrance. She could feel Rio dripping onto the couch below and took pity on her, sinking two fingers in with no resistance. Rio arched into the touch, grinding her cunt down onto Agatha’s fingers, desperate for more. </p><p>Agatha started pistoning her fingers into Rio, alternating her thrusts with her licks over her clit so Rio was never without stimulation. It seemed to do the trick, and with two more strokes, Rio was clenching her thighs around Agatha’s head, suffocating her in her pussy. Agatha fucked her through it, accepting that this might be the way she went, suffocating between a gorgeous woman’s thighs. Not the worst way to go, she decided. </p><p>Rio returned to her senses quicker than Agatha had expected, and before she knew it, she was being pulled into Rio’s lap, and her top was flying across the room. </p><p>Rio ducked her head down, latching onto Agatha’s nipple, flicking the bar before grazing her teeth over the hardened bud. </p><p>“Jesus Christ, Rio. Fuck, you’re so good for me, baby.”</p><p>Rio just growled, palming at Agatha’s other tit before she switched sides. Agatha loved when Rio got like this, all possessive. Agatha would normally never let a hookup take control like this, but Rio was just so damn good at it, and Agatha would never deny herself a mind-shattering orgasm. </p><p>Letting go of her tit with a pop, Rio captured Agatha’s lips in a kiss, swiping her tongue over her bottom lip instantly. When Agatha refused to open her mouth, Rio bit at her lip harshly, strong enough to break skin, and forced her tongue in, instantly licking at the roof of Agatha’s mouth. Rio’s tongue explored every crevice of Agatha’s mouth, marking her as hers. Agatha felt herself soaking through her panties at the thought. </p><p>Agatha wrapped her legs around Rio, who instantly picked them up, walking them to her bedroom. God, Agatha was never going to get over how strong Rio was. Sometimes, she would be sitting on her break at work and would randomly remember that Rio was strong enough to toss her across the room and had to extend her break by five minutes just to get herself off in the bathroom. </p><p>Kicking open her door, Rio latches onto Agatha’s neck, sucking along the length of it, leaving angry marks in her wake. Agatha wished she could care about how annoying that would be tomorrow, but she was currently too horny to care. </p><p>Moving them onto the bed, Rio didn’t even have the courtesy to take off Agatha’s pants; instead, shoving her hand into Agatha’s panties, instantly circling her clit. </p><p>Agatha wasn’t quite sure what happened next. All she knew was that embarrassingly quickly she was coming, and then Rio’s head was between her legs, and she was coming again. Rio didn’t let up, lapping at her pussy like it was liquid gold, propelling her into a third orgasm. </p><p>Rio really was a muncher for her own pleasure; she took every chance she could to be on her knees for Agatha, eating her out like it was her job, and while Agatha was never one to deny herself, if Rio kept going, she might get permanent nerve damage.</p><p>Gently, pushing Rio’s head away, she gripped her chin, wet from her own slick, “Always so good for me,” she said absentmindedly, not noticing how Rio’s eyes shone with the praise. </p><p>Rio crawled her way back up the bed, lavishing every part of Agatha’s body with kisses on her way up before settling down next to her, leaving a noticeable gap between them. </p><p>Pouting, Agatha scooched over, wrapping her arms around Rio’s middle and digging her head into her neck. Rio looped her arm around Agatha in return, gently running her hands through her hair. </p><p>“You know, I was thinking–”</p><p>“Well, that’s dangerous,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio let out a dry chuckle, shifting her eyes away from Agatha, “Very funny. But I’ve been thinking, I really need to stop holding the apartment hostage from Alice. She wants to have some people over tomorrow night, have a party or something, and I really don’t want to be here, would you...would you mind if I maybe...came over to yours?” Rio rushed the words out, as if saying them faster would make them any less heavy. </p><p>Maybe it was the orgasms, or that she was exhausted after a long day of work and trying to be emotionally intelligent, or maybe it was Rio’s arms, holding her so gently, but she found herself letting out a soft, “Yeah, okay, baby, you can come over,” before drifting off to sleep. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke up slowly, blinking at the light drifting in through the blinds. As she came back to consciousness, she became acutely aware of the soft puffs of breath tickling the back of her neck. It seemed in the night, she and Rio had shifted, and Rio was now spooning her, cuddling into her like a koala. Agatha really had to put a stop to this; it was becoming far too normal for them to wake up like this, she thought, as she nestled back into Rio. </p><p>“Mmh, good morning,” Rio husked out. God, it was a wonder Agatha ever managed to leave in the mornings when Rio sounded like this. </p><p>“So, tonight?” Rio asked nervously. </p><p>Right. That was how. Rio always managed to bring them crashing back down to reality in the mornings. She thought about going back on it, saying Rio couldn’t come over, but she knew how Rio hated being in crowded places when she didn’t know anyone, and because she was such a good friend, she would be her place of refuge for the evening. </p><p>Agatha lazily reached for her phone, seeing that it was already early afternoon. “Um, yeah, I’ll text you my address, but I really should head home and run some errands before work tonight, so I’ll see you later, okay?” </p><p>Without giving Rio a chance to reply, Agatha was out of bed, tracking her clothes around the apartment and rushing out the door. </p><p>Great. This was just great. Now she had to go home and Rio-proof her apartment before a Saturday night shift at one of the most popular bars in the area. Perfect. </p><p> </p><p align="center">-----------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been home for a total of ten minutes before Rio knocked on the door. She had offered to pick her up from her shift, but Agatha had politely refused. Coming home to Rio’s together was one thing, but arriving at Agatha's place together would be far too domestic. So instead, she had lugged her ass home on the subway and had frantically pushed stuff around to give the semblance of cleanliness. </p><p>Tonight wouldn’t be like their normal nights. Agatha had a plan. Rio comes over, they fuck, Rio goes home. No dinner, no movie, no <em>cuddles</em>. That had been a particularly poor lapse in judgment on Agatha’s part, and she wasn’t going to repeat it in her own home. </p><p>Shaking her shoulders out, she opened the door. </p><p>Without looking up at Rio, Agatha put on her best bedroom voice. As long as she didn’t see Rio’s big brown puppy dog eyes, she wouldn’t be swayed from her plan. “Hey, big boy, I hope you’re ready to…,” Agatha made the mistake of looking up, “Rio, what’s wrong?” </p><p>Rio’s usually bright eyes were dull and red-rimmed; she’d clearly been crying for hours, her whole face hung heavy with grief. She sniffled and let out a self-deprecatory chuckle. “I’m sorry, I almost didn’t come over, but I didn’t want you to think I was ditching.” She looked away from Agatha, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. “It’s um, it’s the anniversary of my parents’ death today. </p><p>Whatever Agatha had been expecting Rio to say, it wasn’t that. Rio didn’t talk about her parents or her life when they were alive very often, so Agatha only knew pieces. She knew that they had died when Rio was ten, that it had, of course, turned her life upside down, and that she blamed herself for it every day. Agatha didn’t know what to say, didn’t know what Rio needed from her. </p><p>“There’s no party, is there?” </p><p>Rio shifted her eyes away from Agatha, and that was all the answer she needed. </p><p>“No. I just…I can’t stand Alice’s pitying looks today. I just wanted to be,” she hesitated, cutting herself off from what she was originally going to say, “I wanted to be anywhere else. I wanted a distraction” </p><p>“Yeah, okay. I can find a movie or something, we don’t have to do anything, we can just sit and…” Agatha waved her hands around non-comitally, she didn’t want to be the one to say they could sit and cuddle, she wasn’t clingy. </p><p>Rio took a step closer, pressing herself against Agatha. Agatha didn’t even notice her hands moving; they just gravitated to Rio’s face like magnets, wiping away the tears that had started to fall. </p><p>“No, I want you,” Rio whispered into Agatha’s mouth. </p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha didn’t want to take advantage of Rio in this vulnerable state, but Rio was nodding before she even finished her sentence. “Okay, baby. Okay. Whatever you need,” Agatha agreed, resting her forehead against Rio’s. They stood there for a minute, Rio’s eyes remained closed, and Agatha studied her face; she really was beautiful like this. She was beautiful all the time, actually. </p><p>Rio was the one to break the spell, shifting forward and capturing Agatha’s lips between her own. Agatha kissed her back, hard. She ran her tongue across her lip, and Rio wasted no time in granting Agatha access. Moaning into her mouth, Agatha tried to devour every inch of Rio, pushing her back into the wall and slotting her knee between her thighs. </p><p>Rio gasped, arching into the touch. “Agatha…bedroom,” she muttered out in between kisses. Agatha just smirked against her lips. Rio was always so desperate, and though she would never admit it, it made her soak through her underwear every time she remembered Rio was always this desperate for <em>her</em> and no one else. </p><p>“Come on, big boy, I’ve got a surprise for you,” she cooed, running her finger along Rio’s chin. </p><p>Agatha led them to her room, pushing Rio in through the open door, chasing her mouth when–</p><p>“OW. Agatha, what the fuck?” Rio yelped.</p><p>Ah. Right. She forgot about that. </p><p>“Oops, sorry. That’s Miss Vicious, she likes to hide under the bed and attack people,” Agatha grinned, leaning down to pick up Miss Vicious, petting her gently. She had been abused as a kitten, thrown into a creek in a plastic bag and left for dead. Agatha had never had any plans to get a pet; she didn’t think she was the maternal type, but when the shelter assistant told her what had happened to her, she took her home. The idiot shelter had named her Freya, but after the third person had been attacked entering Agatha’s home, she felt Miss Vicious was a much better fit (Jen thought it was hilarious and dubbed her Mama Vicious; Agatha ignored her for a week after that one). </p><p>“You have a cat that attacks people, and you didn’t think to mention it?” Rio asked incredulously. </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she put Miss Vicious outside and closed the door, “Well, I couldn’t get the words out with your tongue that far down my throat, could I?” In truth, Agatha had forgotten because she was too focused on her surprise for Rio. She hadn’t planned to do this tonight, or ever, actually, but Rio needed a distraction, and Agatha knew exactly what to do. </p><p>Pushing Rio onto the bed, Agatha straddled her, leaning in close. “I need you to be a good boy for me and close your eyes, okay?” Rio stared up at Agatha, unbridled lust clouding her eyes, and nodded slowly. </p><p>Shifting off Rio’s lap, Agatha moved to the closet and grabbed the strap that had been sitting there unused for far too long. She thought she would feel some hesitation, but she just felt unbelievably excited at the prospect of crossing this line. The thought of Rio fucking her through the mattress had been plaguing her since their first time in the bathroom, and god, she was quite literally dripping with anticipation. </p><p>“Put your hands out, baby, she cooed. Placing the strap down gently, she watched recognition flash over Rio’s face, and her eyes shot open. </p><p>“Do you…do you want me to…?” Rio flushed, eyes darting from the strap to Agatha. </p><p>Agatha grinned. No matter how hard she tried, Rio was still an absolute dork at her core. “Yeah, baby,” she went back to her rightful place and straddled Rio again, grabbing the strap and moving it over Rio’s crotch, pressing it firmly against her clit. “I want you to wear this, and I want you to fuck me through the mattress. Do you think you can do that for me, handsome?” </p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened, and she instantly had them flipped, pinning Agatha down as she started working Agatha’s top off. Rio ducked her head, nipping at Agatha’s tattoos as she hastily unbuttoned her jeans. Far too quickly, Rio was pulling away from Agatha’s chest, and frankly, that was rude. When you have someone as hot as Agatha bearing her tits for you, you give them their much-deserved attention. But as Agatha moved to tell Rio exactly that, her mouth went dry. Rio had sat up and was tightening the harness, the strap jutting out deliciously, pointing at its owner. Agatha felt another gush of wetness coat her underwear at the sight, and unconsciously leaned forward, grabbing the strap. </p><p>Agatha pulled Rio in by the strap, spitting into her other hand. Slowly, she started jerking the strap, using her spit as lube. Rio whimpered, the friction pad rubbing up against her clit with every stroke.</p><p>“You know, baby, I don’t think this is gonna be enough lube,” she said, looking down with a fake pout. </p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped open in concern, “Oh, do you have more lube? We can go out and get some. I don’t want you to be in pain.”</p><p>“No, baby, that’s not what I had in mind,” Agatha commented, sinking to her knees in front of Rio. </p><p>“Oh god–” Rio choked out. </p><p>Agatha grinned, letting the strap rest against her cheek. “You want me to suck you off, pretty boy?” </p><p>Rio’s hips jumped at the pet name, rutting her cock against Agatha’s face. “Fuck, please, cariño.”</p><p>Agatha startled at the pet name, ignoring how Rio speaking Spanish somehow made her more turned on. Rio had never used any pet names; she always used her name. Agatha had never brought it up, thinking Rio just wasn’t the type to call someone anything but their name in sex, apparently she just needed the promise of her dick sucked to get her there. </p><p>Deciding to oblige her, Agatha licked a long stripe from base to tip before enveloping the head of the strap in her mouth. She sucked hard on the tip, using her hand at the base to move the friction pad against Rio’s clit. </p><p>“God, cariño, that’s so good. You’re such a good girl for me,” Rio moaned, threading her hands through Agatha’s hair and gently tugging. Agatha moaned at the praise, bobbing her head further down Rio’s cock. </p><p>She moved down inch by inch, until she had the whole length lodged in her throat and had to fight back the urge to gag. Coming back up for air, she popped off the strap with a pop, looking up at Rio through her lashes, “Can you come like this?” she purred. </p><p>“Ye-yeah, I think so, please don’t stop,” Rio panted as she pulled Agatha’s head back towards her cock. </p><p><em>So needy, </em>Agatha thought, but she took the cock into her mouth nonetheless. Agatha found herself falling into a rhythm, sucking along the head for a beat before moving down, enveloping as many inches as she could while thrusting the cock against Rio’s clit. Agatha knew Rio was getting close when the hands in her hair started to tighten, and she gently started thrusting into Agatha’s mouth. After a particularly violent thrust, Agatha accidentally let out a gag, choking around Rio’s length. </p><p>“Shit! Agatha, I’m so sorry, I didn’t realise.”</p><p>“Shh, don’t worry about it, baby. I want you to fuck my face, I want you to come down my throat. Do you wanna come down my throat like a good boy?” Agatha cooed. </p><p>Rio groaned, running her hands over her reddened face, “God, Agatha, yes, please, let me come down your throat.” </p><p>Agatha dug her nails into Rio’s thighs, “If I need you to stop, I’ll slap your thigh, okay? Otherwise, I don’t want you to stop until you’ve emptied yourself down my throat.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped open, and her eyes rolled back at the words, but she managed to grab Agatha’s head, thrusting her onto her cock. </p><p>Rio set a brutal pace, hitting the back of Agatha’s throat with every thrust. Agatha could feel the mascara running down her face, but couldn’t bring herself to care because she had a much bigger problem: her clit was throbbing against her underwear, begging for attention. Snaking a hand down into her underwear, Agatha let out a gasp when her fingers grazed her swollen clit. Well, she tried to let out a gasp, with the cock shoved down her throat, it came out as more of a mangled gag, but it drove Rio crazy, and her thrusts quickly lost their rhythm.</p><p>“Fuck, shit…Agatha, baby…I’m gonna–” </p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s thighs tense under her grip, and Rio lodged her cock as deep down her throat as she could get it, thrusting gently as she fucked herself through her orgasm. </p><p>“Get on the bed, Agatha,” Rio muttered hoarsely as she pulled herself out of Agatha’s throat. Rio looked down at Agatha, stroking her face, and Agatha felt a pathetic whimper leave her at Rio’s tone. </p><p>Shuffling into the centre of the bed, Agatha instinctively spread her legs for Rio, watching as she stalked towards her slowly, like she was prey Rio couldn’t wait to devour. Slotting herself between her legs like she belonged there, Rio’s eyes turned soft, and she pressed a far too gentle kiss to Agatha’s brow. “Are you sure? You never want any kind of penetration? Are you sure you want this?”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, feeling Rio’s soft breath hitting her forehead. She wanted to be honest with Rio, to tell her that this <em>did</em> mean a lot to her, that for her, penetration was the most intimate thing she could think of with another person, and that she hadn’t done it with anyone in longer than she cared to remember. She wished she could tell Rio that she wanted to do it with her, that she felt safe with Rio. But that would mean admitting all that to herself, which was pretty much on the very bottom of her to-do list, so instead she leant up, nipping on Rio’s ear, “Baby, if you don’t fuck me in the next five minutes, I will reach into my bedside drawer, grab the biggest dildo I have, and fuck myself in front of you.” </p><p>Rio’s grip tightened on Agatha’s hips, fingernails digging into her side in a way that would surely leave marks tomorrow. “Ok, Agatha,” Rio purred as she pulled back, pushing her cock through Agatha’s centre, dragging it through the copious slick that had been steadily leaking out of Agatha. Agatha bit back a moan as the strap bumped her clit, her hips jolting upwards unconsciously. </p><p>“Shh,” Rio cooed as she smoothed her free hand over Agatha’s thigh, the other still running her cock through Agatha’s folds. “Don’t worry, cariño, I just gotta get it nice and ready for you.” Agatha could hear the grin in Rio’s words, but couldn’t let out a barb of her own as Rio finally sank into her, easing to the hilt in one thrust. “Fuck, you’re so wet, cariño. Look at you, your greedy pussy is sucking me all the way in already,” Rio marvelled. </p><p>Rio started slowly, snapping her hips into Agatha gently, letting her get used to the intrusion. Which was sweet and caring, given that Rio hadn’t even had so much as a finger inside Agatha before, but also fucking irritating. Rio might genuinely be one of the smartest people Agatha knew; she could tell you any fact about any plant you wanted to know, but she couldn’t understand simple shit. For example, Agatha, plus strap, equals fuck her through the mattress, not gently fuck her like you’ve been married for fifty years. Agatha thrust her hips back to meet Rio, forcing the strap deeper inside her, trying to get the right angle. </p><p>Rio let out a chuckle at Agatha’s movements, “You’re so desperate for it, aren’t you, cariño? When was the last time someone fucked this pretty pussy properly, huh?” Rio let her hand drift to Agatha’s clit, rubbing it gently as she eased out, and Agatha whimpered, honest to god whimpered. She would’ve dwelled on how embarrassing that was, but Rio was already flipping her over, and lifting her hips, restarting her thrusts at a brutal pace. Everything felt so much deeper at this angle. Agatha swore she could feel Rio bumping into her cervix with every thrust. Rio’s pace was brutal, sliding in and out so quickly that Agatha was pretty sure she was going to get whiplash. </p><p>“God, cariño, you look so good like this, you only look like this for me, don’t you?” </p><p>“Y-yeah, Rio, god baby. All for you, only for you,” Rio, satisfied with the answer, pushed Agatha’s head down, picking up the force of her thrusts. “God, Rio! Fuck…baby, please. I’m so close.” </p><p>“Touch your clit for me, baby, make yourself come all over my cock like a good girl,” Rio husked. Agatha didn’t need any more invitation than that, sliding her hand down her front, circling her clit with deadly precision. </p><p>“W-want you to come with me, are you close?” </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, “Yeah, cariño, I–fuck. I’m close.” </p><p>“Fuck Rio, baby please…come with me, come inside me baby, please,” Agatha babbled incoherently. She felt Rio’s pace falter slightly at the words before picking back up, ripping orgasms out of both of them at the same time. </p><p>It was in her post-orgasmic haze, as she felt Rio’s body weight topple onto her back, that she realised exactly what she had said that tipped them both over the edge.</p><p>Fuckity, fucking fuck.</p><p>This is exactly why she never lets anyone strap her down; she always says some kind of embarrassing shit like asking her borderline long-term situationship to <em>come inside of her</em>. Jesus Christ. As Rio slowly slipped off her, twisting them on the bed until she was lying tightly in her arms, she could only hope Rio had the tact to not bring it up. It was just dirty talk after all, none of it could be held against her.  </p><p>While Agatha spiralled, Rio slipped out from beneath her, padding softly to the kitchen to grab them both some water. Handing her the glass, Rio tucked a loose strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, “You know, you should really go pee.” </p><p>“Wow, that’s super sexy, keep talking like that, big boy, and you’re gonna get me going all over again,” Agatha commented dryly. </p><p>Rio placed her glass down, cheeks tinting pink, “Well, I just–you know it’s really bad for you to not pee after penetrative sex, you can get a really nasty UTI and–”</p><p>“Oh my god, I’m going, I’m going,” Agatha muttered, flopping out of bed. </p><p>When she came back, she half expected to see Rio putting her clothes back on and making her way out of the apartment. She had gotten what she came for; she had her distraction, that’s all Agatha was really good for. But instead, Rio had pulled on one of Agatha’s t-shirts and her boxers and was scrolling mindlessly on her phone. </p><p>“Comfortable, are we?” Agatha asked, leaning against the doorframe. </p><p>Rio didn’t look up from her phone, enthralled in some mind-numbing bird article, “Hmm?” </p><p>Shaking her head gently, Agatha crawled into bed with Rio, slipping under her arms and snuggling into her usual spot against Rio’s chest. Rio shifted her phone so Agatha could see the article too. “You know, they just discovered a new species of subantarctic rayadito in Chile the other day, that’s three now. Can you believe that we’re still discovering new species like this all the time?” Rio gushed excitedly. </p><p>Agatha just hummed against her chest, already drifting off. If Agatha had had her eyes open, she would’ve seen Rio nervously chewing on her lip, glancing down at the top of Agatha’s head with wide eyes, full of affection. She would’ve seen Rio swiping off her beloved bird article and instead opening the camera, capturing the moment forever. She would’ve seen Rio texting Alice that she was staying the night, that she had actually had a good night, despite what day it was. </p><p>But instead, she slept soundly on Rio’s chest, dreaming of warm smiles and soft skin. Of a full laugh and a non-stop chattering voice. Of a home with a fully-stocked kitchen and a grumbling roommate. Of a woman who knew the worst parts of her and stayed anyway, stayed because of it. She dreamed of Rio, of a day that might have been a memory, or might be a day she was yet to live, of Rio sitting on her couch, exhausted from work, but cracking a smile as Agatha gently opened the front door, rising from the couch to envelope her in an all-consuming hug. </p><p>As soon as Rio’s arms tightened around Agatha, she woke with a gasp, shooting into the air. </p><p>Agatha barely even registered the muffled <em>oof</em> from Rio, as Agatha’s elbow struck her in the ribs, focused on the realisation that she was utterly and devastatingly in love with Rio Vidal.</p>

<p>"Rio? Have you heard a word I’ve said this whole time?” Alice asked exasperatedly. </p><p>Rio, who had been looking straight through Alice, snapped back into focus. “Hmm? Sorry, Al, what were you saying?” </p><p>“You’ve been spacy all morning, more so than usual,” Alice looked Rio up and down, a sly grin forming on her face. “You and Agatha have a good night?” Alice asked the question like she already knew the answer, with a shit-eating grin plastered on her face. </p><p>Rio truthfully wished she knew how to answer. Because yes, she thought they had had a nice night. She thought that maybe they were finally getting somewhere; it felt like last night had been more than just sex, a lot of their nights lately had been feeling like more than just sex. </p><p>But then, at 7am, Agatha–famously a bartender, and a permanently late one at that–left in a rush, claiming she didn’t want to be late for work. </p><p>Rio had sat in Agatha’s bed, shell-shocked for 10 minutes until her alarm had blasted through her thoughts; one of them actually <em>did</em> have to go to work. She had spent the morning in a daze, as Alice so kindly pointed out to her.</p><p>She didn’t know what she had done wrong. Usually, Agatha was fine with intimacy; she would always deny it if Rio tried to bring it up, but more often than not, she was the one to start the intimacy. Rio wondered if maybe it was the strap. It had been Agatha’s idea, but maybe she felt pressured, maybe Rio shouldn’t have tried to come over, the last thing she had ever wanted to do was to make anyone feel uncomfortable, let alone the woman she was in lo–</p><p>“Oh my god, Rio, please try and listen, this is important, I need my best friend’s advice here,” Alice complained as she flicked a paperclip at Rio’s head. </p><p>“Yes, sorry, I promise I’m listening now.” </p><p>“Mhm, anyway, what I was saying was, do you think it’s too soon for me and Jen to officially move in together? I mean, we’ve only been seeing each other for a few months. It doesn’t feel like it’s too soon. I mean, I love her, and you and Agatha basically live together, and you’ve been seeing each other for even less time.” </p><p>“Wait, hang on,” Rio cut Alice off. “Agatha and I are not basically living together. Is that what you and Jen think?” </p><p>Alice gave Rio a pitiful look, “Oh, Rio, you most definitely are basically living together. And it’s cute, happy for you and whatever, but also that is literally my house too, and is in fact one of the driving factors in me moving in with Jen.” </p><p>Rio swallowed the lump in her throat. Great. So not only did her best friend think that she and Agatha were living together, but so did Agatha’s best friend, which meant Agatha had probably heard the same thing. Rio knew they spent a lot of time together for friends with benefits, but she was never going to mention that to Agatha; she didn’t want to scare her off. God, she really hoped Jen wasn’t undoing all of her progress with Agatha with just a few well-placed jabs. </p><p>“Okay, wait. So you’re telling me I would have to find a new roommate, too? I thought Jen would be moving in with us? Which, for the record, I think is a good idea. You two seem really happy.” </p><p>Alice just scoffed, “And what, have double dates every night? No, thank you.” </p><p>Rio felt her face flush as she busied herself with the samples in front of her. “Um, Al, now that I have helped you with your relationship problem like a super good friend, do you think that maybe you could help me?” </p><p>Rio didn’t dare look up at Alice; she didn’t need to see the smug face she had on right now. “Yeah, Rio, I’ll help,” Alice paused, sitting down next to her, straddling the chair so she was facing Rio. “Let me guess, you’re in love with Agatha, and you’re not sure if she loves you back, and you don’t know what to do?” </p><p>That made Rio’s head snap up. “How on earth did you know that?” </p><p>Alice just chuckled, “Rio, neither of you are subtle. Jen and I come home from work most days, and all we both have to talk about is how much you and Agatha talk about each other. Like, to the point it's so irritating, neither of us wants to ever hear anything about either of you again.” </p><p>Rio felt her face flush impossibly deeper. “Right, well, yeah, I guess that’s the gist of it,” she muttered, rubbing her hands over her face in exhaustion. This really was way more than she had signed up for. “Basically, I um, I like her, and we spend so much time together, and it’s not just me initiating, you know? She does as well. But I’m not sure, sometimes she looks at me, and Al, I swear it’s with this like yearning, but then she laughs at me like I’m the obsessed one.” Rio fiddled with the rings on her fingers, trying to fight the embarrassment at the words. “I don’t know, I just can’t tell what’s real anymore, and I’m worried I’m forcing this onto her and that deep down she’s actually really uncomfortable and doesn’t like me at all,” Rio rushed out. </p><p>Rio had been worried about this for a while. Agatha knew how much she hated the thought that she made people uncomfortable, and Rio had started to think that maybe Agatha didn’t want to make her feel worse, so she just wasn’t saying anything. Maybe Agatha was just playing into her delusions because it was easier than saying how she really felt. Or maybe Rio was just spiralling, she hoped it was just that.</p><p>“Look, Rio, you obviously know her better than I do, but I don’t think that’s true at all. From what Jen tells me, Agatha is not the kind of person who would waste even a second on someone she didn’t actually like. I think that Agatha actually likes you as much as you like her, maybe even more, and it scares the shit out of her.” </p><p>Rio groaned, dropping her head onto the desk. “I don’t know, Al, you know I’m shit at situations like this.”</p><p>“I know, I know, but have you considered that Agatha is, too? She’s probably never let anyone get this close, and I’m sure it scares the shit out of her. She’s like a stray cat; she attacks people when they get too close.” </p><p>Rio snorted, “Yeah, I reckon she’s passed that gene down.” At Alice’s confused look, she just shook her head, “Nevermind. But seriously, what do I do? Do I tell her how I feel? I don’t wanna lose her, Al. I can handle this arms-length thing, it sucks, but it’s better than not having her at all.” </p><p>“I don’t know Rio, I can’t tell you what to do. But in my opinion, you have two options. Option one, you’ve been doing so far. Let her come to you, show her how you feel through your actions, and let her decide what to do with it. Option two? Tell her. Point blank. Man up and tell her you love her. She might run, in fact, knowing her, she probably will. But eventually she’ll have to stop running, and she’ll realise that she loves you too, because I guarantee you, Rio, that woman loves you.” </p><p>Rio felt the words hit her straight in the chest. The idea that someone like Agatha Harkness could be in love with her felt surreal, and that someone else had noticed too? It made butterflies flutter in Rio's stomach. She hadn’t really dared to think that Agatha liked her back, not really. The only time she let herself imagine a proper life with Agatha was when she was alone at night, drifting off to sleep, and those fantasies looked a lot like what they did already, if she was being honest. </p><p>“Yeah, um, okay. Thanks, Al, it means a lot. I’ll think about it, I promise.” </p><p>Alice nodded, but her reply caught in her mouth as her eyes flicked over Rio’s shoulder. “Hela, Hi!” Alice glanced down at her watch, “You’re early!” </p><p>“Yes, sorry, I managed to catch an earlier flight, and I figured, why wait?” A deep voice with a slight accent that Rio couldn’t place replied. </p><p>Turning in her seat, Rio was greeted with the sight of Hela Odinsdottir. They had never met formally, but Alice had told her all about the woman. Hela worked out of Norway in a similar field of research to theirs, and she and Alice had hit it off when they met on their work trip a few months ago. </p><p>“Rio, you remember I told you about Hela? Hela, this is my colleague and best friend, Rio Vidal,” she introduced the pair, gesturing between them. </p><p>Hela looked Rio up and down, with a look in her eye that Rio couldn’t decipher. “Ahh, Rio Vidal, yes, I’ve heard a lot about you,” Hela addressed Rio, extending her hand. </p><p>“All good things, I hope,” Rio replied, shaking the offered hand. </p><p>Hela’s eyes darted around Rio’s face, and maybe a little lower, before returning to her face, “Mhm, only the best. I hope it’s all true,” she purred. </p><p>Rio just smiled, not quite sure how to respond to that. This woman seemed weirdly friendly for meeting someone for the first time. Maybe it was just a cultural difference. </p><p>“Rio, Hela thinks that our research areas overlap and that we might be able to help her on her next project. She thinks it might make serious inroads in her work,” Alice commented, breaking the awkward silence. </p><p>“Oh, um, sure, that sounds good,” Rio glanced down at her watch, noting that it was already 1pm. The best thing about working in this lab was that she and Alice really got to set their own hours; as long as they got everything they needed done in the week, they could leave whenever they wanted. Normally, Rio would never leave this early, but she had some quite literally major life decisions to make, and she wanted to have time to think it over before she tried to talk to Agatha. “I’m really sorry to cut this short,” Rio said, quickly packing up all her belongings. “But I’ve actually got to go, something’s come up, and I really need to get home. I’ll see you later, Al. Hela, it was really nice to officially meet you. I’m sure I’ll be seeing you around.” With that, Rio left, hearing Hela throw out an <em>oh, you most definitely will</em> as she ran out the door. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t really have a plan; she just started walking. Since her parents had died, she had always found that the best thing for her to do when she was feeling overwhelmed was to be outside. Her problems always felt more manageable when she realised how small they were compared to the rest of the world. </p><p>So, Rio ended up in Central Park, the only real green space left in New York. Rio thought all the time about moving out of the city. She loved it here, but the more time she spent here, the more she thought that maybe she was meant for somewhere else, somewhere closer to nature. She wondered if Agatha would ever want to leave the city. </p><p>Right. </p><p>Agatha. </p><p>God, Rio didn’t even know where to start. She had been trying to figure out what to do for months. She felt like Agatha was constantly pulling her in one direction and then the other. One day, Rio was so sure Agatha just wanted friends with benefits, and just happened to be a very touchy-feely person outside of sex, then others, she was sure Agatha loved her back. The worst time had been the whole key debacle, only a month into their <em>arrangement, </em>which had sent her into a confused spiral for months. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was exhausted; she had just flown the red-eye back from Norway and hadn't gotten an ounce of sleep the whole way. Alice was staying for a week longer; she had met some woman who she wanted to work with for a bit longer before coming back, so Rio hadn’t even had any company on the flight back. And, to top off her frustrations, Agatha hadn’t been texting her back. She had texted the other woman to let her know she was boarding, and hadn’t even gotten so much as a thumbs-up react in the 8 hours since. </p><p>Rio opened the door to her apartment, sighing at the emptiness. Part of her had hoped that maybe Agatha was here, waiting to welcome her home. It was stupid; she knew what this was, and it wasn’t the kind of relationship that had Agatha waiting for her like some kind of housewife. But still, Rio’s treacherous heart hoped. </p><p>Moving into her bedroom, Rio felt her whole body tense at the sight of someone in her bed, her fight or flight instincts kicking in before she realised she knew that mop of brunette hair spilling across the pillow. </p><p>Agatha. </p><p>Rio felt warmth spread through her whole body at the sight; Agatha in her bed, hugging her pillow–and oh, Rio felt her heart swell–<em>wearing her clothes. </em></p><p>Agatha had stolen Rio’s MIT hoodie and was wearing only it and a pair of Rio’s boxers. </p><p>Slipping into bed beside Agatha, Rio felt her stir. </p><p>“Rio?” Agatha grumbled, voice thick with sleep. </p><p>“Yeah, it’s me, go back to sleep, mi amor,” Rio replied, laying her arm around Agatha. Agatha only hummed in reply, pushing back further into Rio, moulding their bodies together. </p><p>When Rio woke the next morning, she was half convinced her sleep-deprived brain had hallucinated Agatha, but she could still smell the faint trace of her perfume on the pillow. </p><p>Rio sighed, sitting up and rubbing her hands over her face. She should have expected this. Agatha had probably just been exhausted after work and wanted a place to crash; her staying here probably had nothing to do with Rio. </p><p>Groaning, Rio got up, moving into the kitchen, and was greeted with the sight of Agatha trying to quietly slip her shoes on like some kind of one-night stand gone wrong. </p><p>“Agatha? What are you doing?” </p><p>“Shit fuck,” Agatha huffed, the shoe finally sliding on, but catching her finger in the process. “Hi, Rio, sorry I was just leaving, I promised Jen I’d meet her for coffee.” </p><p>Rio ignored the stab of disappointment, “Oh sure, um, thanks for looking after my plants while I was gone, that was really nice of you.” </p><p>Agatha waved her hand noncommittally, “Don’t mention it, seriously. What are fuck buddies for?” </p><p>Rio couldn’t ignore <em>that</em> stab of pain. Nothing like being reminded that the woman you’re in love with sees you as a warm body. </p><p>Rio’s morning only got better as her eyes drifted to the kitchen counter, where the key she had given Agatha was sitting, being returned to its rightful owner. Part of her had hoped that maybe Agatha would keep it, that every so often she would open the door and find Agatha already there. Rio really needed to pull herself together; this was becoming pitiful. </p><p>At Rio’s lack of response, Agatha had a look akin to embarrassment grace her face before she schooled her features. “Right, well, I'd better go, would hate to leave Jenny waiting,” Agatha remarked, clapping her hands together. </p><p>Agatha was out the door before Rio even had the chance to reply, the apartment falling painfully quiet. </p><p>Rio had gotten maybe three seconds into her self-loathing, depressive inner monologue before the door opened. </p><p>“Forgot something, don’t mind me,” Agatha chirped. </p><p>To Rio’s utter surprise (and delight), Agatha instantly moved to her house key, and swiped it up, shamefree, kissing Rio on the cheek as she left once again, this time locking the door behind herself. </p><p>Rio looked between the counter and the door enough times that she thought her head might snap off. But seriously, what the fuck? God, this woman was going to send her to an early grave. </p><p> </p><p>So yeah, Rio was pretty confused as to where exactly Agatha’s head was at. That had been months ago, and Rio was starting to feel like Sisyphus, stuck in a bitter cycle. She should probably have a tad more self-respect, but Rio knew she would never find anyone like Agatha, so even if this blew up in her face, she would take every minute she could get with Agatha until it did. </p><p>Rio wandered around the park, not caring where she ended up, trying to figure out what she was going to do. She loved Agatha; that was pretty much the only thing she was certain of. The rest of it all muddled in her head, and she was left back at square one, with no idea what to do. </p><p>Rio groaned. This was going to split her head in two. She wished her mom were here. Not Lilia, she loved Lilia, but right now she needed her <em>mami</em>. Rio’s mother had always been her biggest supporter and had always made sure Rio knew she loved her no matter what. Rio supposed her mom must’ve had an inkling that Rio wasn’t into guys, because she would always say, <em>“Now mija, when you get a boyfriend, or a girlfriend, I don’t care which as long as you’re happy…”</em> and would go off about how Rio should find someone like her papi, someone who would love her unconditionally. </p><p>She loved Rio so much that she put aside everything she had been taught growing up by her parents, her religion, and the world, and made sure the only thing Rio ever knew was love. </p><p>Rio needed her mami, so she was going to go see her. </p><p> </p><p>The ride to New Jersey was only about an hour and a half, and she owed her parents a visit anyway; she had officially gone five years longer without her parents than with them. </p><p>“Hi mami, papi, it’s uh, it’s been a while,” Rio sat down, facing her parents' graves. “My fault, I know, but with the move and everything else, I just haven’t had the time.” It was a weak excuse, and Rio knew it; she could almost hear her mother shaking her head, saying, <em>"Mija, time passes no matter what, you have to make the effort. </em></p><p>Rio sighed. She couldn’t do anything right at the moment. “Anyway, I’m sorry. I’d promise to come more often, but I think we all know that won’t happen.” Rio felt nervous suddenly, which was stupid. Rio might be a lapsed Catholic, but she <em>was</em> still a Catholic, and call her crazy, but talking to her parents' graves about a girl still felt as terrifying as talking to them in person.  Logically, she knew she was talking to a bit of granite and bones; her parents weren’t here, but still. Old habits. </p><p>“I um, I’m actually here mainly to talk to you, mami. Sorry, papi, you know I love you, but your relationship advice always consisted of <em>‘now mija, when you want to bring someone home to meet us…don’t’,</em> so I think I’m going to stick with mami on this one.” Rio chuckled through the few tears forming. </p><p>She thinks her father would like Agatha, actually, she’d be able to keep up with him, he’d like that, Rio thinks. </p><p>“So there’s this girl. And I love her. I love her so much it hurts, mami. And I don’t know if she loves me back. And I know, I know, I should find someone who treats me like papi treated you, but she does ma. I mean, sometimes. That’s the problem.” </p><p>God, Rio sounded ridiculous. Her mother was probably rolling beneath her at the sound of her daughter's love life. </p><p>“Agatha is brilliant, she’s funny and smart and quick-witted. She’s beautiful too, like the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever seen, kind of beautiful. She’s like some kind of Greek goddess, carved from marble and given life. God, mami, I just wanna scream from the rooftops about how much I love her,” Rio cut herself off, waxing poetics about Agatha wasn’t going to help her. </p><p>“But she’s also the most confusing person I’ve ever met. Some days it’s like we’re a couple, she’ll come over and cook and want to snuggle and act all lovey-dovey, and then others she shuts me out, she runs away and tries to poke fun at the coupley things we do, the things <em>she </em>starts, mind you.” </p><p>“Alice, you remember Alice, right? Well, Alice thinks she loves me back and is just scared, and I don’t know, maybe she’s right, but what if she’s not? What if I go to Agatha, tell her how I feel, and she pushes me away for good? I can’t lose her, ma, not this one.” </p><p>Once again, Rio could feel her mother’s stare. “Okay, that makes it sound like there have been others, but still, you know what I mean.” </p><p>Rio sat, waiting for a sign, maybe a clap of thunder, or a cloud that spelled out <em>go get her</em>, anything, really. But nothing changed, the steady hum of traffic nearby continued, and the sky remained silent. The world kept spinning, and her parents remained below her, cold and unmoving, as they had been for fifteen years. </p><p>Rio thought this would make her feel better, talking to her parents always had before, but this time it just made her feel all the more alone, worsened by the fact that the only alive person she wanted to talk to about it was the one person she didn’t know how to talk to anymore. </p><p>Rio stood, brushing the dirt off her knees and the tears off her face. She should really be getting back into the city if she wanted to even have the option to talk to Agatha tonight. </p><p> </p><p>Back in the city, Rio found herself walking towards the bar. She still hadn’t made up her mind, but maybe seeing Agatha would make the decision for her. When you know, you know, right? Just in case, Rio went to the florist across the street and bought a bouquet of azaleas. If she was going to tell Agatha how she felt, she was going to do it right. </p><p>Before long, Rio finds herself outside the bar, hovering outside like some kind of creep. She should just push open the door, slink into the back; Agatha wouldn’t even notice her. But instead, she’s starting to freeze her ass off in the cold because she can’t open the damn door. </p><p>Someone pushes the door open, snapping Rio out of her thoughts, and giving her her first glimpse of Agatha. She looks perfect, of course, her tattoos on full display, her hair cascading down her shoulders. Agatha leans forward towards the woman she’s serving. She leans <em>quite </em>far forward, Rio realises. She feels the hot spike of jealousy run through her system, and it’s enough of a push to have her moving inside the building.</p><p>Rio skirts along the wall until she is sitting in a booth, never taking her eyes off Agatha and the redhead. She feels her nostrils flare as Agatha flips her hair off her shoulders, twirling the ends as she flirts with the stranger. </p><p><em>Is this what she does every night? Does she flirt with women and then use me to warm her bed? </em></p><p>Rio swallowed the thought away, feeling it rip down her throat like glass. Rio watched the pair, laughing and flirting for what felt like hours, before the final blow hit Rio right in the chest. </p><p>Agatha tilted forward, offering her collarbone to the woman, who licked along it, peppering it with salt, before knocking back her shot. </p><p>Rio shoots up from where she had been sitting, leaving behind the flowers. She’s seen enough; she knows what happens next. She knows Agatha’s game; she’ll probably make some comment about her break, tell the redhead she has fifteen minutes, tell her up the stairs, third door on the left. </p><p>The tears were flowing hot and heavy as Rio made her way out of the bar, not caring if Agatha saw her anymore. </p><p>Well, that was a sign if ever she saw one. </p><p>Rio pulled out her phone as she left, dialling Alice’s number without hesitation. </p><p>“Rioooo, how did it go? Are you a taken woman now?” </p><p>“Al?” Rio’s breath hitched on the word, the tears choking her voice. </p><p>“Oh shit, Rio, what happened? Are you okay? God, I’m gonna fucking kill her,” Alice muttered. </p><p>“I’m such an idiot, Al. How could I ever have thought she cared? I’m just another body to her,” Rio sobbed down the phone. </p><p>“No, no, Rio, there’s no way. What did she say exactly, because there’s no way you mean nothing to her.” </p><p>Rio chuckled bitterly, “She didn’t have to say anything, the redhead she had licking all over her collarbone said enough.” </p><p>“What? Oh god, Rio, I’m so sorry. Maybe it was just for extra tips or something? I’m sure there’s an explanation–”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. I’m done, Al. She would’ve just turned me away anyway. She knows how I feel, and she hasn’t said anything. So I’m done. If she really wanted me, she would’ve said so by now.” </p><p>“Are you sure? That’s a pretty big shift from this morning when you were confessing your love for her to me.” </p><p>Rio sighed. It was a big shift. And it was probably jumping the gun and irrational, but she didn’t care. She was sick of being the lovesick puppy that Agatha used when she wanted and ignored when she didn’t. It wasn’t fair, and it was embarrassing for a 25-year-old to be this hung up on a woman who didn’t care about her, so Rio was done. She asked for a sign, and she got one. That was that. </p><p>“I’m sure,” Rio lied. </p><p>“Uh, okay, well in that case, you remember Hela?” At Rio’s hum of agreement, Alice continued. “Well, as I’m sure you noticed, she was very much into you.” </p><p>Rio had, in fact, not noticed. </p><p>“She was asking me for your number to maybe go on a date before she leaves in a few weeks. I had told her no, and that you were seeing someone. Did you want me to maybe tell her yes instead?” </p><p>Hela wasn’t unattractive, she supposed. Her hair was too dark, her eyes as well, but she was nice. And she wasn’t Agatha. She wasn’t someone who would jerk her around; she would be a date, a proper one-night stand, and then done. Rio could use some clear-cut lines for once. </p><p>“Yeah, tell her, okay.” </p><p> </p><p>If that night, Rio had lain awake listening to <em>Harvest Moon </em>on repeat and staring at the picture she had taken of Agatha just last night, that was no one's business but her own. </p><p>If Rio spent the night trying to convince herself that maybe she had been wrong, maybe Agatha was just trying to be nice to the redhead, maybe her brother or husband had just died, and Agatha was offering her a collarbone to cry on, that was also her own business. </p><p>If Rio spent the night trying once again to figure out which Agatha was the real Agatha, well, no one else had to know. </p><p>Rio let herself have tonight, one last night, spent thinking about Agatha. Tomorrow, she would wake up and text Hela; she would leave this whole mess behind her. </p><p>Tomorrow, Rio Vidal was done with Agatha Harkness.</p>

It wasn’t like she had finally figured out her feelings for Rio and had then promptly been ghosted before she could even begin to plan how she was going to tell Rio. It wasn’t like she had found a bouquet of azaleas sitting on a booth, </span><em><span>Rio’s </span></em><span>booth. It was fi-</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, if you dry that glass anymore, you’re going to wear through it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha jumped back at the sound of Jen’s voice, ripped from her calm thoughts. “Sneak up on me again, and your head’s going to become very familiar with the glass, Jennifer.”</span><span> </span></p><p><span>Ignoring the jab, Jen ran her eyes over Agatha, “You look like shit. What’s going on with you? You’ve been acting weird all week,” Jen paused, giving Agatha the time to come clean. Agatha would personally rather shove her head in a wood chipper than admit what Jen seemed to already know, so she stayed quiet.</span></p><p><span>“Alright, cut the shit, what did you do? Alice said Rio’s been depressed all week and you’ve been more of a bitch than usual.”</span></p><p><span>“I resent that accusation. I am always this much of a bitch.”</span></p><p><span>Jen didn’t take the bait, simply staring at Agatha until she finally cracked. </span></p><p><span>“I don’t know, okay?! I have no idea what’s going on. Rio’s been ignoring me for the past week. I texted, I </span><em><span>called</span></em><span>, a frankly embarrassing number of times (thrice), and nothing.”</span></p><p><span>Jen sighed, folding her arms over her chest. “Yeah, I know that part. Alice said she won’t tell me why Rio’s upset, but I know she won’t call you back. No, what I’m asking you is what did you </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> to make her ignore you.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha had been asking herself the same question for a week. Sure, she had left Rio alone in her apartment after a pretty emotionally vulnerable night, but that didn’t feel like it was the cause. Agatha thought back to the flowers, the </span><em><span>azaleas</span></em><span>, the fact that she didn't recall much else of that night, and felt a lump forming in her throat. </span></p><p><span>At Agatha’s silence, Jen soldiered on. “You know she was getting ready to tell you about her feelings for you.” </span></p><p><em><span>That </span></em><span>made Agatha’s head snap up. “What?” </span></p><p><span>“Yeah, Alice had finally convinced her it was worth telling you.”</span></p><p><span>“Hang on. Exactly how long have you known that Rio had feelings for me and was going to tell me?” </span></p><p><span>Jen had the decency to look guilty. “She called me a week ago, before work, all excited. We’d had bets on which one of us would get you guys to fold first.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her blood run cold. “You have known, for a week, that Rio was going to confess her feelings to me, and that she has since been ignoring me, and you didn’t think that was worth mentioning,” she hissed. </span></p><p><span>“Whoa, no, hang on. Alice only told me about Rio being depressed this morning. I would’ve told you sooner if I knew. I chalked your bitchiness up to your period or something until I put two and two together.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha tried to swallow the lump in her throat to no avail.</span></p><p><span>“Is that why you were so fucked last week? I know you like to knock a few back when we work, but last week was a whole different level.” </span></p><p><span>Ah, that. Jen might have a slight point. Agatha had basically cleared out their tequila stock before they’d even opened, attempting to wash away her feelings for Rio.</span></p><p><span>“Excuse you, I can hold my liquor. I was not </span><em><span>that </span></em><span>fucked.”</span></p><p><span>“Uhh, yes, you were, I was surprised you were still standing, and you know how you get when you’re drunk.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth to argue, to deny it, but before she could get a word out, she felt a memory slap her in the face. It was fuzzy; she wouldn’t have been able to pick the woman out in a crowd now, but she could feel her tongue dipping into her collarbone, licking up the salt. And if Rio had been there, and who else could have brought her azaleas, she would’ve seen whatever the fuck Agatha had let that bimbo do. </span></p><p><span>Fuck. This is why Agatha was so against love. All she ever did was hurt people. Agatha felt the tears prick in her eyes, hot and unwanted.</span></p><p><span>Agatha could feel Jen’s eyes on her, could feel the pity radiating off her as she watched Agatha war with herself. </span></p><p><span>“You want my advice?” Jen finally asked.</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha lied. “But I assume I’m going to hear it anyway, so do enlighten me.”</span></p><p><span>“Go find her. Tell her you’re sorry, tell her whatever happened was a misunderstanding, tell her you love her.” Jen said it with such conviction, as if it would be the easiest thing in the world to walk up to Rio, to open herself up to the one person who could hurt her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha weighed the pros and cons in her head.</span></p><p><span>Cons: </span></p><p><span>She had to talk about her feelings. </span></p><p><span>She had to chase someone for once. </span></p><p><span>She risked rejection </span></p><p><span>She might lose Rio forever.</span></p><p><span>Pros: </span></p><p><span>Rio was the best shag of her life, and she was so pent up she might die if they didn’t fuck soon. </span></p><p><span>Rio might just be the love of her life. </span></p><p><span>Rio.</span></p><p><span>That was it, wasn't it? She could have a list as long as the Nile of cons, but that one, single pro would outweigh them all. Agatha looked up at the ceiling, tracing the tiles. She blinked away the tears, slipping her mask back into place. </span></p><p><span> </span><span>“You know what, Jen, I’m suddenly feeling very ill and I’m going to need to take the afternoon off, mkay?” Agatha reached into the fridge behind the bar, grabbing the wine she knew Rio liked. “It doesn’t feel too bad, though, should be okay for tomorrow.” With that, Agatha grabbed her coat and bag and was already out the door by the time Jen was yelling something about how their shifts had, in fact, not even started yet.</span></p><p><span>Oh well, not her problem. Besides, Jen should be thrilled that she finally gave a good piece of advice that Agatha could follow. A broken clock was right once every 26 years, she supposed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rioooooo, I know you’re in there, open the door. Baby, please, open the door,” Agatha slurred, clutching the now half-empty wine bottle. So she had needed a little liquid courage, sue her. And she was going to need more if Rio kept ignoring her; she had been politely knocking on the door for at least ten minutes. </span></p><p><span>“Rio, come on, open the-” </span></p><p><span>“CAN YOU PLEASE, FUCK OFF,” Alice yelled as she wrenched open the door, causing Agatha to half stumble into the apartment. Alice, thankfully, was there to catch her and not so thankfully shove her ass back out of the apartment. </span></p><p><span>“Rio isn’t here, and frankly, even if she was, I’d be telling you the same thing.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha just scoffed, “Okay, so where is she then?” </span></p><p><span>“Why the fuck would I tell you that after what you did?” Alice spat the words out with a vitriol Agatha didn’t think she was capable of, and she felt herself falter. Alice was a kind woman; she had never seen her even come close to anger before. For her to be this livid at Agatha? Well, she didn’t even want to think of what Rio had told her. Didn’t want to think about what she had done to Rio. </span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat, feeling much more sober than she had a few minutes ago. “Please,” she begged. </span></p><p><span>For a moment, Agatha thought Alice might give in; her eyes softening slightly at Agatha’s plea. </span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry, Agatha.” </span></p><p><span>But only for a moment. </span></p><p><span>“You’ve hurt her one too many times,” Alice said, leaning against the door, slowly moving to close it. </span></p><p><span>Agatha feels panic wash over her as Alice goes to shut the door. This all feels too final for her liking, so she shoves her hand in the door to keep it from closing. “Alice, please,” Agatha pleads once more, tears gathering in her lashes, “I love her.”</span></p><p><span>Alice looks at Agatha pitifully, “I’m sorry, Agatha. It’s too late. If Rio doesn’t want to speak to you, I’m not going to be the one to break her trust.” </span></p><p><span>With that, Alice finally shuts the door in her face, cutting off Agatha’s final whispered </span><em><span>please</span></em><span>. She stared at the door for far too long, as if she could open it through pure will, watching the brass number blur as the tears began to finally fall. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It probably wasn’t the smartest idea to wander around the streets of New York after dark, drinking wine from the bottle. So, Agatha, being the responsible adult she was, wasn’t doing that. She had, in fact, already finished the bottle sitting in the stairwell of Rio’s apartment building, contemplating how much it would hurt to fling herself down the stairs. </span><em><span>Probably less than it already hurts</span></em><span>, she had figured, but couldn’t muster the effort to find out. </span></p><p><span>Now, she was aimlessly walking drunk, which was much safer, attempting to make her way towards her apartment. Which would’ve been much easier if her phone hadn’t died in the stairwell when she was looking hopelessly at pictures of Rio, but alas. </span></p><p><span>So instead, Agatha wandered, hoping she might get hit by a bus or succumb to hypothermia, but no such luck. Instead, she had the pleasure of reflecting on the total mess she had made of her life. </span></p><p><span>Why couldn’t she have just kept her fucking hands to herself for once? Why did she have to let some random woman, a total stranger who meant nothing to her, ruin her chance with Rio? Why could she never stop hurting the people she cared about? Her mother had been right, she supposed. Agatha had been born evil; maybe Evanora, the wretched cunt, had been right when she said she should’ve killed Agatha the moment she left her body. Everyone would hurt a hell of a lot less if she weren't around. Maybe she should just–</span></p><p><span>Agatha is spared from her admittedly rash plans to run away to Florida (she hates the heat and burns after half a second in the sun) and change her name to Agnes (shit name), by catching her foot on the edge of the pavement, slamming face first onto the street, hands landing in the shattered remnants of the empty bottle she had been carrying. </span></p><p><span>“Shit,” Agatha muttered, picking up her hands and staring at the scattered red beads splayed across her palms. Feeling eyes on her, Agatha snaps up, rushing to her feet in embarrassment. She opens her mouth, ready to tell them to mind their own fucking business, when her eyes drift past their heads, landing on a couple in the restaurant behind them. </span></p><p><span>In the next ten seconds, Agatha goes through every stage of grief–bar acceptance, of course, Agatha didn’t think she’d ever accepted anything in her life, good or bad, she was nothing if not a sceptic–before circling back around and landing firmly on anger. </span></p><p><span>How could Rio act like the love-sick, heartbroken, kicked puppy, when here she was, barely a week since she was going to tell Agatha she had feelings for her, on a </span><em><span>date.</span></em></p><p><span>The Agatha of twenty minutes ago might’ve burst into tears at the sight, but this was the new and improved Agatha who felt only blinding rage. </span></p><p><span>How dare she, Agatha seethed, shoulder charging the idiots who were still looking at her like she was a crazy person, as she barged towards the restaurant. </span></p><p><span>How dare she make Agatha fall head over heels in love with her and run at the first sign of trouble without even asking Agatha what was going on? </span></p><p><span>How dare she assume the worst of Agatha, as everyone else had? </span></p><p><span>How dare she flaunt this date for the world to see when she was supposed to love Agatha? </span></p><p><span>“Well, well, well, I never knew ghosts could eat.” Agatha drawled, the alcohol slurring the edge of her words.</span></p><p><span>Agatha watched Rio’s back tense, freezing at her voice. Slowly, Rio turned her head to face her, shock written all over her face. “Agatha, wha-”</span></p><p><span>“So that’s it, huh?” Agatha cut Rio off; she had had her chance to speak and chosen silence for a whole fucking week. “You get your feelings hurt and decide to go on a date with someone else?” </span></p><p><span>“My feelings </span><em><span>hurt</span></em><span>?” Rio scoffs incredulously, and that just pisses Agatha’s wine-addled mind off more. </span></p><p><span>How can Rio sit there, scoffing at her? At what they had? Sure, Agatha had only actually acknowledged that they had something in the comfort of her own mind, but she </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> going</span> <span>to tell Rio, but she was too busy taking other sluts out on dates. Which reminds her, “I am not the one who is going on dates with other women.” </span></p><p><span>Rio, always calm and considerate, finally snaps. “Are you kidding me, Agatha? I’m only here </span><em><span>because </span></em><span>of you and other women. I finally thought we were getting somewhere. I fucking love you, Agatha, and I was </span><em><span>finally </span></em><span>sure you liked me too, and I find out that not only am I the most pathetic person on the planet, I am also a fucking idiot,” she laughed mercilessly at herself, and it struck Agatha right in the chest. “I am in love with you, and I’m just another notch in your bedpost. I know I’m a loser, okay? I have known that my whole fucking life, but I thought that you liked that about me, liked me for who I was. So yeah, I’m on a date, because I can’t stand it anymore, Agatha. I can’t stand loving you when you barely tolerate me.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha felt like a cold bucket of water had been poured over her. Alice was right; she didn’t deserve Rio. She had made Rio feel like she, the love of her life, was just another worthless body she had collected. </span></p><p><span>Here, in the dim lighting of the restaurant, </span><span>looking</span><span> at the woman Rio was sitting with, someone who </span><span>looked</span><span> nice, normal, </span><span>boring, probably</span><span>, she realised it was already over.</span><span> She had to let Rio go. She loved her enough to want more for her than she could ever give her. Agatha felt oddly at peace with it all for someone who had been ready to burn the restaurant down five minutes ago. She loved Rio more than she’d ever loved anyone; she loved her so much she was willing to let her go. </span></p><p><span>“You’re not,” she sighed sadly, tears slipping down her face. Agatha would let her go, but not with Rio thinking so little of herself. She could think whatever she wanted of Agatha; she deserved that much, but not herself. “You’re not another notch, Rio. You were the only one who ever mattered, actually. But you’re right, I jerked you around, I was so scared of you meaning too much to me, of losing you, I never considered telling you that you already had me. And I’m sorry, truly. I’m sorry that I made you think so little of yourself when you’re the best person I know, my favourite person, actually.” Agatha sucked in a deep breath, in for a penny, she supposed. “I love you, Rio. But I respect you more, so I’m sorry I interrupted your date,” she glanced at the dark-haired woman, who looked frankly uncomfortable. It probably would be a contender for the worst first date of your life when your date admitted to being in love with someone else in front of you, but oh well, not Agatha’s problem.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned back to Rio, soaking in her face one last time, fighting back the urge to reach out and wipe away the matching tears gracing Rio’s beautiful face. “I’ll um, I’ll see you around Rio. </span><em><span>Te veo,</span></em><span>” she croaked out, her voice cracking on the words. </span></p><p><span>Before Rio could respond, Agatha bolted from the restaurant, ignoring the whispers that followed her as she went. </span></p><p><span>The night air was biting, slicing through Agatha now that she was sober and newly emotionally intelligent enough to feel anything. Grumbling, Agatha moved to grab her phone, only to remember that it was dead. Just great. Squinting at the signs because, despite being sober-ish, she had run out of her contact prescription and refused to wear her glasses.</span></p><p><span>Agatha had managed to make out the word ‘street’  when the restaurant doors crashed open. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha!” Rio shouted, her head whipping around, muttering something Agatha couldn’t make out under her breath. </span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Agatha!</span></em><span>” Rio tried again, harsher this time, more desperate. </span></p><p><span>“Rio?” </span></p><p><span>Her eyes met Agatha’s instantly, filled with too many emotions for Agatha to decipher, but one shone through stronger than the rest. Agatha felt her heart sink in her chest as Rio drew closer and she realised it wasn’t love or forgiveness, but anger that shone most brightly. </span></p><p><span>“What the hell, Agatha?” </span></p><p><span>“I already said I’m sorry, Rio. What else do you want from me? I’m leaving you alone like you wanted.”</span></p><p><span>“Like I wanted? Agatha,” Rio sighed exasperatedly, like something was spelled out for her and she couldn’t understand how Agatha didn’t see it. Rio moved forward, grasping Agatha’s face in her hands, her eyes finally softening. “Mi amor, all I want is you.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her body, which had been tense for the past week, finally relax, melting into Rio’s touch. </span></p><p><span>“All I have wanted for the past week, hell, the past four months, is for you to want me as much as I want you. And then you finally tell me you do, and you walk away?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gripped Rio’s wrists, locking her in place. “I–I’m not good for you, Rio. You deserve better than me, so, so much more than me,” she confessed quietly. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. And despite your best efforts, you treat me better than anyone else ever has. Sure, sometimes you panicked, and it drove me nuts, but you went out of your way to make my day better or listen to what I had to say. You might not believe it, but Agatha, </span><em><span>mi amor</span></em><span>, you have so much more love in you than you’re willing to admit.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t know how to process all that, didn’t know how to tell Rio how much she meant to her, so she did the only thing she could think of. </span></p><p><span>Feeling her lips against Rio’s for the first time in a week felt like finally coming home. She sighed against Rio’s lips, feeling them slot together like they were made for each other. They kissed slowly, relishing in the feeling of each other's mouths, relearning every crevice, taking their time, because for once that's all they had: </span><em><span>time</span></em><span>. </span></p><p><span>Eventually, Agatha pulled back, resting her forehead against Rio’s, “What about your date?” </span></p><p><span>“Oh, yeah, she left. I think I’m probably pretty lucky she didn’t slap me, to be honest. Apparently, it’s bad manners to confess your love to someone else on a first date, at least it must be in Norway,” Rio grinned.</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted in response, burying her head in Rio’s hair. “She can fuck off back to Norway, fucking skank on a date with my girlfriend.” </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, you can’t call women skanks, it’s rude,” Rio chastised, hands raking gently through Agatha’s hair. “And girlfriend, huh? I don’t remember agreeing to that one,” Rio teased. </span></p><p><span>Lifting off her shoulder, Agatha glared at Rio. “Oh, by all means, go and marry the skank then.” </span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled, pulling them back together, like even the inches apart was too far. “Don’t worry, baby, I don’t plan on marrying anyone else, skanks included.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The decision to go back to Agatha’s was a natural one; Alice was at home, and neither of them wanted to explain anything tonight; they just wanted to be together. They had stumbled through the door together, slowly ridding each other of their clothes. They had somehow navigated through Agatha’s small apartment to the bedroom without detaching their mouths, desperate to make up for the week they had lost. </span></p><p><span>Agatha loathed the term </span><em><span>making love</span></em><span>, had in fact rolled her eyes into the back of her head whenever anyone used the term around her, but there was no other way to describe what she and Rio were doing. This wasn’t fucking, this was more. The way Rio had murmured “no, I wanna look at you” when Agatha had tried to flip over, how she fucked her slow, made her feel each deep thrust, dragging orgasm after orgasm out of her, how they had kissed, languidly, just to be as close as they could, this wasn’t just sex. </span></p><p><span>Agatha felt Rio’s thrusts speed up slightly, losing her rhythm. </span></p><p><span>“Ags, fuck, mi amor, I’m close,” Rio panted into her mouth, face scrunched as she tried to hold back her orgasm. </span></p><p><span>“Rio, please, come inside me, baby, I need it.” Agatha felt herself clench on the strap, trying to milk Rio as if she could feel it. And maybe she could, because almost instantaneously she felt Rio’s thrusts falter, shuddering to a stop, buried as far as she could inside her. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s body collapsed on top of Agatha, landing on her like a weighted blanket. Agatha ran her fingers through Rio’s silky hair, dragging through non-existent knots. Rio sighed into her shoulder shakily, and Agatha’s brows scrunched in confusion as she felt tears slip down her chest. </span></p><p><span>“Rio? What’s wrong?” she asked, chewing on her lip nervously. </span></p><p><span>Rio was silent for a moment. “Nothing, I just…I don’t know, this just isn’t how I thought today was going to end. I thought I’d lost you before I even got you,” Rio lifted her head from Agatha’s shoulder, pressing a painfully tender kiss to her forehead. “I’ve never been more grateful to be wrong.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha felt matching happy tears quietly start to pool in her eyes, threatening but failing to fall as Rio wiped them away quickly. Agatha had spent her whole life being told she was unlovable, evil, a parasite that should’ve been killed before she was born. She never in a million years thought she could ever have someone like Rio love her. She knew she probably didn’t deserve it, didn’t deserve Rio’s love, but those five minutes she had tried to be selfless today had been the literal worst of her life, so she was going to take Rio’s love and keep it for as long as she would let her. </span></p><p><span>“I love you so much,” Agatha whispered. </span></p><p><span>“I–” Rio started, only to be cut off by Miss Vicious jumping onto the bed, stalking towards them like they were both prey. </span></p><p><span>“Fucks sake,” Agatha grumbled, regretfully pushing Rio off her to get her cat before they were both scratched beyond recognition. This fucking cat. She should never have adopted her. </span><em><span>Kindred spirits</span></em><span>, fuck right off, Jen. </span></p><p><span>Before she could even move to grab the cat, Agatha felt her jaw drop open. Miss Vicious, who hated every single person she had ever met (Agatha included), was </span><em><span>cuddling</span></em><span> up to Rio, purring against her chest. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah, you’re not so scratchy now, are you, Señorita?” she cooed. </span></p><p><span>What, and Agatha could not stress this enough, the fuck? What did Rio have? Some kind of magic fingers? </span><em><span>Well, yes, actually</span></em><span>, Agatha thought, but not the point. Grumbling some more about the fickleness of cats as a species, Agatha slid back into bed next to them, only to be immediately hissed at when she tried to touch Rio. </span></p><p><span>“Okay, no, nope, no way is my cat claiming you. Sorry, Vicious, but she was mine first,” Agatha protested, reaching to take the cat from Rio. She was going to lock her out of the bedroom for life; this room was officially a cat-free zone. </span></p><p><span>“Uh-uh,” Rio tsked, moving both the cat and herself away from Agatha’s grasp. “Sorry, sweetheart, but she’s basically my child now, too. I can’t just abandon her.” </span></p><p><span>“Well, if you love her </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> much, then you can go and feed her; she’s probably starving, that’s why she’s acting so nice.” </span></p><p><span>“Come on, Agatha, don’t be jealous that Señorita Scratchy over here has finally found a tolerable human,” Rio teased, already getting out of bed to feed the cat. </span></p><p><span>Agatha almost stopped Rio, the cat could wait goddamit, but the sight of Rio’s ass as she walked away was too good to pass up, and Agatha was </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> excited about her re-entrance in a few minutes, hopefully with just one pussy. </span></p><p><span>Agatha snuggled back into the sheets, wrapping the blankets around her. She could hear Rio in the kitchen talking to the cat like the adorable idiot she was, and couldn’t help the smile that graced her face. Agatha strained to listen, to hear how Rio spoke to her </span><em><span>child </span></em><span>as she so eloquently put it, wanting to store that information away for later. </span></p><p><span>Smiling to herself, Agatha closed her eyes and let Rio’s muffled words lull her to sleep, stirring only when Rio slipped back into bed. Agatha let herself be held, and for the first time since sleeping with Rio, dreamt. She dreamt of a house with a yard, one full of well-kept flowers and wood for a soon-to-be-built treehouse. She dreamt of a home full of terrible but cherished art on the fridge, of giggles and little footsteps running through it. She dreamt of a boy with brown hair and brown eyes, and for once, Agatha never wanted her dreams to end. </span></p>
