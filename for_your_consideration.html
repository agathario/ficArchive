<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was hot. Too hot to be doing this.</p><p>She knew that. She could tell by the way her lungs screamed at her to stop, how her muscles were on the verge of cramping when she’d only been moving properly for twenty minutes or so.</p><p>But this was where Rio Vidal could be fully herself.</p><p>Where she could push herself in ways she couldn’t when all eyes were on her. Everywhere she went. Everything she did.</p><p>Someone always needed something: a selfie, another take, a charming story for a late night show.</p><p>But out on the trails she could be free. The strain and sweat made her feel more alive than the standing ovations received in her broadway debut or the five star reviews of her latest movie.</p><p>But it was this, the hard-hitting drama about a lost cause grifter searching for meaning in all the wrong places, that meant that her peace was shattered as her music switched from heavy drum and bass to something infinitely less welcome.</p><p>A phone call.</p><p>“Alice. What is it? I’m-…”</p><p>“Where the fuck are you? We have to leave in an hour.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio huffed out a heavy breath as she halted her stride and turned her watch over to check her heart rate, paying little attention to the time.</p><p>“I’ll be back soon.”</p><p>“Rio, this is serious. This is a <em>big</em> deal.”</p><p>“Yes, you’ve said.”</p><p>“Look, I know you don’t give a shit about awards but if we can get one then…”</p><p>“And a roundtable with some arrogant actresses is the way to go. Got it.”</p><p>There was a sigh on the other end of the line and Rio felt guilty for a split second. Alice was good at her job and often Rio gave her a harder time than she needed to. But only because she was her best friend before she was her publicist.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll head back now,” she relented before the guilt could fully settle.</p><p>“Hurry,” was all she heard before Alice put the phone down on her.</p><p>And so Rio turned away from her desired route into the foothills and made to run back down the way. But before she could pick back up the pace a couple of walkers just a few feet away caught her eye and Rio groaned internally when they began to flutter at her.</p><p>“Rio? Rio Vidal? Oh my god!”</p><p>Rio smiled and waved, adjusting her stance from ‘about to run’ to ‘nowhere to run’. Pulling her AirPods from her ears she self-consciously wiped her forehead with the back of her forearm and allowed the two to approach, soon realising that they were harmless and wanted a quick selfie rather than a long talk about their favourite movie of hers, or worse, an ill-advised admission that she was on their “lists”.</p><p>She was on a lot of people’s lists.</p><p>She thanked them kindly for their support and felt guilty for the second time that day as she ran off, leaving her fans in her dust behind her.</p><p>It wasn’t that she hated interacting with fans - actually Alice always told her she was too generous with them - but a day like today was not a day where she felt like being fawned over. She had to be top of her game.</p><p>Hence the run. Hence the escape.</p><p>Alice was right. This was a big deal. And the next few months could mean that the rest of her career would never be the same again.</p><p>If she could just play it right, if she could schmooze and charm, and campaign, then maybe she could get a nomination. Maybe she could even win.</p><p>And this roundtable was the start of it.</p><p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> did this annually, ahead of any sort of nominations coming out they’d predict the front runners in each category and invite them to a roundtable where the potential nominees and inevitable winners would be preened and polished before being set out like little dolls at a child’s tea party.</p><p>Rio resented the implication. But she knew it was part of the game.</p><p>Her latest movie was Oscar fodder. She’d known that when she’d signed up. In fact, it was <em>why</em> she’d signed up.</p><p><em>All The Wrong Gods</em> had come out to rave reviews for both Rio and the film itself. It was the first time in her career where the industry was actually paying attention to her rather than her performances being a footnote at the end of reviews: “a standout performance from Vidal manages to elevate an otherwise dire script”, “Vidal adds some life to a two-dimensional character”, “when will someone give Vidal the chance to sink her teeth into a role rather than letting her chew on what’s left”.</p><p>It had taken until her thirty second year to get this kind of recognition, for publications to be bothering Alice night and day for an exclusive interview that didn’t involve questions similar to “how was it working with an all male cast?” Or “was it hard being ‘the straight man’ in a room full of comedians?”.</p><p>And as much as she’d like to let her work speak for itself, she knew that wasn’t how Hollywood worked.</p><p>And so she’d soon be in a room, placed at a table with five other Oscar-hopefuls, all playing the same game with various levels of experience and previous success.</p><p>There was Jessica Dyson, a relative newbie to this game and a rare friendly face in the industry who would be there to speak about her WWII piece: <em>Beneath The Weight Of Sky</em>. Her movie had already debuted at Sundance.</p><p>There would be Sylvia Jones, an old British acting legend who already had two Oscars under her belt and plenty of opinions on the way the industry was going (all negative, all, in Rio’s opinion, racist), bringing with her the weepy drama set inexplicably on a barge (Rio had fallen asleep during this one when she’d had a screener sent to her by the production): <em>Downriver Grace</em>.</p><p>Then there would be Isla McCoy, a younger actress who had racked up more Oscar noms than Rio could count but who she’d met a few times and actually liked, or at least looked forward to speaking to at any and all industry events. Isla was bringing her latest virtuoso performance in a story about a blind violinist in the seventies called: <em>Echoes of Her Hands</em>. Another Sundance release.</p><p>Rio had reached out to Isla when she’d seen the movie telling her how extraordinary her performance was. She’d received an emoji back.</p><p>Next up was the woman Rio most looked forward to seeing. The woman with red hair and a genuine smile and who had turned in a deeply affecting performance in what was otherwise a mess of a movie; Wanda Maximoff for <em>The Vanishing Point</em>.</p><p>But finally, the person Rio always dreaded seeing at any event but who she more than often was able to avoid, was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Agatha was an industry heavyweight.</p><p>Only seven years old than Rio, she’d already secured one Best Actress gong alongside two other nominations and multiple other awards.</p><p>Rio could only guess how stacked her trophy cabinet was.</p><p>Rio already knew that Agatha would win this round again and then she’d be a two-time winner, one of the elite few to obtain such a status.</p><p>Agatha’s latest movie was an intimate portrait of a mother experiencing the loss of a child.</p><p>Rumour had it that this was Agatha’s masterpiece.</p><p>That if she chose to retire now she’d be leaving the world with such a huge gift that the tragedy of her loss to the acting world would almost be forgiven for the magnificence of the gift.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness could hold an audience.</p><p>She could rewire people’s brain chemistry with just a look.</p><p>Her blue eyes contained worlds of emotions Rio could only dream of capturing for a scene or two in every movie she was in.</p><p>But Agatha held them, owned them, ruled them when she worked.</p><p><em>No Heaven Like This</em> was labelled a masterpiece before it had even been properly released. The critics were desperate for it, the audiences were gagging for it, and Rio would be one of the first in line to it.</p><p>Both Rio and Agatha were yet to have their movies debut properly and were waiting on Cannes the next month to have them released to the critics.</p><p>The buzz around them both was already so strong though, so palpable, that they were already the betting man’s favourites to win; hence the invitation to the roundtable, hence the reason Rio’s schedule was full for the next year.</p><p>But as Rio slowed her pace, coming now to the flat of trail, almost reaching her little silver hybrid, she weaved gracefully and expertly through the throngs of people now making their way up the trails in the early morning sun.</p><p>Her mind drifted back to Agatha, the final of the little sextet of actresses all vying for the attentions of the press and the public to get their recognition, and any accolade they could get their greedy hands on.</p><p>But it wasn’t jealousy that led her back to Agatha.</p><p>The sudden phantom feeling of a body against her own. Those blue eyes that held so much, and gave only when she wanted them to, and the feel of warm breath against her lips.</p><p>She’d had plenty of bodies against her own since then, before then.</p><p>But to have Agatha Harkness so close and then to lose her so fast, it was enough to make anyone go crazy.</p><p>She’d met Agatha for the first time eight years ago.</p><p>When Agatha was on the verge of her first nomination and Rio was still a jobbing actress with an improv group in downtown Chicago.</p><p>One of the seniors in the group had somehow arranged for Agatha to stop by one of their shows and Rio had been transfixed by the woman from the moment she’d stepped foot into the little theatre she’d once considered home.</p><p>Anyone who had eyes and ears knew Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And anyone with a brain was a fan.</p><p>Anyone who felt anything for a beautiful woman was in love with her.</p><p>And Rio was no exception to any of these things.</p><p>But Agatha had barely paid her attention all night.</p><p>She’d seen her eyes on her during the show, she was sure of that. She was the talented newcomer of the troupe though so, lots of eyes were on her.</p><p>But in the bar afterwards, she’d barely looked her way, and when she had, she’d always turned just as quickly, as if she’d simply been glancing over and Rio happened to be in the way.</p><p>Only, something strange had happened that night. Rio had got drunk. Too drunk. Which wasn’t that strange.</p><p>She’d been spurred on by a good show, a rowdy cast, and an always encouraging Alice.</p><p>And somewhere between spotting Agatha for the first time in the audience and going home with Alice and on the verge of vomiting, she’d found herself pressed against the inner door of a grimy toilet stall.</p><p>Even eight years later she still wasn’t sure what had happened.</p><p>But she was sure that Agatha had had her hands either side of her head, that their bodies had been so very nearly pressed together, that Agatha’s lips had been a breath away from her own.</p><p>And then it was over before it had begun.</p><p>Someone else entering the bathroom had spooked Agatha and Rio had been left high and dry, all alone in the little stall hornier and more confused than she’d ever been in her life.</p><p>She hadn’t told anyone about this.</p><p>She hadn’t even told Alice for fear her best friend would make fun of her for fantasising about the older, straight actress who had shown absolutely zero interest in her all night.</p><p>It had happened. She was sure of it.</p><p>But back on the Los Angeles trail, Rio lost her footing in the throes of her memories and slipped in the copper dust of the Californian sand.</p><p>She yelped and collapsed onto her side, her ankle sparking up a white hot pain that flashed up her calf.</p><p>“Fuck me, fuck me.”</p><p>That’s what she got for thinking of a married mother of one like that.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness sure as hell didn’t remember one random drunken encounter in a bar all those years ago where nothing technically happened with an actress she barely acknowledged the existence of and probably didn’t even remember the name of.</p><p>And Rio was a fool to even think about it.</p><p>Two burly gentlemen came to Rio’s aid and helped her back to her feet, fussing a little more over Rio Vidal the actress than if she’d been any other random woman tripping over her own feet.</p><p>She soon thanked them and hobbled off to her car, gritting her teeth through the pain of it until she managed to sink into the warm embrace of her five year old Toyota that she refused to give up just because it wasn’t a cool enough car for a cool actress.</p><p>Though Alice had very nearly convinced her to get a sporty little red thing only the previous week.</p><p>The short drive home to her little house in the hills was enough time for her to forget all about her almost-tryst with one of the most famous women in the world.</p><p>And by the time she was back in Alice’s clutches, let alone her bad books, she had lost all sense of what had caused her to fall in the first place.</p><p>“God, for someone so athletic you really are a klutz.”</p><p>“It happens. It’s busy and the trail-…”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>Rio only rolled her eyes, knowing much better than to get into an argument about this when she was already in trouble. Plus, fighting more would only make them much later.</p><p>In fact, they were so late that Alice was performing a soliloquy on the plans for the day as they moved through the Spanish-style villa that Rio had only recently treated herself to.</p><p>“You can’t just follow me into the shower, you know. HR would have a field day.”</p><p>“I am your HR, and your agent, and your manager and PA and-…”</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Rio sang out even as she threw her sweaty sports bra on the floor and shimmied out of her shorts - all sense of shyness long since gone in their friendship; having shared apartments together of varying sizes and in varying states since their late teens.</p><p>“You need to be on your best behaviour.”</p><p>“I always am,” Rio said with a wink, stepping into the waterfall shower as Alice perched on the counter and kept her gaze down on her phone where no doubt she was answering millions of new emails about Rio, her comments on the film, her personal life, her upcoming projects.</p><p>“No. I mean it. It’s important you nail this. Being late won’t help. You have to charm their pants off. Wanda and Jessica and Isla will be fine. They’re friendly. You have to be respectful of her Ladyship and Agatha. Especially Agatha. She’ll win and you want her to name call you first of ‘her fellow nominees’ in her speech.”</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence that lasted the length of Rio lathering up her hair with shampoo before Alice spoke again.</p><p>“Jennifer Kale called earlier.”</p><p>Rio had just put her head back under the water to rinse said shampoo away so wasn’t sure she’d heard correctly. She leant out again and made eyes at Alice through the misty glass partition, seeing her best friend watching her curiously.</p><p>“I’m sorry, what?”</p><p>“Jennifer Kale. Agatha’s-…”</p><p>“Yeah. Why did she call?”</p><p>Alice shrugged slightly and dropped her gaze back to her phone, swinging her legs as she started to type again. “Something about checking in on the competition. I think Agatha’s spooked. You’re the second favourite in the running.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and dipped back into the hot shower, taking her time to rinse out the suds before she leant back out again and said: “It’s just on camera chatting though, right? Schmoozing off-camera isn’t-…”</p><p>“It’s necessary. You schmooze with the best of them. Flirt a little and you’ll be fine.”</p><p>“That’s terrible advice,” Rio said with a huff even as she reached for the conditioner.</p><p>“A little flirt never hurt anyone.”</p><p>Rio would have rolled her eyes if she hadn’t just stuck her head back under the water.</p><p>And she knew she’d have to endure Alice’s pitiful attempts at flirting with Jennifer Kale, whom she’d been smitten with since the first Golden Globes they’d ever attended together two years ago.</p><p>And if Rio were honest, she was pretty sure Jennifer was smitten too. But it wasn’t exactly a relationship she wanted to encourage.</p><p>Not when Jennifer’s boss was the subject of Rio’s most frequent fantasies.</p><p>Soon Alice got bored and was happy enough with the progress Rio was making getting herself clean so she disappeared from the bathroom to give her friend and employer some dignity, finally.</p><p>Rio emerged not ten minutes later into the living room with sopping wet hair and an old sweater over yoga pants. It wasn’t exactly the movie star look Alice would have picked for her.</p><p>“You could at least-…”</p><p>“They pay people to make me look good. An hour in hair and makeup and you won’t recognise me. Relax.”</p><p>Alice huffed and Rio smiled as she grabbed her purse from the couch and jingled her car keys, “Let’s go.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes but hurried after her boss and soon they were on their way to the studio lot where the shoot was to take place.</p><p>They slipped through security with ease, not only because the guard was a fan but also because Alice had all the right identification in place to quicken the process.</p><p>Rio often said that if they wanted to give it all up they’d make a great team of bank robbers: Rio could charm her way in and Alice could work out the rest.</p><p>By the time they were on the set and both hurried to a small trailer where outfit options were hanging patiently on rails for Rio, Rio’s nerves had settled into her stomach.</p><p>It wasn’t that she hated publicity. It was that she <em>hated</em> publicity.</p><p>Speaking to a group of people at a party was no problem.</p><p>Performing to a room using the words that someone else had written for her was a walk in the park.</p><p>But being herself, being her best self, and trying to impress in an environment that just wasn’t normal for anyone, that was a whole different ball game.</p><p>And if Rio knew anything, it was ballgames.</p><p>“Hey, hey, space cadet. Snap out of it,” Alice said urgently as they arrived at the makeup trailer they’d been shown to by a nervous PA.</p><p>“Look, go in there. Switch off for an hour. I’ll pick your outfit. I know what looks good on you. And just relax okay. No coffee. Just water.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and looked down at Alice. Good, kind, fierce Alice who had been by her side for years. She had no idea where she’d be without her and told her this often whenever she was drunk.</p><p>But unfortunately for her she was currently as sober as a nun.</p><p>“You’re the boss,” she said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes before she turned to leave, taking a steady breath before pushing the door open to the trailer.</p><p>Inside it was warm and inviting, with bright lighting around each mirror lining the wall that made Rio regret not wearing even a scrap of makeup - but it would have been washed off shortly anyway.</p><p>It smelled somehow familiar and Rio put it down to the floral scents of all the various lotions and potions that would soon be on her face and in her hair.</p><p>In front of her was an empty chair before the large mirror that reflected back at her the fake movie star that was Rio Vidal: fresh-faced and still a little flushed from her earlier run and the rush she’d been in to get here.</p><p>But she didn’t have time for vanity.</p><p>Within seconds, arms were around her and a soft ‘ooooo’ sound was in her ear.</p><p>She instinctively wrapped her arms around the woman who had so excitedly accosted her and blinked as she pulled back to beam at her.</p><p>“Rio! My darling girl! I wondered when you’d show. Come come, sit sit. Work to do, work to do.”</p><p>Rio recognised this woman but had no earthly idea what her name was and so she became biddable and sat in the chair pointed out to her.</p><p>“It’s so good to see you,” she said in her best impression of a person who knew exactly who she was talking to.</p><p>“Oh darling! How long has it been?”</p><p>“I-…” but a slight movement across from her caught her eye and Rio noticed for the first time a pair of blue eyes watching her closely, a glint of amusement clear in them.</p><p>Rio lost all ability to speak. Let alone make up the date of the last time she had seen the enthusiastic woman behind her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was sat primly in her seat, her hair piled on the top of her head in the way that looked purposeful where Rio’s currently looked tragic.</p><p>She had clearly been on her phone, which now lay delicately in her lap.</p><p>Her sweater was cashmere, her jeans expensive, the little boat shoes on her feet surely more than Rio’s entire outfit put together… and probably Alice’s too.</p><p>She had no makeup on yet, at least, had nothing that was obvious to the layman.</p><p>But her skin was glowing, that dewy way that sometimes happened to Rio’s skin when the right people put the right treatment on it.</p><p>It was a movie star glow.</p><p>And Rio hated her for it. Hated that she could look so beautiful, hated that she was so untouchable, so stratospherically famous and <em>good</em> and beautiful that it made Rio feel small in her presence.</p><p>“Perhaps a year ago? On <em>Starlight</em>, must have been.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said slowly, her eyes still on Agatha who was now raising her brows at her as if to ask ‘why are you looking at me’. And that smirk, god, Rio thought, that fucking smirk.</p><p>She tore her eyes away then and turned back to the unnamed woman who seemed to know her so well she was already taking her hair down and finding her parting in her mop of still-damp hair.</p><p>“Must be! How’ve you been?”</p><p>As Rio allowed her head to be turned towards the mirror so Mrs Nameless could do her job, her eyes flickered briefly through the looking glass to see Agatha, still looking at her.</p><p>She felt her body react before her mind could as she still tried to focus in on the details of the woman’s life, what she’d been up to, and why in the goddamn hell she couldn’t remember her name.</p><p>Rio felt hot under Agatha’s gaze, as if she’d been caught doing something she shouldn’t.</p><p>Though Agatha couldn’t know she’d thought about her a hell of a lot over the past eight years.</p><p>Could she?</p><p>Despite her hair currently being fanned out behind her and run through with expert fingers, she tugged a section free and began swirling it around her finger.</p><p>A nervous habit Alice was always telling her to stop doing in interviews.</p><p>This didn’t last long, however, as her unnamed friend stole it back and Rio was left with nothing to siphon her nervous energy into.</p><p>“And you must have met Agatha? Have you worked together?”</p><p>Rio glanced up from where she’d been determinedly staring at her own nose and looked to the woman behind her before briefly glancing towards Agatha.</p><p>“Yes, we’ve met. Just at parties and events.”</p><p>“Never had the privilege of working together though,” Agatha drawled with a sickening smile that Rio took to be dripping in sarcasm and the woman now leaning round her to access whatever bottle of serum she needed made another ‘ooooo’ sound.</p><p>“You should! You’d be fantastic. A twosome like you? You should make it happen. I insist. And hire me too.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha again and saw the smirk she’d heard in her voice before now proudly displayed on her face.</p><p>Sickening.</p><p>But the woman behind her was now tutting, her mind back on her job rather than the wonders Agatha and Rio could work on a movie together.</p><p>“I don’t have-…” she sighed heavily and dropped Rio’s hair where she’d held it in her left hand, “Bear with. I need to go to raid my other stash.”</p><p>“Aggie, darling,” she turned to Agatha and Rio noted that the brunette’s smile had softened in time to not be caught out, “Stay where you are and I’ll send the team to finish what I’ve started, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded but remained silent and turned back to her phone as Rio returned her attention back to herself, attempting to look cool and calm rather than how she felt, which was hot and bothered.</p><p>She heard the door to the little tin can they were in close behind her and a welcome silence descended for all of ten seconds before Agatha spoke.</p><p>“You don’t know her name.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, watching herself do so in the mirror before she turned to look at Agatha in real life.</p><p>The woman was still intent on her phone, her profile passive and her thumbs still moving.</p><p>“Of course I do.”</p><p>“Great. What is it?”</p><p>Rio blanched, her brain kicking up to start rifling through her internal roledex of industry names and job titles.</p><p>She’d worked with so many people over the years that she’d developed a reasonably good memory for names but for some reason this woman had slipped her mind.</p><p>“Are you asking because <em>you</em> don’t know?”</p><p>Fighting back seemed like the only option when she was coming up blank.</p><p>Agatha paused her typing and turned slowly to Rio, watching her for a second before she spoke again: “A little tip for you: learning people’s names comes at no cost to you and it’ll do wonders for your reputation.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw almost fell to the floor.</p><p>How could Agatha Harkness of all people be telling <em>her</em> how to ingratiate herself with the crew?</p><p>Rio had an exemplary reputation. She was always on time, always friendly, always made sure to bring coffee and pastries for early call times. And the one time she forgot a name <em>would</em> be when in the presence of Agatha Harkness, who had a reputation for being less than friendly to most she considered beneath her.</p><p>“Are you fucking-…?”</p><p>But her question was cut off when the door behind her opened and a flurry of people came into the cramped space.</p><p>Rio clamped her mouth shut just as Agatha grinned across at her and Rio saw the dazzle that people spoke about when they talked of Agatha aiming her shine at them.</p><p>It was nauseating, just how effortless it was for her. And Rio felt her cheeks flush a little from the impact of it, and turned her head away to centre herself again.</p><p>Beside her, Agatha was now accepting cheek kisses from the crew members tasked with taming her mane of brunette hair, and Rio felt like a child allowed at the adults’ table for the first time.</p><p>It wasn’t until her own hairdresser came back that she was able to wrangle herself back.</p><p>She focused hard on the conversation happening to and around her. Of this still nameless woman who was working with her assistants to wrestle Rio Vidal the person into Rio Vidal the movie star.</p><p>Where Rio had max three people at a time working on her, Agatha had at least seven, and occasionally one of the assistants working on Rio would flutter over to help the more senior crew members with Agatha’s face and hair.</p><p>She didn’t mind, really. Rio knew that if she were a member of the crew she’d much rather fuss over Agatha Harkness than Rio Vidal. But it was fascinating to watch all the same.</p><p>With the sheer volume of help that Agatha received to be camera ready, the older woman was done before Rio, and much to Rio’s surprise Agatha slipped from her chair and moved towards her.</p><p>Rio was just about able to lift her gaze up, turning her head just an inch or two to look at Agatha where one of the assistants was behind her working on adding soft curls to her hair.</p><p>Fully made up, Agatha looked no more or less beautiful than she had with no makeup on and more than anything Rio felt how unfair that was.</p><p>But then Agatha had done the unexpected and swooped in, a soft hand landing on Rio’s shoulder and her waterfall of long hair blocking the two of them from the rest of the room.</p><p>Rio’s lungs filled suddenly with the familiar scent she’d noticed earlier.</p><p>It was Agatha.</p><p>She wondered why it smelt so familiar, having never really been this close to the woman, unless a drunken mind could remember precisely the perfume of a woman who’d once almost kissed her.</p><p>Surely not.</p><p>But Agatha was leaning in, was smiling as she turned her head and Rio felt the soft warmth of her cheek just graze her own as she murmured into her ear, “It’s Sarah.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched the second the soft words hit the shell of her ear and she forgot herself as she turned her head slightly, making their cheeks brush again and her mind go blank when Agatha pulled back just enough and looked at her with something in her blue eyes that Rio had no capacity in her brain to recognise.</p><p>Agatha didn’t give her time to adjust to the proximity. As soon as it had started, it was done.</p><p>Agatha was moving on and had left the hot little trailer in search of her outfit for the shoot.</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, her mind now elsewhere when the people around her spoke to her.</p><p>She wondered if this was how her fans felt about her whenever they ran into her in the street or waited outside theatres or premiers for the chance to get her autograph.</p><p>Surely it was similar.</p><p>Agatha was a beautiful, unknowable movie star. Who wouldn’t be awestruck in her presence? Who wouldn’t be melted down to jelly when near her, when touching her?</p><p>Who wouldn’t now be thinking of the ghost of her breath against her lips?</p><p>The memory that over the years had morphed and changed and transmogrified into sometimes delicious late night fantasies, sometimes idle daydreams, sometimes nightmares of accusations or insults.</p><p>And so Rio shook it off, shook her silly little crush on the Oscar-winning actress off and made herself back into a professional adult who could focus in on a conversation without focusing on the warmth of her cheek that had just been graced with Agatha’s touch.</p><p>By the time Rio’s face was made up and her hair was styled to to look chicly natural, Rio ironically felt much more normal.</p><p>She stood from her seat and hugged the assistant and then the woman she’d spent hours with now, only now knowing her name for the last half of their time together.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal! Think about it, darling!”</p><p>Rio laughed and was determined to absolutely <em>not</em> think about it as she squeezed the woman’s arms.</p><p>“Sarah, always a pleasure. Thank you.”</p><p>The woman blinked at her, her joyful expression fading slowly and then morphing into something else.</p><p>The oxygen was sucked from the room.</p><p>And the soft sound of the radio blasting in the corner even seemed to stutter with static.</p><p>“It’s Grace.”</p><p>Rio could have kicked something.</p><p>Someone.</p><p>The whole room had gone silent and everyone had turned to look at them and Rio felt like the smallest person in the world. But she had no option but to persevere.</p><p>“Oh god, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day. Of course. Grace. Having a moment, I think.”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t as good an actress in real life as she was on screen and Grace clearly didn’t believe her.</p><p>So Rio smiled through the shame and stepped out of the now hot and stuffy trailer, intent on getting as far away as possible.</p><p>She stormed across the lot, only barley able to acknowledge the people who acknowledged her.</p><p>Agatha <em>fucking</em> Harkness.</p><p>Once inside her little trailer for the day, with her favourite person again, she flopped immediately down onto the couch beside a stressed out looking Alice.</p><p>“You look great.”</p><p>“Good because I need my mugshot to be good.”</p><p>“Mugshot? What?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness just made me look like an ass in front of the whole makeup trailer.”</p><p>Alice took a second before she looked around at Rio and placed her phone down, “What happened?”</p><p>“I forgot the stylist’s name and she told me it was-…”</p><p>“Oh, c’mon, Rio. That’s the oldest trick in the book.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio insisted, groaning loudly and closing her eyes as she tried to think back to how Agatha had looked at her before. Was it triumph in her eyes? No. It was something else.</p><p>“I hate her.”</p><p>“You don’t. You admire her. You want to marry her. You-…”</p><p>“Her poor fucking husband,” Rio huffed out, going to rub at her eyes and then remembering she’d just had them done up.</p><p>“He’s apparently an ass,” Alice said, done with her friend’s dramatics as she turned back to her phone.</p><p>But Rio didn’t care about the home life of Agatha Harkness. Not when she had just humiliated herself in front of half the crew.</p><p>“At least you look pretty,” Alice eventually said again, glancing over at a still annoyed Rio.</p><p>“Thanks. Just took a couple hours and like four hands on me at all times and I look passable all of a sudden.”</p><p>“Don’t give me that shit, Rio. God the amount of women you go through you’d think your self-esteem would be-…”</p><p>But Rio had slipped the cushion from under her head and used it to smack solidly into Alice’s chest, “shut up.”</p><p>“Whore,” Alice quipped and then laughed as Rio rolled her eyes and threw herself properly into a seated position, stealing Alice’s phone away.</p><p>“You’re a bigger whore than me. Plus you use my name to get in girl’s pants.”</p><p>“You use <em>your</em> name,” Alice reminded, stealing her phone right back.</p><p>“Actually I use my face.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Alice huffed and motioned to the rack of clothes on the side, “your dress. The red glittery one.”</p><p>“You’re kidding.”</p><p>“I don’t kid about work. Put it on.”</p><p>Rio scowled at her friend who was suspiciously avoiding eye contact and then stood to stride over and survey the dress a little more closely. “Isn’t it a bit-…?”</p><p>“You’re hot. Flash some boob, show some thigh.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and disappeared to put the dress on, taking the time to admire herself in the small bathroom mirror before she stepped back out again and Alice looked expectantly up at her.</p><p>“See? Am I right or am I right?”</p><p>Rio turned, annoyed that Alice looked so smug, and stood in front of the floor length mirror, gaging just how comfortable she felt in a dress like this when all the questions would inevitably be about ‘the actor’s process’, ‘changes to the industry post-Me Too’, and ‘what did you want to be when you grew up?’.</p><p>But she supposed a little boob wouldn’t hurt.</p><p>The dress was a ruby red with long sleeves and a daring slit both over her left thigh and down her chest and Rio moved left and right to see the shimmer it gave off sparkle in the light.</p><p>“That dress alone will get you laid for a month when this goes out.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shot her best friend a look in the mirror, adjusting the opening of her chest a little so just a slither more of skin was exposed.</p><p>She settled back down on the couch beside Alice, waiting until the last minute to put on her impossibly high shoes and they skimmed through the questions they’d received earlier in the week as prompts for what they might be speaking about today.</p><p>It was mostly the same stuff Rio had answered time and time again. Nothing extraordinary.</p><p>So by the time there was a knock at the door and one of the wardrobe assistants came in to check the progress of Rio’s outfit choice, she was comfortable enough to devote her time and attention to the woman, allowing her to adjust the dress, tweak her hair, and prod and poke her about until she was happy.</p><p>She even let her convince her to slide her heels on and had to hide the fact that her left ankle was a little tender from where she’d rolled it earlier.</p><p>But Alice saw. And she moved close to help support Rio subtly as she led her from the trailer and to where the shoot was to take place.</p><p>Rio’s stomach began to churn with the beginnings of nerves and even the whispered affirmations of Alice did nothing to ease them.</p><p>“You’ve got this. I’ll be right off-camera. Just be yourself… but not too much.”</p><p>From behind them came a sudden shout of Alice’s name and the light footsteps of a tall beautiful black woman, now beaming at the two of them, carrying an iced coffee in her hand.</p><p>“Alice! There you are. Where have you been hiding?”</p><p>Alice’s hand fell from Rio’s waist and Rio had to fight the urge to pull her back as she moved to kiss Jennifer Kale’s cheek.</p><p>“Oh, y’know, this one keeps me busy.”</p><p>Jennifer hummed and glanced at Rio, briefly checking her out in her sparkly dress.</p><p>“Vidal. Pleasure.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but notice her reception from Jennifer was significantly icier than Alice’s had been and she knew why.</p><p>Rio was one of the reasons her and Alice couldn’t spend as much time together as they’d like to at functions.</p><p>And, Rio thought a little guiltily, the reason Alice and Jennifer were more often than not on other sides of the country, or the world, sitting it out at boring movie shoots or press junkets with their respective clients.</p><p>Then again, Rio was also the reason Jen had met Alice in the first place.</p><p>If Rio hadn’t hired her best friend, she’d never have been at the swanky events where her and Jen could dress up and flirt for a few hours.</p><p>And that’s exactly what they did.</p><p>Alice and Jennifer had fallen into a strange sort of relationship for the past two years. It lived only at premieres or awards shows.</p><p>And the occasional phone call about some press matter or other.</p><p>But Rio had overheard a few of those calls and knew for a <em>fact</em> that ‘baby’ was not a word she’d be using on someone who was just a colleague.</p><p>And Rio, being loyal to Alice, and at least initially with no other true friends in the industry, had often found herself in Jennifer’s presence since the invitations to swanky events and exclusive premieres had started to open up.</p><p>In fact, she’d spent more time with Jennifer than she had her boss, <em>much</em> more time.</p><p>Agatha she only saw across the room, shining her light on more important people than Rio Vidal.</p><p>And Jennifer was free to schmooze because Agatha didn’t need the hand-holding.</p><p>Jennifer was charming and beautiful and the exact type of woman who would be working for the equally charming and beautiful Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Alice had once stated that Agatha and Jennifer were who they both wanted to be when they grew up. But Rio knew this wasn’t true - mostly because Alice was desperate to get into Jennifer’s pants and Rio wouldn’t mind being in Agatha’s either.</p><p>That had been, until she’d set her up in the makeup trailer.</p><p>
<em>Bitch.</em>
</p><p>“Jennifer,” Rio found herself saying, holding her hand out with a smile, “Come here often?”</p><p>Jennifer pursed her lips but Rio thought she might be trying to hide a smile as she took her hand and shook it gently, “You should probably go in. Agatha’s been there for at least ten minutes. Can’t be Hollywood’s ‘golden child’ and be late now.”</p><p>‘Golden Child’ had been Rio’s designated epithet for months now, since a mawkish article came out about her in the New York Times.</p><p>Alice loved it. “Good for the brand,” she’d say. Rio hated it.</p><p>But unable to fight the clock, she withdrew from the two and turned to make her way into the studio, sucking in a breath when she saw the little set before her.</p><p>It was smaller than she expected. Much more intimate.</p><p>On the sound stage sat a round table with seven chairs, all with glasses of iced water before them.</p><p>On one of the chairs sat the woman she knew to be the English actress, Sylvia. She looked regal and unamused in the warm glow of the studio lights, her gaze off in the middle distance somewhere.</p><p>Probably thinking about what fresh horrors she could spew, Rio thought.</p><p>But just off to the right of her were her friends, a gaggle of three gorgeous women all in varying shades of red.</p><p>Wanda, Jessica, Isla.</p><p>She strode over, making eyes and smiling at the crew members as she passed and trying her best to ignore the strain on her ankle as she did.</p><p>Wanda spotted Rio first and beamed at her, holding her arms out expectantly and laughing as Rio slipped into them for a hug.</p><p>Wanda was the kind of woman who got on with most people and Rio felt lucky that they’d met on a movie a while ago and had been fast friends with ever since. She was always a friendly face to run to at an otherwise boring or uninviting industry party.</p><p>Jessica similarly pulled Rio into a big hug and Isla smiled into her own with Rio too.</p><p>“Ready for this? Should be fun!”</p><p>Rio only hummed in response, her arm still loosely draped around Wanda’s waist as a means to both ground her nerves and take the weight off her ankle.</p><p>But her proper response was lost on her tongue as she looked over and saw Agatha speaking with the journalist who would be leading the interview.</p><p>Agatha was talking, though Rio couldn’t hear what she was saying. But she was making the journalist nervous if the shuffling of her cue cards were anything to go by.</p><p>Whatever they were talking about, whatever was making the journalist nervous, was completely lost on Rio for the sight of Agatha’s outfit.</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost popped out of her head.</p><p>Agatha was wearing an oversized red suit jacket and… and that was it.</p><p>Her long toned legs had a light tan on them that from where Rio was standing looked natural and the jacket ended perilously close to the apex of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Surely that must be illegal.</p><p>Her sleeves were rolled up casually to her elbows which made it look natural and as if Agatha had simply pushed them there herself. Her hair was draped over one shoulder and her eyes, her eyes…</p><p>Rio had been caught.</p><p>She looked away quickly, but not quickly enough for Agatha to have missed the way she’d been staring. The way she’d been <em>ogling</em> at her.</p><p>If Rio weren’t currently caked in make up she’d have been worried she were as red as the dress she were wearing.</p><p>But she kept her gaze down, purposefully avoiding looking back up, and choosing instead to zone in on young Isla who, despite her impressive pedigree for such a young actress, was talking of how nervous she was.</p><p>Rio felt Wanda move from her side to go to Isla instead but she hadn’t been expecting it so she stumbled a little and winced when she placed her foot properly down.</p><p>Wanda shot her an ‘are you okay?’ look that she brushed off with a smile and she settled herself back, leaning slightly to the right so she could take the strain off.</p><p>But there wasn’t time now for worrying about her ankle or that she wanted to kiss Agatha or or that she hated Agatha or that Agatha now thought she was a pervert.</p><p>She was being ushered to her seat, offered a tea, and left to do what quick maths were needed to determine who would be sitting next to her.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Opposite her was Wanda, looking serene and unbothered by the fussing attention of something touching up her blusher. Beside her was Isla, looking a little green with nerves and beside her was Sylvia, still as regal as ever. Then came Jessica, grinning and trying to reassure Isla with a wink.</p><p>And an empty seat.</p><p>Rio felt the tell-tale sign of a weight on the back of her chair as somebody slipped past and held it as they sat down, followed swiftly by the familiar perfume of Agatha Harkness as she took her seat beside her.</p><p>Rio didn’t acknowledge her presence. She didn’t even look around at her.</p><p>She simply stared straight ahead, watching as the journalist took her place and they were all of them introduced to her.</p><p>The concept was simple. An hour or so of chat and questions.</p><p>Each one of them would get their chance to shine, to answer questions on acting, and on their latest movie. Then other questions would be a free for all and they were all of them encouraged to jump in whenever they wanted.</p><p>Simple. Easy. Quick.</p><p>And as the lights moved down and the cameras moved in, Rio began to feel settled. Her mind went from busy to blank in seconds in the way it did when she had an audience or a camera to perform to.</p><p>She was being introduced for the camera and she managed to smile easily, as if it had taken her off guard and she were simply happy to be there.</p><p>“Welcome everybody. It’s a pleasure to have you all here. We’ll start off easy. Favourite movies? Just one. Anyone can jump in.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced around with a coy smile, seeing who would bite first, who would set the tone.</p><p>Sylvia: “<em>Ben Hur.</em>. Charlton Heston was, for me, everything.”</p><p>There were polite murmurings and Rio thought it were clear that neither she nor the other actresses had ever seen <em>Ben Hur</em>.</p><p>Wanda jumped in then: “<em>Mary Poppins</em>. It’s the nostalgia for me. I used to watch it all the time with my mom. Julie Andrews can do no wrong in my eyes.”</p><p>“Oh then I raise you <em>The Sound of Music</em>,” Jessica said with a grin. Her best role. The chemistry with Christopher Plummer is to die for.”</p><p>“Isla?”</p><p>“That’s a hard question. I love so many. Maybe <em>The Notebook</em> or something, I don’t know. It’s a good sick-day movie.”</p><p>Rio smiled at all of these answers and was still racking her brain for her own answer when the interviewer turned to Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha? Favourite movie?”</p><p>“<em>A Woman Under The Influence.</em> Powerful. Beautiful. Rowlands at her best.”</p><p>“All quite different answers,” the journalist said with a smile as she turned to Rio.</p><p>“And last but not least, Rio?”</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair and knew somewhere off camera Alice would be cursing her out. But she also knew it would fly back down and give her a purposefully dishevelled look even when she sat in all her finery.</p><p>“Honestly? Because of the sheer spectacle of it and how it made me feel as a kid: <em>Jurassic Park</em>. That or <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em>.”</p><p>“Alright!” The interviewer announced with a grin, “a good eclectic mix there, I think. Questions won’t get that much harder from here on out, I promise.”</p><p>The questions came slow and steady from then on, and people began to relax.</p><p>Occasionally, between questions, someone would call to cut and hair and makeup artists would run on to touch lipstick or eyeliner up and Rio noticed that everyone was particularly keen on fussing over Agatha.</p><p>She did her best not to look at her.</p><p>And when it was Rio’s turn to wax lyrical about her movie, about the film making process, about the joy of creating this character, she’d forgotten this was something she’d even been nervous about.</p><p>“Can you tell me a little about your choice as a queer actress to take on three queer roles in the past year? Was it intentional, did you seek it out? Or was it just something that happened and you jumped at it?”</p><p>“Oh, I mean, I have lived experience of it, right? I know what it is to be closeted like Angel in <em>Tampa</em>, I know what it’s like to kiss a woman you’ve had a crush on for ages or a woman you spot across a bar. So these roles…”</p><p>Beside her, Rio was aware of a slight shift, of movement in her periphery, of a hand that raised and landed on the back of her chair. Agatha had turned more to her.</p><p>“… they allow me to play more because I’m pretending a little less. So I guess I seek them out, but I also think it’s important to focus on more than just the sexuality of a character. I’m a lesbian and I have been in love and heart broken but so have straight women. And heartache feels the same, regardless of who you are or who you love.”</p><p>The journalist nodded and Wanda across from her smiled and said: “Well said.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and dared to glance to the side, clocking suddenly what she’d expected to see: that Agatha was still holding the back of her chair, her body angled her way.</p><p>Rio took a sip of water.</p><p>“Do you think only queer actors should play queer roles?”</p><p>A question that Rio had been plagued with for years now.</p><p>One that she never enjoyed answering because you could never please everyone.</p><p>“I don’t think queer actors <em>have to</em> always play queer roles but I do think that if we continue to cast and favour straight actors then it says a lot about who and what we value as an industry, and as a culture. But generally having more queer parts available I think is a win for everyone, particularly those actors who often don’t get the opportunities that straight actors might.”</p><p>Two questions about queer identity. Rio knew Alice would be furious.</p><p>She hated it when in mainstream interviews like this it was all anyone wanted to bring up.</p><p>But Rio didn’t mind.</p><p>It sometimes meant she was stopped in the street by a kid, or even an adult, struggling with their own sexuality and they’d seen her talking about it in a medium like this and it made them feel better.</p><p>So she always tried her hardest with those questions.</p><p>For the people who needed her to.</p><p>“And with this role in particular, in <em>All The Wrong Gods</em>, focusing a lot on seeking absolution for what your character considers to be her inherited badness, how did you work through that as an actress?”</p><p>“I’m Catholic. I carry guilt with me wherever I go. It wasn’t so hard.”</p><p>And then she heard it, a miraculous, tiny, snort from beside her, hidden amongst the laughter around the rest of the table.</p><p>Rio turned her head, and saw Agatha watching her, an amused smile on her face that Rio, if she didn’t know any better, would have guessed were genuine.</p><p>But she’d been wrong before.</p><p>She smiled back at her and turned back again only when the journalist probed some more, “So you think it’s easier to act when you feel close to your character in some way?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and laughed because god if she were anything like her character in this movie then she were in big trouble.</p><p>“Close can mean lots of things. If I can identify something in them that is familiar to me either through myself or people I know then, maybe.”</p><p>“I find it easier when I <em>don’t</em> know what I’m doing or who the character is,” Wanda interjected, shooting Rio a smile, “it feels scarier for sure but trying to make it up as you go along for me is the best way I’ve found to do it.”</p><p>Rio settled back in her seat slightly, glad the spotlight was off her for a few seconds, still more than aware that Agatha’s hand was still resting on her chair.</p><p>The conversation moved on and Rio jumped in where she could, but remained cognisant of Alice’s instruction to be herself, but not too much.</p><p>Agatha’s hand had moved away from her chair after maybe ten minutes, and in moving it away Rio felt herself able to breathe properly again, no longer half focused on the pale hand so close.</p><p>And when it came to Agatha’s turn to speak, Rio took advantage of the opportunity to look at her, to properly look, with no fear that she could be accused of being a pervert this time.</p><p>So long as she focused on her face.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” the interviewer had said, and Rio had watched as Agatha pursed her lips and straightened her back slightly. “Three time nominee, one time winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress.”</p><p>Jess whooped and Agatha released a laugh, that was as well-timed as it was self-deprecating.</p><p>It was like watching a master at work.</p><p>“You’re bringing us <em>No Heaven Like This</em>, and in it you play Agnes, a woman who has recently lost her son. Obviously, you have a child of your own, how easy or difficult was it to separate yourself from Agnes?”</p><p>“Impossible. Impossible.”</p><p>Agatha took in a deep breath and Rio watched as her hands fidgeted before her on the table.</p><p>“When you’re playing with grief, when you’re trying to live in it for the sake of the performance, of your character… it’s impossible to remove yourself from it.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s gaze fell to her hands and she noticed she was toying with her wedding ring, a plain band of gold.</p><p>“I’m a mother before I’m an actress. Everything I do, or have done in my life, is for him. So playing a character where she was just the same, where she was having to live this half-life because her son was taken from her because sometimes boys just die… I thought of my son every day and how lucky I am to have him.”</p><p>Beside her, Jess reached a hand to touch Agatha’s arm and Agatha shot her a quick smile before focusing back on the interviewer.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and watched as Agatha forced her hands to relax, splaying them along the tabletop.</p><p>She wanted to reach for one.</p><p>“Did you speak to anybody going through that type of grief in preparation?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha shifted again and Rio watched her shrug her shoulders, lifting a hand to tuck her hair back behind her ear.</p><p>“It wasn’t my place to use anyone else’s grief.”</p><p>There was a pause where everyone processed and Agatha spoke again, “Really brought the mood down, sorry.”</p><p>Rio smiled at this and caught Agatha’s gaze as she turned to look at her, and in it she noticed a softness she hadn’t seen before.</p><p>Maybe it was the lights, maybe it was Agatha talking about her son, but it was there, and it made Rio want to reach for her, but she didn’t.</p><p>Agatha’s brow arched up a little as if reading Rio’s thoughts but as soon as it happened it was gone, and Rio turned away to focus back in on the questions now sent out across the table.</p><p>The rest of the conversation went easily, with Rio able to make the whole table laugh a handful more times. And by the time it was over, Rio felt more relaxed than she had all day.</p><p>“Nicely done,” a voice beside her, closer than it had been before, said.</p><p>She glanced around just as Alice made it to her side and pressed her lips to her cheek, echoing Agatha’s words unknowingly into her ear as Rio’s gaze met Agatha’s and she watched her stand and walk from the table to find Jennifer.</p><p>Rio swallowed as her gaze dropped briefly to the backs of toned thighs and then turned to Alice to meet her in a hug as she rose to her feet.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice was saying as she pulled away, back in work mode. “Just the photoshoot, then home.”</p><p>Rio groaned internally but was soon hurried along to a waiting makeup artist who was ready to touch up her face and she was chastised for fidgeting a little as she watched Alice disappear off to flirt with Jennifer.</p><p>From her position by the table still, Rio watched as everyone else was poked and prodded by their own members of the crew and she wondered if it was only her who felt like a dress-up doll.</p><p>But her gaze was soon moving inevitably over to Agatha who was on her phone again, oblivious to the three people around her fluffing her hair and touching the makeup up on the tip of her nose.</p><p>She wondered how she felt, if she minded, if she luxuriated in it.</p><p>But her idle daydreams were interrupted when Agatha looked up, as if years of being stared at by strangers in public meant that she could pinpoint exactly who was looking at her.</p><p>They locked eyes.</p><p>And Rio saw, or thought she saw, Agatha’s gaze drop from her eyes, moving significantly further south, then further south still.</p><p>And then, was she looking at her ankle?</p><p>“Rio,” a voice made her startle and she turned around quickly to see a man in a headset smiling expectantly at her, “Your turn. We’re doing individual shots then the group.”</p><p>Rio only nodded and turned to follow him, knowing that in just seconds she wouldn’t be alone, and sure enough Alice was suddenly at her side, clutching her hand and swinging it lightly between them.</p><p>“I might be in there, you know.”</p><p>“In where? Jennifer’s-…?”</p><p>“<em>Don’t.</em>”</p><p>Rio laughed and dropped Alice’s hand when she was ushered into the centre of the small space designated for the photographer.</p><p>A younger PA ran over to Rio as she was positioned and posed by the friendly photographer and Rio noticed a crowd form close by, the red outfits of her fellow actresses standing out against the typical black and white uniforms of the crew members designed to blend in.</p><p>“We’ll be filming too. Don’t be shy about moving.”</p><p>“Music, Miss Vidal? Anything you want?”</p><p>“Something heavy. Loud.”</p><p>The small PA nodded and scurried off as Rio accepted the last minute adjustments to her lipstick and Alice appeared again in her eyeline, “Big smiles. Wide eyes.”</p><p>“You want me to look insane?”</p><p>“I want you to look beautiful but approachable.”</p><p>“I think if you try for approachable you often end up manic.”</p><p>“Fine. Do whatever you want.”</p><p>Rio grinned and forced a grin out of her best friend too, but quickly softened her smile when she realised she was making the poor makeup artist’s life a bit harder.</p><p>“I’ll smile and think of being on the couch later, okay?”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Rio scoffed lightly as Alice spun on her heel and Rio watched her head back to Jennifer who was now just behind one of the large lights, stood directly by Agatha.</p><p>Rio chose to ignore the fact that Agatha Harkness of all people had come to watch the show and instead she concentrated on the photographer, where she wanted her, what poses and angles she’d like, and she did as she was told, shifting positions and trying to make her movements as fluid as possible.</p><p>It was over before Rio had even thought it had really begun and she was ushered off the set to be replaced by Isla who still looked nervous.</p><p>Wanda grabbed Rio just as she was making a beeline for Alice.</p><p>“Hey, I’m starved. Want to grab something from crafty with me?”</p><p>Rio was a little taken aback by this request but nodded all the same and shot Alice a look before she followed Wanda to the little table to the side full of food.</p><p>“Forget how to walk in heels? What’s going on with your foot?”</p><p>So that’s why Wanda wanted her alone.</p><p>Rio grimaced.</p><p>“God, is it that obvious?”</p><p>Rio glanced down at her ankle and couldn’t see that it looked any different to her other but she could feel the strain, and it was getting worse the more she stood.</p><p>“Well you fell earlier when I moved away and I overheard,” she reached for a cannoli the size of her hand, “Harkness was asking Alice about it.”</p><p>Rio paused, her one hand now hovering over the danishes. “Agatha was asking? Asking Alice? My Alice?”</p><p>“Mm,” Wanda shrugged, completely unaware of Rio’s internal struggle now she was tucking into her pistachio cannoli. “Yeah. Asked if you’d fallen.”</p><p>Rio blinked stupidly, looking down at the plate of food just beneath her fingertips and then forgetting it completely as she turned to look back over at where Alice stood with Jen and Agatha, now too far away for them to be able to hear any conversation.</p><p>“That’s…” Rio mumbled, almost to herself, but Wanda was leaning behind her and grabbing more food for herself.</p><p>“Aren’t you eating? Don’t let me eat it all alone.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and forced herself to focus in on the plethora of food available to her but now she wasn’t so hungry.</p><p>“Yeah. Sorry. I haven’t eaten all day.”</p><p>Had she been stumbling about the place and she’d not noticed? Had she grimaced every time she took a step?</p><p>But Wanda was holding up a piece of cheese to her mouth and she had no choice but to take it, grateful that she’d been forced to but still feeling less than hungry.</p><p>A soft clearing of a throat nearby made Rio turn with Wanda’s hand still hovering in the air by her lips, now holding a half-bitten piece of cheese and Rio began to choke on the piece she’d bitten off.</p><p>Agatha had clearly watched the interaction, and Rio was mortified to have been caught being fed by another actress, even if the other actress in question was just Wanda.</p><p>Surely it had looked innocent enough. Surely it hadn’t looked like Rio were flirting or being less than professional on a set.</p><p>But Wanda’s hand came down hard on her upper back and Rio spluttered a little more as she caught her breath again and swallowed down the piece of cheddar that had betrayed her so.</p><p>“Dodgy ankle <em>and</em> choking in one day? Bad things come in threes,” Wanda warned with a soft smile as she rubbed Rio’s back gently.</p><p>“Great. Thanks. Great.”</p><p>Releasing a laugh, Wanda returned her attention to her cannoli, green eyes darting to Agatha who was now the other side of Rio and picking up an apple.</p><p>Rio grabbed a bottle of water from the back of the table and cleared her throat roughly, “I should go back to Alice.”</p><p>“Careful on the ankle there, doll. Need some help?”</p><p>Rio froze momentarily, and even Wanda beside her looked a little surprised, but she managed to keep her cool and didn’t turn to the woman who’d offered her help, barely even acknowledging it as she shook her head once, shot Wanda a small smile, and then as gracefully as she could she strode back over to Alice.</p><p>Rio could feel eyes on her as she walked away and she assumed it was both Agatha <em>and</em> Wanda, but she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>Either way, she was embarrassed enough that she didn’t want to see either of them again.</p><p>But Alice was busy flirting with Jen and so Rio had to make do with hanging by the crew, and soon enough settling in the back with a worried Isla and an easy breezy Jess to discuss how everything had gone.</p><p>By the time they were all called to the group shots, Rio had managed to speak to Alice about requesting she would be able to sit and so she sat first as everyone moved around her, being practically manhandled into position.</p><p>Soon enough, Rio had a nervous photographer’s assistant adjust the hem of her dress just so on her thighs she became aware of a presence beside her that was beginning to feel oddly familiar but no more welcome.</p><p>Agatha had been positioned by her left side, standing so Rio’s head were at her chest level and Rio felt suddenly like a sweaty teenager beside the head cheerleader in some random flush of fortune in French class.</p><p>Before she knew what was happening, her arm had been taken and draped around Agatha’s waist, and Rio felt dizzy when Agatha moved, without anyone instructing her to, closer to her.</p><p>She felt her hand rest gently on her upper back and Rio flexed her fingers subconsciously in the dip between Agatha’s waist and her hip.</p><p>It was too intimate, too close to be to anyone who up until that day Rio hadn’t exchanged more than five words with in eight years.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t protested and no one had made a fuss, so Rio remained still, though her body burned her from the inside out.</p><p>“You should ice it,” Agatha said quietly after one or two photos were snapped and then people ran in to adjust the actresses all grouped together.</p><p>“It’ll swell.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything for a second but, given there were now at least five people with hair and makeup brushes around them, she slowly turned to look up at Agatha, shifting back a little and causing Agatha’s hand to move against her upper back.</p><p>“How did you-…?”</p><p>“You’re not that good an actress.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly, watching as Agatha Harkness turned slowly to look down at her, her expression was impassive, almost bored, until Rio caught her jaw flexing slightly and she turned away again.</p><p>“Observant,” Rio muttered quietly, but Agatha obviously heard it because she shifted on the spot and Rio turned back around to watch the camera being setup again.</p><p>Someone came by her and moved her hand on Agatha’s waist, making her fingers curl more around it so they’d be visible in the shot.</p><p>She felt the warmth of Agatha’s body against her own and the scent of her perfume and was reminded of what had happened earlier.</p><p>“You set me up.”</p><p>“Pardon me?”</p><p>“In hair and makeup. You set me up with Grace’s name.”</p><p>There was silence for a few seconds and Rio tilted her head a little as someone came to dab some glitter across her exposed sternum.</p><p>Agatha had clearly been waiting until they were more alone again.</p><p>“A harmless prank.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but didn’t say anything else, though she’d made up her mind that Agatha was just a bitch.</p><p>A ridiculously hot one.</p><p>“Smile everyone! Have fun with it!”</p><p>She schooled her face and focused in, moving her face only slightly with each shot taken to make sure they got all the optimal angles.</p><p>“She calls me ‘Aggie’,” Rio heard from above her, and she turned to look back at Agatha with a frown.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Grace. I’ve worked with her a few times and every time she calls me ‘Aggie’. I hate it. So… I saw the opportunity and I took it. Hollywood’s ‘golden child’ forgetting her name in front of everyone. She won’t forget that soon.”</p><p>It was as cruel as it was genius.</p><p>But Rio still wasn’t thrilled to have been a pawn in this game.</p><p>“Can’t you just ask her to not call you ‘Aggie’?”</p><p>“I have. Hasn’t sunk in. Might do now, though. People don’t like to be called by the wrong name.”</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Agatha turned as the flashes were still going off and dazzled down at Rio.</p><p>It was as mesmerising as it was earth-shattering.</p><p>And Rio forgot how to breathe.</p><p>She turned away and felt the flush across her whole body.</p><p>She <em>hated</em> Agatha Harkness.</p><p>But another break. Another pause for Jess to have her dress adjusted and Sylvia to remove a necklace that was apparently bothering her.</p><p>Rio turned to see Wanda and Isla chatting and she smiled at the sight of the younger actress clearly more relaxed.</p><p>Maybe it was that she had her fellow actresses so close that they felt like a group, maybe it was that the photographer had been shouting compliments at them all as she shot them, maybe it was that Wanda had a gentle voice and a softer smile, either way, Rio was pleased.</p><p>“She’s pretty,” a voice said somewhere above her and Rio stiffened again, once more made aware of who she was holding.</p><p>She turned from Wanda and Isla and looked around at Agatha, arching a brow slightly at the implication, “You think?”</p><p>“You know she is.”</p><p>Rio released a laugh and had to pull back, unable to think straight when this close to acting royalty, when this close to Agatha.</p><p>“I do,” she said as if it were obvious, because why was Agatha telling her this.</p><p>Her hand was now somewhere in the region of the middle of Agatha’s lower back, but hovering so her fingers were just lightly grazing the fabric instead of pressing close.</p><p>Agatha only nodded, her blue eyes somehow steelier than before, looking from Rio’s confused and slightly bewildered face to Wanda and back again.</p><p>But Rio’s hand was once again taken and she had no time to process this reaction.</p><p>Her hand was placed back around Agatha and she had to shift in to get close again, feeling Agatha’s fingers flex at the top of her upper back.</p><p>A strange feeling had settled in Rio’s stomach as she dutifully smiled for the camera.</p><p>It felt like she’d been caught doing something wrong when in actual fact she’d done nothing wrong at all.</p><p>But soon they were being descended upon again and Rio was asked to slide down to the lower step of the small set of blocks laid out for them.</p><p>She adjusted herself before anyone else could so she was at least decent for a room of people with all eyes on her and the other actresses.</p><p>As she shifted her hips to tug her dress down a little more over her thighs she felt her arm being lifted and placed down on something warm and solid and she looked around to see a shaking assistant adjusting her arm over Agatha Harkness’s lap.</p><p>It looked like a surrealist painting.</p><p>In that Agatha was art and touching her didn’t feel real.</p><p>Rio’s arms were covered in the sparkly red material of her dress and her arm was being moved centimetre by centimetre up and down Agatha’s thigh as if each movement would make or break the photo.</p><p>The assistant looked distressed and uncomfortable and Rio leant up to place her free hand on her wrist to reassure her, “This is fine. We’ll make it work, thank you.”</p><p>Rio received a grateful smile in return for her kindness and the assistant moved over to the next person to begin moving them around.</p><p>Clearly she’d been just as flustered by touching Agatha as Rio felt.</p><p>Rio watched for a second before she turned her head up to look at Agatha with a slightly amused grin, fighting her instincts to look down at the expanse of skin before her for fear she’d faint where she sat.</p><p>“This okay?”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to say something else but decided not to, choosing instead to turn back around and face front, adjusting her arm on Agatha’s lap so it was touching as little of her skin as possible.</p><p>But her hand was taken suddenly and Rio assumed it was by the assistant again.</p><p>She turned and saw that it was instead Agatha who had taken it, who had slipped her fingers between Rio’s and placed her hand on Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“This okay?” Agatha parroted back to her and Rio thought she’d heard a hesitance in her tone, but she was so distracted by the sight of her hand in Agatha’s that she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>“Fine,” she managed to utter, turning quickly before she could lose her   mind entirely and pull her hand away.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s other hand sit on her shoulder and Rio wondered what in the fresh hell had happened that this was how she’d end her day, hand in hand with Agatha Harkness for all the world to see.</p><p>Because this wasn’t just happening now.</p><p>This would happen over and over again for months to come.</p><p>When new people picked up <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> magazine.</p><p>Or people watched the video.</p><p>Or Rio thought about how Agatha’s hand felt above her own.</p><p>Because Agatha’s hand was warm and and soft where it curled around Rio, her palm pressed down against the back of Rio’s hand, her fingers  slipped between Rio’s, filling the spaces Rio had never until now considered to be lacking something.</p><p>Just empty gaps waiting for Agatha to fill.</p><p>But then Rio suddenly worried that her hand was too warm and soon enough she’d be sweating over an Oscar-winner.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t pull away, didn’t move a single muscle where she was touching Rio and so Rio didn’t move either.</p><p>She’d lost to Agatha already today, she wouldn’t lose again.</p><p>Only once did her hold on Agatha drop, when the photographer herself came over to adjust Rio’s dress and Rio moved her hold from Agatha’s hand.</p><p>That strange feeling of her hand feeling suddenly less than surfaced and she stretched her fingers out subconsciously, trying to return to her previous equilibrium.</p><p>But when Rio was as perfect as could be, Agatha squeezed her shoulder and Rio glanced around to see her hand waiting just above her knee, expectant that she’d return to their previous hold.</p><p>Rio hesitated for only a second before she lay her palm down on Agatha’s knee and splayed her fingers so Agatha could hold her there again, and this time, with her hand now feeling strangely whole again, Rio felt a jolt somewhere in the pit of her stomach as Agatha’s thumb brushed over her own.</p><p>The shoot didn’t last much longer, which was a mercy as far as Rio was concerned; she wasn’t sure she could take much more of the infuriating woman she’d had a crush on for almost a decade.</p><p>But when it did end, Rio thought she was going mad for the girls around her beginning to move, to switch positions, to relax their posture and adjust themselves, and only Agatha stayed still.</p><p>Her left hand fell from Rio’s shoulder but her right stayed on Rio’s right, and even as Rio shifted to respond to a question from Wanda, and she heard Agatha above her talking to Sylvia, Agatha hadn’t removed her hand.</p><p>Wanda was asking about drinks with everyone after the shoot but Rio felt like she was floating above them somewhere, watching as Agatha Harkness quite literally held her hand.</p><p>But, no. She had to be realistic and not dissolve into a fantasy.</p><p>If she moved it she could steal her hand back. It wasn’t as if Agatha were gripping her. In fact, it was more like resting. She was <em>resting</em> her hand over Rio’s, it was innocent, uncomplicated, thoughtless.</p><p>And so Rio turned more and shifted her hand, twisting it slightly from under Agatha’s grip and for just a second Agatha responded, she’d held on, and then released.</p><p>Rio had her hand back, and regretted immediately having pulled away in the first place.</p><p>Just as she was agreeing to Wanda’s suggestion of drinks, she glanced round at Agatha and saw that the actress once again looked impassive, looked neutral, and wasn’t looking at her.</p><p>And so Rio shook it off. She shook it off like the memory of Agatha one hazy night in a grim Chicago bar.</p><p>She turned back to Wanda and smiled, this time without having to pretend, “Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>Preparations for Cannes were in full swing and Rio had never felt less prepared in her life.</p><p>Thank god for Alice.</p><p>Thank god for her loyal, guard dog of a best friend.</p><p>They’d somehow hit the big time where everyone wanted Rio, everyone wanted to dress Rio, to bedeck her in jewels, to paint her face in the best makeup, to style her hair with products and using techniques neither of them had ever even heard of.</p><p>And while Rio was prodded and poked and measured and draped in all this finery, Alice was on hand to make sure it wasn’t too much.</p><p>That the Versace gowns weren’t making Rio feel uncomfortable.</p><p>That the brilliant diamonds offered to her weren’t giving her anxiety about how much they cost or the various ways Rio could lose or break them.</p><p>That the people rouging her cheeks were the kind of people you’d want nearby for hours every day, the kind of people who’d touch your makeup up without making a fuss.</p><p>Because, really, Rio’s success was Alice’s success.</p><p>She wouldn’t be here without her.</p><p>It had been Alice who’d jumped in one night after one of their improv shows where a seedy looking guy had approached Rio offering to manage her.</p><p>It had sparked the idea in Alice’s head that the way to crack this showbiz world was to get serious.</p><p>So she’d pretended to be Rio’s manager until she no longer had to pretend.</p><p>Until Rio picked up the first proper gig she auditioned for and started to earn just enough that she could support the two of them in a one bed studio apartment in a less than desirable area of downtown LA.</p><p>But it was something. And it was home to them both for over a year.</p><p>Then more jobs came, and more money with them, and soon they were in a bigger apartment where they had their own rooms.</p><p>Then Alice was able to move out into her own apartment.</p><p>Then Rio helped her buy it and bought one for herself.</p><p>And so on until they were both lying across the large couch in the middle of Rio’s new house, both scrolling through their phones, one working, the other swiping through a dating app.</p><p>“You better stop that, you know.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“You’re a serious actress now. Serious actresses don’t have sex.”</p><p>Rio laughed: “Well this serious actress does. Or at least is trying to.”</p><p>She turned her phone around and leant up suddenly, grinning at Alice, “She’s cute, right? A surgeon! Mom would be so proud.”</p><p>“Your <em>mom</em> would only be proud if you <em>married</em> a surgeon. Are you looking to marry this woman?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and flopped back down again, scrolling through the pretty brunette surgeon’s Raya profile, “Maybe. Not immediately, obviously. But if we got on and-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said with just a hit of exhaustion in her voice, “maybe after you win your Oscar you can think about settling down.”</p><p>Rio paused her scrolling and looked to the ceiling for a second before she sat back up again, “are you saying that as my best friend or as the woman I pay to manage my career?”</p><p>“Both?”</p><p>“Both?” Rio asked in confusion, frowning down where Alice rested her head back against the arm of the couch. “Didn’t you once say that being single worked in my favour because-…”</p><p>“Because it meant you didn’t have any problems travelling and working away, yeah. But… I think it would help your brand if… y’know you settled a bit. And also… you’re not cut out for being alone.”</p><p>Rio blinked, stupefied by the sudden damning indictment of her career and personality.</p><p>“I can be alone,” she said lamely, frowning a little now where she sat. She reached for Alice’s wrist and forced her to put her phone down.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said with a gentle sigh, mirroring Rio’s position now as she sat up and stretched her legs to the side of Rio’s hips.</p><p>“That first week you moved in here, how many girls did you have over?”</p><p>“I-…” Rio bit down on her lip and watched Alice for a second before she relented, “Seven.”</p><p>“One every night so you wouldn’t be alone.”</p><p>“That’s not-… I was just ovulating or something. I was horny.”</p><p>Alice smiled a little and reached to take Rio’s hand, “Hey, it’s not a <em>bad</em> thing. It’s actually very sweet if you ignore the fact that you’re a bit of a-…”</p><p>“Fuck off,” Rio said quickly, though she’d relaxed just a little and smiled as she squeezed Alice’s hand. “I can be alone.”</p><p>“I know it’s hard to find someone when you’re away all the time but-…”</p><p>“It’s impossible, Alice. You know that. Seems all glamorous at first and then people realise what a drag it is.”</p><p>Alice nodded in understanding and looked down at their hands still entwined together, “I know. But it’ll happen one day. You’ll find some absolute knockout who doesn’t mind you being away for weeks at a time.”</p><p>“Do I want to be with someone who doesn’t mind me being away from them?”</p><p>“I think it would be impossible to find someone who wouldn’t prefer a little distance from you.”</p><p>Back to teasing, Rio thought with a small smile, and she squeezed Alice’s hand with a playful wriggle of it, “Charming, thank you. Hope you’re putting those vibes out to the press: ‘Rio Vidal: good for a while but gets annoying.”</p><p>“It’s actually the subhead of the <em>Vanity Fair</em> piece.”</p><p>Rio hummed in amusement and released Alice’s hand to drop back down again, “After Cannes I won’t have any time for girls anyway. So might as well make the most of the time I <em>do</em> have now.”</p><p>“Fine. Get it out of your system because you cannot be seen to be picking up women in the middle of a film festival.”</p><p>“That’s fine,” Rio said absently, throwing away Alice’s chastisement with a wave of her hand, “I don’t speak french anyway.”</p><p>Alice scoffed and nudged Rio’s hip with her foot and Rio smiled as she continued to swipe through the options available to her in her little app, pushing back the worry that maybe Alice was right, maybe what she did need was someone to come home to at night, someone to be there.</p><p>But Awards Season waits for no woman and that night on the couch with Alice was the last night of freedom until they flew out to Cannes the following week.</p><p>A team had been assembled to sort even Rio’s outfit for the plane ride over and Rio felt more than a little embarrassed that she was being instructed exactly what to wear for a long haul flight.</p><p>Usually she’d wear a comfortable pair of leggings and a sweater.</p><p>This time around she was in a soft cashmere t-shirt and tan slacks that admittedly were very comfortable.</p><p>She’d insisted she didn’t want any makeup though, and Alice had helped her case on this one, preferring not to be sat next to a complaining Rio if she were made to wear makeup all the way to France.</p><p>She looked effortless and chic, which was the whole point of the hours long meeting she’d had with her new stylist on her festival looks.</p><p>She looked like a movie star.</p><p>And she was greeted like one when they finally landed on the concourse at Cannes Mandelieu.</p><p>Alice had warned her there may be more press than she was used to and so it wasn’t a huge surprise when she was practically blinded by the lights of a thousand cameras as she stepped through the airport arrivals and out into the heat of the day.</p><p>Alice hurried her through, constantly close and as protective as always as she helped Rio get to their waiting car.</p><p>They slipped inside and Rio felt suddenly like she could breathe again as the door slammed shut and they had at least a barrier between them and the dozens of men with cameras trying to capture Rio Vidal’s first entrance to a film festival.</p><p>“Intense,” Rio breathed out, hiding wide eyes behind large sunglasses.</p><p>“You did good,” Alice reassured with a smile, checking their baggage had been placed in the trunk securely before she turned to the driver and told him to go.</p><p>“You too,” Rio said with a smile, squeezing Alice’s thigh briefly in acknowledgement that this was also Alice’s first time at an overseas film festival.</p><p>They grinned at each other and Rio found it easy to relax.</p><p>This was the stuff she hated but could manage.</p><p>This was the stuff that people said she was good at.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t exactly prepared for the circus that was to follow.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she muttered as they pulled up to the Carlton Cannes.</p><p>“Alice,” Rio said urgently, turning to her best friend with hidden wide eyes beneath her sunglasses.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“I know. It’s okay. They won’t be allowed in. Wait there. I’ll come round and get you and we rush you in.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, feeling a strange mixture of disbelief, horror, and like she were being pranked.</p><p>The paps liked to get her when she was out on a run, a couple times they’d caught her out for dinner with a friend, with Alice, even with her parents, but she’d never had to deal with a hoard of them.</p><p>But the rowdiness of the paparazzi crowd with nothing until Rio Vidal stepped from her carriage of choice and entered into the swarm.</p><p>They were hungry sharks and she was the chum.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>“Rio! Over here, sweetheart!”</p><p>“Bienvenue a Cannes, Rio!”</p><p>Rio kept her head down, angled to where she could just about spot her feet through the sudden flashes and movement, and Alice crowded her to the left whilst a footman from the hotel rushed to her aide at the right, creating space for her to be able to slip through the crowd and reach the peace of the opulent lobby.</p><p>She breathed out and thanked the doorman with a soft word in French and then squeezed her friend’s arm as she walked with her to the reception desk.</p><p>It felt a little like being royalty for the day, or like she’d won a competition.</p><p>Everyone was thrilled to see her, everyone was happy for her to be there in their hotel, in their little town.</p><p>Of course, being a movie star came with its advantages.</p><p>The pretty receptionist smiled at Rio and greeted her in French before slipping into accented English.</p><p>“Bienvenue, Mademoiselle Vidal. I trust you had a good flight?”</p><p>“It was great, thank you. Your hotel is beautiful.”</p><p>“I’d be happy to give you a tour once you’re settled in, Mademoiselle.”</p><p>Alice cleared her throat quietly and whispered, “Basta.” <em>Stop</em>.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t respond because the blonde and blue eyed receptionist was now checking over her details and Rio who wouldn’t have even considered properly flirting with the pretty young woman now just wanted to do it to annoy Alice.</p><p>But her train of thought was interrupted as Alice placed her passport on the side and a loud American voice rang through the lobby.</p><p>“Alice, be still my beating heart.”</p><p>Rio, who had been in the process of fishing out her own passport, turned to see Jennifer Kale, standing a few feet away with her arms open wide and a brilliant smile across her perfect features.</p><p>“Jen,” Alice said a little more demurely, with no less enthusiasm.</p><p>She stepped away from Rio and went over to exchange two kisses with Jennifer, one on each cheek.</p><p><em>French already,</em> Rio thought with a smirk.</p><p>But her attention was back on the receptionist who was now taking the passports to check over details.</p><p>A holiday romance was exactly what Alice deserved and Rio now regretted their choice to share a suite together. Alice had said it would be easier for prepping to be in close proximity and not have to worry about running across the hall all the time.</p><p>Plus, the fact that the Movie Studio were funding this trip meant that Rio could demand practically what she wanted but Alice would be left with the dregs.</p><p>So Rio had demanded a two bedroom suite.</p><p>It was the least she could do.</p><p>And so, once the details were confirmed, and Rio had received more than a handful more smiles from the receptionist, she was directed towards the elevator where a snappily dressed concierge was waiting.</p><p>“Your bags are waiting for you in your suite, Mademoiselle.”</p><p>“Rio, s’il vous plait,” Rio purred with a grin, deciding a little flirt wouldn’t hurt to start the day off right. “Merci, Camille.”</p><p>The receptionist ducked her head a little and Rio knew if she pushed it she could maybe get a number, maybe ask her for that tour later, but she felt a hand on her arm and turned to see Alice smiling at her.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio shot the woman behind the counter one last movie star grin before she turned away, pocketing their passports and the room keys as she did.</p><p>“Jen wants to go grab a coffee before the madness starts later. I could really use the caffeine hit. Would you mind?”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and glanced over at Jen who was watching them closely.</p><p>Rio shot her a small smile which was returned but then Jen’s eyes dropped to her watch and Rio looked back to Alice. The woman wasn’t subtle.</p><p>“Sure. No problem. I’ll take a shower and see you later?”</p><p>“Great,” Alice said with a relieved grin, as if she’d ever thought Rio would demand she stay.</p><p>She squeezed Rio’s arm in goodbye and then moved back over to Jen and motioned for them to leave together.</p><p>Rio watched this for a second and felt a slight pang of jealousy that had nothing to do with Jennifer and everything to do with the fact that she was left alone to check out their joined suite in the fanciest hotel in the fanciest of places.</p><p>But she picked herself back up quickly when she approached the concierge and found herself once again greeted like the movie star she was.</p><p>“Bonjour, mademoiselle. I am here to take you to your suite.”</p><p>“Merci,” she said with a smile, turning then as the elevator dinged lightly. Even the bells here sounded angelic.</p><p>She and the concierge stepped aside a little when it was clear the elevator was already occupied and Rio’s stomach did a flip when she saw by whom.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was stepping out in a matching white linen suit and large Chanel sunglasses on top her mane of wild hair.</p><p>But it wasn’t just Agatha.</p><p>The man Rio knew to be her husband was with her. Recognisable from the photos she’d seen of him on magazine covers, from the internet, and from across the room at industry parties.</p><p>He was tall, dark, and handsome, everything you’d expect in the man married to one of the most famous actresses in the world.</p><p>And Rio hated that they looked good together.</p><p>But they did.</p><p>Ralph Bohner inclined his head slightly at her and Rio smiled back, but her attention was once again on Agatha who’d stepped back slightly from her husband who - Rio noted - had stepped from the elevator first.</p><p>
<em>Prick.</em>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Was Agatha’s smile genuine? Was she as pleased to see her as she looked?</p><p>Rio had to remain objective, though suddenly she feared the thirteen hour flight had made her look less than brilliant compared to Agatha’s current, glamorous state.</p><p>She cursed herself for refusing to wear makeup.</p><p>But she had one thing in her back pocket that could claw back some power for her, something that now felt like an inside joke, some tiny semblance of a common ground between them.</p><p>And now, feeling a little on the back foot being caught all alone in the presence of Agatha and her asshole of a financier husband, she used it.</p><p>“Aggie Harkness,” she beamed, watching as Agatha’s eyes widened slightly and then narrowed, a slow smirk creeping up her features as she took Rio in.</p><p>They stood like two cowboys in a vintage western, sizing each other up, seeing who would draw first, though Rio had flashed her piece already.</p><p>“Agatha,” the husband was saying, as Rio’s own charge - the concierge - waited patiently for whatever Rio wanted to do.</p><p>Rio glanced at him and saw that he looked less than impressed with whatever his wife was doing talking to another actress when he wanted a croissant on the waterfront.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t even flinched and as Rio glanced back at her she saw she was still being assessed, and her brow quirked a little, amused that she’d won a point so soon in their first interaction since the Roundtable shoot.</p><p>“You’re cute,” Agatha concluded, after what to Rio felt like minutes of a standoff that can’t have been longer than ten seconds. “Call me that again and you’ll regret it.”</p><p>“Threats before midday? Très chic.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes again but Rio caught her lips twitching at the sides and she fought the urge to kiss Agatha there, wondering if she could get away with a French two cheek kiss, accidentally brushing the lips of the most famous woman in Cannes right now.</p><p>“Au revoir, honey,” Agatha purred, giving Rio no chance to act out her fantasy and before she could even blink again, Agatha had turned from her and was sauntering through the lobby with her husband.</p><p>Rio released a soft breath and stepped into the elevator, wondering if she were imagining the lingering soft scent of Agatha’s perfume in it.</p><p>The concierge pressed the button and just as the doors began to close Rio looked up and saw Agatha turning back to her from across the lobby.</p><p>They made eye contact and Rio suddenly wished she’d tried something because maybe, just maybe, Agatha wouldn’t have protested.</p><p>But then the doors closed and Agatha was lost to her.</p><p>The length of the elevator ride to the top floor of the hotel was all the time it took for Rio to rid herself of her silly schoolgirl fantasy. Agatha had no more romantic interest in her than she did in the concierge standing beside her.</p><p>Although, she supposed, he was at least a man, so maybe in the battle for Agatha’s heart he had a total advantage.</p><p>But as the elevator pulled to a gentle stop on her floor, she was led out to a large and beautiful lobby and to the third door on the right.</p><p>The Katara Suite.</p><p>“Welcome to your new home for the week, mademoiselle Vidal.”</p><p>Rio stepped inside as the concierge opened the door for her and tried to school her face into what would be an appropriate reaction for a sophisticated movie stair.</p><p>The suite was more beautiful than even the pictures on line had led her to believe and she wished Alice were here to take it in with her.</p><p>The concierge took her on a tour of the space, showing her the grand shared living area with large curved couches and a view of the water beyond. He took her to both bedrooms and pointed out the bathrooms attached to each and the features therein.</p><p>And lastly, he took her to the balcony and presented the full view of the waterfront, proudly evidencing his hotel’s greatest asset.</p><p>When he’d had assurance enough from Rio that she would be fine and didn’t need anything else, she sent him on his way with a large tip and a bright smile and finally, finally she were alone to run around the suite again, taking in everything she’d missed upon first viewing.</p><p>With Alice gone, she had the luxury of picking the best room and soon found herself situated on the balcony after a long shower with a seltzer and fresh lime courtesy of the free bar just off the main living space.</p><p>Rio Vidal was on top of the world.</p><p>Her gaze drifted across the sea of deepest blue before her and as she watched the sun dazzle the waves with its shine she felt a deep calm washing over her.</p><p>She’d built this. Her and Alice. They’d worked their asses off to get here and now here they were.</p><p>But as Rio’s gaze drifted along the balcony she couldn’t help but notice that it wasn’t the two of them.</p><p>It was just her.</p><p>And she felt a sudden, unexpected melancholy as she looked at the seat beside her, free of another person there to enjoy this with.</p><p>It clutched at her heart in a way she couldn’t shake even as she finished her drink and heard the telltale signs of her best friend arriving into their little piece of paradise high above the streets of Cannes.</p><p>“Holy shit!”</p><p>Rio laughed as she appeared at the door to the balcony, grinning at Alice, shaking off the surprising loneliness for the sake of her best friend, “None of that language, please. We’re <em>sophisticated</em> now.”</p><p>“I mean though,” Alice said with her eyes wide and her mouth open, her sunglasses perched atop her head, “<em>holy</em> shit.”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio agreed as she marched across to take Alice’s hand and drag her to the balcony to show off the view like a proud mother introducing her baby to the world. “You’ve said that.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Alice continued to be gobsmacked for at least another ten minutes as Rio trailed behind her on her many rounds of sightseeing around the huge suite.</p><p>And Alice didn’t even complain that Rio had taken the largest room because, <em>holy shit</em>, her room was huge too.</p><p>Once Rio’s patience for her friend’s shock had died down entirely she changed the subject from “how much do you think these cushions cost?” to “how did it go with Jen?”.</p><p>Alice’s expression changed on a dime.</p><p>She went from bemused to shy in the flash of an eye.</p><p>“Good. We just had a coffee and… yeah. Good.”</p><p>“Good? Just good? No make out sessions by the water? No leg touching under the table? No-…”</p><p>“Stop it. We’re taking it slow. I’m not even sure she likes me.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Who wouldn’t?”</p><p>Alice shrugged slyly and then buried her face in her hands for just a second before she removed them again and stood assertively, “Okay. We have about ten minutes before everyone arrives. You need to look incredible for the opening party.”</p><p>“Are you saying I <em>don’t</em> already?” Rio asked as she looked down at herself in her ‘Delaware Diva’ t-shirt Alice had bought her one Christmas years ago and the denim shorts she’d owned since she was about seventeen.</p><p>Who said a sophisticated actress couldn’t wear her most comfortable clothes in her most fancy suite?</p><p>“Actually, I want you to change. You can’t get ready in that. It wouldn’t look good on socials.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, “Surely it makes me look down to earth. Normal.”</p><p>“You are not down to earth and normal, you are premiering your movie at Cannes.”</p><p>“I’m not changing, Alice. Three outfits in one day is more than enough.”</p><p>Alice sighed but knew Rio well enough to know not to argue. “Fine. Appeal to the masses. Charm them with your normalcy.”</p><p>Rio laughed and threw a cushion in Alice’s direction. She caught it with ease and looked down at it with a sudden frown as she tested the weight in her hands. “I’m gonna guess about $250.”</p><p>“Wrong,” Rio said with a grin as she stood to go and place her phone on charge in the other room, speaking over her shoulder as she left, “I looked it up earlier. $400.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Not ten minutes later, as Alice had predicted, the suite was abuzz with noise and movement.</p><p>SZA was blasting from a speaker someone had brought with them and Rio was being prodded, poked, pulled, and pressed into the glamorous starlet she needed to be.</p><p>Alice was somewhere nearby, out of Rio’s eyeline as she diligently reviewed the plans for the day.</p><p>And Rio, Rio was being plied with champagne though Alice had insisted no more than two glasses before they left, Rio’s new hairdresser, a fun new friend called Miguel, had on more than one occasion topped Rio’s glass up when Alice wasn’t looking.</p><p>Rio’s buzz meant that she was relaxed as she let the artists work their magic on her.</p><p>It was just a red carpet, sure it would be one of the busiest she was yet to walk, one of the most important, perhaps the <em>most</em> important of her career to date, but she could handle it.</p><p>What was a quick walk amongst thousands of screaming members of the press?</p><p>It took close to three hours for each member of the glam squad to be fully satisfied with their transformation of Rio Vidal.</p><p>And in that time they’d turned her from attractive to bombshell.</p><p>Her nails, hair, face, lips, and even body had transformed.</p><p>Alice had wolf-whistled more times than she could count and taken more photos than Rio thought necessary, but she didn’t mind. She lived for this sort of thing. The compliments weren’t unwelcome.</p><p>By the time she was dressed and had the most uncomfortable shoes she’d ever worn slipped onto her feet, she felt ready. Four glasses of champagne more than likely helping with this.</p><p>Rio had been dressed for the first night at Cannes by Louis Vuitton, a last minute switch from her preferred option of Versace.</p><p>But she didn’t mind when the dress looked and felt this good on her.</p><p>It had a longer train that she was used to but moved easily in the heat of the evening.</p><p>It was a deep burgundy, covered in sparkling diamantés that glittered every which way she turned. It had a plunging neckline and an equal plunge at the back, with see-through strips of fabric along the plains of her tanned back up to her shoulders.</p><p>It was a movie star dress.</p><p>She’d arrived.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said after a few moments taken to get a few more snaps of Rio for her instagram before they ventured into the madness. “Remember, red carpet, stairs, top of stairs, home straight, okay? Then party. We’re scheduled with the rest of the cast so you’ll have friendly faces.”</p><p>“Yep,” Rio said absently, toying with the bangle hanging around her wrist that must have been worth more than three months’ rent of her first apartment. “Easy.”</p><p>“Breezy, beautiful,” Alice concluded with a warm smile as she squeezed Rio’s fiddling hand. “You got this.”</p><p>When they entered the lobby together Rio was suddenly reminded of the power of celebrity.</p><p>Everyone was staring.</p><p>Women smiled and men ogled.</p><p>Even as she passed by the familiar face of an actress she didn’t know well but had seen at events like this before, and certainly on the big screen, she smiled but was rushed past by a work-mode Alice who was determined to not be late for their big Cannes debut.</p><p>The same group of paps that had been outside before had somehow quadrupled in size and it took a little longer to get through them even as two of the hotel staff and one of the execs from came to help.</p><p>Rio’s heart was racing so fast she felt like she’d been thrown from a plane without a parachute as she was cautiously delivered into the waiting car.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Alice uttered for the millionth time that day as she slammed the door behind them and they were left in a tinted goldfish bowl of relative peace.</p><p>“You can say that again.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Rio turned to catch Alice’s eye and found herself beaming at her best friend, both thunderstruck by the world they’d managed to find themselves in.</p><p>They remained silent for the rest of the short journey to the entrance to the red carpet, each of them lost to their own disbelief that this was their life now.</p><p>But if Rio had thought outside the hotel was insane, then it was nothing to the red carpet.</p><p>“Focus on faces, remember,” Alice was saying to her in her best therapy speak, “faces, Rio. They’re just people.”</p><p>Rio acknowledged this only with a quick nod before she clambered out of the car, helped by a man in a tux and a headset who had the unenviable job of helping the women out of the cars as they formed a queue to the entrance.</p><p>She placed a smile on her face and only relaxed even slightly when Alice’s hand hit the small of her back and she guided her lightly in the direction of the other waiting cast and crew members.</p><p>It felt better to be with the others now.</p><p>She wasn’t facing the sea of screaming press alone.</p><p>But Rio was the star of the movie and the studio’s best shot at awards so she was ushered to the front, made to walk the carpet first.</p><p>She took it in her stride, pretending to feel as confident and elegant as she looked.</p><p>She could barely see for the flashes of cameras and heard nothing but her name being shouted from every way she turned. But she posed, and she smiled, she winked and she waved.</p><p>She nailed it.</p><p>By the time she hit the bottom of the large staircase at the top of the carpet, her director was there to greet her, taking each of her hands in his and kissing them in a display for the cameras as well as a means to greet Rio without ruining her makeup.</p><p>“Terrified?” He asked with an indulgent smile.</p><p>“Me? Never.”</p><p>He laughed and turned with her to pose some more until he helped her walk up the stairs where they waited for the others to join them.</p><p>One of the youngest cast members was there and ran to Rio before any of the others, and Rio embraced her fully, pleased of the normal reaction in an otherwise abnormal place.</p><p>Once she’d straightened back up she opened her arms to pose in a line with the others, grinning for all of Cannes to see as she surveyed the fruits of her labours.</p><p>Nowhere did she see Alice, but she knew she’d be close, keeping a watchful eye on her.</p><p>But the photo call was soon over and the little troupe was ushered away to escape the circus and head in to the night’s main event.</p><p>Once inside, before Rio could so much as take a glass of champagne that was offered to her, she found herself surrounded by well-wishers in the form of faces familiar and unfamiliar.</p><p>Even now, it sometimes took her by surprise that people knew her name, let alone wanted to speak with her.</p><p>She was just some kid from Delaware who had dreams of making it big.</p><p>But hands were on her back, touching her arm, taking her hand and lips were brushing her cheeks every which way she turned.</p><p>It took ten minutes until a touch she recognised found her again and Rio turned to Alice with a grin, raising her brows, “So?”</p><p>“Perfect. You looked incredible.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, thinking Alice was being a little hyperbolic but she’d take it for now.</p><p>“Jeunet’s over there,” Alice murmured in a softer tone, stepping a little closer to Rio so she wouldn’t be overheard, “time to schmooze it up with the directors. Come on.”</p><p>Alice took Rio’s hand and Rio obediently followed, slipping easily through the crowds that parted for her and her determined best friend.</p><p>But Alice’s name was suddenly called and it surprised both the aim of the call and Rio, who stopped dead in their tracks and looked around.</p><p>Jen.</p><p>Rio smiled at the sight of Jennifer Kale, leaning back against the large mahogany bar, holding out two glasses of champagne to them both.</p><p>And for the first time that night, Rio wasn’t the one being looked at.</p><p>Jen had eyes only for Alice and Rio knew then that Alice was an idiot to think that Jennifer Kale didn’t have feelings for her.</p><p>No one could mistake that look.</p><p>Alice immediately forgot their mission to schmooze a world-renowned director and turned to pull Rio to Jennifer instead, which made Rio laugh, though Alice missed it through the din of the party.</p><p>“Hi,” she breathed out when they got close enough, self-consciously releasing Rio’s hand as she moved to take one of the glasses offered to her.</p><p>“Looking good, Wu,” Jen said with an appreciative look up and down over Alice’s outfit for the night: a sleek white dress that was simple, understated, and elegant.</p><p>“You look incredible,” Alice offered right back and Rio suddenly felt like a spare part to their little flirt.</p><p>She cleared her throat and glanced over her shoulder to see if she could make a break for it with anyone else she knew.</p><p>“Agatha said she saw you in the lobby earlier, Vidal,” Jen said suddenly and Rio turned to her with raised brows.</p><p>Agatha. In the whirlwind of the past few hours she’d forgotten all about her.</p><p>Her stomach flipped and she ignored it, instead taking the glass of champagne and taking a quick sip. Bubbles helped to calm nerves. It must be scientific or something.</p><p>“She did?”</p><p>Cool enough, disinterested enough. She was an actress for a reason.</p><p>“Mm. You’re on her floor too. She’s just next door.”</p><p>This was news to Rio. News she was very glad she hadn’t been aware of until now.</p><p>“Where is she?” Alice asked curiously, glancing around the throng of people.</p><p>“Oh, she’s been trapped by a couple studio heads. Ralph’s not helping much.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this and was about to fish for more detail on how exactly Mr Agatha Harkness wouldn’t be helping when she felt a touch to her elbow and she turned to see Carol Danvers grinning at her.</p><p>“Hey, you. I have someone I want to introduce you to.”</p><p>Before Rio could even say hi back, she’d leant around her and was addressing Alice with a smile, “Mind if I steal her Alice? You’ll be pleased with me, promise.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes playfully but nodded and Rio knew if Jen weren’t there she’d have insisted on coming with but as it was, she had other priorities.</p><p>Plus, of all Rio’s friends in the industry, Carol was probably the safest bet to be left alone with.</p><p>Straight-laced and well respected, it had taken Rio several bottles of beer and much pleading to get Carol to allow her one cigarette one night on her terrace back in LA. So Alice was more than content to let Rio go play with her for a little while as she flirted some more with Jen.</p><p>Carol only smiled and grabbed Rio’s hand, leading her through the crowds until they arrived at their destination and Rio suddenly wanted to die.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha,” Carol said, reaching to touch the pale skin of a toned arm resting along the side of a black dress.</p><p>Rio could see a sharp little cape visible just beneath the long wavy brunette hair that lay across it down her back. The neckline looked to be high and the fit straight down, with a train a little smaller than Rio’s pooling behind her.</p><p>As Agatha turned, Rio in took a sharp breath, now able to see the look in full.</p><p>The cut was indeed high to her neck, a shallow curve giving just a glimpse of toned traps until the fabric appeared again at her shoulders, creating a little sleeve that connected to the cape Rio had seen from behind.</p><p>The effect was intoxicating.</p><p>The dress hugged Agatha’s body perfectly without showing much of it off at all apart from her arms. And Rio found it hard not to stare at them.</p><p>But Agatha was looking at her now, giving her a once over, once, twice, three times.</p><p>Rio felt hot all of a sudden, embarrassed that it might look like she’d <em>asked</em> Carol to do this.</p><p>“Agatha, have you met my friend Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio wanted to die.</p><p>She saw Agatha’s lips twitch in amusement and saw she was about to answer when a man’s voice entered the fray: “Rio,” he said triumphantly, “that’s it. We saw you in the hotel today. I knew you looked familiar.”</p><p>Rio tore her gaze from Agatha’s and looked up to the man now offering his hand to her. She took it and shook firmly.</p><p>“I’m Ralph, Agatha’s husband.”</p><p>“Pleasure,” Rio said, though the pleasure she’d stated didn’t quite meet her gaze as she stared up into the eyes of the man that was lucky enough to be married to the goddess still standing before her.</p><p>“So you have met?” Carol asked with a smile, “Good. That makes this easier then. Agatha, Rio’s a huge fan.”</p><p>
<em>Oh god.</em>
</p><p>“The night you won the Oscar, we’d only just met, Rio hosted this tiny dinner party and we all sat on the floor crowded around the tiny screen watching the show.”</p><p>“You did, did you?”</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eye again and watched pools of blue sparkle like the sea she’d been looking out over just a few hours ago.</p><p>But then Ralph had moved to snake an arm around his wife and their eye contact dropped as Rio watched this happen with an unwelcome feeling of jealousy flare up in her chest.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t even reacted to it, she was still watching Rio.</p><p>“Anyway, all that to say, I think you guys would be amazing on screen together. You’ve sway, Agatha, anything you think little Rio here could jump in with you on?”</p><p>Rio’s previous state of jealousy faded so suddenly it was like it hadn’t happened.</p><p>She was so mortified that Agatha might think she’d asked Carol to help her get into a movie with her that she couldn’t breathe with it, though she was aware she’d only said one word since arriving to this little corner of the party.</p><p>“Rio Vidal in a movie with me?” Agatha asked with a growing smirk, her gaze still on Rio though Rio was now doing everything in her power not to meet it.</p><p>“Nothing springs to mind but I can keep an eye out. But asking for a friend and not for yourself, Danvers? Didn’t enjoy working with me before?”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, wondering if Agatha were throwing her a bone by moving the focus of the conversation to Carol rather than herself. But she still didn’t dare look at her again as Carol answered with an ease of manner that suggested she actually had enjoyed working with Agatha and even liked her.</p><p>But Rio’s attention was now on Ralph.</p><p>She watched as he swigged his champagne, his hand still resting on Agatha’s hip, his eyes on the crowd, and at a lower vantage point than would suggest he were looking at people’s faces.</p><p>Rio fought off a shiver, not believing for a second that anyone married to Agatha Harkness would even bother checking out anyone else. Was this guy blind?</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>The sound of her name shook her back down to the conversation and she was surprised to see that it was Agatha addressing her.</p><p>Their eyes met and Rio felt her heart rate pick up again, performing a one track percussion solo against her ribcage.</p><p>“How are you enjoying Cannes?”</p><p>It was such a simple question, as if she and Agatha were just shooting the breeze like any old friends might. But Agatha was one of the most powerful people in the room, at this festival, in Hollywood, and Rio couldn’t take her eyes off her.</p><p>“I mean… I’ve mostly seen my room and the red carpet, but so far so good.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and Rio thought she saw her gaze drop a few inches briefly before she took a sip of her champagne.</p><p>She had to get a grip.</p><p>“It’s the only festival I ever come to,” Ralph said suddenly, taking advantage of his position by Agatha to join in the conversation when as far as Rio was concerned he absolutely was not welcome.</p><p>“Best wine, best food, best beaches.”</p><p>Carol smiled warmly at him, the only one of the little group who was apparently willing to indulge this kind of conversation and Rio took the opportunity to excuse herself, squeezing her friend’s arm in farewell before she turned to leave.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said quickly, stepping away from her husband as he began to regale Carol with stories of Cannes passed.</p><p>Rio felt a warm hand curl around her wrist and turned in surprise to Agatha, “Don’t go far. I want to introduce you to Lilia.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly and turned her body back to Agatha, the two of them now a foot or so away from Carol and Ralph.</p><p>Agatha’s hand remained curled around her wrist.</p><p>“Lilia? Who-…?”</p><p>But it clicked suddenly, Lilia Calderu, two generations above Agatha, an acting legend who still demanded a huge pay check as well as the respect of the whole industry.</p><p>“Really?” Rio finished feebly, a little in shock that Agatha would even offer this.</p><p>“I was talking to her about you last week.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing and if Agatha hadn’t been right in front of her, her soft hand still curled around her wrist, she might have thought she was teasing her.</p><p>But the look in her eyes told her otherwise.</p><p>“I… okay,” Rio said quietly, a light furrow appearing in her brow, wondering why Agatha Harkness was talking to industry heavy weights about her.</p><p>They looked at each other for a second longer and then Agatha slowly released her wrist, her eyes darting down again briefly before they moved back up, “You look good.”</p><p>And Rio opened her mouth to respond, to tell Agatha that she looked better than anyone else in the room, than anyone else on the planet, but her name was called from somewhere behind her and Agatha glanced over, “it’s your director. Best go.”</p><p>She knew she was being dismissed, but she couldn’t feel the sting of it because Agatha Harkness thought she looked good, was still looking at her, was still close.</p><p>Suddenly she was 24 again, alone with Agatha in a toilet stall, with no thoughts in her head except how lucky she was that Agatha were looking at her like that.</p><p>But the memory faded as Agatha turned from her and Rio had no choice but to make her way over to her director, feeling the sickly feeling of someone who couldn’t quite get a hold on their emotions at a time where she had to be anything but emotional.</p><p>She didn’t see Agatha for a while after their first interaction and didn’t even see Alice for a little while either.</p><p>The party was so huge and the space so crowded that it was impossible to find anyone easily.</p><p>Rio stuck with her cast and crew for a little while, feeling the affect of champagne slowly work its way into her system, even if she were making sure to top it off with water and canapés.</p><p>It was when she was speaking to a nervous Spanish director in a quiet corner that she found Alice again. Or, Alice found her.</p><p>She came over with a bright smile and introduced herself to the director, surprising him by speaking Spanish with almost as much fluency as Rio had been.</p><p>Once they’d extricated themselves and Alice had exchanged her card with the director, Rio got a rundown of her performance for the night from Alice.</p><p>“I’ve had four directors, at least a dozen producers, two studio heads, and countless actors all bother me about you. I haven’t spoken to anyone who hasn’t mentioned you. Everyone’s charmed, everyone’s impressed. You’ve got a career yet, kid.”</p><p>Rio laughed at the theatrics as Alice put on her best Cary Grant voice and tugged her over to an area with seats, desperate to get off her feet for the first time in almost three hours.</p><p>“Enough about all that. Where’s Jen? How’s Jen?”</p><p>Alice only grinned in response to this and was about to answer when she spotted someone behind Rio’s shoulder and stood quickly, making Rio jump a little at the urgency of it.</p><p>“Ms Calderu,” she said reverently and a jolt of panic shot through Rio because if Lilia were here then…</p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha’s voice sounded suddenly, “this is Alice, Rio’s manager.”</p><p>Rio stood slowly straightening herself out quickly before she turned to Lilia, watching as Alice rushed around and held her hand out to her, “Pleasure, Ms Calderu.”</p><p>“Please,” the older woman said with a friendly wave of her hand, but shook Alice’s all the same, “Lilia’s fine.”</p><p>“And,” Agatha continued, holding a hand out to Rio as if to show her off, “this is Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio smiled slightly as Lilia took her all in, looking her over slowly and smiling as she did.</p><p>“The talk of the town.”</p><p>“Lilia,” Rio breathed out, stepping around her now abandoned chair to hold her own hand out to Lilia, feeling Agatha’s eyes on her every movement.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Lilia said with an enigmatic smile, “I’ve had Harkness here in my ear all night about you.”</p><p>“A little exaggeration there,” Agatha said quickly, moving around to sit down in the seat Rio had just vacated.</p><p>“Not by much,” Lilia countered, still maintaining eye contact with Rio. It felt a lot like Lilia were looking for something in her brown eyes, but Rio couldn’t be sure what it was.</p><p>There was talk, obviously. Hollywood was a town of talkers, gossipers. Lilia had a reputation for being a little kooky and Rio had seen her work, seen her interviews, knew she could be a little intense, but this… this was something else.</p><p>“I see a lot of light in you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and heard a movement behind her that suggested Agatha had turned in her seat to watch the two of them but she couldn’t take her eyes away from Lilia who simply stared at her.</p><p>“I… Thank you?”</p><p>Lilia just hummed and from the corner of her eye Rio saw Alice step a little closer, her fingers just grazing the side of Rio’s forearm where it rested by her side. But Lilia wasn’t a threat, wasn’t making Rio uncomfortable, more… exposed.</p><p>But nothing felt more exposing than Lilia turning the hand she still held onto over, supporting Rio’s wrist as she traced her fingers over the lines of her palm.</p><p>“God,” Agatha said from somewhere behind them, “Jesus, Lilia. We’re at a party, not a seance.”</p><p>“I’m curious,” Lilia said quietly, though Rio was sure it was so quiet that Agatha wouldn’t have heard it.</p><p>Lilia’s touch was soft and for the first time she’d dropped her gaze from Rio to look down at her palm, tracing the lines slowly. Alice had moved even closer and was leaning over to see if she could see what Lilia was looking at but to both her and Rio it looked like a whole lot of nothing.</p><p>After what felt like a lifetime and a lot of huffing from Agatha behind them, Lilia gently curled Rio’s fingers over and covered her hand with her own.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>“I… what’s interesting?”</p><p>“Do you see an Oscar in there?” Alice asked in all seriousness and earned a quick slap to her arm from Rio.</p><p>But Lilia was just smiling and moving around to take Alice’s seat, leaving the two original occupiers of the chairs to have to stand up.</p><p>Rio shifted a little where she stood, transferring her weight to one foot to ease help the discomfort.</p><p>“So,” Lilia said suddenly, a little more spritely now she was seated and had apparently read whatever she’d read in Rio’s palm. “I haven’t had one conversation tonight where your name hasn’t come up in some capacity. You’re quite the hit.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and had to fight back her grin, completely flummoxed by this woman she’d been watching since childhood now sitting before her.</p><p>Sure, she’d caught glimpses of her at awards shows and parties before, but she’d never been this close, never deigned to talk to the great Lilia Calderu.</p><p>She felt a different kind of intimidation with her compared to Agatha. Maybe because she hadn’t once had Lilia pressing her into the door of a bathroom stall, maybe because Lilia didn’t make her pulse quicken and her legs feel like jelly.</p><p>“It’s been a whirlwind,” Rio answered in the best media-trained response she could come up with.</p><p>Lilia only smiled and Agatha was the one to respond, “Jen’s furious about it. Thinks you have an industry plant paying people to keep your name being said. Keeps you fresh on people’s minds.”</p><p>“Oh? Does she think I’m raking in twenty mill a picture or something?”</p><p>Agatha smirked up at Rio and moved her arms to rest on the arms of the little chair she’d stolen, turning it into a throne beneath her.</p><p>“No, but I am.”</p><p>God, Rio wanted to kiss that damn smug look right off of her twenty-million-a-picture-face.</p><p>“Alice,” Lilia interjected suddenly, causing Alice to jump where Rio was still staring at Agatha, refusing to look away until she did.</p><p>“My manager is here, Helen. Allow me to introduce you?”</p><p>Rio broke the stare then, surprised by what she was hearing. She didn’t even have a second to regret it though because she was so intent on looking at Alice who looked just as shocked as she felt.</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, yeah. Of course. That would be-… yeah.”</p><p>Lilia smiled and stood slowly from her seat, offering her bent arm to a shell-shocked Alice who sent Rio a small, unbelieving smile before she let Lilia walk her away to find her manager.</p><p>Rio watched them go and then immediately went to sit down, just desperate to get off her feet for a second.</p><p>The second she did she looked up and regretted it immediately because she had Agatha directly in her line of vision and saw her watch her curiously. Rio shifted slightly, self-consciously rearranging her dress so she wasn’t accidentally exposing herself to the room and the woman opposite.</p><p>“That went well,” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“The palm thing,” Rio said slowly, looking to check Lilia wasn’t in earshot, “what was that?”</p><p>“Oh, she likes to check before she works with people.”</p><p>“Check what?”</p><p>“I think it’s mostly to freak people out, test their nerve. You held up well.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, unsure if Agatha were praising her or making fun of her, or maybe both.</p><p>She decided to turn the conversation around, wanting to claw some power back because she had nowhere to look other than at the woman before her and the heady mix of champagne and compliments all night was making her want to jump her.</p><p>So the only topic that could possibly dampen her desire was what she brought to the table: “Ralph seems to be enjoying himself.”</p><p>This tangent seemed to take Agatha by surprise and her eyebrows shot halfway up her forehead as her fingers thrummed the arms of her chair, she surveyed Rio for a second before she suddenly dropped her gaze and Rio registered that this was the first time all evening that Agatha had been the one to properly look away from her first.</p><p>“He enjoys the glitz.”</p><p>“And you don’t?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and slowly brought her gaze back around to Rio, her blue eyes dropping briefly to dance across her diamanté-covered dress, “I like the sparkle.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, sure that if had been anyone else she might have picked up the thread of the flirt and let it unravel between them but it was Agatha, so she forced herself to ignore it.</p><p>But then she’d been silent for too long.</p><p>So long that Agatha’s gaze had flickered up again to meet her own and Agatha across from her raised her brows.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>She turned away and cleared her throat, wondering why her body was betraying her like this.</p><p>Her fingers curled around the arms of the chair she’d sat in to take the weight off her aching feet that had now become the perfect viewing platform to stare at the one person she absolutely, positively could not have.</p><p>“Sorry,” she uttered after another few beats of silence, her pulse beating so erratically that surely Agatha could see her cheeks flushing beneath the expertly applied makeup.</p><p>“Long night. Lots of champagne.”</p><p>She didn’t look back around at Agatha but knew her eyes were still on her.</p><p>How could she not know?</p><p>“You’re opening the ceremony tomorrow?” Rio asked in an attempt to try and move the conversation back into safer territory.</p><p>“I am. Will you be there?”</p><p>“We couldn’t get tickets.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s brows shot up and she looked pensive for a second before she asked: “Would you like tickets?”</p><p>Rio blinked, wondering if Agatha were trying to trap her in some way.</p><p>But she decided she wasn’t and so she was honest.</p><p>“To see the most talked about movie in years?”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little, and Rio thought it was the most beautiful she’d ever looked.</p><p>“You flatter me.”</p><p>“Aren’t you used to that?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened and Rio felt her own grow to match it. God, this woman was devastating.</p><p>“Not from you.”</p><p>“My apologies, Ms Harkness. Must have left my manners at the roundtable.”</p><p>Agatha released a soft laugh and raised her hand to run through her hair and Rio couldn’t help it when her eyes flashed down to the curve of her bicep and she felt a jolt of desire sit low in her stomach.</p><p>“I’m not sure you were being particularly polite then either.”</p><p>“Oh? Did I offend you somehow? Not fawn enough over you?”</p><p>“Certainly didn’t tell me what a big fan you were.”</p><p>Rio laughed at this and stuck her tongue into the inside of her cheek, watching Agatha’s eyes dart to it before she spoke again, “And yet you’ve never told me you were a fan of my work.”</p><p>“No accounting for taste,” Agatha said with a smirk as their little bubble was burst and they’d been discovered by the who’s who of the Cannes festival again.</p><p>They watched each other even as they were descended upon.</p><p>Rio felt warmed under Agatha’s gaze but it wasn’t the usual flush of an unrequited crush.</p><p>Her whole body felt aflame, her insides crackling with the intensity of Agatha’s eyes on her.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” the man above her stole her attention and she was helped to her feet by him, smiling gratefully as she stood before him.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Agatha’s attention being taken by an actor that Rio had heard bad things but she didn’t have the chance to look at her more as her attention was stolen by the man before her already asking whether she was enjoying the festival.</p><p>Somewhere in the next few minutes Rio lost Agatha to the crowds that had moved to swallow them both up.</p><p>She didn’t see her for the rest of the night.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Alice had found her again.</p><p>“You’re not going home with Jen?”</p><p>“Shh! God. No discretion,” Alice accused with a huff as she took Rio’s arm, “How drunk are you? We should leave whilst on a high. Leave them wanting more.”</p><p>Rio laughed and realised she was quite drunk because a few people turned around to look at her after she’d barked it out.</p><p>“Maybe that’s a good idea.”</p><p>Alice steered Rio out of the party with a firm hand on her lower back and that same determination to get Rio as quickly and cleanly as possible.</p><p>In the end, it took another thirty minutes to get Rio out and into a waiting car.</p><p>“I hate that you’re famous sometimes,” Alice huffed as she slammed the door shut behind them and Rio only rolled her eyes and laughed.</p><p>“Isn’t that your <em>whole</em> job?”</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and rolled her head around to stare out the window, wondering if she’d been charming enough to the hoards of people who’d approached her that night.</p><p>By the time they’d arrived back in their suite, Rio was feeling significantly happier about her performance of the evening.</p><p>Alice had been telling her how many business cards she’d received, regaling her of the projects people had been hinting at getting Rio on board with.</p><p>It felt like a soothing bedtime story that her parents may have told her when she was little.</p><p>Only this story didn’t have princesses and dragons it had movies and famous directors.</p><p>Rio may have been gently lulled to sleep by Alice but she was also harshly woken by her not four hours later.</p><p>She groaned and rolled over in the king-sized bed, trying to hide away from the light of the day and the ferocious way Alice was pummelling her to get her up.</p><p>“I’m not fucking kidding, Rio! Get up! We need to get you ready. Now.”</p><p>Rio huffed and slapped Alice’s hands away where they continued to hit and grab at her.</p><p>“Stop! Stop! I have a free morning. You said. You <em>promised</em>.”</p><p>“Yes but that was until we got tickets!”</p><p>“Tickets?”</p><p>Rio huffed as Alice managed to rip the blankets from her with a triumphant grin.</p><p>“Jen just called. We’re going to see <em>No Heaven Like This</em>. Agatha got us tickets.”</p>

<em>"Jen just called. We're going to see No Heaven Like This. Agatha got us tickets."</em>
</p><p>“She did what?”</p><p>Rio’s head was spinning suddenly and it could only be for one of three reasons:</p><p>The amount of champagne she’d had last night<br/>
The fact that Alice had just heaved her into a seated position<br/>
The idea that after what Rio remembered to be a throwaway comment, Agatha Harkness had gone out of her way to secure Rio (and apparently Alice) entry to the hottest premiere in town</p><p>Perhaps it was all three.</p><p>“She got us tickets, you idiot. Get up! Get up!”</p><p>Alice was already hurrying to grab Rio’s phone, taking it upon herself to use Rio’s WhatsApp as a means to encourage the glam squad to be over sooner rather than later.</p><p>“We have an hour.”</p><p>“An <em>hour</em>?!” Rio yelled out in horror; the idea of showing up to Agatha’s premiere looking less than perfect suddenly lightly a fire beneath her ass as she threw herself from the bed.</p><p>“I <em>told</em> you to get up.”</p><p>The next hour was one of the fastest hours of Rio’s life.</p><p>She had four people working on her at once.</p><p>At least eight hands on her at all times.</p><p>Usually in moments like this Alice would comment on how this would be Rio’s dream date situation but there wasn’t even time for jokes.</p><p>Rio was deathly hungover and had time only for small sips of coffee in between lipstick application or the rouging of her cheeks to make her look less than the grey that she felt.</p><p>She’d long since decided that her hangover was partially alcohol-driven and partially a certain queasiness that had set in at the idea of Agatha personally inviting her to the premiere.</p><p>When she’d hardly asked.</p><p>When she barely knew her.</p><p>When she’d spent all night trying not to stare at toned arms or fall into intoxicating pools of blue.</p><p>Alice had been in her ear all morning about the benefits of being friendly with everybody’s favourite actress.</p><p>She’d been waxing poetic about Agatha’s power in the industry and how Rio would be smart to keep close, to keep her on side.</p><p>But Rio was at a loss for how to do that when apparently she was already on side - if the invites were anything to go by.</p><p>But then, in the back of her mind she knew, Agatha was the competition.</p><p>Not three days ago <em>Variety</em> had released an article about the early Oscar contenders and there, front and centre in the four-page spread, were photos of her and Agatha at different red carpet events. Both smiling, both the ones to watch in the Oscar race.</p><p>Maybe it was psychological warfare.</p><p>Maybe Agatha was trying to psych Rio out.</p><p>After all, <em>No Heaven Like This</em> was supposedly a masterpiece.</p><p>So making Rio watch it in a room full of the most influential people in the industry, watch Agatha receive what was sure to be a ten-minute-plus standing ovation for it, that was cruelty rather than kindness.</p><p>But despite Rio knowing that Agatha was an incredible actress she couldn’t bring herself to believe that the way she’d looked at her last night had been anything but kind, or interested, or in the very least, polite.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>The makeup artist huffed in a way that Rio didn’t think she would if she were currently plastering lipstick on Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Stop fidgeting.”</p><p>Rio grimaced in embarrassment and apologised quickly as she tried to focus back in on the task at hand.</p><p>Look good.</p><p>Look good for Agatha.</p><p>She mentally chastised herself as her hair stylist combed through her dark flop of hair, and could no longer look herself in the eye in the mirror.</p><p>Perhaps having a crush on someone so unattainable wasn’t the best option for a wannabe movie star.</p><p>Or maybe another actress would be fine.</p><p>But Rio felt things deeply, too deeply.</p><p>And Agatha was starting to take up too much of the brain space she needed to use to focus in, to nail every appearance, to charm the world.</p><p>She didn’t have time to try to charm a married mother of one.</p><p>Or to think.</p><p>As soon as she was deemed acceptable, she was wrestled into a little white dress and heels, and thrown a bag with her phone and then marched with Alice to the waiting car outside.</p><p>Rio didn’t even have time to register the pretty receptionist shooting her a megawatt smile on her way out.</p><p>“The press conference afterwards. You need to pay attention to how Agatha handles it,” Alice was saying in the back of the car with Rio.</p><p>“Press conference? We surely can’t-…”</p><p>“Well maybe you can’t but I can.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and smirked a little at her determined friend.</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“She’ll help, I’m sure of it.”</p><p>“You’re the competition.”</p><p>“So? You’re the competition too and Agatha got you in.”</p><p>But Rio turned away, unwilling to express her fears that that might not have been a kindness.</p><p>“Rio? She’s a better friend than you could find anywhere else. Don’t fuck it up, okay? We’re on the cusp of greatness and Agatha <em>is</em> great.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, tried to focus on what had happened last night.</p><p>How had she broached the topic of Agatha’s premiere? Had she asked for a ticket?</p><p>Everything still felt a little hazy by the time they were pulling up to the red carpet outside the theatre.</p><p>With some final words of encouragement, Rio was able to put on her best smile and saunter in.</p><p>The place was overrun.</p><p>They were some of the last in and the usher was reluctant to show them to their seats.</p><p>“Listen, kid. I’m telling you that these seats were reassigned to us.”</p><p>Rio had been trapped by a well-meaning journalist who she’d spoken to several times over the years but she could still hear Alice’s voice through the noise of the crowd.</p><p>As the journalist asked her how she was enjoying the festival she felt her stomach drop and fear clutch at her heart.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t got them seats at all.</p><p>“I’m <em>telling</em> you. It’s-…”</p><p>“What’s happening here?”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped around when she heard Jen join the mix and she missed the journalist’s high praise of her latest <em>Vanity Fair</em> piece.</p><p>Jen wouldn’t prank Alice.</p><p>Agatha would prank Rio. But Jen wouldn’t prank Alice.</p><p>So she turned back and tried to drown out the urgent conversation of the two women beside her in favour of the man who’d once felt so sorry for her after arriving at a press junket and seeing her tired and miserable that instead of asking questions about the movie he asked her about basketball.</p><p>She’d give this man an exclusive on anything just for that.</p><p>“Vidal,” came Jen’s voice through the noise, cutting Rio off where she was telling the journalist about her plans for the next few days - what she could remember from Alice’s oft-repeated itinerary anyway.</p><p>“Quick. It’ll start soon.”</p><p>Rio excused herself politely and turned to Jennifer and a smug looking Alice.</p><p>“Don’t get used to this special treatment. She must have still been drunk when she called me this morning. It was a huge headache to get you both in here. I must have pissed off a hell of a lot of people. But she insisted. So.”</p><p>Jen looked furious.</p><p>Rio wondered how Alice was holding up about it.</p><p>But she didn’t have time to ponder the very intricate dynamics of their strange situationship because the lights were dimming and that meant the cast and crew would soon be arriving.</p><p>“Straight down, the two seats in the middle,” Jen pointed out, and Rio followed Alice down the row until they found the two remaining seats in the theatre that weren’t the exclusive front row.</p><p>Usually in a movie theatre Rio would opt for a back row seat where she was less likely to be observed by the curious fan. She’d also opt for a bucket of popcorn the size of a small child and a soda large enough to drown in.</p><p>But in this instance, the sight of Agatha Harkness striding in hand in hand with her director would be enough to satisfy her.</p><p>Agatha was wearing a pale blue suit with a crisp white shirt and she looked devastating.</p><p>She was beaming as she walked along the row and for a heart-stopping moment she locked eyes with Rio.</p><p>It was brief, and if it had been anyone else looking at her like that, Rio might not have noticed.</p><p>But it was Agatha so she noticed everything.</p><p>She might not have believed she’d even looked her way except for the fact that Agatha knew where she was sitting, because she’d gone to the effort of placing her there.</p><p>But the moment was gone and the filmmakers all had their seats, and Rio realised with a jolt that she could see Agatha still, the blue standing out even as the lights dimmed.</p><p>She was five rows behind her, diagonally positioned so if Rio turned her head only slightly she could stare at the back of Agatha’s head for the next two and a half hours.</p><p>Then Agatha moved as the director stood to introduce the movie to the expectant crowd.</p><p>And Rio could just see her profile.</p><p>The curve of Agatha’s nose was something that even the gods must envy, that Rio wanted to trace it with her fingers and brush it with her lips.</p><p>Agatha was made from something divine, something that mere mortals could only dream of emulating.</p><p>But the director was finishing and the crowd applauded as the lights dimmed completely and Agatha was lost to Rio as she turned back to the front.</p><p>Alice reached for Rio’s hand and squeezed it gently, shooting her a smile as the first titles came on.</p><p>For two hours Rio felt breathless with the intensity of the storyline, of the cinematography.</p><p>The movie unfurled before the silent audience; splitting open like a fresh wound as Agatha portrayed a mother losing a child with such precision that it was almost unbearable to watch.</p><p>Only it wasn’t.</p><p>It was compelling in a way that meant nobody blinked, nobody moved.</p><p>Every fractured breath, every cut to soulful blue eyes, every shot of Agatha bled with emotion. It made Rio grieve with her. Made her yearn to reach that part of her that could produce such a performance.</p><p>It was masterful, it was magic.</p><p>Hauntingly raw and real and remarkable.</p><p>As the camera faded to black after lingering on the final shot of Agatha, lone on a hillside, her wild hair billowing behind her as she stared into the distance, the crowds began to move.</p><p>Like a living beast, they rose together, spreading their thunderous applause through the theatre.</p><p>The cameras rolled in and suddenly Agatha was on the screen, looking more glamorous than she had in the throes of her performance.</p><p>And Rio hollered with the rest of the crowd, her hands already hurting from the ferocity of her applause.</p><p>Alice beside her was on her tiptoes, giving as good as Rio beside her.</p><p>Agatha was beaming, looking every which way but at the camera that stayed intrusively close to her face.</p><p>Whether truly shy or expertly putting on the pretence, she kept her gaze away from the lens and focused on her director, the producer her other side, and then the people directly behind her.</p><p>The standing ovation lasted for fourteen minutes, not a record at Cannes, but close enough.</p><p>As the noise died down, Rio could feel the sting of her hands and her eyes from the tears shed during the screening.</p><p>Alice looked distraught beside her and Rio wondered if it were because the movie had moved her so or because she knew any hope of an Oscar for Rio was dead on arrival.</p><p>The Oscar was surely Agatha’s to take.</p><p>A festival worker came out and instructed those who had press credentials to follow the usher at the exit of the theatre.</p><p>And as people began to move, the front row of filmmakers started to exit before everyone, Rio turned to see Agatha looking up at her, her blue eyes questioning and Rio just shook her head in disbelief down at her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a grin that Rio matched and even as her director tried for Agatha’s attention her eyes lingered on Rio for a few seconds longer before she turned away.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said close to her ear, “I’m going to sneak in. Go back to the hotel. Stay in the room. Order up lunch. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, feeling Alice gently push her towards the exit.</p><p>Rio was one of the few who left ahead of the press conference and without Alice to tell her otherwise, she refused the ride back to the hotel and instead took the scenic route home.</p><p>She needed some air to shake off the lingering impact of the movie.</p><p>And the fresh, crisp air of the town soothed her down from where her her mind was still with Agatha’s character in the depths of her grief.</p><p>Rio knew that she was a good actress. she knew she could command a stage and wow a cast and crew with her talent - especially when earlier on in her career she’d been typecast as a manic pixie dream girl, an actress who could play sexy whilst being a ‘cool girl’.</p><p>“Beautiful but doesn’t know was often in her earlier character descriptions somewhere.</p><p>She, and Alice, had rallied against it until, eventually, she’d been handed a breakout role in a little indie film only two years ago.</p><p>The director, female because of course, had seen something in her that Rio hadn’t even seen in herself.</p><p>The role was grittier, darker than she’d ever played. And although it didn’t get much awards attention, an Indie Spirit being the only award Rio was nominated for (though there was <em>some</em> buzz), it had allowed her access to the Hollywood elite.</p><p>She’d been considered suddenly by directors and producers, and even fellow actors were beginning to take notice.</p><p>So Rio had spent the last two years moving from film set to film set, terrified that she’d lose her chance if she didn’t work her ass off.</p><p>But Agatha, and Rio hated that she knew this, hated that she’d read her Wikipedia several times, was built for this and her name had been in the Awards circuit for practically as long as she’d been in the industry.</p><p>She came from a wealthy family, went to all the best schools, knew all the right people.</p><p>But she could also act rings around anyone she was on screen with.</p><p>And <em>No Heaven Like This</em> truly was her ultimate triumph. A perfect combination of a director knowing what to do with everything she could give and the indefatigable talent of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And though Rio wanted to speak to her, to pick her brains to try to unravel and understand how she ticked, how she could possibly have achieved such greatness, she knew she’d be a bumbling mess in front of her if she spoke now.</p><p>So the sea breeze was a welcome balm to her crazed mind.</p><p>Maybe she could write her a note. Maybe that would be how she could get across just how in awe of her she was.</p><p>But it wasn’t exactly the ‘cool girl’ thing to do, so Rio turned onto the main drag before the beach and began to consider how she could ever revert to type in the presence of Agatha Harkness and be cool enough to be able to speak to her as not some fawning fangirl with a crush but as a peer with some talent of her own.</p><p>A peer whose own movie was premiering the next day.</p><p>“Hey! Hey! Rio!”</p><p>Rio startled some from where she’d been focused on the horizon line as she walked to towards the beach. Torn from her idle thoughts of Agatha by a male voice.</p><p>She turned and raised her brows at the sight of a tall man, manoeuvring his way clumsily around the woven chairs outside a chic little cafe to get to her.</p><p>Ralph.</p><p>“Hey, you alone? Come join me! Coffee’s good!”</p><p>Rio had no chance to refuse as she was treated to a megawatt smile and the chivalrous offer of a seat pulled out for her at one of the little tables where Ralph had clearly been enjoying a coffee and a pastry on his own.</p><p>“Thank you,” she muttered softly, taking a seat and brushing down her little dress over her thighs.</p><p>“Were you at the premier?” He asked with that same grin plastered across his face.</p><p>This must work on other women, she thought.</p><p>Must work on Agatha.</p><p>“I was. Didn’t feel like it?”</p><p>The waiter appeared by her side and offered a menu. Rio took it and smiled her thanks before focusing back in on Ralph who’d taken it upon himself to order for her: “Two champagnes, please. Merci.”</p><p>Ralph’s French word of thanks was spoken with the kind of cloying American crassness that made Rio cringe but she kept her smile up on her face, refusing to be accused of being impolite to the husband of the woman who had just done her an inexplicable favour.</p><p>“Merci,” she repeated, with a much more agreeable accent than Ralph’s.</p><p>The waiter disappeared and Rio turned expectantly back to the man who’d ordered alcohol for her at eleven in the morning.</p><p>“Champagne?”</p><p>“When in Rome!” He said with a grin, leaning back in his chair and slipping his glasses back onto his face.</p><p>He looked even more handsome.</p><p>Rio hated him.</p><p>“But no. Never really been a movie fan.”</p><p>“Your wife is one of the most celebrated actresses of-…”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s her thing. I’d never expect her to come to one of my conferences.”</p><p>Rio had to fight to keep her face neutral, unsure how Ralph could compare a financial conference to the premier of one of the best movies ever put on the silver screen.</p><p>“Well you missed out. She was incredible. <em>It</em> was incredible,” she corrected herself.</p><p>“I’ve heard,” he said with a bored lilt to his voice.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and tilted her head as she took in the luckiest son of a bitch in the world.</p><p>This guy should be worshipping the ground Agatha walked on. He should be singing her praises and following her around ready to give her everything and anything she needed.</p><p>And here he was, in a seafront cafe, sitting ordering champagne with another woman, barely acknowledging Agatha’s impressive career.</p><p>Or how beautiful she was.</p><p>Or the way her eyes sparkled when she smiled.</p><p>Or how soft her hands were.</p><p>Or how-…</p><p>Ralph was speaking again.</p><p>“So, Rio. Is that your real name? Or a stage name? Like Elton John?”</p><p>The waiter arrived and delivered the champagne with a smile. Rio thanked him in soft French while Ralph said nothing.</p><p>“It’s my real name.”</p><p>“Different,” he said absently, though Rio felt his gaze drop slightly further south of her face and she took a sip of her champagne just to have something to do.</p><p>Just so she wouldn’t slap him.</p><p>It was as she turned her gaze to the view of the beach before them that she noticed something she should have been more cognisant of.</p><p>Something that should have made her second guess sitting down in the first place.</p><p>Something that should have made her refuse the champagne.</p><p>Across the way there were three photographers all with their eyes on the little twosome outside the cafe, all with their cameras hanging around their necks.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Sitting having a champagne with the husband of Agatha Harkness whilst she was in the middle of a press conference wasn’t a good look.</p><p>“Ralph,” Rio said suddenly, “I think I should go. I shouldn’t have sat down. There’s paps over there and-…”</p><p>But Ralph had reached forwards and placed his hand over Rio’s and Rio just knew that if the photographers had been waiting for their shot then this was it.</p><p>She pulled her hand away quickly.</p><p>“Come on, don’t deny me the chance to drink champagne with a pretty girl by the sea.”</p><p>Perhaps Ralph himself should have been enough deterrent for her to sit down.</p><p>“I should go.”</p><p>She stood quickly and Ralph didn’t stand with her as she did.</p><p>“Thanks for the champagne.”</p><p>Through his glasses Rio thought she saw Ralph’s eyes flash angrily but she didn’t hang around to see.</p><p>She simply turned away and strode off, deciding that perhaps she should do now what Alice had told her to do earlier.</p><p>She should go to her hotel room and do nothing.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>Only doing nothing meant she had time to worry about what had just happened with Ralph.</p><p>Which seemed crazy, no? She was out and proud - one of the few actresses to be so.</p><p>They couldn’t spin this, surely.</p><p>They couldn’t make out that Rio was having an affair with the great Agatha Harkness’s husband.</p><p>But, of course they could.</p><p>Rivals at the festival, rivals in awards season, Rio could be made out to be trying to sabotage Agatha’s relationship to get under her skin.</p><p>Alice would kill her.</p><p>But more than that, more than her impending murder and her character assassination by the pestilential press, was her concern over Agatha’s reaction.</p><p>The woman had gone out of her way to get Rio and Alice the hottest tickets in town.</p><p>And Rio had spent the length of the movie marvelling at her talent, stupefied by the force of her gravitational pull even through the screen.</p><p>And now she’d repaid her by embarrassing her.</p><p>Alice arrived an hour later and Rio hated that she was so happy because she knew she wouldn’t be when Rio told her what she’d done.</p><p>“God she nails it every time. She’s so fucking good, Rio. So fucking good. You wouldn’t believe how she handled those questions.”</p><p>But Alice had spotted Rio’s tortured expression and stopped where she was mid-stride, “What? What happened?”</p><p>“I think they got pictures of me and Ralph.”</p><p>“Ralph?”</p><p>“Ralph. Agatha’s Ralph.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows, unable to compute what Rio might have been caught doing with Ralph that would lead to this reaction.</p><p>“We had champagne on the front and he held my hand. Very! Very briefly! But I spotted the photographers and I just <em>know</em>…”</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. I told you to come straight back.”</p><p>Rio grimaced and ran both hands through her hair which looked significantly more dishevelled than it had this morning.</p><p>Alice was already fishing out her phone.</p><p>“He stopped me and I thought we’d just get a coffee and then he-…”</p><p>“I’ll call Jen. I knew your flirting would get us in trouble one day but-…”</p><p>“I was <em>not</em> flirting, Alice. He’s a <em>man</em>, in case you hadn’t noticed. And he’s with Agatha. He’s married to Agatha Harkness! I don’t do married and I’d be a fucking fool to-…!”</p><p>“Okay, okay. Fine. Relax. It was innocent. I’ll call now. Just… just don’t move.”</p><p>Rio threw herself down onto one of the ridiculously large couches and groaned as Alice turned from her and quickly dialled for Jen.</p><p>Rio knew she was already on thin ice with the woman so she could only imagine her reaction to <em>this</em>.</p><p>And then she imagined Agatha’s reaction. The only reaction she found herself caring much about.</p><p>But Alice had gone into the other room and so Rio was left to her catastrophising.</p><p>It didn’t take long until she found out how much of a catastrophe this was.</p><p>“Okay. Jen’s pissed. She’s speaking to Agatha about it but she’s in press all day so it’s unlikely we’ll find out just how pissed <em>she</em> is but if it helps at all, Jen thinks she’ll mostly be mad at Ralph.”</p><p>Rio sighed and threw her forearm over her eyes, feeling like the stupidest person on the world.</p><p>“I don’t even like men,” she mumbled unhappily.</p><p>“Well our dinner with the Head of MGM has been moved.”</p><p>“Moved?”</p><p>Rio sat up suddenly, staring at Alice in surprise. Alice had worked hard to get that dinner booked into their schedule so Rio suddenly knew she’d <em>really</em> fucked up.</p><p>“Alice-…”</p><p>“Moved restaurant,” Alice clarified, taking a seat by Rio’s feet and focusing on her phone.</p><p>“Agatha’s also out for dinner. We’re arranging a happenstance meeting between you two. Getting a photographer to capture it. You’re going to smile and hug and pretend like you’re the best of friends.”</p><p>Rio swallowed down something heavy in her throat. It felt a lot like her heart.</p><p>“Jen’s a genius,” Alice added with just a hint of smugness about it.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Ralph will be there too. A quick two kiss cheek. Polite, friendly. There’s no story here.”</p><p>Rio paled a little as she watched her friend in silence, watching the little frown appear between her brows.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Alice. I didn’t mean to. It was just… I was being polite.”</p><p>“I know,” Alice said softly, “I told Jen.”</p><p>She looked up and Rio knew then that Alice wasn’t mad anymore. She felt a little better.</p><p>“Do you think she’ll be mad?”</p><p>“She has a reputation for a reason.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and felt the light pressure of a hand on her calf, “Hey. We’ll spin the close friend narrative.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened again as Alice removed her hand from her leg but she saw she was still looking at her.</p><p>“How did you convince her to get you those tickets?”</p><p>“I have no idea. I barely remember telling her we hadn’t managed to get any.”</p><p>“Well however you charmed her last night you’ll just have to charm her again.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and then flopped onto her back again and sighed heavily, “Fuck. Fucking paps. Should be illegal.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Alice said quietly, “What’s a married man doing holding the hand of a young actress?”</p><p>Rio felt a white hot fury flash through her suddenly. The reminder of Ralph’s disinterest in his wife’s work making her feel anger like never before.</p><p>Alice was right. This was <em>Ralph’s</em> fault.</p><p>“He wasn’t exactly fawning over her. Had no interest in her movie.”</p><p>“Prick,” Alice said as she turned her attention back to her phone. “I get that he’s hot and rich but… so’s she. She could get anyone.”</p><p>Rio just hummed quietly, closing her eyes again as she thought back to the way Agatha had grinned at her at the premiere.</p><p>She’d probably never get that treatment from her again.</p><p>Rio couldn’t shake the dread at seeing Agatha for the rest of the day.</p><p>Even Alice’s gentle reassurances didn’t help. Alice was convinced that Rio could turn this whole thing around with her easy charm.</p><p>Or maybe she was just saying that to get Rio through the afternoon’s press round.</p><p>Because Rio hadn’t known how she’d charmed Agatha into getting them tickets in the first place so Rio was less sure she’d be able to do it again.</p><p>In fact, by the time they were pulling up to the restaurant, Rio was convinced the best thing she could do would be to turn around and take the first flight out of Cannes.</p><p>“You’re being hysterical.”</p><p>“You said it yourself: Agatha has a reputation for a reason.”</p><p>“She won’t do anything in public. And I’ll know from Jen by the time we go to bed how she’s feeling. Just try to relax, okay? You need to be convincing. <em>And</em> you need to be at the top of your game for MGM. So suck it up, buttercup.”</p><p>Rio huffed and began toying with her hair which made Alice slap her hand.</p><p>But press waits for no woman. And so Rio Vidal <em>had</em> to suck it up.</p><p>She thankfully was partnered with her director for the majority of the afternoon’s interviews so had someone to rely upon whenever she felt like she was flagging or her mind was drifting to the other rooms in the hotel where surely Agatha was answering similar, boring questions.</p><p>They had time to change and refresh makeup once the last of the interviews was done, but no glam squad this time.</p><p>Which meant that Rio crowded Alice in her little bathroom and kept prying to see if she knew just how mad Agatha was.</p><p>Alice knew nothing. Only that Agatha would be in the restaurant already by the time they arrived.</p><p>So, when Rio stepped out onto the sidewalk not twenty minutes later after a short journey from the hotel to the restaurant, she found that her body moved without her brain having to tell her to do so.</p><p>The maitre d’ greeted her and Alice and Rio only had to raise her head to see a pair of familiar eyes on her.</p><p>Agatha was wearing the same suit she’d had on that morning for the premiere only she’d draped her jacket over the back of her chair and had rolled her white sleeves up to her elbows.</p><p>Rio’s gaze fell to her forearms and she saw them flex slightly where she sat, and found herself wishing she’d strangle her just so she could see them do that up close.</p><p>Ralph was beside her and an unknown man sat opposite her, beside Jen.</p><p>Agatha raised from her seat as Rio and Alice approached and she smiled a smile that made Rio’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha announced making Rio almost stumble where she got closer.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Agatha had wrapped her arms around her and Rio couldn’t believe that Agatha Harkness was pressed against her all of a sudden.</p><p>She’d expected a typical European greeting of a two cheek kiss and had prepared herself for <em>that</em> but not this.</p><p>Not Agatha’s strong hold and the fingers that rested on the skin at the base of her neck, the hand on her lower back, pressing her close.</p><p>Rio was sure Agatha would be able to feel her heart beating erratically against her ribcage, beating so hard and fast as if it were trying to escape its cage and nestle in beside Agatha’s.</p><p>But she managed to wrap her arms around Agatha too, holding on just enough so she didn’t look as surprised and useless as she felt.</p><p>“Smile,” came a voice close to her ear, soft and gentle, just for her, “pretend you’re happy to see me.”</p><p>“I am,” Rio murmured back, feeling Agatha already pulling away when Rio could have held onto her like this forever.</p><p>She managed to keep her smile on her face as Agatha pulled her top half away, their hips pressed together in a hold that made Rio flush a little at the intimacy of it.</p><p>Agatha looked at her curiously, and it was a sign of her talent as an actress that she managed to maintain her grin.</p><p>“What are the chances.”</p><p>Rio forced a laugh that sounded, to her ringing ears, genuine.</p><p>And then Agatha was releasing her hold on her and Rio knew it was her cue to go to Ralph and greet him too.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand drift down her arm as she stepped around her and was surprised when she felt soft fingers curl around her own and squeeze her as she leant up to kiss the cheeks of the man that had caused this mess.</p><p>Her greeting of Ralph was practised politeness and by the look on his face, she knew he’d been warned that two light kisses to Rio’s cheeks were all he’d be allowed to do.</p><p>But if he’d stuck his tongue down her throat, Rio wouldn’t have even noticed, because Agatha still had her hand. The hold was so light, so tentative around her fingers that she wasn’t sure who now was holding on to who.</p><p>But Alice had moved in and was motioning for Rio to follow her so she only had time to shoot Jen and the unnamed man a quick smile before she stepped away.</p><p>Her hand remained in Agatha’s as she swept past and their hold on each other only dropped when Rio stepped from around her.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure why she’d done it but maybe it was a means of making sure she were anchoring Rio away from her husband, of reminding her of her place.</p><p>Still, her fingers tingled with the electricity of Agatha’s touch even as they now hung useless at her side.</p><p>But they’d stepped away to the table in the corner and as Rio sat down opposite Alice, her best friend whispered across at her: “Nicely done. He got the shots.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, flexing her fingers subtly over the table as she tried to calm her still racing heart.</p><p>From where they now sat waiting on their guest, Rio had a direct view of Agatha if she turned to the left.</p><p>It was too tempting. And so she didn’t.</p><p>She kept her gaze on Alice, on the table, on her water glass, on anything but the woman she so badly wanted to look across at.</p><p>Within five minutes, Rio’s heart rate had calmed down again and their guest had arrived.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, she had to look up when he did and saw that he’d stopped at Agatha’s table to greet the future two-time Oscar winner.</p><p>Just a few hours, Rio thought to herself as she watched Agatha kiss the man’s cheeks, and smile up at him, until she’d know how badly she’d fucked up.</p><p>She’d find out how angry Agatha truly was.</p><p>And whether she’d ever get to hug her again.</p><p><em>Pathetic</em>, she thought more bitterly, clenching her teeth as she saw Agatha introduce Ralph to one of the most important men in Hollywood.</p><p>It was two minutes later, as Ralph reached over to shake the hand of Tony Stark, that she caught Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>Rio sucked a sharp breath in, seeing that Agatha’s smile had indeed been fake earlier.</p><p>Because right now she looked less than happy, she looked angry.</p><p>Rio looked away quickly, unable to handle the guilt that settled in her stomach.</p><p>But Stark was soon at their table and Rio had to push whatever she felt about her current situation down to focus in on the man who could make or break careers.</p><p>She’d met Stark before, had even had a drink with him once at a party. But this was the first time she’d had his undivided attention for a whole hour and a half: as promised by his wife and right hand woman, Pepper.</p><p>Rio had no problem being charming for Stark and found his easy manners and bawdy wit to be a welcome distraction from her horror that she’d managed to burn down a tentative friendship with her longest running crush with a misjudged attempt at being polite.</p><p>With a promise to keep in touch with Alice, Stark left and Rio was lavished with compliments by her best friend for her ability to charm the pants off of anyone.</p><p>Which felt ironic to Rio as she was so tragically aware that Agatha were still at dinner just a few feet away, furious with her.</p><p>“She’s pissed,” Rio whispered, ignoring Alice’s compliments.</p><p>Alice’s smile froze on her face and then she shot a quick glance around at Agatha’s table, seeing that whoever they’d been with before had gone and left just the three people there.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>“Alice, <em>no</em>.”</p><p>“Come on. Best do it now.”</p><p>And Alice was moving so Rio had no choice but to follow.</p><p>She hung back a little, unwilling to be exposed to Agatha’s wrath when she’d started the morning with a different belief about the state of their relationship.</p><p>“Hey, how was your meal?”</p><p>Rio cringed at Alice’s opening line and settled by her side, wondering why she’d had two glasses of red and not any tequila.</p><p>Or arsenic.</p><p>“Well as planned pap shots go it was the most delicious,” Jen offered with a smile as she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“I’m sorry about that,” Rio said quickly, suddenly desperate to get her guilt off her chest.</p><p>“I didn’t-…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said quickly, and Rio glanced down to see Agatha swirling her glass of wine, her gaze somewhere off in the distance.</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and leant across the table to Alice, her hand landing just inches from where she stood, “I’ll call you later, okay?”</p><p>Rio reacted sooner than Alice did and reached for her friend’s arm, tugging her away quickly so they could disappear from this ill-advised interaction.</p><p>They paused briefly at the maitre d’ and Alice quickly paid the bill, both now avoiding looking back at the three people they’d just hurried away from.</p><p>They were silent on the journey back to their hotel, both lost in their own thoughts of the relationships that they may have lost due to a miscalculation.</p><p>When they arrived back to their room Rio wondered why she felt so sick with the idea of Agatha being angry at her.</p><p>She’d not technically done anything wrong. She’d only put herself in a stupid situation. She’d only tried to be polite to a man she would otherwise rather ignore, potentially punch.</p><p>Agatha must know that.</p><p>Agatha can’t have thought she’d be cruel enough or stupid enough to try something with her husband.</p><p>Alice looked as if she were suffering as much as Rio was and for that reason, when they arrived back in the suite, Rio excused herself and went to take a long hot bath.</p><p>She couldn’t handle the fact that she may have also ruined Alice’s chance at a relationship with Jen.</p><p>She stayed soaking for close to two hours, constantly topping up the bath with hot water so she could prolong the inevitable - facing Alice again.</p><p>By the time she’d summoned up the courage to step back into their shared living space Alice had also been soaking in her own tub for a while, she looked up at Rio with a small, sad frown.</p><p>“I haven’t heard from Jen yet.”</p><p>Rio only nodded silently and went to take a seat beside Alice on the couch, reaching an arm around her to pull her into her side.</p><p>“Jen is totally head over heels for you. She-…”</p><p>There was a faint knock at the door and both women on the couch looked up in surprise.</p><p>Alice moved over, squeezing Rio’s thigh as she pushed herself up and Rio sat forwards having a hunch who it might be knocking on their door so late at night.</p><p>She was right.</p><p>“Hey,” Jen said, a little breathlessly, and Rio wandered if she were nervous and if she’d been as worried about her future relationship with Alice as Alice had been.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>Alice could only nod and Rio felt a twang of affection for her best friend.</p><p>“Rio. Hey.”</p><p>Rio nodded and stood, placing her hands in the back pockets of her shorts.</p><p>“Jen. How is… is everything okay?”</p><p>Jen glanced at Alice and then nodded, taking it upon herself to move further into the room and take a seat at the couch opposite where Rio was.</p><p>Alice hesitated for a second before she went to take a seat by Rio and Jen cleared her throat a little at this choice but swallowed down whatever she was about to say and replaced it with: “Agatha’s pissed but she’s mostly pissed at Ralph. She thinks you’re a fool, obviously, but… she’s pissed at Ralph.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart leap into her throat as she stared across at Jen, vaguely aware that she was now telling Alice about a call she’d made to her press contacts, about how she’d sourced the photographers who’d taken the photos and firstly talked them down and secondly bought the photos off them - for a much lower price than they were initially going to try and flog them for.</p><p>“I… wait,” Rio said suddenly, her brain still focused on the most important news - that Agatha wasn’t annoyed at her.</p><p>“You got the photos?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then… they won’t run the photos of us in the restaurant either?”</p><p>“No. There’s no need. Agatha’s reputation is safe and yours is fine too.”</p><p>Rio started a little, wondering if she could get a hold of those photos. Wondering if she could get Agatha to sign them. Wondering if Agatha would ever hold her like that again.</p><p>“So… so she’s not mad.”</p><p>“Oh, she’s mad. Ralph’s flying back home tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down at her hands, distractedly cracking her knuckles as she thought this over.</p><p>“Did he make a move?”</p><p>Rio felt Alice shift beside her, her hand unconsciously reaching for Rio’s wrist, whether in a protective move or to stop her cracking her knuckles, Rio wasn’t sure. Maybe both.</p><p>“A move? I… no. Does Agatha think he did?”</p><p>“He held your hand… it’s logical to think he may have made a move.”</p><p>And then Rio realised why Agatha had held her hand earlier.</p><p>She’d been worried Ralph had made a move and Rio would be concerned it might happen again.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Rio’s mind was reeling, her whole body felt hot suddenly and she stood up from her couch, striding from the room to stand out on the balcony where at least she could get some air.</p><p>Not only had she almost caused a PR disaster for Agatha Harkness but she’d almost ruined a marriage.</p><p>She’d fantasised about Agatha being suddenly single, suddenly interested.</p><p>But the reality was different.</p><p>Everyone knew that Agatha and Ralph were a golden couple.</p><p>Rio had a crush but she wasn’t selfish enough to want them to break up.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>“God,” she heard from just behind her, “actresses are so dramatic.”</p><p>Rio looked over her shoulder at Jen and raised her brows.</p><p>The woman stood watching her with her arms crossed over her chest, her cell phone clutched in one beautifully manicured hand.</p><p>“Ralph is a good guy… mostly. But he sometimes looks… sometimes touches… Agatha mostly turns a blind eye but… anyway.”</p><p>Rio sighed and turned back around to look out across the water. She realised she was being a little dramatic but she couldn’t help it.</p><p>It was her job, after all.</p><p>If Agatha turned a blind eye to Ralph, would Ralph turn a blind eye to Agatha too?</p><p>Was Agatha sleeping around on the side? Would Agatha sleep around with her?</p><p>But, no. Now wasn’t the time to fantasise.</p><p>She was barley friends with Agatha and Agatha had given her no reason for Rio to believe she was anything other than straight anyway.</p><p>Except for one drunken memory of a night in Chicago. But even that was too hazy to be anything real.</p><p>Besides, this whole thing had ruined what she had hoped would continue to be a confusing, difficult, but totally enthralling relationship.</p><p>Because despite it all, she wanted Agatha Harkness to like her.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said from somewhere close by, “You did nothing wrong. And now it’s fixed. Relax, okay? And next time don’t sit with another famous actress’s spouse drinking champagne in one of the most photographed towns in the world.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned around again and in doing so she caught the look exchanged between Jen and Alice and she had to soften.</p><p>They looked so in love it was impossible not to soften with it.</p><p>Her best friend was an idiot for thinking Jen might not be interested.</p><p>“Will you tell Agatha I’m sorry? And that… that I loved her movie?”</p><p>Jen’s face changed as she looked around to Rio and she scoffed before she turned her attention to her phone and Rio knew that a woman who worked for Agatha Harkness would surely be busy every minute of the day.</p><p>“Tell her yourself. Alice, I should go. Agatha wants to prep for tomorrow.”</p><p>Jen looked up then and dropped her phone slightly, “But drinks? Tomorrow evening?”</p><p>Rio felt suddenly like she shouldn’t be here but with the door blocked back into the suite she could do nothing but turn back to the sea.</p><p>She held her breath and brought her arms in as her forearms leant on the barrier, trying to shrink herself so Jen and Alice could have some privacy.</p><p>“I… yeah! I’d love that.”</p><p>“Good. I’ll drop you a text later. We’re non-stop all day tomorrow but I should have most of the evening free.”</p><p>“Cool. I mean, great. I… yeah. Cool.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look around but she grinned to herself as she heard Jen laugh quietly and turned only when she heard Jen leave and shout over her shoulder back at her.</p><p>“Bye, Rio! Fuck up again and I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Rio raised her middle finger at the woman and smirked when she glowered at her but she caught her lips twitching.</p><p>Maybe Alice was rubbing off on her. Maybe Jen was just softer than she looked.</p><p>But Rio went back to the view so she didn’t have to see Alice fumble her way through a goodbye, or even a kiss.</p><p>Less than thirty seconds later and she felt arms around her neck and a grinning idiot of a best friend pressing her face into her hair.</p><p>“She asked me out. You heard that? Like… for drinks. On a date.”</p><p>Rio only laughed in response and grasped Alice’s hands.</p><p>“Yes, I heard.”</p><p>Alice moved around and made Rio turn to her, holding her arms as she did.</p><p>“<em>You</em> are a fool if you think she’s not entirely into you.”</p><p>“I thought <em>you</em> were the fool today.”</p><p>Rio grinned and rolled her eyes, “I’m going to write her a note. And send a gift.”</p><p>“How very romantic of you. Be sure to sign it ‘from your biggest fan, sorry about trying to fuck your husband’.”</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks colour slightly but she ignored it and ignored Alice’s teasing grin as she moved back into the safety of the living room.</p><p>“Besides, you should actually be praising me for the number I did on Stark. I think he liked me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Alice said with a slow smile, “I’ve already heard from Potts. He <em>does</em> like you and he’s keeping you in mind for his next few projects.”</p><p>Rio whipped around so quickly she almost lost her balance.</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Do I ever joke about work?”</p><p>Rio huffed and then threw herself onto the couch.</p><p>“Sooo,” Alice continued in a slightly softer tone than before, moving around to stand before Rio and shrugging her light blazer off. “All <em>you</em> need to do is behave for the next few days. And be nice to Agatha. I want you back on her good side. And,” she draped herself on a nearby chair as Rio turned to look at her, “I might treat you.”</p><p>“Treat me?”</p><p>Alice hummed and tried to fight the smirk that threatened to give her away, but Rio knew her friend too well.</p><p>“Well… we’ve barely had a break for two years and we actually have a couple days free so I was considering taking you away.”</p><p>“Away?” Rio sat bolt up right and stared at Alice, feeling suddenly like a child promised the largest of the cookies available on the counter.</p><p>“If you get more than ten minutes’ ovation. I’ll take you away.”</p><p>“You can’t promise something and then put caveats on it.”</p><p>“Gives you something to focus on rather than spiralling about Agatha Harkness plotting to kill you.”</p><p>“You think she is?”</p><p>Alice laughed at the look of panic on Rio’s face and shook her head, “Jen said she’s just pissed at Ralph. She probably already knows you’re an idiot and nothing more. You're no real threat to Agatha Harkness, come on. I bet she barely thinks about you at all.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and threw herself back again. “Whatever. <em>I</em> got into the screening. You should be thanking me.”</p><p>Alice hummed and then laughed, “Fine. I’ll treat you. With your credit card, of course. But a couple days vacation I think will be good for us, don’t you think?”</p><p>“God,” Rio said with a grin, “I knew I loved you. I just never realised how much until this very moment.”</p><p>“Ha ha,” Alice said as she tucked her legs beneath her and reached for her nearby laptop, “I’ll find us somewhere nice. But you should go to sleep. Movie’s released tomorrow. Glam are coming first thing because you need to look <em>perfect</em> for your debut.”</p><p>Rio sighed and stood up.</p><p>“Make sure it’s luxurious.”</p><p>“Oh, it will be. It’s <em>your</em> credit card, remember?”</p><p>Rio only rolled her eyes and went to leave the room, thinking only now of the soft embrace of her bed.</p><p>But the sleep she so craved didn’t quite come.</p><p>Blue eyes and an angry stare were all she could think of and her worried mind didn’t relent until it was too late and her alarm was ringing as Alice kamikazed into her room.</p><p>“Up! Up!”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, having had maybe half an hour’s proper sleep all night.</p><p>A point that Alice picked up on immediately.</p><p>“Holy shit, did you sleep <em>at all</em>?”</p><p>Rio groaned, not having the energy to argue with Alice when she could barely lift herself from the bed.</p><p>“Maybe I should have booked more than just the four of them.”</p><p>“Shut. <em>Up</em>. This is my big day, you’re supposed to be nice to me on my big day.”</p><p>“I’d be nicer if you had done me a favour and not looked like absolute-…”</p><p>But Rio shot Alice a look and her best friend softened.</p><p>“Fine. Whatever. Shower and change and be out in ten. They’re coming soon and we’ll need all the time we can get.”</p><p>With that, Alice flew from the room, and Rio was left to her tired mind and nervous body.</p><p>All hopes of the highest honour of her industry rested on today. She needed the critics to rise to their feet and applaud her, to confirm that all the hype had been real and she wasn’t just some flash in a pan when Agatha was still the whole damn meal.</p><p>So she showered and fought down her fear of being a failure before she’d even begun.</p><p>Faint concerns about Agatha’s wrath filled her subconscious still but she had no time for concerns about that when she was being poked and pulled and painted.</p><p>She forced herself to make small talk, tried her best to concentrate when Alice was prepping her for the who’s who of the press who would be front and centre, and tried to focus in on the actress she knew she could be and not the flaming mess she currently felt.</p><p>Usually confident, calm, collected, Rio stepped from the black SUV with a nauseating feeling that she was walking to the gallows.</p><p>She could barely see for the flashes of cameras that surrounded her.</p><p>The only thing now grounding her to the moment was the rough feel of her director’s hand in her own, the soft whispers of “just wait, Rio. just you wait”.</p><p>His confidence was annoying.</p><p>His belief that what they’d made together were worthy of anything made her feel worse because if he were wrong then he would be crushed.</p><p>But they were stepping into the theatre now, with it’s high bolted ceilings and the grand sweep of seats around them.</p><p>Rio’s smile was plastered on her face and she felt like one of those marionettes taken out to dance for her crowd.</p><p>She didn’t dare to look around, couldn’t bear to see the amount of people looking at her, expectant that she would dazzle them.</p><p>“Just people, Rio,” Alice always said, “Look at their faces. Just people.”</p><p>But Rio was at her seat now, her hand empty where her director had released it to deliver his mawkish and self-aggrandising introduction.</p><p>She felt small in her seat, felt like she’d shrunk an inch or two as her shoulders rose close to her ears.</p><p>She wished she could run, or that Alice had been able to sit beside her.</p><p>She wanted to be swallowed whole by the black screen in front that threatened to show her face to the world, threatened to destroy her career with the too-high expectations on her.</p><p>But then there was an outbreak of applause and Rio saw her director motion to her, waving his hands at her to bring her up, to spin her around and to show her to the room.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and almost choked on it as she was shown off to the most influential journalists in the industry.</p><p>And there, sitting beside Jen in the middle of the sea of beaming faces was Agatha.</p><p>The applause seemed to slow, seemed to merge into one, heavy crash of hands.</p><p>Agatha was looking directly at her, her own hands moving in tandem with those around her, her eyebrows raised almost as if she was wondering why she were there herself, her smile widening the longer Rio stared.</p><p>And more devastating than anything that had happened to Rio that week, she winked.</p>

<p>Two hours and twenty four minutes.</p><p>That was how long Rio didn’t breathe for.</p><p>A new record, she thought.</p><p>At least one thing to be proud of.</p><p>Because she could no longer be objective about her performance. She could no longer believe what everyone had been telling her for weeks.</p><p>All she could see was herself playing dress up on the fifty foot screen before her.</p><p>The rough, calloused pads of her director’s fingers were brushing her knuckles every now and then and that was the only thing that kept Rio from bolting.</p><p>She wanted Alice. And she wanted to be alone.</p><p>The screening ended, the movie faded to black.</p><p>The credits rolled.</p><p>There was silence for a beat.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath.</p><p>The lights went on.</p><p>The noise started.</p><p>All around her the jubilant, thunderous applause began.</p><p>She was wrenched from her seat by her director and pulled into his arms without warning.</p><p>The noise seemed to intensify suddenly, as if her brain could initially only handle part of it and had now finally given in to all of it.</p><p>But when she was released she noticed the camera was in her face already and she had to force a smile but noticed the tears forming in her eyes must be real.</p><p>She hadn’t forced those.</p><p>The camera stayed and she saw herself reflected in it, felt the hands jostling her shoulders and squeezing her waist.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Her forced smile became real like a sudden morning light through the dusk.</p><p>Her audience was applauding her still, and Rio took a shot and turned to see, blinking owlishly to avoid letting her tears fall as her grin grew at the sight of her admirers.</p><p>Maybe the press and Alice had been right. Maybe she had a chance.</p><p>Alice was the first person she saw.</p><p>And Rio almost lost control right then and there because her best friend was crying real, proper tears.</p><p>Rio’s stomach lurched at the sight and she wanted to clamber up the two rows to get to her but all she could do was grin back at her, trying to convey to her that it was her win too.</p><p>She dared then to turn and see the rest of the crowd when she could no longer stomach watching her best friend when she couldn’t reach her.</p><p>There were faces she recognised and faces she didn’t; there were grins and smiled and appraising eyes on her from every angle.</p><p>And then there was Jennifer Kale, clapping along but leaning over and whispering urgently into the ear of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Rio caught her eye and felt her smile grow impossibly wider at the sight.</p><p>There were at least a thousand people there all clapping for Rio.</p><p>But Agatha was clapping for her too.</p><p>Agatha was smiling at her.</p><p>A hand wrapped around her waist and she was turned back around, but she looked back, just once, and over her shoulder she winked at Agatha, returning the gesture from before.</p><p>It felt heady; this new confidence she had.</p><p>She felt like she would conquer the world, like she could have anything she wanted, woo the woman who had no interest in her.</p><p>The applause lasted what felt like a lifetime after that and Rio’s cheeks felt so sore from all the smiling.</p><p>But her heart was full and she felt the drunk on the applause. And Rio recognised the secret part of herself that longed to look back at Agatha to confirm that she had been clapping, that she had been smiling, and how she’d reacted to her wink.</p><p>But as the applause began to die down, Rio was ushered out with the rest of the cast and crew and she faced straight ahead under the pretence of being cool, calm, confident.</p><p>There wasn’t time for Alice to get to her before she was ushered to her seat along the long table at the front of the little press room and Rio already felt the familiar glare of the cameras flashing all around her before the room was even half full.</p><p>“You ready for this, Vidal?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and grinned at her costar, leaning in conspiratorially to whisper to him as they took their places.</p><p>“Born ready, baby.”</p><p>Rio found Alice in the sea of faces and grinned at her as the questions began to come thick and fast.</p><p>Rio’s freshly acquired earpiece translated the languages other than English spoken in the room and this was working well until a Spanish reporter asked a question aimed at her costar.</p><p>“¿Te resultó distraído trabajar con Rio?”</p><p>“<em>Did you find it distracting working with Rio?</em>”</p><p>Only the translation that came through Rio’s earpiece wasn’t exactly right.</p><p>What Rio heard in English was instead: “Did you enjoy working with Rio?”</p><p>Without thinking, and knowing Alice would kill her if she gaged her response wrong, Rio reached for the arm of her handsome costar to stop him from answering a question that hadn’t been asked.</p><p>“Sorry,” she pulled her earpiece from her ear and looked directly at the reporter as she clarified: “¿Distrayente?” <em>Distracting?</em></p><p>“Sí, ser una mujer hermosa y todo.” <em>Yes, being a beautiful woman and all.</em></p><p>Sexist pig.</p><p>Rio could feel Alice’s eyes burning into her but she couldn’t look away because she’d lose her nerve.</p><p>“Uh,” Rio forced out a soft laugh, making herself appear less than the fury that she felt. “Steve, you’re being asked if you found me distracting? Because I’m beautiful?”</p><p>She turned to her costar and wriggled her brows, knowing she’d played it just right because the room tittered with laughter.</p><p>Steve turned to her with a slightly confused and then amused grin and Rio felt like kissing him when he responded easily, “Oh, we had a no eye contact rule so I wouldn’t melt before her and forget my lines. But we managed to make it work.”</p><p>Rio laughed again but this time it was genuine and she shot the room a megawatt grin, finding Alice in the crowd and seeing her shoot a subtle thumbs up.</p><p>Rio poked her tongue into the inside of her cheek and tried not to look too smug as the conversation moved on and talk of Rio distracting costars turned into festival gossip rather than headline fodder.</p><p>Nothing else was lost in translation so far as the rest of the press conference went and when it was over Rio was ushered into a small room where she’d have the opportunity to touch up her makeup and speak to Alice before more interviews were to go ahead.</p><p>“Risky behaviour, kid.”</p><p>“Paid off though,” Rio beamed as she pulled Alice into a tight hug.</p><p>“We’re getting you that Oscar,” Alice whispered into her ear and Rio laughed as she pulled back.</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>“Twelve minutes! Twelve minutes! And Rio, it was so good. Seeing the whole thing, with your performance just…”</p><p>And Alice began to well up.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio smiled as she tenderly swiped her thumbs below Alice’s watery eyes, anticipating the tears that would soon be falling.</p><p>“No crying today. I have about a million hours of interviews today and I can’t be thinking about anything other than ‘how the industry has changed since Me Too’.”</p><p>Alice laughed and pulled away, sniffing heavily so that Rio knew she was now properly crying.</p><p>But she’d been launched at by a makeup artist so couldn’t go after Alice as she kept turned from her and focused in on her phone.</p><p>“Closed lips, please,” came the soft words of the woman now brushing Chanel across her red lips.</p><p>Rio did as she was told and briefly relaxed under the tender care of the expert hired to make her look her best.</p><p>But Alice’s voice floated back into her ears just as she was tilting her head a little more to help the artist at work.</p><p>“By the way, Jen’s pissed. She thinks you’ll take it.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned her head so that the makeup artist tutted at her and she grimaced in apology.</p><p>“Wha?” She mumbled, trying not to open her lips too much.</p><p>“She came in with Agatha. Didn’t you see them? Got great seats. Imagine how easy all this would be if we had their power. But she saw it and loved it and she’s pissed because of it.”</p><p>Rio felt a flush of butterflies erupt in her stomach at this. Because if Jen loved it then there was a chance that Agatha did too.</p><p>Only she was trapped by the woman working the curve of her lips and she fought against herself to not just push her off and demand Alice find out Agatha’s opinion.</p><p>Another thirty seconds went by that felt like a lifetime and the woman had moved away to fetch a bronzer from her bag and Rio turned to Alice and said in such a rush that she wondered how Alice had understood her: “And Agatha what did Agatha think of it?”</p><p>Alice turned from where she was now sitting in a little director’s chair behind one of the cameras already set up, “Agatha? I don’t know. I’m sure she liked it. It was great, Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighed but said nothing else as she allowed her head to be turned by the makeup artist and her cheeks were painted with bronze.</p><p>She began twisting her hair in her fingers as a means to distract herself from the torturous mystery of Agatha’s opinion on her movie.</p><p>Perhaps her smile in the theatre had been nothing more than a friendly reassurance. Maybe she was smiling because she <em>hated</em> it or thought Rio was unbelievable as a woman on the brink of a breakdown, vulnerable and looking in all the wrong places for reassurance.</p><p>Maybe she just thought she was a hack.</p><p>But Rio sailed through the questions thrown at her - mostly because they were all variations on a theme so it didn’t take my brain power to do it - and she had thirty seconds in between to take a sip of coffee or have her lipstick reapplied.</p><p>Alice remained a silent observer, occasionally reminding Rio of a point she might want to bring up at the next interview or else telling her what bar she might meet Jen at later - the decision always changing.</p><p>And Rio floated through, her mind often elsewhere as she smiled and charmed and chatted.</p><p>She was thinking of the quiet evening she could have with Alice out with Jen.</p><p>She thought of where Alice might whisk her away to on vacation now it was confirmed that she’d had over ten minutes of applause.</p><p>She thought of Agatha now in Cannes alone, living down the hall of their swanky hotel, and the smile she’d given her that morning.</p><p>At around three, Rio was done with the junket and had moved on to a longer form interview with a journalist from <em>Vogue</em> which was to take place in a nearby restaurant.</p><p>Starving now and a little grumpy because of it, it took Alice breaking the surprise of their vacation to get Rio to smile again on their way to the location of the interview.</p><p>“Positano. Two full days, three nights. A little hillside villa with a pool.”</p><p>Rio groaned at the sight of the villa Alice had sent over to her email, flicking lustfully through the images of the place they could disappear to for two whole days.</p><p>“God, Alice. How much is this costing me?”</p><p>“Well I’ve managed to get the fridge filled and the wine fridge filled too so…” she grinned and shrugged, “I’m afraid it’s costing you quite a bit.”</p><p>Rio only laughed and tilted her head back in her seat, taking a second to fantasise about sitting by the pool with a drink in her hand.</p><p>“I don’t even care. I want to be there now.”</p><p>“Soon,” Alice promised with a smug smile as she returned her attention to her overflowing email inbox, “just a few more people to charm and we’ll be on our way.”</p><p>“Easier said than done,” Rio grumbled as the image of herself lying by the pool slowly dissolved in her mind and she was back in an air-conditioned SUV thinking about how to charm the next journalist.</p><p>Rio began to shuffle a little as they reached their destination and Alice took this as a sign that she was beginning to get tired so she placed a hand over her hand and squeezed it.</p><p>“Think of the villa. The vast amounts of wine and two days of uninterrupted pool time with your favourite person.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes but the reminder did help.</p><p>In fact, it helped so much that a promised two hour interview expanded into three and Rio Vidal not only charmed the interviewer, she managed to get a promise of an even longer middle page spread printed of it.</p><p>Alice was so happy about this result that she forgot to be nervous about her impending date with Jen for the rest of the day.</p><p>The only issue was: Rio had barely had a chance to eat anything.</p><p>She’d gone easy on the wine because of it but she’d been talking so much that she’d hardly touched the food they’d ordered. The one saving grace was that her interviewer had barely eaten either so there was little concern that any mention of Rio’s appetite (or apparent lack thereof) would be mentioned in the piece.</p><p>But it also meant that Rio was <em>hangry</em> and now she was alone with Alice back in their suite she could barely see for the red mist that had descended as they waited on a rushed room service order of burgers and fries.</p><p>“I can’t eat much. I have to look my best and my <em>best</em> is not <em>bloated</em>.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and began plucking at the soft tassels on one of the cushions in her lap, “You look beautiful. Jen is lucky. Stop working yourself up.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say, you don’t have a hot date tonight. You can just-…”</p><p>“Geez, thanks, pal!”</p><p>“You know what I meant,” Alice huffed softly, kicking Rio from where she sat just up from her on the couch.</p><p>“You just get to sit here and indulge and think about that Oscar on the horizon. It’s not too early to think about speeches, you know.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and sighed as she leant back in her seat, “A nomination is the win, Alice. Didn’t you say that just two months ago?”</p><p>“Yes, but that was before everyone realised what a contender you are! Screw Agatha! You’re winning. I promise you.”</p><p>But Alice’s optimism didn’t rub off on Rio until she got her greedy hands on the burger that arrived five minutes later.</p><p>She ate without breathing, she devoured without thinking, and then she was done and she could be herself again.</p><p>“That was so impressive. Maybe we should make you do a mukbang.”</p><p>“A what?” Rio asked absently as she began to steal fries from Alice’s half-finished plate.</p><p>“Nevermind. Something to think about.”</p><p>Rio only hummed quietly, intent on her continued thieving activities.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Do you just want my plate?”</p><p>“Yes please,” Rio said quickly, stealing the whole thing over to continue where Alice had left off.</p><p>Alice only rolled her eyes and Rio watched with a mouth full of burger as she disappeared into her room to get changed and shouted over her shoulder, “Rest up tonight, please! One more day of press and then we’re outta here.”</p><p>“Mm’kay,” Rio mumbled as she focused back in on the task at hand.</p><p>By the time Alice was back out Rio was on her back on the couch, clutching her stomach and feeling a little ashamed of herself for eating so much.</p><p>But Alice was twirling in a little black dress and grinning down at her and Rio sat up to admire the view properly.</p><p>“She’ll be putty in your hands.”</p><p>“Here’s hoping,” Alice smiled as she finished her twirl with an uncharacteristic flourish that made Rio laugh.</p><p>“Now,” she said, suddenly turning serious as she marched towards Rio and leant over her with her hands on her shoulders.</p><p>“Don’t wait up, okay? I’m hoping I’ll be back too late for you.”</p><p>“I’m hoping that too,” Rio smiled as she squeezed Alice’s forearms and grinned up at her.</p><p>“Pervert,” Alice accused with a grin as she pulled away and went to fetch her purse.</p><p>“Have a lovely, <em>quiet</em> evening, my friend!”</p><p>Rio flopped back down and waved vaguely in Alice’s direction before the door closed and she was left alone properly for the first time in a day.</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought back to the poolside of their vacation home and smiled to herself as she did.</p><p>But her gentle daydreaming only lasted so long as her mind drifted back to the day she just had and then the day before and then…</p><p>She sat slowly from her prone position and thought about it for only a second before she went to find the little desk in her room.</p><p>Left inexplicably by hotel staff in every corner of the world was a notepad and pen.</p><p>Only this notepad and pen were the fancy kind, the kind that were embossed and had nibs of actual ink.</p><p>Rio snatched the pen up, grateful she’d only had two glasses of wine at lunch so she could think straight as she put pen to paper and wrote out a note to Agatha.</p><p>It took longer than she anticipated and when she was done she had ink on her fingers and a strange nervous buzzing feeling in her stomach.</p><p>But having read it several times after rewriting it even more times, she was happy enough.</p><p>And saying something was better than not saying something.</p><p>And she thought what she’d written was better than nothing:</p><p>
<em>Agatha,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just a note of thanks for getting me and Alice tickets to your premiere.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Your performance was astounding. And I’m so grateful that we got to experience it surrounded by that energy. I’ll never forget it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And about the photos with Ralph. I’m so sorry it turned into a shadow on your day. It was nothing, less than nothing, and I hate that it looked like anything at all.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You deserved a day that was all about you and I’m sorry that I ruined even a tiny piece of it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Thank you again and enjoy the rest of your time here.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yours,<br/>
Rio.</em>
</p><p>So she folded it neatly, having blown on the ink for fear it wouldn’t dry, and slipped out into the grand hallway of her expensive hotel to sneak down the the Grace Kelly Suite where she knew Agatha to be.</p><p>Before indulging in the expensive but studio-subsidised room service menu, Rio had changed into a navy sweater and jeans, an outfit not intended to be seen by the waiting press of Cannes.</p><p>But Levi’s and The GAP were dressing up as far as Rio was concerned for the task she’d set out to do as she hesitated outside the door.</p><p>She took out the note and read it through once more, taking a deep breath as she folded it back over and bent down to slip it below the door.</p><p>But just as she had pressed half the note underneath, the door swung open and Rio was met with a pair of loafers staring back at her.</p><p>She groaned internally and slowly raised her gaze up the length of the one person she would rather not be seeing from this angle.</p><p>It felt too like a fantasy she’d once had.</p><p>Although Agatha had been wearing significantly fewer clothes and Rio hadn’t been clutching an apology note in her hand.</p><p>“Oh. Hey.”</p><p>She cleared her throat and straightened quickly, fighting off the blush that threatened to redden her whole face as she avoided eye contact.</p><p>“I, uh, just wanted to deliver this note.”</p><p>She dared to look up then, seeing Agatha’s brows raise and an amused smile tug at the sides of her lips.</p><p>“A note? How very old school of you.”</p><p>“I just,” Rio rolled her eyes, more at herself than Agatha and raised a hand to run through her hair, “I wanted to apologise for yesterday. And to thank you for… for getting us into the premiere.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent and Rio saw her purse her lips a little, appraising her for a second before she made a move and snatched the note hanging limply from her fingers.</p><p>“Ah! Hey!”</p><p>But Agatha had moved away before Rio got a chance to snatch it back and her face had gone beetroot red at the idea that Agatha was going to read it infront of her.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t, not yet. Wait until…”</p><p>Rio had taken two steps into the suite behind Agatha who had turned her back and was reading the little note.</p><p>Rio huffed loudly, making sure Agatha knew this was <em>not</em> what she’d had in mind when she’d written the note.</p><p>But she couldn’t do much other than tackle Agatha to steal it back and that wasn’t exactly an option.</p><p>“I… I didn’t think you’d be in, so,” she offered in a lame attempt to claw back some dignity as Agatha turned back around to her and stared at her with a look of soft surprise.</p><p>Rio became aware suddenly that they were both just standing in the middle of the open plan living space that Agatha had previously inhabited with her husband and now lived in alone.</p><p>She swallowed thickly and watched as blue eyes dropped to her throat which did nothing to help her blush.</p><p>“You didn’t need to write me a note,” Agatha said in a voice that took Rio off guard.</p><p>It was soft. Far from the teasing tone she’d expected.</p><p>“I mean,” Rio said with a shrug, feeling her heart rate slow now she knew Agatha at least wouldn’t laugh in her face, “you didn’t need to get us tickets. And… I <em>am</em> sorry about the Ralph thing. It really wasn’t anything and I didn’t want you to think I was trying to make it something.”</p><p>Blue eyes dropped back down to the note in her hands and Rio cleared her throat softly, unsure what to say next.</p><p>“I hope he didn’t leave because of me.”</p><p>Agatha looked back up then and Rio bit her lip where Agatha shook her head and began folding Rio’s note back up absently in her hands.</p><p>“No. He doesn’t really enjoy this anyway so I just told him to go home early. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, aware that Agatha was now slipping her note into her back pocket and she was watching Rio carefully.</p><p>“But Jen said he just touched your hand. Did he…?”</p><p>“No,” Rio clarified quickly, taking a step closer to Agatha without knowing why.</p><p>“He barely touched my hand even. It was just as I was leaving.”</p><p>But Agatha had moved on from the subject of Ralph as her eyes had fallen to Rio’s hands where she’d stepped forwards and she reached suddenly to take up her right hand, looking at the mess Rio had made with the ink earlier.</p><p>“Let me guess… not used to a fountain pen?”</p><p>Rio huffed but fought against the feeling of electricity when the pad of Agatha’s thumb brushed the pad of her forefinger and she felt a little faint as Agatha raised her gaze up to meet her own.</p><p>“It’s not as easy as it looks.”</p><p>“Then I appreciate the effort.”</p><p>Rio smiled in amusement, seeing the twitch in Agatha’s lips as she dropped her hand again.</p><p>“I would have bought you flowers but I assumed you already had too many of those after the premiere.”</p><p>“An excuse if ever I’ve heard one.”</p><p>Rio gaped at Agatha as she turned from her to take up her seat back on the couch and she gestured to the room around her, pointing out the various bouquets of flowers that littered the space.</p><p>She made a mental note to ask Alice why <em>she</em> hadn’t received any flowers.</p><p>“Have you see all of these?!”</p><p>“Another one wouldn’t hurt,” Agatha said with a shrug as she settled back and picked up her wine glass.</p><p>Rio moved closer to the edge of the couch and placed a hand on the back of it, watching Agatha look up at her innocently as she sipped her wine.</p><p>“And here I thought you appreciated my effort.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and then motioned to the couch, “Wine?”</p><p>“I…,” Rio’s smile faltered a little as she considered the offer.</p><p>On the one hand all she wanted to do was drink wine and talk to Agatha, on the other, she felt like that may lead to dangerous territory.</p><p>“I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“Suit yourself,” Agatha said with a small smile, as if she knew why Rio might be refusing her.</p><p>But Rio felt safer still standing, as if the couch between them were enough to absolve her of her crush.</p><p>They stayed silently looking at the other for a few seconds, Rio plucking at the couch distractedly as she took all that was Agatha Harkness in.</p><p>She looked relaxed and Rio realised that it was the first time she’d seen her in her own space - albeit her own space in a rented suite in a hotel - her hair was wild and verging on messy, her face makeup free, and her clothes much more casual than she’d seen her before.</p><p>It was intoxicating.</p><p>The softness of a woman so untouchable, so out of this world famous.</p><p>“I should go,” Rio said eventually, the silence hanging like a heavy blanket between them both.</p><p>She turned to leave and stopped only when she heard Agatha’s voice behind her, louder than it had been before.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio paused and then turned on the spot, a perfect pirouette for a woman who had spent her childhood on the basketball court rather than in the dance studio.</p><p>“You were mesmerising up there today. Really. I couldn’t keep my eyes off of you.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and felt it settle uncomfortably in her throat, as if her body refused to take it in properly when Agatha’s words had sucked all the oxygen out of the room.</p><p>“Thank you,” she managed to say, unsure what else she <em>could</em> say.</p><p>Agatha just looked across at her, one leg tucked below her, her wine glass held balanced on her knee. Rio’s fingers twitched at her sides and then she turned to leave, favouring what she could have said rather than ruining the compliment with something unworthy of it.</p><p>She stepped from Agatha’s suite as quickly as possibly, practically running back down the hall to get to her own.</p><p>And once inside the safety of her suite, she exhaled the breath she’d been holding, and rested back against the closed door, trying to shake the adrenaline that caused her heart to race in her chest.</p><p>It felt cruel that Agatha had such an impact on her.</p><p>A punishment from a chaotic universe for what, Rio couldn’t fathom.</p><p>She needed to do something to take her mind off of her. Alcohol was out of the question because now she knew she was alone down the hall she didn’t trust herself to not go and knock on the door when she’d had a few, demand to know why she looked at her the way she did, why she had a memory of Agatha pressed so close in a Chicago bar.</p><p>Movies and tv she couldn’t focus on. They were glaring reminders of their shared industry. And therefore glaring reminders of Agatha, whether she were on the screen or not.</p><p>She marched through to her bedroom, deciding a couple melatonin would help to calm her without sending her into outer space.</p><p>It was as she picked up the little tub of pills from the desk that she spotted the remainder of the Hotel-provided paper. And she was suddenly inspired.</p><p>It was cheesy, maybe.</p><p>Stupid, definitely.</p><p>But just doing it didn’t mean she’d give her it.</p><p>And it would be a good distraction from her racing heart and mind for a least a few minutes before she forced herself to sleep.</p><p>She set up her phone against the mirror on the desk and settled herself in the seat, flicking through until she found an easy enough video to follow entitled: ‘Easy Origami Rose’.</p><p>It took a few attempts and therefore longer than a few minutes but eventually Rio was satisfied with her output and in the palm of her hand she now held the flower she should have given Agatha in the first place. Or at least, a small, paper version of one.</p><p>The hotel paper was a pale blue and therefore the rose was too, and Rio thought it was cute and maybe, maybe Agatha would appreciate the effort, just like she had with the note.</p><p>She knew Agatha could laugh in her face when she handed it over but something told her she might not. And that tiny slither of hope was what Rio focused on after popping her melatonin and clambering into bed for a necessary sleep.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, unimpressed by the soft weight of the body lying across her and shouting directly into her ear.</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>Rio huffed out a heavy breath, scowling into the pillow and wriggling a little to dislodge Alice. It didn’t work.</p><p>“Get. Off.”</p><p>“Don’t you want to hear about my date?”</p><p>Rio groaned as Alice eventually rolled off of her and she attempted to pull the duvet over her head, trying to hide from the light.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Rio gave in, knowing she was on a lose lose anyway.</p><p>“Fine. Fine.” She flopped back over and squinted up at Alice who was beaming down at her.</p><p>“You look like shit.”</p><p>“Good morning to you too.”</p><p>“I got in at three,” Alice said with a sly smile that made Rio perk up a little and slowly shuffle into a sitting position at the top of the bed.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“We just talked all night. She invited me back to her room and-…”</p><p>“Alice you dirty dog,” Rio laughed and shoved at her friend’s shoulder roughly.</p><p>“No, no!” Alice laughed with her friend and shoved her right back, “We just talked. Nothing more. Maybe a little kissing but… nothing below the belt.”</p><p>“What about the shirt?”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes and began to shuffle from the bed as Rio guffawed and reached to pull her back to her but missed by centimetres.</p><p>“Wait! Wait! Details!”</p><p>“No, I’m a lady. And so is Jen so I will not fuel your dirty little mind with tawdry details.”</p><p>Rio laughed harder at this and eventually threw herself from the bed and onto Alice, kissing her cheek in earnest and forcing a laugh from the smaller woman.</p><p>“I,” kiss, “am,” kiss, “so,” kiss, “happy,” kiss, “for,” kiss, “you.”</p><p>Alice eventually managed to wriggle from Rio’s clutches and made to leave the room laughing when she spotted the little rose garden sprouting on Rio’s desk.</p><p>“What the fuck?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said flatly, seeing where Alice’s gaze had fallen, “yeah, I… got bored.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows and shot Rio a look of surprise, “We need to get you a girlfriend. Better things you can do with those fingers.”</p><p>And before Rio could react, Alice disappeared from the room and closed the door behind her, “I thought you were a lady!”</p><p>“Get ready! You have ten minutes!” Alice shouted right back.</p><p>Rio huffed and shot her late night gardening efforts one last look before she disappeared into the bathroom to shower.</p><p>There was just one more day left of torture before she would be lounging by the pool, free of the pressures of looking and being perfect all the time, free of needing to be anything for anyone.</p><p>All she had to do today was smile and get through.</p><p>And, she decided as she stepped from the shower, she had plenty of time to decide whether or not she’d give her handmade flower to Agatha.</p><p>She’d just take it with her today and if she happened to see her then… maybe she would.</p><p>Once she had changed into something unflattering and that would drive Alice crazy because it wasn’t “good for the gram”, she swiped the best of the flowers and went to sit in her usual seat for the glam squad to work their magic.</p><p>This morning she felt considerably lighter than the previous two mornings.</p><p>The movie had gone down well.</p><p>The press had all gone smoothly.</p><p>Alice was happy with her performance (the slight glitch with Ralph now forgotten).</p><p>And Agatha Harkness thought she was mesmerising.</p><p>As she toyed with the little rose in her now ink-free fingers she could enjoy the glamour of it all again; the soft touches of the people around her drying and fluffing her hair, the brushes against her skin making her look dewy in the morning light, and the woman now touching up her manicure to match the white dress she had for the day.</p><p>Even better, she had a two day vacation to focus on after a short day of more press.</p><p>“Um, Rio?”</p><p>Rio started a little from where she’d been staring out at the blue skies above, her free hand still toying with the matching flower she held.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I…,” Alice stepped into her line of vision and the look on her face made Rio sit up straighter, pulling away from the hands that preened her.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Jen’s just text.”</p><p>Rio glanced down at the phone in Alice’s hands and then her gaze flickered up again and she held her breath as she dropped her rose in her lap and reached for Alice.</p><p>“I might have invited them.”</p><p>Rio’s hand made contact with Alice’s wrist and she stared at her as if she’d just spoken Greek to her.</p><p>“Invited who?”</p><p>“Jen and Agatha.”</p><p>“Invited them where?”</p><p>Alice looked up slowly and met Rio’s gaze for the first time since she’d interrupted the glam squad around them and with a sinking feeling Rio suddenly realised what Alice meant.</p><p>“No. No. Absolutely not.”</p><p>“It’s just that… well Jen said she’s changed their flights.”</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“I… don’t even know what to say. I was a little drunk I…”</p><p>But the hairstylist was moving close again to sort Rio’s hair and so Alice was jostled away as the others moved back, mumbling apologies about the time they had left.</p><p>Rio looked away from her friend, unable to comprehend a world where she’d opened up their sneaky little trip away to two people she barely knew.</p><p>Alice knew she needed to give Rio space and she went to take a seat on the couch behind them. And Rio, Rio was now spinning the rose in her palm as if she span it fast enough it might rewind time and stop Alice from inviting her crush to their one precious vacation.</p><p>But time kept moving as it usually does and Rio was faced with changing into her little white dress with a guilt-ridden Alice in the corner of her room, moving close only when Rio needed held with the zipper.</p><p>“It has two rooms,” Rio said sharply, every detail of this trip now spinning round and round in her mind.</p><p>“I’ll be with you, obviously.”</p><p>“They can’t get their own villa?”</p><p>“I… I think Jen wants…”</p><p>“Agatha makes twenty a picture. She can afford-…”</p><p>“Rio, I think… I think she wants to stay with us because…”</p><p>“You’re there,” Rio snapped, feeling only slightly guilty when she saw Alice flinch.</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>She stormed out of the room, almost crushing the rose she’d spent so long perfecting the night before.</p><p>Alice only followed her silently out to the waiting car and if anyone had been paying attention to Rio Vidal and her manager over the past three days they’d have noticed this stark change in behaviour.</p><p>They were usually side by side, or arm in arm, either talking or laughing, or sometimes whispering.</p><p>Never was there a foot between them. Never were they silent.</p><p>But when they got in the car Alice spoke again, and this time Rio listened.</p><p>“I’ll tell her she can’t. I’ll say I was drunk and wasn’t thinking and-…”</p><p>But Rio’s rose-free hand flew over to Alice’s knee and she sighed quietly as Alice went silent.</p><p>“It’s fine. I just… I wanted a couple days just to be us and now…”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I don’t know either of them and, god Alice, Agatha Harkness? Seriously? Why does she have to come?”</p><p>And therein lied the issue. Jen was one thing, a snarky interruption on their vacation. But Agatha? Agatha laid out by the pool. Agatha drunk in the sun. Agatha close by.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure she could handle it. And even if she could, she’d be a mess the whole trip.</p><p>“I think Jen just wants a friend.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and shook her head as Alice went to take her hand, “Are you sure it’s okay?”</p><p>“I… yeah. Fine. You really like her?”</p><p>“I <em>really</em> like her. And now maybe this means she really likes me too?”</p><p>Rio looked up then and caught Alice’s tentative gaze, and couldn’t help but give in to her. She squeezed her hand and offered her a small smile because she couldn’t offer much more as nervous as she was about this new development.</p><p>“I think it means she does.”</p><p>Alice’s shoulders relaxed a bit then, shrinking down from where they’d been hovering near her ears and she shifted a little to get more comfortable in her seat.</p><p>“They’re not on the same flight at least. They get in a little later than us because of the Ceremony later so we can pick the best room and have some dinner and then…”</p><p>“Then figure out how the hell we’ll get through the next couple days.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows and smiled warmly, “Jen is great. And Agatha is apparently great too. Plus it’ll give you an opportunity to get closer to her. She’d be a really good ally to have and-…”</p><p>“I think we’re close enough.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t hurt, Rio. Just… please try and be as charming as you can be.”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze to the flower in her hand and began to brush the tips of the petals with her thumb, taking each one in turn.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll be on my best behaviour.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Their reconciliation was cut short when they arrived at another hotel were more press interviews were happening.</p><p>Rio was ushered through the grand lobby and out to a courtyard garden where she was offered orange juice in a champagne flute and asked to wait until they were ready for her.</p><p>At least this way, she got some sun before being locked away for hours on end in a stuffy room with stuffier people asking the same old questions.</p><p>Alice had abandoned her in favour of finding the list of journos soon to be boring her client to death and so Rio hovered by the table draped in white linen and covered in breakfast pastries.</p><p>“Good morning,” came a familiar voice through the greenery, and Rio turned to see Agatha striding towards her looking far more glamorous than she had the night before in a blue and white striped dress and red lipstick.</p><p>“I hear we’re crashing your vacation.”</p><p>“I hear you make twenty a picture and you’re kicking me out of my room to bunk with Jen.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and accepted her orange juice with a smile before turning back to Rio, “Who am I to get in the way of burgeoning romance?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, catching a glimmer of amusement in Agatha’s blue and she felt the urge to one up her, to throw her off course so she turned her hand palm up and held out the rose she’d made her.</p><p>“For you,” she said simply, watching bright blue eyes fly down to the pale paper flower in her hand. And there, Rio caught Agatha suck in a short and sharp intake of breath, her lips parting a little in shock as Rio waited patiently for her to take it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move for a second, her eyes still on the little flower. Rio briefly considered moving for her, forcing her into action, but she held her ground and it soon paid off because Agatha had stepped closer and was now just lightly touching the petals of the rose with her forefinger, the way Rio had earlier in the car.</p><p>“I made it. I thought you’d appreciate the effort.”</p><p>This close up, Agatha was no less beautiful. And with her gaze down on the flower, Rio had the opportunity to take her in properly without fear of being caught.</p><p>She’d been made up today to look like she barely had any makeup on at all. A clever trick, Rio had always thought, because usually that meant you were wearing more makeup than an average person wore in a week.</p><p>But Agatha wore it well. Her skin still looked like skin and Rio could see the faint freckles that were scattered sporadically over her nose and cheeks. She could see the slight sea change of colour in her eyes that made them sometimes bright blue and other times strangely green.</p><p>And those eyes were now looking across at her, taking her in the way Rio had just done with Agatha. Though, Agatha was bolder with it because where Rio had the privacy of Agatha’s gaze being away from her, Rio was looking directly at Agatha as she did it.</p><p>“You made it for me?”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Along with a few others but… this was my best one.”</p><p>She held her hand up a little higher, holding it so Agatha would take it.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped down to it again and she seemed hesitant at first and then picked it up and held it in her own hand and Rio felt a spark of pride that her creation now sat cradled in Agatha Harkness’s hand like it were something precious.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have.”</p><p>“I wanted to.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze again and they both smiled, Rio losing herself for a moment as she stared across at Agatha and wondered what it might be like to be this close to her all the time.</p><p>But Agatha was moving and Rio was powerless to stop it - not that she would have if she had the choice.</p><p>Agatha’s hand holding the flower had curled around it, moving down to rest on Rio’s hip as she pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s left cheek and then moved around to deliver the same to her right.</p><p>She’d received multiple kisses just like this one since arriving in France but this was the first time she felt aflame because of it.</p><p>And Agatha’s hand still at her hip wasn’t helping.</p><p>“Merci,” Agatha whispered softly, her face still close enough that Rio could make out the green in her blue eyes again, her hand still lightly against her hip.</p><p>But the whispered French had unwittingly brought back memories of Ralph speaking the word to her two days ago, his cloying, clanging American twang turning it into something embarrassing where Agatha had curled her lips around it, softening her accent until it was something else entirely.</p><p>Rio wondered how this goddess was married to that nothing of a man.</p><p>A good husband only because he was handsome and rich and not because he valued his wife’s talent and achievements, or even remained loyal to her.</p><p>And certainly not because he spent time to create a flower for her with his own two hands.</p><p>But she couldn’t think like that. Not with Agatha now coming away with her and Alice.</p><p>She had to distance the part of her that wanted to kiss Agatha from the part of her that wanted to survive the next two days without going mad.</p><p>There was a noise behind them and they both turned to see Alice beaming across at them. Agatha’s hand slipped away from Rio’s hip and Rio felt like she could breathe again.</p><p>“Agatha! Hi! So glad you could make it to Italy!”</p><p>Rio shot her a look over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Rio, they’re ready for you.”</p><p>Rio nodded and in lieu of saying goodbye to Agatha in the way she’d just thanked her she turned around and reached for a croissant, taking it with her as she brushed past Agatha.</p><p>Saying ‘goodbye’ or ‘see you later’ felt too formal so she simply smiled over her shoulder at Agatha and entered back into the main part of the hotel.</p><p>The interviews flew by because Rio wasn’t really thinking about them.</p><p>She was thinking about the way Agatha had looked at her, the way she’d remained close, how she’d held her when there was no need.</p><p>Maybe she was delusional, she didn’t really care, because the idea that Agatha Harkness might find her even slightly appealing, attractive, charming, made her want to whoop in delight.</p><p>When the last journalist left the stuffy little room and Alice and Rio were left alone with the crew Alice finally asked the question she’d been sitting on all day: “Why’re you so happy? What happened?”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and stood from her seat, stretching briefly before she marched on over and like a kid in love, she grinned as she kissed her best friend’s forehead.</p><p>“Just excited for Italy.”</p><p>Alice frowned her suspicions up at her friend but said nothing and instead began to gather their things.</p><p>They both thanked the crew and left to head back to the hotel.</p><p>Rio’s good mood lasted all the way to Italy.</p><p>Even when Alice was going over and over their schedule for when they got back to the states. Even when Alice was worrying out loud about whether or not a weekend away with Jen so early in their tentative relationship would make or break them. Even when they landed and had to travel from Naples to Positano along the high, winding coastal roads of the Amalfi Coast.</p><p>But her good mood paid off because the villa looked even better in real life.</p><p>Situated above on the hillside above the colourful bay, the sand-coloured villa was as impressive on the outside as it was inside.</p><p>The open-plan living kitchen area was spacious and Alice soon discovered that her planning ahead had paid dividends: the wine fridge was stocked and the cupboards, pantry, and fridge were full of fresh local ingredients and snacks.</p><p>But Rio was more interested in the outside space.</p><p>The pool was large and overlooked the hillside with a glass barrier a foot from the edge of the clear blue water, protecting the villa from the cliff edge.</p><p>There was a little dining area to the side and a handful of sun beds dotted around the space.</p><p>But the view.</p><p>The view was unreal.</p><p>Rio lost herself scanning the hillside and looking down over the bay until Alice appeared at her side and gasped quietly.</p><p>“Holy shit. I love that you’re rich now.”</p><p>Rio just laughed and stole Alice back inside, so they could toast to their mutual success that allowed for this kind of villa to be available to them.</p><p>“Okay okay,” Alice said after half a glass of wine on the terrace.</p><p>“But we have to pick a room.”</p><p>“The best one,” Rio said with narrowed eyes at her friend. “You promised we’d get the best one.”</p><p>“Well, seeing as we’re both trying to impress our guests…”</p><p>“Alice, no. Come on. This is <em>our</em> vacation.”</p><p>Alice chewed on her lip and remained silent for a while before she finally said, “Think of how many doors would open if you got Agatha on side.”</p><p>Rio threw her head back, unwilling to share her deep, dark, embarrassing belief that Agatha might just have a little thing for her.</p><p>She was sure she had her as much on side as she ever could.</p><p>“I haven’t had a day off in months.”</p><p>“I know but…”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said suddenly, throwing her hands out, “Whatever. Let them have the best one. I don’t want to fight anymore.”</p><p>They remained silent for a little while and Rio could feel Alice’s eyes on her.</p><p>But she didn’t cave.</p><p>“I think she’s incredible.”</p><p>Rio looked across at Alice and smiled, “I know you do.”</p><p>“And she loves Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faded a little and she turned away.</p><p>“So being friends with her will not only help <em>you</em> but it would also help me.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, “We’re friendly, Alice. Don’t try to push anything. We’re… feeling each other out. She’s complex.”</p><p>“But you’re not.”</p><p>Rio grinned and took a sip of wine, “Are you calling me shallow?”</p><p>“More like… straight forward. A little arrogant. Easily amused.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and wondered how Alice would react to her telling her she was in the midst of a near zen-like high because Agatha had accepted a paper flower from her several hours ago and had kissed her cheek.</p><p>“Sure, let’s go with that.”</p><p>It took them finishing the bottle of wine for them to actually head up the stairs with their bags and claim the less incredible of the rooms. Which was hard. Because both were incredible.</p><p>But Alice decided the one with the blue walls just beat the one with the pink because it had a free-standing bath in the en suite.</p><p>“Jen might like that.”</p><p>Rio had just rolled her eyes, annoyed that she had to lug her bags back across the hall to the other room.</p><p>Once their bags were offloaded and Rio made an acceptable but not astounding pasta dish, they retired to the couch where Alice forced Rio to stay until their guests arrived.</p><p>Rio’s earlier high at the prospect of her straight peer potentially having less than straight thoughts about her had disappeared. Perhaps it was the exhaustion creeping in, perhaps it was the wine she’d consumed, or maybe the bowl and a half of pasta puttanesca, but she suddenly didn’t feel so optimistic about Agatha’s arrival.</p><p>But Rio Vidal fell asleep on the couch, curled around a cushion and was woken up around two in the morning by Alice shouting her name and running to the door.</p><p>“They’re here?” She asked groggily, fighting the urge to just roll back over and go to sleep.</p><p>But Jen’s voice carried through the space and Rio groaned quietly as she sat up and dug the heels of her hands into her eyes.</p><p>Maybe the second bottle of wine had been a bad idea.</p><p>“This place is gorgeous!”</p><p>Rio groaned again and forced herself to stand up, running her hand through her hair at the last minute to try to fix what was already broken.</p><p>“God it’s-… Jesus, Rio. Make an effort, much?”</p><p>Rio blinked at the sudden insult and glanced down at herself before she moved around the couch towards the waiting women.</p><p>Two smiling at her, one with an amused smirk.</p><p>“A pleasure to have you here with us on <em>our</em> vacation, Jen.”</p><p>Alice jabbed Rio’s side and Rio only just managed to squirm away. She felt Agatha’s eyes on her as she did so.</p><p>“Alice invited us,” Jen said with a grin that had softened somewhat and Rio glanced at Alice to see her looking suddenly shy.</p><p>“Well we’re pleased to have you.”</p><p>“And here I thought you were a <em>good</em> actress,” Jen said with a smirk just as Rio’s gaze moved to Agatha as she strode towards the bifold glass doors to take in the view outside.</p><p>“Very funny.”</p><p>“Now, Agatha here just won the <em>Palme D’Or</em>.”</p><p>Rio was still looking at Agatha and watched as she turned from where she stood by the glass doors to look at them with raised brows, her gaze lingering on Rio for a second, “The film won. Not me.”</p><p>“Same thing.”</p><p>“Oscar’s ours, baby,” Jen said in a softer tone and Rio didn’t have to look around to know that she was now talking only to Alice.</p><p>Rio scoffed softly but decided she was too tired to either charm or scorn so she disappeared to get a glass of water.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice shouted after her, “Could you get some wine?”</p><p>Rio could only hum a response and grabbed two more glasses and a fresh bottle before she turned back towards the living area of the space and poured three glasses, avoiding her own.</p><p>“You’re not staying?”</p><p>“I would but I’m exhausted.”</p><p>“Refusing to drink wine with me two nights in a row, Vidal? I’ll start to get offended.”</p><p>Tried brown eyes flickered across to teasing blue ones and Rio bit the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“Third time’s the charm. Perhaps you’ll get lucky tomorrow.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that be a thing.”</p><p>Agatha moved forwards to pick up her glass and they maintained eye contact, Rio feeling a little stupefied by the obvious flirting and only Alice rocked her from her trance.</p><p>“We’ll go to the beach tomorrow.”</p><p>But as Rio looked up at her friend she saw that she was already back engrossed in Jen, her face lit up with the prospect of two days (practically) alone with her.</p><p>On the couch, Agatha was watching Rio, and it took Rio a second to notice but when she looked back down, Agatha had looked away.</p><p>She hesitated for just a second before she turned on her heel and trod the path up to her designated bed for the night.</p>

<p>Rio woke to a pillow to her face and yelped as she sat bolt upright, cradling the offending weapon to her.</p><p>“Alice!”</p><p>“Get up! We only have two days here. I want to make the most of it. And you need to tell me what to wear to look <em>irresistible</em>”

</p><p>Rio huffed and rolled over, “I pay your wages, you know.”</p><p>“Yes, I know. Pay me more, bitch.”</p><p>Rio laughed as Alice jumped onto the bed behind her and began to shake her shoulders playfully, attempting to annoy her out of bed. </p><p>“Get off! Get off!”</p><p>Rio shuffled away and flopped onto her back, scowling at a grinning Alice. </p><p>“You’re too giddy. I don’t like this Alice. What happened to my brooding, charmingly grumpy friend?”</p><p>“She’s in looooove,” Alice sang out and laughed as she threw herself from the bed and went to fetch her outfit options for the day. </p><p>“Alice,” Rio said steadily, sitting slowly to look at across at her with what she hoped was a stern expression but the twitch to the right of her lips gave her away a little.</p><p>“Don’t go all goo-goo ga-ga on me. I can’t handle it.”

</p><p>“Shut up. Just help me pick.”</p><p>“I can’t believe this is what my vacation has turned into.”</p><p>Alice looked guilty suddenly and her smile faded from her face, “I know. I’m sorry. You know I didn’t-…”

</p><p>“It’s fine.” </p><p>Rio sighed heavily and ungracefully hauled herself from the bed, yawning as she arrived at Alice’s side and surveyed the options laid out before her. </p><p>“Well, I mean…” she held up a teeny tiny bikini top and held it against her own chest, “Who could resist?”</p><p>“Stop that,” Alice laughed and grabbed it back, “I’d wear a shirt over it.”</p><p>“No way.” Rio reached to take it back and grinned down at it, “This’ll give her a heart attack.”</p><p>“I don’t want a heart attack. I want at least some above the bikini action before we have to head back to our real lives.”</p><p>“Alice, this will get you more than that. I promise you.”</p><p>Alice huffed but Rio could see the smirk threatening her best friend’s features, “red one it is.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio announced as she made her way to the adjoining bathroom, yawning again and stretching her arms up in the air to release any tension from the previous night. “I’ll be down in ten. Don’t leave without me.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at the sarcastic drawl of her giddy friend and disappeared to shower. </p><p>Beneath the heavy waterfall, Rio took slow and steady breaths, taking the time to convince her mind and body that today would be easy. She needed to believe it because she’d not felt this nervous around another human being since middle school.</p><p>Agatha’s presence was a constant pull towards the version of Rio that was incredibly uncool and incredibly downbad for the cheerleader who once smiled at her in the hallway but otherwise barely acknowledged her presence. </p><p>But she had to get through it, had to find a way to be friendly, for the sake of her career, and for the sake of Alice’s burgeoning relationship with Jen. </p><p>So she got out, dried herself, and slipped into a black bikini, denim short shorts, and a Hawaiian overshirt that Alice hated but that Rio loved. </p><p>She barely glanced in the mirror, knowing makeup would be the wrong choice for a day by the beach and her hair would dry naturally anyway. </p><p>Plus she had no one to impress. </p><p>Technically.</p><p>Rio was the last one down to the little group and smiled at the expectant faces of the three people waiting for her. </p><p>“Lookin’ good, Vidal,” Alice shot at her with a wink, “but you’d look better if you took that shirt off.”</p><p>Rio laughed and muttered, “Heard that one before.” 

</p><p>“Is that… cowboys?” Jen asked with a frown, tilting her head to get a proper look at the print of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“You’re darn right it is.”</p><p>“Oh god,” Alice groaned out, “don’t get her started.”</p><p>“What? I’m kidding! That isn’t very rootin’ tootin’ of you, Alice.”</p><p>A soft noise behind her made Rio turn and she caught Agatha’s eye, seeing her smile a little in amusement at her, her gaze dropping briefly to the cowboys flying their lassos over Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“Cute.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this but said nothing, ignoring the lurch in her stomach as it happened.</p><p>But Alice was desperate to get them to the beach, desperate to show off for Jen, and Rio didn’t protest as she made a fuss about all grabbing their stuff to leave.</p><p>Rio complained only when Alice refused to let her make a coffee first but as they stepped into the sun, she found Agatha pressing a mug into her hand, “Here. Just made it. Already had one.”</p><p>Unsure whether this was just a kind gesture or a dig at Rio being the last up, Rio accepted it all the same, and happily drank Agatha’s coffee all the way down to the beach.</p><p>Alice had done her research and had picked the smaller of the beaches in the area, Fornillo Spiaggia, so that they’d hopefully be less bothered by tourists and fans.</p><p>Rio had brought with her a trusty, dusty blue cap to be as incognito as possible and she noticed that Agatha had been thinking along the same lines but had a woven hat with a floppy wide brim instead.</p><p>Rio was a little luckier, she supposed, she could potentially be mistaken for any old Italian beachgoer, but Agatha was clearly a movie star.</p><p>On the way down to the sand, Alice broached the subject of shared photos and Agatha politely but firmly declined, offering no reasoning behind her refusal but allowing her “no” to speak for itself.</p><p>Rio ought to have been offended by this but she couldn’t find it in herself to care much. Neither Agatha nor Jen were supposed to be on this vacation anyway, so what did she care if there was photographic evidence they were. “Looks good for the brand,” Alice muttered in annoyance to her as they set themselves up.</p><p>Jen insisted that Agatha be on the inside of the little group of four, for fear she’d be spotted too easily if on the outside.</p><p>This, Agatha protested too, but her “no” this time was ignored.</p><p>And although Rio was disgruntled that Agatha would be beside her all day, she couldn’t help but be amused by the sight of Agatha not getting her own way with Jen. Their relationship felt a lot like hers and Alice’s. Which meant that Agatha Harkness might just be human after all.</p><p>Pretending to not notice the quiet discussion beside her as it was ongoing, Rio unfurled her towel and stripped down to her bikini, throwing her shorts and shirt over the end of her bed.</p><p>She fished out the sun lotion from her bag and was just about to apply some to her legs when she heard a voice beside her ask: “Can I have that after you?”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha, now sitting on her own sunbed with her hat still on her head and an expectant look on her face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio said slowly, doing her best not to look at the expanse of pale skin on offer to her with Agatha in a mauve bikini. “It’s just…” but there was no use, she had to look, but only because it was relevant to the conversation.</p><p>She glanced down and spotted a smattering of freckles across Agatha’s chest, unwilling to look any further, she looked back up. “You’ll burn.”</p><p>“That’s why I want the lotion,” Agatha said, raising her brows and straightening her back a little, which only made it harder for Rio to maintain eye contact.</p><p>“No, I mean, I’ve SPF 15. You’ll surely need stronger.”</p><p>A look of incredulity flashed across Agatha’s face and she laughed a little, “So you won’t share it which will mean I’ll burn anyway?”</p><p>“That isn’t what I meant. I just meant…” she looked around and saw Alice applying lotion to Jen’s back and had to fight the grin from her face, knowing how thrilled Alice would be about this honour.</p><p>“Maybe ask Jen and Alice.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned to do just that but quickly turned back around to Rio and shook her head, holding her hand out to her, “They’re busy. Gimme.”</p><p>Rio huffed and handed the lotion across, and only in doing so did she realise she was yet to put any on herself.</p><p>She threw herself back down on the bed and waited impatiently for Agatha to be done, refusing to look around at what was surely to be an incredible sight of Agatha rubbing lotion all over her body.</p><p><em>Pervert</em>, she thought idly to herself.</p><p>A light tap on her shoulder a few minutes later told her that Agatha was done with her sun cream and Rio lifted to her elbows to take it from her, frowning a little as she did.</p><p>She lifted her glasses and a slow smile spread over her face as Agatha looked at her quizzically, “What is it?”</p><p>“You’ve got a little…” Rio motioned near her own nose and smiled wider when Agatha missed it entirely and somehow rubbed more cream across the bridge of her nose.</p><p>“Here,” Rio offered as she swung her legs over the side of the bed and reached to gently wipe the lotion from Agatha’s nose. She realised only when she pulled her hand away that she’d been holding her breath as she did this, and she flushed slightly at the realisation.</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha muttered quietly, her own cheeks slightly flushed and her eyes darting about Rio’s face.</p><p>They watched each other for a second and Rio felt the familiar butterflies in her stomach as she met Agatha’s gaze but she soon turned away and busied herself with the bottle so she didn’t have to look at Agatha again.</p><p>By the time she was done, she lay back out and sighed as she stretched an arm above her on the sun bed, allowing the heat of the day to soothe her of the knowledge that right beside her was Agatha Harkness, lying in a similar position, in a bikini that Rio had decided she couldn’t look at again for fear she’d combust.</p><p>“Rio,” the voice came close to her ear and Rio frowned a little, her whole body hot and uncomfortable in the midday sun, but Alice was persistent, and shook Rio’s shoulder, “you’ll want to wake up for this. Jet skis. Come on.”</p><p>Rio blinked her way awake, frowning into the brightness even with her sunglasses and cap on.</p><p>She first noticed Alice crouched beside her and then spotted Jen and Agatha a little way down the beach by the shed where the water sports equipment could be rented.</p><p>“How long was I asleep?”</p><p>“Do me a solid,” Alice said urgently, “share one with Agatha. I want to share with Jen and if you-…”</p><p>“No. Alice. No. That would be <em>insane</em>.”</p><p>Alice whined a little and took Rio’s hand when she sat up properly and swung her legs over the edge.</p><p>“Just ask Jen if she’d share.”</p><p>“No I don’t want to seem too keen.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio laughed, “Like inviting her on vacation? And me asking Agatha to share isn’t going to look too keen?”</p><p>“You’re friends, sorta, there’s nothing romantic there, it’s different.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and turned around to look over at the two by the shed, seeing Jen wave them over. Agatha was at least wearing a large linen shirt now, her long hair loose now she didn’t have her hat on and the large sunglasses covering her blue eyes.</p><p>Maybe she could do it.</p><p>Maybe she could just ignore the closeness and focus on the driving.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said stiffly, turning back to Alice, “Don’t ask me for anything else this trip, okay?”</p><p>Alice beamed up at her from where she was resting against the back of her ankles and kissed the back of Rio’s hand. “Yes. Thank you. I owe you one.”</p><p>“You owe me more than one.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her shirt with the cowboys, shoving it on unhappily as they marched their way over to Agatha and Jen.</p><p>Alice nudged Rio’s arm as they got close and Rio rolled her eyes but glanced Agatha’s way and swallowing her pride she said: “Want to ride with me? More fun when there’s two.”</p><p>She couldn’t see her eyes beneath her large shades but Agatha’s brows rose up and she looked startled for a second before she said: “That so? Fine. I’ve never been on one before anyway so you can show me how it’s done, cowboy.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t expected the nickname. She hadn’t expected to be so affected by it either.</p><p>She poked her tongue into the inside of her cheek and heard a sudden ringing in her ears. How Agatha was able to do this to her she had no idea. But she stepped forwards anyway and approached the Italian man waiting for who was going to rent what.</p><p>She explained they’d be taking two and he only nodded, pointing briefly to a safety notice on the side that had stick men exhibiting some strange behaviours at sea: drinking from a wine bottle, riding backwards, and waving his arms in the air.</p><p>Rio studied this for a second and once sure she wouldn’t be doing any of those things she nodded her assent.</p><p>“No glasses,” he said suddenly and Rio thought it was weird they couldn’t wear their sunglasses but at no point had he said anything about them all being half dressed.</p><p>She raised a brow but nodded and passed him her glasses, turning to the others to make sure they did the same.</p><p>Jen was the only one who had a problem with this and huffed as she removed her Chanels and handed them over.</p><p>But it was when he turned to Agatha that Rio suddenly had the problem.</p><p>She stood between them so watched almost in slow motion as the man lecherously looked her up and down, his greedy eyes taking in every inch of skin on offer to him and his tongue coming out to wet his lips.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and though the man didn’t notice or look up she saw that Agatha did.</p><p>She turned away quickly and tried to ignore the strange feeling of anger that had bubbled in her chest. Surely it was just that a man was ogling a woman. Nothing more.</p><p>But soon she was being handed a thin life jacket, bundled in a u-shape that hung upside down over her neck.</p><p>It didn’t look very effective but Rio was confident enough that she wouldn’t be the cause of either herself or Agatha Harkness dying today.</p><p>They followed the man down to the shore and waded in a few steps and watched a very brief and not very detailed instruction as to how to start and stop the skis.</p><p>Rio was losing patience with this man, but tried not to let it show even as her jaw flexed and when he was done with his demonstration she walked right past him and threw her leg over the seat, situating herself as she waited for Agatha.</p><p>“Not a fan?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio was checking the turn key operation and adjusting herself in the seat to make sure she was comfortable, not looking at Agatha who now stood beside her, watching curiously.</p><p>“You look furious, honey.”</p><p>Rio froze briefly and turned to look at Agatha, momentarily taken aback by the sight of her standing in water up to her knees, wearing the life jacket around her neck.</p><p>It was infuriating that she looked good in it.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” she huffed quietly, turning back to the ski to make sure she knew where everything was before they went out on the open water.</p><p>She felt Agatha clamber on behind her, and was grateful that she wasn’t pressed close.</p><p>“You ready?” She asked after thirty more seconds, only slightly more cautious of just heading off than Alice was who had just skated off beside them.</p><p>“When you are,” Agatha responded, and Rio raised her brows when she found her elbows suddenly being held.</p><p>She glanced down to her right and then looked over her shoulder at Agatha curiously, “You’ll have to hold on properly.” She reached her left hand back and found the small fabric handle just behind her, “Here.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha glanced at it, and then looked back up, “That? That doesn’t look…” but then something happened and Agatha seemed to change her mind and she straightened her back a little, tossing her hair behind her back as she reached for the little handle with both hands.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and turned back around, and in a quick one-two motion, they were off.</p><p>Rio made for where Alice had gone to and when they were out as far as the deepest swimmers she kicked the throttle in properly and the little jet ski flew over the waves.</p><p>Rio laughed with her adrenaline rush and whooped until she heard a voice over the din of the engine and the rush of the wind.</p><p>“Rio! Rio!”</p><p>Rio turned her head slightly when she heard it, and without hesitation she slowed the beast of a machine down, turning inwards so they were facing back into the shore and maintaining a steady hand until she cut the engine and they bobbed slowly with the waves.</p><p>“You okay?” She turned and saw that Agatha looked white, her eyes wide.</p><p>“Shit. Sorry. I-…”</p><p>“No, it’s fine. It’s okay.”</p><p>Rio turned as best she could and reached for Agatha’s arm, squeezing it gently, “I’ll slow down.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, and Rio felt the sting of rejection as she brushed Rio’s hand from her arm, “No I’m fine. I just didn’t know they could go that fast.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and chewed on a lip for a second before she asked: “Would you feel better if you held onto me?”</p><p>Agatha opened and closed her mouth a couple times and then looked down between them at the flimsy handle she had in a death grip, glancing between that and Rio’s shirt.</p><p>She didn’t say anything but she shifted slowly forwards and as soon as she did, Rio realised what a mistake this offer was.</p><p>Agatha was now pressed against her, their bodies totally flush bar the life vest draped around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Rio felt on fire suddenly, the flames spreading over her in a second, and worsened by the arms that snaked around her waist, and the soft shock of a hand slipping below her shirt to rest against her exposed ribcage.</p><p>When Agatha spoke again she spoke close to Rio’s ear and she had to fight the shiver that threatened her entire body at the feel of her breath so close.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Rio wondered why Agatha hadn’t moved her hand when she’d realised it was inside her open shirt but she didn’t, couldn’t, draw attention to it for fear of being caught out.</p><p>So she focused back on the task at hand, and forgot about the woman wrapped so snugly around her.</p><p>The only issue was, when Rio built their speed back up, Agatha held her only tighter, and with so little fabric between them Rio could feel every flex of her muscles, very twitch of her fingers, and every frightened breath against her neck.</p><p>If Rio had felt like she was flying before, it was nothing to now.</p><p>Agatha holding her was the best and worst thing in the world.</p><p>She’d felt safe enough to go fast again only because Agatha hadn’t exclaimed or screamed or told her to stop. And the faster she went, the more Agatha kept close.</p><p>If she stopped Agatha would pull away. She’d drop her hold and Rio would never feel this way again.</p><p>But Alice and Jen were in the distance and they were waving to them to come over.</p><p>They were heading further out to sea now and Rio had to slow down for fear she’d send them both toppling into the deep.</p><p>And if Agatha were scared now, she could only imagine how scared she’d be in the open water.</p><p>So she slowed to a reasonable pace which meant she’d have no problem pulling up beside Alice’s ski and with it she felt Agatha’s hold loosen but she didn’t pull away.</p><p>Just as they arrived parallel to the other two in their party Rio felt Agatha squeeze over her ribs gently, and then her thumb brush over her skin and Rio almost rocketed them off in the wrong direction by accident.</p><p>She could feel every inch of her body like her sensitivity had been dialled up to a hundred.</p><p>Every inch of it that Agatha touched was still on fire and Rio idly wondered if she’d ever feel the same again.</p><p>Maintaining a steady path towards Alice, she briefly glanced over her left shoulder at Agatha and regretted it immediately where their faces were too close and she had to turn sharply to avoid the pull of hypnotic blue eyes.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her soon fell as they reached the others but she didn’t move back and as Rio pulled up and turned off the engine, Agatha dropped her hands to just before Rio’s thighs, resting her fingertips on the seat.</p><p>They were so close that Rio could feel the warmth of her palms against her inner thighs and she had to fight with herself as she gently lifted Agatha’s hands from this position and placed them on her hips, which felt safer but still not out of the danger zone.</p><p>“I hate this,” Jen said with a frown, her arms still wrapped tightly around a very pleased looking Alice.</p><p>“Are there sharks in the Med?”</p><p>“Oh plenty,” Agatha said with a laugh, “All very keen on publicists.”</p><p>Rio snorted and felt the unmistakeable squeeze of her hip. She glanced back at Agatha and saw she was smiling at her, looking almost as pleased as Alice.</p><p>“What’s this?” Jen asked suddenly, indicating Rio and Agatha who were smiling at each other still, only turning back when she added, “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Can’t stay for long and chat, I’m afraid,” Agatha said suddenly, squeezing both of Rio’s hips and then wrapping her arms back around her. If Rio needed any other indication that Agatha wanted her to drive again, it was that both hands were now beneath her shirt and life vest, holding her bare waist, and Rio would have driven across oceans if it meant she could continue having her hold her there. “We’ll catch you back at the beds.”</p><p>With that, Rio kicked the engine into gear with another one-two, and without giving any warning, they shot off, running parallel to the current and moving down with it until Rio found and calm to hit the gas and jump up the speed.</p><p>In their wake both Jen and Alice watched in shock until Alice shrugged and said, “Rio likes to show off.”</p><p>And Rio did.</p><p>Rio heard the sound of Agatha laughing against her ear and turned a little into it, keeping her eyes on the open sea. “It’s like flying!”</p><p>And Rio began to laugh too, because maybe Agatha felt even a fraction of how she felt then, maybe she could understand just a small bit how her body was reacting to her.</p><p>Or maybe not, and that was fine too, because she could have listened to just her laughing for centuries.</p><p>But Rio had a pretty girl wrapped around her which meant that no ordinary amount of showing off would do.</p><p>She had to push it.</p><p>And so, without warning, she swung them around, and Agatha yelled out in surprise, her arms constricting impossibly so Rio felt like she couldn’t breath but then they were speeding off in the other direction again and Agatha relented.</p><p>Rio took deep gasps of air and guessed that Agatha knew what she’d done because she was rubbing her thumbs gently across her ribs, soothing Rio’s burning lungs as best she could.</p><p>But her soft touches were much worse than getting no oxygen to her lungs.</p><p>Rio felt high with it, and was vaguely concerned she could be caught for driving under the influence: Agatha’s influence.</p><p>When Rio slowed again, unsure how much the little ski could take with two bodies on it and going at max speed for the majority of their run, Agatha’s arms loosened and uncrossed over her body.</p><p>She felt them taking the unnecessary journey of pulling back over her ribs to rest at her sides so her shirt was pulled back below her armpits and her front was totally exposed to the open sea.</p><p>She held her there for longer than she needed to and Rio had to tell herself Agatha was just taking a moment to recover because it felt like she was just enjoying holding her.</p><p>Which wasn’t something a happily married woman would do.</p><p>“That was crazy,” Agatha breathed softly, slowly dropping her hold on Rio to rest her hands down against her hips.</p><p>Rio glanced back at her and had to fight the urge to push her hands away completely, feeling as hot as she did under her touches.</p><p>But Agatha seemed to sense this and pulled her hands away, placing a few inches between them on the seat.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and glanced back again at her, briefly catching sight of blue eyes staring back at her, “You think Jennifer’s in love?”</p><p>“Without a doubt. Jen’s been obsessed since she first saw her.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah. Love at first sight.”</p><p>Rio laughed and ran a hand through her hair, shaking it out loosely where it was was damp from the salt spray, “I didn’t take you for the romantic type.”</p><p>“No? What gave me away?”</p><p>Rio hummed and rested her forearms on the handlebars, staring out at the sea before them, “Your general demeanour and you know… ice queen reputation.”</p><p>She felt a sudden, light jab to her side and squealed a little as she batted a hand that had already retreated. “Hey! I’m sensitive.”</p><p>Agatha snorted behind her and Rio glanced back to see that Agatha had turned her attention to the open body of water too and she looked distant for a second before she asked, “Are you seeing anyone?”</p><p>Despite the innocence of the question it hung heavy in the salt air between them and Rio didn’t know why. She wanted to puff her chest and proclaim that she saw a new girl every night but Agatha wasn’t the right audience for that.</p><p>Though she wanted her to know she was desirable.</p><p>Wanted her to know that if she’d felt like this about any other actress she’d probably have found a way to make it happen for her.</p><p>To get over her crush by getting <em>under</em> her crush. Or on top of her. Whichever way was quickest.</p><p>But she shook those feelings off and instead shrugged a little, deciding honesty was the best policy.</p><p>“No. I haven’t had a girlfriend for a couple years now.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>
<em>My inability to commit, my fear of rejection.</em>
</p><p>She couldn’t give those answers either.</p><p>So Rio shrugged and dropped her gaze to the gentle waves beneath them, choosing another truth instead: “Work takes me all over the place. There aren’t many people who’d put up with so much distance all the time.”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a while and Rio looked over her shoulder at her, feeling the weight of things unsaid but not knowing what they were.</p><p>“And Ralph? How’s he with it all?”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said noncommittally, shrugging her shoulders and looking down at her hands, “He’s fine.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and decided to probe a little more. Seemed like both of them were only telling half truths.</p><p>“Was it love at first sight?” Agatha’s eyes snapped up to her own, “With Ralph?”</p><p>Then her gaze dropped again and she shook out her hair, making a vague gesture back to the shoreline, “We should probably head back.”</p><p>The change had been so sudden that if Rio had blinked she’d have missed it.</p><p>Agatha was looking more than distant now.</p><p>She looked on another planet.</p><p>And the strange, tentative rapport they’d built up since that first photoshoot, then had cemented in Cannes, suddenly meant nothing as Agatha built a wall between them so solid that Rio didn’t think she’d ever break through.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio hesitated before starting the engine and fully expected Agatha to move back in again but she didn’t.</p><p>A soft movement behind her told her that Agatha had instead chosen to take the flimsy handle again and she couldn’t help but wonder if it were punishment for asking about her husband.</p><p>Perhaps it was a reminder of the hand holding incident that had almost derailed their Cannes experience.</p><p>Perhaps it was something else.</p><p>Rio piloted them back to where they’d picked the jet ski up in the first place and kept the pace slow, not wanting to frighten Agatha for one and worried about what her reception would be when they got back onto dry land.</p><p>Once the engine was off, Agatha slipped from the jet ski without looking back and Rio found herself watching her as she handed her life vest back, took her sunglasses, and walked back up the beach to their loungers.</p><p>Alice and Jen were there already so she wouldn’t have a chance to bring up Agatha’s change in mood - not that she really wanted to.</p><p>She handed the keys back to the man and delivered the life vest into the little box, taking her sunglasses too, before heading back up.</p><p>Only, unlike Agatha, she was stopped.</p><p>It was a bunch of teenage Italian boys, no younger than seventeen, no older then about twenty one.</p><p>They crowded round Rio and started speaking in excitable, rapid Italian.</p><p>Rio picked up some of it: “Beautiful Rio!” “The actress, no?” But the rest was such a blurring of voices that even Rio’s Spanish couldn’t help her decipher it.</p><p>So she smiled and nodded and made to squeeze past them but one grabbed her around the waist and her body’s reaction could not have been more different to the reaction to Agatha grabbing her there earlier.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio shouted, shoving the boy’s arm away from herself and wrestling past him, she stumbled and fell into another body and made to shove it away before she realised who it was.</p><p>Agatha had run back down the beach to pull her away and Alice was right behind her, yelling at them in Spanish, hoping they’d understand that and if not, she added a few violent “fuck offs” that were surely universal.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said huffily, even though Agatha hadn’t asked and was instead walking silently back to the sun beds with her, one hand holding her arm, the other wrapped around her as if someone would jump Rio any second.</p><p>“They’re just horny teenagers.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but didn’t say anything still and Rio actually blushed when she pulled her down onto her sun lounger with her, crowding her so she sat closer to the top, and Rio leant back at an angle to rest her back against the sturdy wooden parasol that sat between Agatha and Jen’s beds.</p><p>“Where did he touch you?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced up at Agatha, briefly distracted from where she’d been watching Alice march furiously back up the beach towards them.</p><p>“What? Nowhere.”</p><p>“I saw him <em>grab</em> you,” Agatha insisted and Rio sighed quietly, her eyes still on Alice as she got closer.</p><p>“Just around my waist.”</p><p>Rio missed Agatha’s furious look because she was reaching for Alice and pulling her towards her, shuffling forwards to get closer to her. “You okay?”</p><p>“Fine. Idiots. I’ve told you we should get you a-…”</p><p>“No,” Rio said sternly, scowling up at her best friend, “Do you know how embarrassing that would be?”</p><p>Alice huffed, “Less embarrassing than being tossed about by some prepubescent boys.”</p><p>“I was <em>not</em> tossed about,” Rio began to insist but she felt a hand on her knee that made her stop she saw Agatha shifting closer. Over her shoulder Jen was now hovering.</p><p>She glanced around at Agatha and saw that she looked more tense than even Alice and frowned at this reaction, unsure why it had bothered her so much. For someone who had practically gone silent on her ten minutes ago, she seemed to be caring pretty deeply about some idiots trying to get a reaction out of Rio.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice tried again but softer this time, “don’t move. I’ll go and get us all some drinks. Just… stay as incognito as possible.”</p><p>Rio huffed and reached for her earlier-discarded cap, and shoved it on her head unhappily.</p><p>Agatha’s hand had been dislodged where Rio had moved and Jen stepped around them to follow Alice.</p><p>Rio made to move to her own sun bed but was pulled back down by Agatha who was watching her sternly, “Just stay there.”</p><p>“Oh come on. They’re hardly the mafia. They’re stupid kids trying to impress their friends. I’m fine.”</p><p>“It’s assault.”</p><p>“Don’t be so dramatic.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze and scowled across at her, wondering why the universe made her friends with Jen, and then why the universe made Alice friends with her, and why on god’s green earth it decided those two should fall in love and force her and Agatha together.</p><p>It seemed too cruel.</p><p>“Just wait until everyone’s back.”</p><p>“And what? You’ll protect me in the meantime?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed and she turned from Rio, “Fine. Whatever.”</p><p>Rio made a show of stepping onto her old sun bed and lifted her knees up to the sky, which she stared furiously at beneath her sunglasses.</p><p>They didn’t speak until Alice and Jen returned.</p><p>Alice seemed to have calmed down but she picked up on the tension immediately and perched beside Rio’s hip on the bed, passing her a spritz. “What’s happened?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio muttered at the same time as Agatha, both shooting the other a look.</p><p>“Jesus,” Jen sighed as she sat beside Agatha on the bed, “and people call me <em>dramatic</em>.”</p><p>“Listen,” Alice said, raising her free hand in the air, “when one of you eventually wins the Oscar-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen interjected quickly.</p><p>“It’s important you still both smile for the cameras. Which <em>means</em>,” she continued insistently as Rio began to protest, “That whatever this is, whatever the two of you are annoyed about needs to be fixed. Now please, Rio.”</p><p>“Why do you assume it’s my fault?”</p><p>Agatha and Jen both scoffed and Rio scowled as she sat up properly, narrowing her eyes at Agatha in particular, “she was being patronising.”</p><p>“You were assaulted. I was trying to-…”</p><p>“I wasn’t. It was kids.”</p><p>“Kids who grabbed you and-…”</p><p>“You touched me more on that jet ski than that boy did.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened to retort and then closed just as quickly again and Rio heard the words reverberate in her own mind and she realised how they must have sounded, what she was accusing Agatha of.</p><p>“Not,” she started, unsure how to escape this hole. “I-,” but Agatha was looking so mortified that she suddenly looked furious, her whole face morphing before Rio’s eyes as Rio finished quietly, “I didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p>Jen moved her hand to Agatha’s arm and shook her a little but her gaze was firm even when her words were not, and her eyes were on Rio. It felt like she were being warned. “Hey. Relax. She didn’t mean it. It’s been a stressful few minutes. Drink your drink.”</p><p>Rio watched in horror as Agatha turned away from her, her jaw tighter than she’d ever seen it and she felt Alice touch her leg and draw her attention to her as she murmured, “Apologise. Now.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and handed her drink to Alice, standing slowly and going to stand at the end of Agatha’s bed, standing right in front of her so that Agatha had to turn her face away to avoid looking at her.</p><p>She felt small suddenly, strangely desperate to rewind time, take them back to their time on the ski where nothing else mattered but Agatha’s hands on her.</p><p>Rio glanced briefly at Jen who nodded once and took that as an ‘okay’ to go on.</p><p>She crouched down and placed a hand on the very edge of the bed, not daring to move any closer. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and slowly turned her gaze to Rio and miraculously, surprisingly, she’d softened. Her blue eyes were no longer steely and her jaw wasn’t as firm and more than anything she looked a little hurt.</p><p>Jen behind her made a move to go back to her bed but shot Rio a scowl and Alice placed Rio’s drink down before she disappeared to her own leaving Agatha and Rio in as private a little bubble as they could get on a public beach.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said softly, “I didn’t mean that you-… I heard it after I said it. I was trying to say-…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha reassured quietly.</p><p>And Rio nodded, her gaze dropping to Agatha’s hand where it sat on her knee. She didn’t reach for it, but she lifted her forefinger and touched her knuckle gently before she stood back up, picked up her drink and returned to her bed.</p><p>Perhaps a semi-peace with Agatha was all she could hope for.</p><p>A tentative friendship with the most famous woman in the world whom Rio just happened to want to kiss every second of the day.</p><p>It’d be fine.</p><p>Rio adjusted her sun lounger so she could sit up a bit more and took the opportunity to gaze out to sea.</p><p>Despite being grabbed in the same place Agatha had held her so tightly she could still feel Agatha’s hold on her, far stronger than the memory of the Italian youth.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly and allowed herself to fantasise just for a second.</p><p>She thought of the woman next to her whispering a soft “fuck it” and sliding across to sit behind her on the lounger. She imagined her soft hands roaming her torso, touching her where she wanted to even on this crowded beach. And then they were on the jet ski again and Agatha’s hold was firm and her hand was sliding down her abdomen and dipping slowly beneath her thin bikini to touch the place that Rio most desperately wanted her.</p><p>But before she lost herself too much, before she tortured herself with these thoughts whilst the woman of her fantasises lay out next to her, she opened her eyes and took a long sip of her drink.</p><p>The cool bitterness was like a palate cleanser for her mind and she tried to focus on people watching rather than slipping back into her desperate desire for Agatha to hold her again.</p><p>But she couldn’t ride around a jet ski forever hoping that one day Agatha would jump back on.</p><p>She just had to power through the next couple of days and then seeing Agatha wouldn’t be so intense again. She’d have time and distance between them and she wouldn’t have to be this het up all the time.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness!”</p><p>Rio blinked into the sun and adjusted her cap slightly as she looked up at whoever was destroying their peace. From the corner of her eye she saw Agatha sit up slowly, and just behind her, on the furthest sunbed, she saw Alice her protective best friend sit up straight.</p><p>“I am such a big fan!”</p><p>Rio watched with interest as the woman before them beamed at Agatha and Agatha smiled warmly, holding her hand out to the woman, “Thank you. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>“Oh my god, oh my god.” The woman shook Agatha’s hand roughly, beaming down at her and to Rio she looked a little drunk but maybe she was just excited. Understandable. Agatha often made her feel the same.</p><p>“Could I maybe get a selfie?”</p><p>“Oh I’d love to but I’m here relaxing with my friends. But appreciate your support, thank you.”</p><p>The woman looked more than devastated but only nodded frantically and disappeared off down the beach, stopping a few feet away to turn back and wave at Agatha.</p><p>“Sweet,” Rio teased gently, shooting Agatha a grin.</p><p>“Least my fans don’t grope.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes, turning to watch the woman disappear along the sand.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said suddenly, snapping in her face to get her attention, “You’re burning.”</p><p>Rio looked back over and looked down to where Jen was now staring and saw the light pink skin of Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She was sorry she was burning but it was a good excuse to look.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you?”</p><p>“You’re so smug.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and Agatha swatted at her leg, which only made Rio laugh.</p><p>After that the rest of the beach day went by smoothly.</p><p>They each had two more cocktails and Agatha had half a dozen more people approach her before making their way back up to the villa where they all went their separate ways to the two bedrooms and each took it in turns to shower and change.</p><p>Rio opted for a linen striped shirt dress, figuring they were just lying around the house anyway.</p><p>She was first down and was reclined on the couch scrolling on her phone when Agatha appeared.</p><p>“Jen wants to go out.”</p><p>Rio dropped her phone to her side and sat up slowly on her elbows, frowning up at Agatha. “Really? Has she booked somewhere?”</p><p>“Yeah, just now. For her and Alice.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Rio sat up properly then, unsure what to do with this information. “Right. Okay.”</p><p>“I was going to order pizza and call it an early night.”</p><p>Rio swung her legs around and stood from the couch, “Sure. I’ll keep out of your way. Might head down for a drink or something later but-…”</p><p>“Have one with me before you go?”</p><p>Rio looked around and was surprised to see that Agatha hadn’t moved from where she’d originally stood when she entered the room.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and Rio bit the inside of her cheek, feeling a little awkward suddenly.</p><p>“You look nice,” Agatha offered, so out of the blue that Rio raised her brows and glanced down at herself, tugging lightly at the fabric of her dress.</p><p>She brought her gaze back up and looked Agatha over properly for the first time. And wished she hadn’t.</p><p>She was wearing tan linen pants and a loose white T-shirt that…</p><p>“Oh shit,” Rio said quickly, stepping closer to inspect Agatha’s pink chest. She raised a hand towards it and then remembered herself and pulled her hand away.</p><p>“You were right,” Agatha said with an arched brow, “but if I hear one more smug word about it.”</p><p>“It looks worse.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quickly and met Agatha’s gaze, wondering where and how this relationship suddenly became so full of randomly blurred lines.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t have the chance to respond as Jen announced herself into the space, “Champagne, darlings? We’re celebrating!”</p><p>“Celebrating what?” Agatha asked suspiciously, but Rio nudged her arm and smirked, “Apparently their first proper date.”</p><p>Jen was in a flowing pink dress and heels and Rio had to admire both her taste and Alice’s.</p><p>Jen looked unreal.</p><p>And if Rio’s heart rate weren’t thrumming in tandem with wherever Agatha was in the room, she might just have a little crush on Jen too.</p><p>But Agatha had turned to her and squeezed her arm as she walked past and Rio knew that until she could shake this little crush she was done for.</p><p>No other woman could possibly match up.</p><p>Agatha took charge of popping and pouring the champagne, making sure everyone had an equal share and by the time the glasses were ready to be handed out, Alice had arrived too and Rio had snuck behind her, leaning around to embarrass her by placing multiple kisses to her cheek.</p><p>“Rio! Rio!”</p><p>Rio only gave in and let Alice go when she feared she’d hurt herself trying to wriggle from her grip and she laughed as Alice lightly slapped her cheek, pushing her away.</p><p>“You look good, Wu.”</p><p>“Don’t try that shit on me,” Jen warned Agatha with a glare and Agatha just rolled her eyes, holding the champagne flutes out to Alice and Rio now they were both behaving.</p><p>“You wish.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed Agatha’s as she took her champagne and they locked eyes briefly and all the laughter in Rio’s face died in that instant and she knew three things for sure: she needed to get out the house that night, she needed to get drunk, and she needed to get laid.</p><p>They went to sit out by the pool, each taking a seat around the dining table setup there and each gazing at the view in silence for a while.</p><p>Rio noticed Jen and Alice’s hands meeting across the table and she smiled at her best friend before turning and catching Agatha watching her.</p><p>The brunette looked away when she was caught but Rio felt her stomach lurch at the idea that Agatha had been looking at her.</p><p>She cleared her throat softly and took a sip of her champagne just as Jen filled the silence: “So, Vidal. What’s next?”</p><p>“Uhh,” Rio started, glancing at Alice for help on this one.</p><p>“Eight weeks on a movie then off to Venice. We’re pretty back to back until the end of next year.”</p><p>“Wonderful,” Rio said quietly as she sipped her champagne.</p><p>“Where are you shooting?” Agatha asked and Rio racked her brains for a second before answering:</p><p>“London.”</p><p>She met Agatha’s gaze and saw her nod slowly, seemingly lost in thought as she took a sip of her drink.</p><p>“We’re the same. Agatha’s two shoots to contend with so no Venice for us. No rest for the wicked.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and watched the bubbles float about in her glass. “Especially not when campaigning.”</p><p>“Your first go-round,” Agatha said with a smirk, snapping out of her reverie, raising her brows at Rio, “and already complaining?”</p><p>“You make it sound like you’ve been doing this for decades.”</p><p>“I’m almost forty.”</p><p>“And with three Oscar nominations with one win and one on the way?” Rio matched Agatha’s smirk, “you’re practically a prodigy.”</p><p>She took another sip of her champagne.</p><p>“And what does that make you? A baby?”</p><p>Rio laughed and Agatha smiled across at her as Jen eyed them both suspiciously, “You two are being weird. What’s going on?”</p><p>“Leave them whilst they’re not biting each other,” Alice said with a wave of her hand, too happy to be concerned about anything Rio was doing.</p><p>“But, actually. The sun’s setting and you know what would be a good idea now everyone’s so happy?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but kept her gaze down on her drink, predicting what would be coming next.</p><p>“A quick snap for socials.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence and Jen interjected before Agatha could outright refuse again. “Baby, maybe not tonight.”</p><p>Rio glanced up at the nickname and couldn’t help but smile a little at Alice’s reaction.</p><p>She looked annoyed initially and then almost as if she’d realised what had happened she blushed a deep crimson and simply nodded.</p><p>Rio caught her eye and sent her a congratulatory wink across the table. She hadn’t got her photos but she’d clearly got her girl.</p><p>So Rio felt herself relax just a little in Agatha’s company again, perhaps the distance of the wide table between them helping her recalibrate a little.</p><p>But just as she felt herself fully relax Alice and Jen began to make a move. Rio felt the panic rise in her slowly at the prospect of being alone with Agatha, in this beautiful place, with the memory of her hands on her body.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she could take it.</p><p>“Actually,” she announced as Alice and Jen stood from the table.</p><p>All eyes landed on her and Rio felt Agatha’s gaze on her the most, “I’m going to come with you.”</p><p>“What? Rio, no. We’re-…”</p><p>“I know, I know. I’ll just walk down to the town with you, that’s all.”</p><p>Alice eyed her friend warily but nodded and Jen looked less than happy but Rio didn’t turn to Agatha to see her reaction.</p><p>Instead she pushed her chair back and cleared her throat as she turned to leave.</p><p>“Get back safe,” Agatha said quietly, and Rio paused for a second to acknowledge it, nodding just once but not quite looking at Agatha before she turned to leave with the other two.</p>

<p>Rio stumbled into the villa at well after three am.</p><p>She was hot and tired and considerably drunk but she’d also just spent the last few hours kissing, grinding on, and eventually fucking a hot Italian she met at a bar on the beach.</p><p>She’d had worse nights.</p><p>“Ow, fuck!”</p><p>She’d stumbled right into the console table in the hall.</p><p>Recovering herself and muttering under her breath about inconveniently placed objects, she moved through to the main living area - a little wobbly but managing not to crash into anything again.</p><p>There was movement on the large couch that made her stumble a little over her own feet and she blinked into the semi-darkness until the silhouette of a woman became the face and body of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Oh. Di’ I wake you?”</p><p>Agatha watched Rio for a second, her gaze dropping to the purse still held loosely in her hand and the sand-covered sandals in her other.</p><p>“No, I was awake.”</p><p>“Is late,” Rio trilled, gesturing vaguely at the darkness as she stepped forwards and threw herself onto the couch beside Agatha.</p><p>“Ver’ late,” she added with an heavy slur to her voice.</p><p>Agatha shifted beside her and Rio rolled her head where it now lay on the back of the couch to look at her.</p><p>Agatha was pretty in this light.</p><p>Hell, Agatha was pretty in any light. But now, in the dark, at this hour, she looked softer. And Rio couldn’t help herself as she reached for her, her fingers just grazing her cheek.</p><p>The tips of her fingers travelled lazily along to the tip of Agatha’s nose, and Rio frowned as she walked her two fingers up to the bridge of it, then brushed them back down again.</p><p>“Who made you?” She asked reverently, her gaze now darting across Agatha’s face as she tried to comprehend the magnificence of it when she could barely speak a full sentence.</p><p>“D’you wait up for me?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t moved or said anything the whole time Rio had been exploring her face but Rio’s hand fell down and landed just an inch or two from Agatha’s forearm and blue eyes fell to watch it. Even in her drunken state Rio thought Agatha looked cautious.</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep. That’s all.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hummed, in no fit state to be able to tell if the great Agatha Harkness was acting or not.</p><p>She pulled her hand back and lolled her head back around, closing her eyes.</p><p>“I drank too much.”</p><p>“I can see that.”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned back to Agatha, beaming stupidly at her and grinning even wider when Agatha’s lips twitched a little and she avoided eye contact.</p><p>“You did wait f’me.”</p><p>“You’re drunk.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and reached back out for Agatha, grabbing the fabric of her shirt by her shoulder, “You did!”</p><p>Agatha made to take Rio’s hand away and Rio simply turned her hand over to take Agatha’s, wriggling it between their faces.</p><p>“Knew you liked me.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio laughed again, seeing this as an opportunity to move closer, her brain not firing on all cylinders but firing on what she considered to be the most important ones in that moment.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath as Rio moved closer to her, their hands still together but now pressed against Rio’s chest.</p><p>“You smell like alcohol and cheap perfume.”</p><p>“Mmm, that’s be Alessia.”</p><p>“Alessia?”</p><p>“Girl,” Rio clarified unhelpfully, not interested at all in this line of questioning.</p><p>“Who is she?”</p><p>Rio shrugged slightly and shuffled some more until she was an inch or two away from Agatha, still holding her hand firmly.</p><p>“S’a girl from the bar.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio watched her blue eyes dart about and she wondered if Agatha were seeing two of her like she were seeing two of Agatha.</p><p>“And what did you do with this girl?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, her brain already on more important matters and not on the fact that she’d potentially put herself in a very dangerous and stupid situation by fucking someone on a public beach.</p><p>“Jus’ kiss,” she lied, her eyes dropping to the place she’d like to kiss Agatha.</p><p>Agatha remained quiet and Rio did too, her gaze still down on Agatha’s lips as she conjured up the memory of the last time they were this close and her drunken mind won over as she whispered:</p><p>“D’you remember me?”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly and watched as Agatha’s brows rose and her head tilted a little to be at the same angle as Rio’s against the couch.</p><p>Rio couldn’t tell if Agatha hadn’t heard her or if she were so drunk she’d slurred her words too much so she tried again and moved their joined hands from resting against her own chest to resting against Agatha’s.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said slowly, pronouncing each syllable with only a sprinkle of slurring, “d’you remember me?”</p><p>Agatha remained silent again and Rio frowned a little as she dropped her gaze down from her face to focus somewhere at her chin, noticing Agatha’s little dimple there and clumsily raising her index finger from the claw she’d formed over Agatha’s hand to touch it.</p><p>Just as she made contact Agatha spoke softly, “Yes. You were as drunk then as you are now.”</p><p>Rio didn’t react for a while, her mind slowly catching up, working out exactly what Agatha was confirming. But steadily she raised her gaze, leaning in just a little more and grinning stupidly as Agatha watched her, “Y’remember? The bar?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and wriggled their joined hands between them, “I thought… too famous… too rich… too pretty… too…”</p><p>But her smile faded slowly as she remembered what had actually happened in the bathroom: that Agatha had spooked and left her alone.</p><p>“Husband,” she muttered quietly, closing her eyes and rolling her head away, her body turning away from Agatha’s but her hand was still being held. “You’ve husband.”</p><p>“Let me take you to bed.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice drifted into her consciousness as Rio squeezed her eyes shut, trying to focus on what was real.</p><p>She could feel the couch cushions beneath her, the sand between her toes, Agatha’s hand in her own.</p><p>She could smell the sweat from her skin from a night of dancing and sex, the fresh lemons in a bowl on the coffee table, Agatha’s perfume.</p><p>She could hear the crickets chirping outside through the open windows, the soft tick of a clock nearby, Agatha moving slowly beside her.</p><p>She could taste the alcohol on her breath, the flavoured lip balm of the girl she’d been groping all night, and the indignity of her current situation.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes slowly and saw Agatha leaning over her, her blue eyes bright in the dim, her lips parted as if she were about to say something else, a strand of hair falling delicately across her brow.</p><p>Rio reached to tuck it clumsily behind her ear again and Agatha let her.</p><p>“Let me take you to bed.”</p><p>Rio huffed a little but didn’t move, releasing her hold on Agatha’s hand and dropping her own hand into her lap instead.</p><p>“Alice an’ Jen? Di’ they get back okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and pursed her lips as she stepped away from Rio, holding her hands out to her now in a move that even Rio recognised as a request, not a demand.</p><p>She accepted them and allowed Agatha to pull her to her feet, mercifully not stumbling too much and correcting herself before their bodies collided.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio mumbled quietly, stealing her hands back again from Agatha and making for the staircase, feeling ever so slightly less wobbly than when she’d walked in.</p><p>“You’ll have to take my bed,” Agatha said from somewhere behind her, “Jen and Alice… well they’re in the other room.”</p><p>Rio had reached the stairs and swivelled to look at Agatha so quickly that she stumbled and fell onto her ass on the second stair. Just as Agatha reached her, she released a laugh and buried her face in her hands, “Finally. She sealed the deal.”</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said firmly, not offering anymore where she took Rio by the arms and lifted her to her feet again, “I’ll help.”</p><p>Rio was still halfway to a laugh and she grinned at Agatha, for a second seeing two pairs of eyes looking at her until they melted into just one. “She’s liked her for ages. Ages and ages and ages.”</p><p>“I know. Jen’s been head over heels for a while too.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, a smile playing on her lips, as she watched Agatha survey her closely, trying to gage how balanced she was.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she reassured, emphasising the “ine” a little to much for someone who was “fine”.</p><p>“I can make it from here.”</p><p>Agatha looked a little like she’d flinched at this but Rio was still trying to keep her mind steady as she turned away from Agatha and the hold on her arms dropped.</p><p>She took two more steps and then stopped, her hand secure on the bannister so at least she could be sure if she fell she wouldn’t fall far.</p><p>“Okay?” Agatha asked, having not moved from the bottom of the stairs, now just four down from Rio.</p><p>“Where’re you sleeping?”</p><p>Rio turned slowly around, almost stumbling as she crossed one foot over the other and watching in something close to amusement as Agatha lurched for her and took two steps up.</p><p>“Careful. The couch.”</p><p>“Silly,” Rio said with an eye roll, shaking her head as she turned back around and began to take slow steps up the rest of the staircase.</p><p>It was when she hit the landing that she registered movement behind her.</p><p>The creaky top step had given her away and Rio paused for a second to determine how she felt about Agatha following her to bed.</p><p>Mortified, for one. Indignant, for another.</p><p>But somewhere deep down she felt warmed by it, touched that a one-time Oscar winner were making sure she didn’t plummet to her death in a villa in Italy.</p><p>And Agatha remained with her as she crawled into bed.</p><p>Rio went to her usual side in the unfamiliar bed and didn’t even stop to brush the sand from her feet as she buried herself beneath the blankets.</p><p>She heard her name muffled somewhere above her but was determined to sleep, determined to stay hidden, until…</p><p>“Rio Vidal, get on your side.”</p><p>The warm embrace of darkness had been torn from her and Rio scrunched her face up against the light as Agatha threw the blankets off of her.</p><p>“On your side,” she repeated again as Rio remained still on her back and tried to grab the blankets back up and over her face.</p><p>Agatha huffed a little and gave up on the War of the Blanket and instead ducked down to tuck her fingers around Rio’s side and heave her onto her side.</p><p>Rio allowed this and didn’t even complain when Agatha patted her leg to get her to move it up so she was in the recovery position. “Don’t move, okay? Can’t have you dying in the night. They’ll think I killed the competition.”</p><p>Rio only laughed a little, the noise catching in her throat as she began to succumb to sleep, “You’ll win. Better actress.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly and Rio felt a gentle touch to her cheek which made her eyes flutter open and she blinked slowly as she readjusted her vision again, aware suddenly that Agatha was close, perhaps as close as she’d been on the couch.</p><p>“I’m gonna sit with you for a second. Just until you’re asleep.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was a whisper now, a gentle timbre that Rio hadn’t heard before. It was so soft if her lips hadn’t moved with it Rio might have missed it.</p><p>But she frowned where she lay and moved her hand up to capture the fingers now tenderly brushing her hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Jus’stay.”</p><p>Rio thought she heard the soft hitch of a breath but she couldn’t tell if it was from her or Agatha and she moved Agatha’s hand down to press her knuckles to her lips. It was barely a kiss, more a brush, and Agatha reacted only to it by nodding and then releasing Rio’s hand.</p><p>Rio curled a little more into herself when Agatha moved away and she closed her eyes as she felt the mattress dip on the other side of her.</p><p>By the time Agatha had slipped beneath the sheets, Rio’s breathing had evened out entirely and she was fast asleep.</p><p>Rio woke twice in the night. Or the early hours of the morning, as it was.</p><p>At just after four am, she woke with a start and panicked when she didn’t recognise the room, momentarily forgetting where she was.</p><p>Italy.</p><p>Villa.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Turning slowly over, her eyes landed on the back of Agatha Harkness’s sleeping form, turned away from her and as far over on the other side of the bed as she could be.</p><p>Rio watched her for a few seconds, seeing the steady rhythm of her ribs expanding beneath her T-shirt, and the fresh horror of her entrance just a few hours ago hit her.</p><p>She turned over quickly then and forced herself back into sleep.</p><p>The second time she woke, she woke slower, the creeping dawn easing her where the shutters remained at half mast.</p><p>Blinking into the light she allowed herself to adjust to being awake for a few seconds this time, taking a mental inventory of her body as well as her mind before she slowly turned to see Agatha again.</p><p>This time, Agatha was on her back, still far from her.</p><p>But her hand was flung out towards her and Rio looked down upon it and saw that she wasn’t wearing her wedding ring. She didn’t know why she’d spotted this so suddenly, as if anybody might have, but it struck her the moment she’d laid eyes upon Agatha’s long fingers curled towards her.</p><p>Sure Agatha was still asleep, Rio let her eyes wander up her arm, taking in the light freckles and seeing the subtle shadow of her bicep that she’d felt when Agatha held her on the jet ski the day before.</p><p>Her gaze roamed over her shoulder, to the curve of her jaw, along the plains and lines of a face that people would go to war for.</p><p>Agatha was tragically beautiful, and Rio found herself envying the artists who got to work every day with such a canvas. The people who got to paint her lips and cheeks with rouge, who blackened her eyelashes and were paid to focus in on eyes so hypnotic Rio was sure she could drown in their blue pools.</p><p>And her husband. Agatha’s husband who had access to this face. The man who could kiss it and hold it at will. Rio hoped Ralph knew how lucky he was. She hoped he treasured and worshiped Agatha the way she deserved.</p><p>Though the reality was that she didn’t think Ralph knew at all what he had in Agatha. And she didn’t think he treated her the way she should be treated.</p><p>A movement of Agatha’s made Rio fall back to earth with a jolt and she turned quickly back into her side, furious with herself that she’d been staring at a woman she barely knew whilst she slept.</p><p>She’d mortified herself enough. If Agatha had woken and caught her she was sure she’d have been blacklisted from Hollywood immediately. Me Too’d so fast she would barely be able to breathe the name ‘Agatha Harkness’ again.</p><p>Getting to sleep again after that was a little more difficult.</p><p>The threat of her hangover had now been confirmed.</p><p>Her head was a stormy cloud of regret and pain and her stomach churned with the memory of last night.</p><p>She’d picked up some girl from a bar, danced with her until her feet hurt, and then taken her to the beach to get out some of the frustration she’d been feeling that day.</p><p>God, she hoped no one had caught them.</p><p>She knew it couldn’t have looked good, or glamorous, or sexy.</p><p>It must have looked sweaty and desperate and more than a little pathetic.</p><p>But miraculously, sleep came back to her. Perhaps, she thought as she woke up a few hours later, it was the universe repaying her for making her spend days in close proximity with her longest running crush and most intoxicating person alive.</p><p>The third time she woke she was alone.</p><p>Rio stretched her sore limbs and felt the grainy rub of sand by her feet, as unwelcome as it always was when not on the beach.</p><p>She leant across to touch the bed beside her and found Agatha’s side to be cool which meant she’d disappeared a while ago.</p><p>Perhaps Rio had dreamt her there.</p><p>But no, usually her imagination was a little kinder to her than that.</p><p>She groaned as she rolled into a sitting position on the edge of the bed and rubbed at her eyes before noticing a little care package on the side in the form of a tall glass of water and some aspirin.</p><p><em>Agatha</em>, she thought.</p><p>After drinking down the majority of the water and using it to help knock back the aspirin, she padded through to wash away her sins in the shower.</p><p>There was steam still evident against the glass partition that told her Agatha hadn’t long showered here and she wondered if she’d taken pains to be quiet or if Rio were so dead to the world that Agatha could have recited her inevitable Oscar speech right by her ear and she wouldn’t have noticed.</p><p>Beneath the hot stream of water though, everything felt better.</p><p>The pummelling stream against her skin woke her up to what she could remember of the night before.</p><p>The scent of the perfume of the Italian she’d taken to the beach, the sight of Agatha on the couch, the feel of her hand in her own.</p><p>Rio needed to get a grip. And fast.</p><p>She’d been on the verge of pining last night, of melting before her fellow actress without any thoughts on whether this was a good move personally or professionally.</p><p>Agatha could help to make or break her career.</p><p>She had to do better than this.</p><p>And so, determined and now clean, she stepped out and dried herself as best she could before risking it and slipping into her old room.</p><p>Alice and Jen were nowhere to be found so Rio took her time finding a navy blue bikini, linen shorts and a thin green t-shirt to go over the top. She checked herself in the nearby mirror and decided she could undoubtedly look worse… but she could also look a whole lot better.</p><p>But it would have to do.</p><p>Stepping out into the Italian sun, Rio felt another wave of goodness sink into her body.</p><p>It was what she needed. Sun, sea, silence.</p><p>In front of her lay the pool with the distant view of the bay of Positano. A view Rio could never be sick of.</p><p>But movement on one of the loungers before her alerted her to another view nobody could be sick of.</p><p>“Hey,” she said cautiously, unsure what the reception would be like this morning as she approached the sun lounger beside Agatha’s and chose not to look at her as she took a seat.</p><p>“Hey. Not dead, I see.”</p><p>“Probably thanks to you.”</p><p>Agatha made a noncommittal noise that Rio took as not unfriendly and she stole a glance at the woman, seeing her half under the shade of a parasol, only her legs laying out in the midday sun.</p><p>She’d opted for a black one piece today with cut outs at her sides and was determinedly reading a book. Rio noticed a half-finished cappuccino beside her and the fact that Agatha’s cheeks were a little flushed. Too much sun, she thought.</p><p>“I’m sorry about last night. I got too drunk and I-…”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“No, really. I was probably being a nightmare and really embarrassed myself and-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha looked up suddenly, her face stern but her eyes a little softer than Rio might have expected. “It’s fine. We’ve all been drunk before.”</p><p>Nodding slowly, Rio turned to place her heels on the edge of the bed, wrapping her arms around her legs.</p><p>“Thanks for… helping. Getting me to bed… the water this morning…”</p><p>Agatha was watching her still, her book held up as if she’d turn away any moment to continue reading, but she hadn’t.</p><p>“I think we should clarify something,” she said, her voice a little softer than before. “About when we met.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and nodded, her gaze drifting down to Agatha’s arm as it flexed where she held her book. She wanted to press her face against it, breathe in the sun lotion, hide from the world with Agatha.</p><p>“I was drunk and…”</p><p>But Rio looked up suddenly because Agatha had turned around, placing her book on the bed beside her and her feet on the ground.</p><p>Her ring was back on. Had Rio noticed it wasn’t before? She had a vague memory of thinking about Agatha’s wedding ring. She hoped she hadn’t said anything.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Agatha reached for it, her thumb and forefinger of her right hand now twirling it as she continued: “I was missing Ralph. And you were charming and funny and I… I guess I just… anyway, I’m not into girls. I made a mistake. One I wouldn’t have gone through with anyway. You were too drunk, and too young, and… well it wasn’t anything. I’m not into girls. Nothing happened. I’m happily married. Rio, can we leave it there?”</p><p>Rio watched Agatha closely during her little speech, seeing the way her diction picked up the closer she got to the end of it, the more urgent her words were coming out. How quickly and with practised fingers she was spinning her ring. How Ralph’s name was thrown away from her lips whereas Rio’s was breathed.</p><p>It hurt her brain too much to think about. To assess and breakdown Agatha Harkness’s worst performance to date.</p><p>But Rio was also aware that she was deathly hungover, that she was possibly still drunk, and that no mind is strong enough to fight the delusions that came with a crush.</p><p>She had to focus on what Agatha had said, not what she hoped she meant.</p><p>She had a husband. A husband she loved, and had missed, and Rio was maybe just charming enough that a straight person could want to be close for a second, too close. But that was it. Rio was a girl and Agatha wasn’t into that. And she was happy with her husband.</p><p>Reasonable. Fine. She had to believe it because anything else would destroy her.</p><p>“Okay,” she said slowly, her mind still reeling from its swinging back and forth between wanting to believe Agatha and wanted to accuse her of… of what? Wanting to kiss her? Eight years ago having a crush on her?</p><p>Insane.</p><p>But Agatha had dropped her gaze and was now staring at the ring she held still on her finger and Rio couldn’t help but reach for her hand, catching her fingers and feeling Agatha curl her own around Rio’s.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I implied anything last night. It was so long ago and… it’s just not often a movie star has you up against a bathroom door, that’s all.”</p><p>It wasn’t all, but Rio had to push through, ‘yes, and-ing’ Agatha’s tale to make the both of them feel better.</p><p>This had to be it, she decided.</p><p>Rio could no longer live in this world where Agatha might have, at one point, wanted her.</p><p>So she squeezed Agatha’s hand gently and smiled when she met her gaze again, “You’re burning a little. Will I grab more lotion?”</p><p>Agatha nodded but didn’t say anything and Rio slowly pulled away, but Agatha tugged her hand as she stood and Rio turned back, looking down with a slight frown.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s heart hammered in her chest and she watched as Agatha frowned back at her, her other hand coming up to her forearm as she stood slowly before her, standing too close between the two adjacent sun beds.</p><p>Suddenly it was eight years ago.</p><p>Only rather than a grimy Chicago bar, they were standing on the edge of a multi-million dollar villa on the Amalfi Coast.</p><p>Agatha’s hand still held hers and Agatha’s other hand was holding her arm so firmly as if Rio had looked like she’d bolt. And Rio didn’t know what was happening, didn’t understand what had happened between ‘I’m happily married’ and Agatha suddenly looking at her like she was the first hot meal she’d seen after a long winter of rations.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>And all the thoughts left Rio’s brain because Agatha Harkness was staring at her lips.</p><p>Her lips that the night before had been all over some girl from a bar, using her as a quick fix to get the thoughts of Agatha out of her head.</p><p>It felt sick, it felt cruel, it felt… and then Agatha had pulled away. She’d released her hold on her and by the time Rio’s brain had caught up, Agatha was halfway back to the villa.</p><p>“I’ll get you a coffee,” she was saying, “and maybe an aperitivo.”</p><p>Rio felt a little faint and she wasn’t sure if it was the hangover, the heat of the sun, or the mixed signals that flared with every other interaction she had with Agatha.</p><p>Was she messing with her? Goading her to try something? Was she wanting Rio to make a move so she could accuse her of something awful?</p><p>Before she could even think on it Rio had slipped her feet into Agatha’s discarded sandals and was marching to the front of the house.</p><p>She bypassed the open plan kitchen area and from the corner of her eye saw Agatha turn to her. She even thought she heard her say her name.</p><p>But Rio was too fast, too determined to escape and catch her breath, and before anything else could happen, she’d exited the villa.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It smelled sweet.</p><p>The kind of sweet that reminded you of candy.</p><p>Though of course it was the ghosts of cocktails past: of spilled grenadine and rum.</p><p>It was dimly lit to hide the sins of the patrons, to disguise the grime of the glasses and the stains of the seats.</p><p>There were posters on every inch of every wall. But of nothing, of no one, as inconsequential as the people they smiled down upon.</p><p>This was the kind of bar that nobody frequented and where everybody who did was called as such.</p><p>And so it was the perfect bar for the little improv troupe to fall into.</p><p>Some celebrating; some commiserating.</p><p>Agatha Harkness, Oscar hopeful and Hollywood heavyweight was in their midst, and so no one was on their best behaviour.</p><p>“She’s fucking hot,” someone breathed into Rio Vidal’s ear as she stared at the actress from where she sat squeezed in the corner of a curved booth with her fellow improvers - the underlings of the troupe.</p><p>“God she’s like one of these statues,” someone else said from across the way.</p><p>“A fucking hottie with a body,” Alice added helpfully with half her mind on her bottle of beer and half her mind on Agatha.</p><p>“A goddess,” Rio concluded, her own attention split between Agatha and the beer she cradled in her hands; the fifth of the night, the last she could afford.</p><p>“Seriously, I hear her husband is hot too. Have you seen him? It’s actually unreal.”</p><p>“Unfair.”</p><p>“Sad,” Alice murmured as Rio leant into her and laughed against her ear.</p><p>Agatha Harkness had been the talk of the night.</p><p>Because of course.</p><p>She’d rocked up without any warning. Simply because she was filming in Chicago and one of the improv leaders had been an extra on the set.</p><p>Perhaps she was lonely, perhaps she was bored, but it didn’t matter. She’d turned up.</p><p>On the verge of an Oscar nomination and at their little show; the troupe felt insane with it.</p><p>They felt crazy with the power.</p><p>And Rio Vidal felt nothing at all.</p><p>She’d worked so hard and still nothing.</p><p>Alice had been telling her for years she had something and yet, and yet…</p><p>But then she’d spotted Agatha Harkness in the crowd and she’d shown off.</p><p>She’d been louder and funnier and sharper and better than she’d been in weeks.</p><p>Because Agatha was there. Because Agatha was a woman to impress.</p><p>And now she sat, drunk, convinced she’d left an impression on the woman who’d had eyes on her all night.</p><p>But girls in the audience who stared at Rio usually came over. They usually cashed in on the time spent watching her.</p><p>They usually weren’t famous actresses with handsome husbands.</p><p>So Rio sat, unadmired and tipsy, watching as the seniors in her group absorbed the smiles and the laughs from Agatha Harkness.</p><p>In any just world Rio would be there too.</p><p>But then Alice shook her shoulder and she turned to her best friend and smiled lamely, her eyes already hooded and slow to cooperate with her hazy mind.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re staring again. She’s hot but she’s not interested.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and then shrunk back a little, turning back to the small group at the bar that encircled the object of her most keen attention.</p><p>She raised her beer to her lips, now warm and flat, and saw that Agatha was looking at her.</p><p>Not for the first time that night.</p><p>Rio suddenly felt warmer than the beer that slipped down her throat, felt dizzier than the tequila earlier had made her feel, felt every second that they maintained eye contact.</p><p>Agatha was the one to break the eye contact.</p><p>Because of course she was.</p><p>Rio was drunk, she knew that.</p><p>She was probably staring, she assumed that.</p><p>Agatha was the most famous, most beautiful woman she’d ever seen.</p><p>How could she not stare?</p><p>She told herself she had to behave.</p><p>She looked away, focused on her friends. Ignored the way the conversation kept steering around to Agatha again - if she enjoyed the show, how rich she was, if she would introduce anyone to her agent, if she’d come back to see their summer show.</p><p>After two more too-warm beers and an unwise shot of tequila bought by Alice, she stumbled her way into the bathroom.</p><p>There, above the cracked porcelain of the sink, she took slow breaths to stem the nausea that threatened to overcome her pleasantly drunken state.</p><p>“Feeling okay?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head in the direction of the speaker, assuming a friend, unable to recognise the familiar voice she’d only previously heard through a screen.</p><p>The bathroom descended into silence again and as Rio calmed her system down she felt well enough to turn and lean back against the basin.</p><p>Apparently she still wasn’t alone.</p><p>“You were good.”</p><p>Brown eyes flashed open and Agatha Harkness came into focus, as magnificent as Rio remembered.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio uttered, a little too drunk for her body to catch up with her mind.</p><p>“Whadd’re you doing here?”</p><p>Agatha smiled and leant up against the basin next to Rio’s, watching her with blue eyes that made Rio feel weak at the knees.</p><p>“You’re the best of them.”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio hummed a soft question, rubbing her temple as she tried to focus on what the goddess in the room with her was saying.</p><p>“You’re drunk.”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“Definitely.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rubbed her face with her hands, unable to deny or fight back.</p><p>“Do you want me to get you some water?”</p><p>Rio dropped her hands.</p><p>She looked across at Agatha, frowning at her as she stared at her. She was closer than she’d been before, she was sure of it.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Ah-gah-tha.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and tilted her head to watch Rio, her eyes darting from heavy dark eyes to a lopsided grin, “That’s my name.”</p><p>“S’pretty.”</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“Pretty.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly and Rio’s gaze dropped. Dropped to perfect teeth, to perfect lips.</p><p>“Smile’s pretty.”</p><p>Agatha moved a little closer and Rio’s gaze dropped again.</p><p>She looked at the plain white T-shirt Agatha was wearing. She looked at the pale arm at her side. The long fingers. The rings on one of them.</p><p>She reached for them.</p><p>“S’pretty,” she said again, her voice dropping as she held Agatha’s left hand, reverently touching the diamond there.</p><p>“Lucky sonofabitch,” Rio murmured almost to herself but not quite low enough to not be caught.</p><p>If she’d looked up she’d have seen Agatha raise her brows at her.</p><p>“It’s Rio, isn’t it? Like ‘river’.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio continued to toy with the rings on Agatha’s finger, her gaze drifting in focus as she did.</p><p>“Vidal?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio began to frown where she still held Agatha’s hand, turning her engagement ring over so she could no longer see the diamond.</p><p>“I’d get you a bigger one. S’big everyone could see.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio looked back up again, smiling a little, now confident that she absolutely could buy Agatha Harkness a larger ring than her rich financier husband had.</p><p>His five million net worth was nothing to her five dollars, seventy cents in her current account.</p><p>Agatha seemed amused enough that she wasn’t deterred, that her confidence grew, that she was convinced she could do it and Agatha would welcome it.</p><p>“So pretty.”</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mmhm?”</p><p>“You sure I can’t get you that water?”</p><p>Rio grinned, dropping her hold of Agatha’s hand and forgetting she’d just promised her a much larger ring.</p><p>“No. Only delicious, shitty beer f’me.”</p><p>She threw her hands to her face again and huffed out a breath, laughing at her own little joke.</p><p>But then she was moving.</p><p>A soft hand on her wrist steered her and her eyes were now uncovered, unfocused on the back of a brunette head of hair as she was pulled to a toilet stall.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of her legs moving beneath her and her body responding to something her mind couldn’t quite grasp yet.</p><p>But then she felt a slight darkness descend.</p><p>A dimmer light than before.</p><p>The hard feel of something behind her back.</p><p>The scent of something lightly floral, very welcome.</p><p>A click.</p><p>A breath.</p><p>Two hands either side of her head.</p><p>“How drunk are you?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“How drunk are you?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, her eyes heavier now than they had felt before.</p><p>Maybe because it was darker, maybe because her body was fully relaxed back against something, maybe because she was breathing in something that felt soothing, felt safe.</p><p>“No’drunk.”</p><p>She blinked as she looked into blue eyes, much closer than they’d been before.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of her mind she realised the scent that was soothing her so was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>She laughed at the absurdity of this realisation, at the knowledge that Agatha was close enough that she moved her hand just a few inches and she held the hem of Agatha’s t-shirt in her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>“Pretty.”</p><p>“Can I kiss you, Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio’s expression changed as her brain caught up with the words breathed out before her.</p><p>Her fingers were still clutching the fabric of the shirt of the woman in front of her.</p><p>And she could only breathe in her perfume, could only see those blue eyes now focused further down her own face, could only feel her warm breath against her lips.</p><p>Rio had always thought she belonged on the stage.</p><p>She thought she belonged to an audience.</p><p>But now, as drunk as she was, her brain recognised something that when she was sober again only her soul would acknowledge: she belonged to, and with, Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“I… <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Agatha leant in and Rio sucked in a sharp breath of anticipation, her eyes fluttering closed as she waited for the pressure of those perfect lips against her own.</p><p>Perhaps it was punishment for closing her eyes when she had someone so beautiful before her, perhaps it was simply that her luck had run out, but the noise of people entering the bathroom meant that Agatha had pulled away.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open when she felt the loss of her and she saw the flash of horror in blue eyes.</p><p>But then a hand was on her shoulder and she was moved aside so that the door could be opened and Agatha could disappear.</p><p>It happened so quickly that Rio missed the soft “sorry” as Agatha had passed. She didn’t register the soft squeeze of her arm, the pain in her gaze as she swept away.</p><p>And Rio was left in the bathroom stall, silent and in a state of shock.</p><p>She managed, just, to turn and lock the stall door again, keeping still and quiet until the women who had ruined her night had left.</p><p>When alone again, she reappeared in the main bar, lost and desperately horny, but unclear and unsure as to what had just happened.</p><p>It was Alice who greeted her on her way out.</p><p>Alice who wrapped an arm around her.</p><p>Alice who informed her that Agatha Harkness had bolted not five minutes ago.</p><p>“Maybe got her fill of slumming it for the night,” she’d said against Rio’s ear, as if she’d welcome the joke, as if she’d laugh at it.</p><p>But Rio could only feel the loss of Agatha.</p><p>The aching need she’d had for her that would never now be satiated.</p><p>And so she accepted the beer thrust towards her, took more shots than she should have been allowed, and she stumbled home with Alice.</p><p>By morning she was a shell of her former self, with only a vague memory of Agatha, and a deep loneliness she couldn’t explain.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio tread the familiar path down to the port, focusing on her breathing, on stretching her aching muscles out, and on everything that wasn’t Agatha Harkness.</p>
<p>The things she knew about her: married to Ralph, a son called Nicky, a well-respected and incredibly famous actress, someone who would look after you when you were drunk, someone who tried to protect you, someone who set Rio’s body on fire and mind and heart racing.</p>
<p>But straight. Straight and married to a man.</p>
<p>Ralph.</p>
<p>By the time Rio had walked to the other side of the bay she felt better.</p>
<p>Distance from Agatha seemed to help. And in the back of her mind she knew she was still suffering from an almighty hangover which can’t have helped the situation.</p>
<p>Because nothing had happened. Agatha had looked a little too closely at her, but then again she was an actress. Perhaps she was studying her because she was interested in human behaviour, in how others carried themselves, in the physicality of a person so different to herself. That must be it.</p>
<p>They were both adults, both in the same profession, both currently working their asses off to convince the world they were worthy of the highest award Hollywood could provide.</p>
<p>Insofar as all that was true, they were colleagues and rivals. It was an intense relationship anyway.</p>
<p>Made more intense by Rio’s inability to get a grip.</p>
<p>As her lips pressed against the cool glass of the beer she’d secured herself at a small chiosco opposite the bay, all thoughts of Agatha disappeared.</p>
<p>She was a goddamn movie star. She was one of the favourites to win an Oscar. She got a twelve minute standing ovation at Cannes. She was young and hot and free and could get any woman she wanted.</p>
<p>By the time she was on her second beer, she heard her name being called across the way and she turned to squint into the sun until the familiar figure of Alice Wu-Gulliver appeared before her looking concerned and a little annoyed.</p>
<p>“Where the fuck have you been?”</p>
<p>Rio held up her beer and turned to the barman to ask for another. “Right here. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Agatha said you practically ran away this morning.”</p>
<p>Rio scoffed and turned to watch as Alice took a seat on the low stool beside her, “I just need some air.”</p>
<p>“And more alcohol? We heard you stumble in last night. Agatha was discreet with the details but from what I gather you were a total mess.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned back to begin drawing idly into the condensation on her glass.</p>
<p>“I hear you finally sealed the deal?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ignore me. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, Alice. Only our little escape for two days to get some rest and alone time for the first time in <em>ages</em> has been interrupted by your new girlfriend and her boss.”</p>
<p>Alice was silent for a while but accepted the beer placed before her with a soft murmur of a “grazie”.</p>
<p>“I knew you were pissed about it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not pissed I’m just… hungover. Tired. Embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“How bad was it?”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and rubbed her temple, “She had to put me in the recovery position. And I’m pretty sure I asked her to stay in the bed with me.”</p>
<p>“My god, Rio. I told you to make friends, not proposition her.”</p>
<p>“I <em>didn’t</em> proposition her. I just… maybe held her hand a bit and sat a little close. And in case <em>you</em> forgot, <em>you</em> are the reason we technically had to share a bed in the first place.”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and Alice grimaced into her beer.</p>
<p>After a beat of silence Alice eventually said:</p>
<p>“Jen says she likes you. Says she’s never seen Agatha soften for someone so quickly before.”</p>
<p>Groaning a little, Rio turned to look at Alice with a deep furrow in her brow, “She’s an actress. The best one we have. She’s just playing along because you and Jen are all over each other and she’ll be stuck with me for the next few months until this goddamn season is over. And even then, if you both decide it’s a longterm thing… we’re stuck.”</p>
<p>Alice’s smiling face softened and she reached across to place her beer-cooled hand on Rio’s bare knee, providing a welcome balm against the heat of the day.</p>
<p>“Actually, I think she likes you. Most people do so it’s not that shocking. Maybe relax around her a little. I know you’re a fan and she’s a hot woman but… try to relax. Like you say, we’ve a lot of time to get through and it would be better if you two could actually be friends.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed and despite the welcome coolness of it she pushed Alice’s hand from her knee. “I’m not sure we’ll ever actually be friends.”</p>
<p>“Why not? She’s sparky. She’s funny. Jen says she’s generous and loyal and her kid is cute. Plus she got your sorry ass to bed last night. The amount of times I’ve had to bribe you to bed with more tequila I cannot even count.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. She’s a <em>Saint</em>.”</p>
<p>“Only to her friends. Otherwise she’s a bitch,” Alice smirked, “whereas you’re the opposite. Great with everyone else and an absolute horror to anyone who knows you.”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck off.”</p>
<p>Alice released a cackle as Rio tried to push her off her stool and they both received unimpressed glares from the posers and preeners of Positano as they walked by.</p>
<p>When they’d both calmed down and Rio was well into half of her beer, Alice quickly catching up, Rio broached the next most important subject of the holiday: Alice’s romance.</p>
<p>“So. How was it? Earth-shattering?”</p>
<p>Alice smiled and blushed a little, turning slightly to try and hide it. “I really like her. I’m hopeful it’s… that maybe she’s the one.”</p>
<p>“The one?” Rio asked in complete surprise, her worldview changing slightly as she took Alice in. “You can’t leave me single and alone. That’s not the deal.”</p>
<p>“There was no <em>deal</em>, Rio Vidal. Just your assumption that we’d be single forever and die hand in hand in our late nineties on the terrace of our beachfront property.”</p>
<p>“And you’ve decided to renege on this deal for a hot woman with at least a foot on you?”</p>
<p>“Not a foot,” Alice insisted with a laugh, “But yes. I hope so. I think, I think I really like this one.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m happy for you,” Rio grinned genuinely, reaching to take Alice’s hand and squeeze it gently. “And I can’t imagine for a second that she wouldn’t feel the same.”</p>
<p>“We’re taking it slow but yeah,” Alice grinned back and squeezed Rio’s hand right back. “So you and Agatha might just have to deal with each other far beyond the season.”</p>
<p>Rio hummed and turned back to take a drink of her beer, wondering how a life with Agatha constantly in it would work out. But just because Alice was with Jen didn’t mean Agatha would be there every time she saw her.</p>
<p>But this belief was shattered when Alice spoke again: “So Jen was suggesting a bit of a triple date night. Me, you, Agatha, Ralph, and Jen.”</p>
<p>Rio almost choked on her beer and turned to Alice with wide eyes, “What? You can’t be serious. I’m not fifth wheeling.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on! You’d be there for me. I’d need you there!”</p>
<p>“Alice, no. That’s insane. It would be humiliating. Last time I saw Ralph… it was a disaster. I already told you yesterday: no more favours.”</p>
<p>“Rio, you’re the most popular piece of ass in Hollywood right now. Get over yourself and either find a girl to bring or come alone. Who cares. Do this for me.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed but smiled just a little, the beer easing her down just enough to be able to accept the compliment and lessen the inevitable humiliation of rocking up somewhere with two other couples.</p>
<p>“Fine. But only for you. And only once.”</p>
<p>“Deal.”</p>
<p>They finished their beers and Rio was feeling all the benefits of being in a port town in Italy all of a sudden.</p>
<p>With her best friend tucked into her side as they strolled back up to the villa she couldn’t help but feel lighter than she had that morning, more at peace.</p>
<p>The doom that had settled with her hangover had disappeared entirely. And once again she was just a person on vacation with her best friend, a pretty interloper, and her best friend’s crush.</p>
<p>Not a bad place to be.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived back to the villa it was early evening but the sun was still hot, still beating down on the bay and the hills that surrounded it where the villa was perched.</p>
<p>Rio walked with Alice through the open planned living space and out onto the deck to find Jennifer and Agatha both sitting on sun loungers; Agatha was in the sun lounger she’d been in earlier and Jen was now occupying Rio’s.</p>
<p>They were both drinking aperols and both looked up when Alice and Rio circled round to them. Alice perched on the end of Jen’s bed and kissed her shoulder sweetly whereas Rio remained standing.</p>
<p>“There you are,” Jen announced loudly, pulling Alice closer to her, “running off with stolen sandals? Are you having a breakdown or something?”</p>
<p>“I just needed some air,” Rio said with a shrug, still too on her high to be brought down by Jen’s remarks.</p>
<p>“Yeah because a hillside pool is completely devoid of any air whatsoever.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes but noticed Agatha moving her legs up to cross beneath herself where she sat and she took it as an invitation to sit on the very end of the bed.</p>
<p>“Go off in search of your beach friend?” She asked as Rio placed her hands behind her and leant back, closing her eyes as she looked up to the sun.</p>
<p>“No, I tend not to return once I’ve had my fun.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” Alice said quickly, slapping Rio’s leg and making her look back across at her, “Who? What did you do on a beach?”</p>
<p>“Apparently made out with <em>Alessia</em>,” Agatha drawled, and Rio turned to see her watching her closely, a glint of amusement in her eye. She knew she was punishing her for running away earlier.</p>
<p>“Alessia?” Alice asked with a frown, “Who is she?”</p>
<p>In all honesty, Rio hadn’t remember the girl’s name until Agatha had just said it and she bit down on her lip as she returned her gaze back to Alice, wondering whether to be fully honest or to deny, deny, deny.</p>
<p>But it was too late.</p>
<p>“Some girl from a bar?” Alice filled in herself, shaking her head in disbelief. “And you took her to the beach? Rio.”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and shot Agatha a look before she leant towards her best friend who was less her friend in that moment and more the woman she paid to look after her image, to source her jobs, to control the press around her.</p>
<p>“We were careful.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that.”</p>
<p>“Alice. It was just…”</p>
<p>“Rio, if you try for even a second to pretend you just made out with her I will drown you in this pool.”</p>
<p>Rio returned to chewing on her lip and ran a hand through her sun-dried hair that was a little more wavy than usual, a little more wild for the chlorine and the salt water.</p>
<p>“You did <em>not</em> have sex on the beach,” Jennifer suddenly piped up, watching Rio with wide eyes and a mixture of disgust and awe. “You’re in the middle of a campaign.”</p>
<p>Rio groaned and shook her head, “No one saw. It was dark and quiet and-…”</p>
<p>“You said you just made out,” Agatha said in a tone that sounded oddly accusatory and Rio turned to look at her, feeling strangely worse that Agatha now knew compared to Alice knowing.</p>
<p>“I-…”</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Alice said suddenly, standing from her seat, “I need to talk to my client in private.”</p>
<p>“<em>Client?</em>” Rio gaped suddenly, staring up at Alice in shock, “Alice don’t be-…”</p>
<p>“Inside. <em>Now.</em>”</p>
<p>With that, Alice turned away and marched back towards the villa, leaving a shocked Rio staring after her with her mouth slightly agape.</p>
<p>“Holy shit that was hot,” Jen muttered almost to herself as she stared after Alice and Rio grimaced as she slowly went to follow her best friend back in, knowing she was already in for a world of hurt.</p>
<p>Once inside Alice grabbed her arm and marched her to their old shared bedroom, throwing Rio onto the end of the bed and beginning to pace.</p>
<p>“Not only could you have been <em>arrested</em>, what if the paps got a shot of you? What if some tourist got a photo of Rio Vidal fucking some local on a sun lounger?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t,” Rio said softly, feeling more than a little small, “no one saw.”</p>
<p>“And how do you know that?! How, Rio?!”</p>
<p>Rio took a deep breath and crossed her arms over her chest, trying to regulate her heart rate. “Alice, I promise you-…”</p>
<p>“No. You don’t get to do that. We have worked <em>so</em> hard to get you here. First Ralph and now… I swear if you’ve fucked it all up by fucking-…”</p>
<p>“It would be on the internet by now!” Rio shouted, throwing her arms out before her, “It would be everywhere! You’d have <em>seen</em> it. Alice, please, this isn’t-…”</p>
<p>“How could you have been so stupid? Honestly, Rio. You usually have more sense than this. What is wrong with you?”</p>
<p>Rio slammed her mouth shut, unable to tell Alice exactly what was going on for fear she’d laugh at her or she’d call her a moron, or any other insult she deserved.</p>
<p>But how could she tell her best friend that she was currently experiencing a true or maybe imagined flirtation with a married actress, a married older actress who had once pinned her against a toilet stall, a married older actress who had touched her in ways that weren’t strictly necessary when riding a jet ski with someone, a married older actress with a child, a married older actress who was probably not flirting at all with Rio, and Rio was going crazy with it.</p>
<p>“Rio. You need to-…”</p>
<p>But there was a knock on the door and Alice stopped, running her hands through her hair and pacing again, “What is it?”</p>
<p>Rio had expected Jen to be there to try and calm Alice down or else pull her into the other bedroom alone if her reaction to Alice’s outburst earlier had been anything to go by.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t Jen.</p>
<p>It was Agatha.</p>
<p>The door opened slowly and Agatha stepped inside, glancing between Alice and Rio and holding up two glasses of clear liquid.</p>
<p>Rio stared at her, unsure what she was seeing but she accepted the glass that was suddenly offered to her, Agatha now in front of her, watching her closely.</p>
<p>“Come down to the pool and take photos with me. Post them on your socials. If anything comes out about…” she cleared her throat and turned around to Alice to hold out the second glass to her, “if there’s anything about what happened last night it would have been on the internet already. But we’re here. People will want to see us here. They’ll be excited we’re together. Take some photos and make the most of it.”</p>
<p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing.</p>
<p>Agatha, who had been so against any sort of pictures of the two of them on social media.</p>
<p>Agatha, who had denied and denied Alice’s requests to get snaps of them at dinner or by the pool or in the water.</p>
<p>Agatha, who was now looking at her with an expectant look in her eye, her hand motioning to the cool glass in Rio’s hand as if wondering why she hadn’t drunk it yet.</p>
<p>But Alice broke the silence first, clearly struggling with the same thing as Rio.</p>
<p>“But… but you were so against-…”</p>
<p>“I know,” Agatha said gruffly, glancing at Alice before turning back to Rio, “I’ve changed my mind.”</p>
<p>Rio opened and closed her mouth a few times, unable to form words for a while, but Alice had sprung into action before she managed to.</p>
<p>She’d leapt at Agatha and wrapped her free arm so suddenly around Agatha’s neck that the older woman stumbled back a little and in being so caught off guard she laughed and actually returned the embrace with a loose arm around Alice’s middle.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Alice said genuinely, pulling away to grin at Agatha and touching her cheek briefly, “This will…”</p>
<p>“You should speak to Jen first. She has to ‘okay’ everything but I’m happy if she is. Whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She stared at Agatha as Alice made a soft noise of delight and disappeared from the room still clutching whatever liquid had been poured into the glass for her.</p>
<p>“It’s tequila,” Agatha clarified, motioning to Rio’s glass now they were alone together.</p>
<p>Rio dropped her gaze to it and hesitated for just a second before she raised it to her lips and downed it in one. It was a shot’s worth, maybe a shot and a half of crisp, clean tequila, which meant it went down as easily as any shot of pure alcohol could.</p>
<p>And when she was done she lowered the glass and watched as Agatha ran a hand through her hair and shuffled a little on the spot.</p>
<p>“What changed your mind?”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed a little and went to perch on the windowsill, curling her fingers around the edge of it as she watched Rio, “You looked so helpless back there I thought it was the least I could do.”</p>
<p>Rio chewed the inside of her cheek and dropped her eyes to her empty glass, watching as the last drop of clear liquid moved with each swirl of it.</p>
<p>Agatha was doing her another favour. She just didn’t know why.</p>
<p>“Photos of us will benefit me far more than they’ll benefit you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know… every other conversation I have now your name comes up.”</p>
<p>“It does?”</p>
<p>“Mmhm.”</p>
<p>Rio placed her glass down on the edge of the bed and stood to move over to Agatha, watching as her back straightened out and she looked cautious suddenly.</p>
<p>Rio gave her every opportunity to move away, to pull back, but when she didn’t her hand found purchase on Agatha’s cheek and she brushed her thumb delicately across her high cheekbone, a little frown forming on her face as she took Agatha in.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the two beers and the tequila talking, but she thought there was now a faint blush on Agatha’s cheeks where she still held her.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded gently, careful not to dislodge Rio’s hand and Rio watched in surprise as Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed and she raised her hand to hold Rio’s wrist lightly, her face turning a fraction of an inch so the corners of her lips grazed Rio’s palm.</p>
<p>It was so soft, so intimate that Rio forgot herself and moved closer, ducking her head slightly in order to press a kiss to Agatha’s other cheek.</p>
<p>But before she made contact, there was noise in the hall and Rio pulled back properly, her hand reluctantly dropping from Agatha as she turned to see who would be arriving now.</p>
<p>Just as Jen stepped into the room Agatha pushed herself off the ledge beside her and muttered: “don’t say anything”.</p>
<p>“Jen.”</p>
<p>“Agatha.”</p>
<p>Rio now took Agatha’s position on the window ledge, shrinking back a little from the furious looking woman in the doorway and noticing that Alice was just behind her.</p>
<p>“You can’t just offer-…”</p>
<p>“Come on, Rio is all anyone is talking about. It’ll be her or me and right now my money is on her. A couple vacation snaps and that’s it. You can have full creative control.”</p>
<p>Jen huffed and scowled over at Rio who was still hiding behind Agatha slightly, which, admittedly she wasn’t too proud of.</p>
<p>“Fine. Vidal, these pictures of you on the beach better not come out. Can’t have anyone thinking it was Agatha you were fucking.”</p>
<p>It was Rio’s turn to blush at this and she cleared her throat quietly as Agatha turned to her and offered her a hand, “Let’s get this over with.”</p>
<p>Rio blinked and momentarily forgot herself as everyone stared at her and Agatha actually wriggled her fingers at her. But she took her hand and found it to be just as warm and comforting as it had felt the previous night when she was off her face drunk.</p>
<p>They walked like that, unnecessarily hand in hand down to the pool area and Agatha only released her hand again when Jen pulled Agatha in the other direction.</p>
<p>“We’re getting one shot and that is <em>it</em>,” Jen announced firmly, “and we will only use it if I am happy with it. Goddamn Agatha Harkness does not hang about pools with nobody actors.”</p>
<p>“Hey,” Alice and Rio said quickly and even Agatha slapped Jen’s arm lightly. “Play nice.”</p>
<p>“Whatever,” Jen said in lieu of an apology and shot Alice a small smile over Agatha’s shoulder that promised she was at least half joking.</p>
<p>Whilst Jen worked on the composition of the shot, Alice turned to Rio and began fluffing up her hair, to what aim, Rio had no idea.</p>
<p>“You got a swimsuit on beneath that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah but isn’t that a bit much?”</p>
<p>“No, not when it’s your one shot to be across the internet with Agatha. Take it off.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over herself to seamlessly slip her t-shirt over her head and tossed it in the sun bed.</p>
<p>“These too,” Alice instructed, motioning to Rio’s shorts.</p>
<p>“Don't be ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“And don’t be a prude, Miss I Fucked A Stranger On The Beach.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed but supposed she deserved that and she shuffled out of her linen shorts, feeling a bit like an idiot just standing awkwardly in her bikini.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay!” Jen announced, having been strolling around the area with her phone and Agatha in tow as a test subject to check the light.</p>
<p>“Two options-…” but she stopped as she spotted what Rio was now wearing and rolled her eyes, “Really, Alice? This isn’t a porno.”</p>
<p>Rio looked down at herself, suddenly fearful she’d somehow stripped naked without meaning to. But she hadn’t. She was still very much covered up where it mattered.</p>
<p>“They’re by the pool, they’re friends, they’re on vacation. It would be weird for Agatha to be in a bathing suit and Rio to not be. Plus she looks more femme like this, it’ll help with the rumours.”</p>
<p>“What rumours?” Agatha asked suddenly, watching the scene from the glass barrier that separates the edge of the hills from the drop below it.</p>
<p>“Well two hot women on vacation together, one a lesbian?” Alice asked with raised brows and Rio had to look away for fear she was blushing too much at the insinuation.</p>
<p>“Agatha is happily married,” Jen accused with a frown and Rio was beginning to wonder if ‘happily married’ were tattooed somewhere on Agatha’s body.</p>
<p>“I know,” Alice agreed with a slight frustration in her tone, “everyone knows. So Rio not rocking up looking like a total-…”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it,” Rio interjected with a frown, slapping Alice’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“-… well, it’ll help the cause.”</p>
<p>Alice had clearly won the battle and had turned to Rio to take her arm and whisper in her ear, “Sorry. I just want you in that bikini for the shot. You look hot.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and poked Alice in the ribs before she moved over to where Agatha and Jen were and offered herself up with a little display of opening her arms to Jennifer, “Where do you want me?”</p>
<p>Jen got to work immediately and had no qualms about moving Rio without asking if it were okay she touch her. It felt a lot like being in a set or in a makeup trailer and so Rio didn’t mind.</p>
<p>But things changed when Jen started moving Agatha and it was Agatha who was touching her now, rather than Jen.</p>
<p>Jen had positioned Rio to be leaning her elbows back against the top of the glass barrier, her right leg up and bent so her foot was back on it.</p>
<p>She’d forced Rio to face forward and her hair to drape across her shoulders, spending time in adjusting it until she was satisfied.</p>
<p>And then Agatha.</p>
<p>Agatha was positioned next to Rio, facing her.</p>
<p>Jen had made her place her right elbow on the barrier and her left hand on Rio’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Agatha’s hand was warm and Rio glanced to the side to see that she was watching her, her steely blue gaze intense in the early evening sun.</p>
<p>It was the golden hour and behind Agatha’s head was a halo of light. She looked breathtaking and Rio was glad she had the barrier behind her to hold her up, to keep her from melting before her.</p>
<p>“No,” Alice was saying suddenly, holding her own phone up to look through the camera.</p>
<p>“The hand on Rio’s shoulder looks weird. Agatha, put it on her stomach.”</p>
<p>“My stomach?” Rio asked in panic, breaking her pose and standing up properly, “Why my stomach?”</p>
<p>“It’s just less awkward than your shoulder. These needs to just look like two friends shooting the shit together by their ridiculous pool,” Alice shouted back across the pool, frowning at the dramatic reaction of her friend.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Jen agreed, “makes it easier to see her ring too.”</p>
<p>Rio blanched a little and slowly settled back into position, glancing at Agatha as Jen continued to fluff her hair behind her and Agatha asked: “This okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio said quickly, properly blushing now she’d caused such a fuss and turning away again. “Totally fine.”</p>
<p>She tensed as Agatha moved her hand down to rest against her stomach, and glanced askance at Agatha again, seeing that she was looking down at where her hand pale hand was now resting against Rio’s tanned skin.</p>
<p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and forced herself to relax, feeling the slight movements of Agatha’s fingers as she tried to find the most natural pose on Rio’s flat abs.</p>
<p>Not unused to being touched during photoshoots, and not even unfamiliar with posing with Agatha now for photos, this shouldn’t have felt odd.</p>
<p>And after yesterday, with Agatha’s hands all over her torso, this should have felt natural.</p>
<p>But Rio’s body was screaming at her that Agatha Harkness was touching her publicly, for millions of people to see, and when Jen pushed Agatha a couple inches towards her she shifted uncomfortably so that Agatha dropped her hand from her.</p>
<p>“Shoulder’s fine,” she muttered quietly and went to place her hand back there before Rio grabbed it suddenly and placed it back just below her sternum, over where her diaphragm would be.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Rio reassured just as softly, keeping her hand over Agatha’s until she was sure she wouldn’t pull away.</p>
<p>Agatha only nodded once and kept her hand still against Rio’s skin.</p>
<p>Jen eventually moved away and went to stand by Alice to take the shot. Both Agatha and Rio tried smiling, tried smiling at each other, but neither Jen nor Alice were happy and both frequently pointed out the sun going in and the golden hour coming to a close.</p>
<p>“More energy! Look like you like each other!”</p>
<p>Rio laughed a little and shot Agatha a smile, raising a brow, “Nothing says ‘I like you’ more than a fake photoshoot on vacation.”</p>
<p>Agatha only rolled her eyes and moved the hand that wasn’t still over Rio’s stomach to poke Rio in the ribs suddenly, expertly finding her most sensitive point and causing Rio to burst out a laugh and lurch forwards.</p>
<p>Agatha laughed with her and caught Rio’s back as she threw herself back again, the shock of the jab making her forget she was on the precipice of a cliff with a thin, single pane of glass protecting her from here and infinity.</p>
<p>“Careful!”</p>
<p>Rio curled her arms around the arm that held her steady and caught her breath back steadily, not realising that Agatha had pressed against her side and now was basically just holding her where they stood.</p>
<p>“We got it,” Jen sang as the two women at the edge of the pool turned to smile at the other, suddenly both shy in their hold but neither pulling away.</p>
<p>It was Rio who broke the spell, peeling herself from Agatha gingerly, and feeling suddenly cool in the warm air without Agatha close by.</p>
<p>But she shook it off, forced herself to focus as she went to look over Alice’s shoulder at the photo they’d chosen of the hundreds they’d taken.</p>
<p>Rio was on the way to lurching forwards, her mouth open in a laugh and her eyes wide with surprise.</p>
<p>Agatha’s hand remained pride of place on her front and her right hand was close by her ribs where she’d just delivered the fatal blow.</p>
<p>Agatha looked pleased with herself, smug and beautiful in the light.</p>
<p>They looked good together, even Rio could see that. And perhaps Agatha could too because she’d appeared at her side and had briefly squeezed Rio’s hand where they stood, both silently acknowledging what was clear in the photo: Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal were about to break the internet.</p>
<p>“Ring still obvious,” Jen said slowly, scrutinising every inch of the photo and now literally zooming in to see every inch of the two of them up close.</p>
<p>“Can we not zoom in on my breasts, please?” Agatha asked with more than a little annoyance as Jen focused in on her client’s body and ignored everything about Rio.</p>
<p>“Hey, check Rio over too. No nips slipping. No drool.”</p>
<p>“Drool? Rude.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed beside her and Rio scowled, but looked back down again in time to see a zoomed in shot of Agatha’s face. She looked unreal. How could she look that good in a candid shot? But she looked up again and saw Agatha watching her closely and she raised her brows as she said: “You look good.”</p>
<p>Agatha fought a smirk and raised a brow at this, tilting her head as she surveyed Rio. “And you… are surprisingly shy about being touched when you fucked a girl on the beach.”</p>
<p>“Ooooohh,” Alice sang in amusement, looking between Agatha and Rio, all anger from the incident before clearly gone now she’d secured her client the photo of the century.</p>
<p>Rio narrowed her gaze at Agatha but saw no malice reflected back at her and only a smug smile on that annoyingly gorgeous face.</p>
<p>It infuriated her.</p>
<p>“Did Agatha Harkness just say ‘fuck’?” She asked with a smirk, and watched as Agatha narrowed her gaze further.</p>
<p>“Agatha, maybe you should start wearing your engagement ring,” Jen was saying, her phone zoomed back in on the hand over Rio’s stomach. “More sparkle.”</p>
<p>But Rio had turned around to be closer to Agatha and the older woman looked suddenly nervous, and a little surprised at the proximity again, but Rio didn’t leave her guessing for long.</p>
<p>In one, quick, strong, movement, she’d pushed Agatha into the deep end of the pool.</p>
<p>Two gasps rang out behind her and Rio laughed as Agatha resurfaced looking livid, throwing her wild her back over her head and practically growling at Rio on the edge of the pool.</p>
<p>“Rio! What the fuck!” Jen bellowed, as Alice slapped her hand over her mouth from beside her.</p>
<p>“Rio, what the fuck?”</p>
<p>Rio crouched down to get closer as Agatha moved towards the edge of the pool, ignoring the two behind her. “Sorry, I must have slipped.”</p>
<p>“You’re an ass,” Agatha accused just as she reached up and tugged Rio into the pool with her, both disappearing beneath the water for a few seconds before resurfacing with splutters of laughter.</p>
<p>It was the laughter that softened the reaction of the two people hired to be what they were both silently considering in that moment to be glorified babysitters to the two actresses now gasping for air and laughing in the water below them.</p>
<p>“She has an Oscar,” Jen said in disbelief as she watched her client throw a splash of water in Rio’s direction.</p>
<p>Alice only rolled her eyes and she took Jen’s hand, tugging her away to the kitchen, “Shame she’s straight. Think of what we could do together if <em>they</em> were together.”</p>
<p>“Rio wishes,” Jen muttered as the two disappeared into the villa.</p>
<p>In the pool Rio was laughing so hard she had to swim to the side and support herself with one hand, trying to catch her breath.</p>
<p>“God. You weren’t supposed to pull me in!”</p>
<p>Agatha was treading water somewhere behind her and laughed, “Like I wouldn’t. You think I’d let you get away with trying to drown me? I have an Oscar!”</p>
<p>Rio laughed harder again and turned, twisting her wrist to keep herself up still on the side. “Yes, I’ve heard! Where is it? The bathroom? The bedroom?”</p>
<p>She wriggled her brows suggestively and Agatha scoffed and threw a wave of water Rio’s way.</p>
<p>“The <em>office</em>. My office.”</p>
<p>“No fun,” Rio accused with a grin reaching her other hand behind her to hold the wall too.</p>
<p>“And exactly why would an Oscar be fun in the bedroom?”</p>
<p>Rio shrugged a little, smiling still, “Remind your husband how powerful you are. Remind <em>yourself</em>.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need reminding,” Agatha said with a grin, moving over to mimic Rio’s hold on the wall.</p>
<p>“Maybe. Still. Something sexy about it.”</p>
<p>“Well maybe you can put yours in your bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, I think I have a while yet. This one’s yours.”</p>
<p>Agatha hummed softly and pushed off the wall again, choosing to tread water in front of Rio instead, “Don’t be so sure.”</p>
<p>Rio raised her brows, “Are you gonna vote for me?”</p>
<p>Agatha released a laugh and tilted her head back, exposing her neck to Rio which made her glance down at it and lose her train of thought for a second.</p>
<p>“How about this?” Agatha asked, catching Rio’s eye again with a smirk when she looked back across at her, “If I vote for you, and you win, you have to thank me first.”</p>
<p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes, “Easy. Wanda will be a little pissed but-…”</p>
<p>“No, Rio Vidal, <em>first</em>. Before god, before your parents, everyone. Not just ‘your fellow nominees’.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed and poked her tongue into the side of her cheek, watching as Agatha’s eyes twinkled with mischief and something else she couldn’t name.</p>
<p>“On the very slim chance that I’m nominated and <em>win</em>, then yes. I’ll thank you first. Before anyone. Which might be hard to explain to my mom.”</p>
<p>Agatha hummed and nodded, “Good. Then that’s one vote in your favour.”</p>
<p>“And what if you win?”</p>
<p>“What if I win?” Agatha asked with a grin, “<em>You</em> can’t vote. So if I win, you’ve done nothing to help me.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Rio sang out, kicking her feet out gently before her and stretching her body out near the surface of the water. Agatha’s gaze dropped along the length of her and she moved to the side, now only a foot or so away.</p>
<p>“That photo of us was gold. That’ll help you. <em>And</em> it’ll help your profile with the younger audiences.”</p>
<p>“Younger audiences?” Agatha gaped at Rio, reaching to grab the side so she could rest her arms and legs that were working to keep her afloat. “You know I’m not <em>that</em> much older than you?”</p>
<p>Rio brought her body back in to be back against the wall.</p>
<p>“Older, though. Old enough for me to make you seem <em>very</em> cool for hanging out with me.”</p>
<p>“That is so-…”</p>
<p>“So what?” Rio teased, finally understanding what Alice had meant. Relaxing more around Agatha was the way to go, it was the way to make all of this much easier.</p>
<p>She wasn’t just a girl with a crush on a movie star.</p>
<p>She was a movie star with a crush on a movie star.</p>
<p>Two very different things.</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know,” Agatha moved closer, her hand slipping below the water and resting on Rio’s side applying enough pressure that Rio knew she wanted her to turn her way.</p>
<p>“I’m seven years older. I looked it up. Both millennials. That’s barely an age difference.”</p>
<p>“It is in Hollywood,” Rio said with a smile, intensely aware that Agatha’s hand was still on her side as she turned to her.  “You could play my mom in my next movie.”</p>
<p>Agatha’s jaw dropped and she froze for a second, and Rio thought she’d gone too far suddenly, the beer and tequila blurring the lines in her mind.</p>
<p>But Agatha’s reaction, her true reaction hadn’t hit yet and an apology was on the tip of her tongue before Agatha repeated her move from earlier and found that soft spot between Rio’s ribs and waist and dug her fingers in so deep that Rio inhaled in shock as she folded in on herself.</p>
<p>She swallowed a mouthful of water and disappeared below the water line, dragging Agatha with her where she’d placed her forward-leaning body weight over her arm.</p>
<p>They wrestled and flailed beneath the water for a while until they both broke out, Rio coughing much more than Agatha and Agatha gasping as she struggled to keep them both afloat.</p>
<p>She managed to manhandle Rio to the edge of the pool, lifting her so her top half was out and her elbows could rest on the edge. Agatha panted softly behind her, one arm tight around Rio’s waist and her other holding herself at the wall by Rio’s side.</p>
<p>“That…” Rio gasped, too intent on catching her breath to focus on the fact that Agatha’s body was pressed behind her, her cheek and soft breaths against her naked back. “Was… mean.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed quietly and pulled her head away, pushing off a little only when she was sure Rio wouldn’t collapse back into the water.</p>
<p>Her hold around her middle loosened enough for Rio to be able to turn around and found herself trapped between Agatha’s arms holding the wall beside her head.</p>
<p>It was familiar, too familiar, only this time Rio wasn’t as drunk, wasn’t as awestruck, though she was close.</p>
<p>“You okay?” Agatha asked softly, the laughter fading from her lips as she watched Rio watch her.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rio said just as softly, her lungs still burning from the inhalation of pool water but her whole body more interested in the woman before her than its own salvation.</p>
<p>“You play dirty,” Rio accused and Agatha’s lips twitched slightly at the sides.</p>
<p>“Not bad for an old woman, huh?”</p>
<p>But Rio couldn’t give in to this blatant cheating and only scowled playfully, taking a shot and lifting her right hand to rest over Agatha’s left on the wall behind her, her wrist twisted uncomfortably. Just to be closer.</p>
<p>Just to see.</p>
<p>Agatha glanced at their hands and saw the extra strain Rio was putting herself under so pulled her hand away and dipped it below the water, her lower face slipping under until she got a good purchase, to tug at Rio’s thigh, her hand slipping to hold the back of her knee.</p>
<p>“Here. I’ll hold us.”</p>
<p>Rio only nodded and as loosely as she could she draped her legs around Agatha’s waist, careful not to press too close, moving her hands to rest lightly and demurely on her shoulders.</p>
<p>Being held up by Agatha in the pool was not how shed envisioned her evening going.</p>
<p>But her fingers had moved of their own accord, lightly toying with the straps of Agatha’s swimsuit. Her thighs were tense where she tried to get a hold of her own desire to press closer, and her gaze was determinedly focused on Agatha’s.</p>
<p>They were both silent for a time and Rio began to feel the awkwardness of the choice, her mind working overtime to establish it as friendly rather than flirty.</p>
<p>If Alice had done this, if Wanda or any other her other industry friends had done this, it wouldn’t have meant anything at all.</p>
<p>But something about Agatha’s frequent shifts in intensity, the way she was looking at her, the way Rio’s body reacted to her, it was different.</p>
<p>And she wasn’t sure Agatha would be comfortable with a photo of them like this on the internet, but she could count several other of her friends who wouldn’t mind at all.</p>
<p>She racked her brain with what to say, how to break the tension.</p>
<p>She couldn’t run away again, that at least wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>But what could she say that would make this seem normal, natural, and not result in Rio embarrassing herself once more in front of Agatha Harkness.</p>
<p>“Nicky,” she tried suddenly, “do you miss him?”</p>
<p>Agatha looked a little taken aback by this, she’d clearly been lost in her own thoughts too but she nodded and frowned a little, falling easily back into the conversation.</p>
<p>“All the time.”</p>
<p>And Rio shifted her hands, jumping them from Agatha’s shoulders to her neck, her fingers just touching the soft, wet hairs at the back of her neck.</p>
<p>Agatha didn’t acknowledge the move but her arms flexed and she pulled a little closer to the edge, and Rio had to assume it was to lessen the strain as she held them both above the water line.</p>
<p>But it meant that she’d pressed closer.</p>
<p>Rio swallowed and cleared her throat quietly, “Jen told Alice he was a good kid.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled just a little and whether real or imaginary Rio noticed her whole face softening.</p>
<p>“He’s the best. He’s shy but a real ham when he wants to be.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Rio laughed a little as she felt the tension ease somewhat.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Into everything. Basketball’s his first love though. Tries to get me to play all the time but-…”</p>
<p>“I’d play with him.”</p>
<p>The words came out before she could even think about it and Agatha looked taken aback again for a second before she schooled her face and simply raised her brows.</p>
<p>“You’d play basketball with my seven year old son?”</p>
<p>“I mean… he can’t be any worse than some of the guys down the park.”</p>
<p>This seemed to give Agatha even more pause and she tilted her head to the side as she surveyed Rio closely, “You play? In the park?”</p>
<p>“When I can. I used to have a team but… work makes that harder.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded slowly, apparently thinking it over for a second, “Maybe we can set up a date? Schedules are crazy right now but… I wouldn’t mind introducing you to Nicky if you wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>Rio cursed herself for getting herself into this position, literally and figuratively, but Agatha was offering another olive branch and who was Rio to say no.</p>
<p>“I’d like that.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled softly and Rio’s gaze dropped to it, her cheeks flushing once more at just how close she was to Agatha.</p>
<p>It made her feel insane, made her feel like she was drunk again, misunderstanding things once more.</p>
<p>But had Agatha leant in a little? Had she parted her lips?</p>
<p>“Agatha! Drinks on the terrace!”</p>
<p>The moment was broken and Agatha had pulled away so suddenly that Rio almost dropped below the waterline again.</p>
<p>Her saviour was once again Agatha, who’d caught her waist and kept her buoyant but released as soon as Rio managed to grasp the wall.</p>
<p>They looked at each other but neither said anything as Agatha moved away and swam back to the shallow end of the pool.</p>
<p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath, watching as Agatha climbed the shallow steps to get out.</p>
